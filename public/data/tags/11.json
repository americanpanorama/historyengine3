a Monday morning at 3 a.m., a breach in the levee allowed rushing waters to flood New Orleans.  Within two days, the breach had expanded to be at least an acre in width.  The areas initially most affected by the waters were the Cyprus swamp and St. John's Bayou.  However, the waters were continuing to flow into the city, and it was predicted that by the time the flood waters stopped rising, the entire city would be underwater. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The governor of Louisiana took immediate action and hired engineers who pledged to have the breach fixed within several days.  Due to having an abundance of the resources need to fix the levee accessible to them, the projected time to be able to fix the levee was accurate.  Many of the city's residents relocated for the summer out of fear of an epidemic breakout of illnesses due to the excess of mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to protect the city from experiencing such devastating effects was by constantly patrolling the levee, which spanned for miles above and below New Orleans.  Every landowner was responsible for maintenance of the levee that bordered his land, often helped by slaves and free Blacks.  The portions of the levee that did not border personal property and ran through New Orleans were maintained by the city at the public's expense.  This breach occurred five miles upstream of New Orleans, a section that was not under care of the city.   Catastrophic events, such as this one, that threatened the southern way of life, brought together Whites and Blacks to work towards preservation of their society."],"display_date":"May 7, 1816","search_date":"1816-05-07","locations":[{"id":5594,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":19,"title":"409 Slaves from Africa arrive in Georgia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1798, Georgia banned involvement in the Atlantic Slave trade, followed a decade later by a nationwide ban.  The Constitution had required the ban when signed, and Congress put it into effect on January 1, 1808.  As the Hon. Joshua Giddings announced in a speech to the House of Representatives, the United States;pronounced the African slave trade to be piracy, and those who followed that vocation to be pirates worthy of death.'  All captured Atlantic slave traders in the future would tried for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strong sentiment against the Atlantic trade was not as universal as people imagined.  Many politicians in the South were unyielding in their attempts to reestablish the Atlantic routes.  Fifty years later, a candidate for Mississippi office announced that the the great want of the South is more Negroes, fresh from Africa,' and he was not alone in this idea.  The development of an illegal slave trade started as soon as the law was enacted, and this black market continued for decades.

Commercial conventions emerged as a way to close this gap.  The first meetings focused on single, specific issues such as direct trade with Europe or railroad construction.  Later, the conventions would address a wide range of economic concerns.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1858, Montgomery, Alabama hosted the Southern Commercial Convention.  Over 500 citizens, including committees of 3 delegates per state, attended to discuss issues such as African apprentice labor, European trade, and, most importantly, the reopening of the Atlantic slave trade.  On the second day of the convention, speeches were heard from Richard Pryor of Virginia against the reopening, but William Yancey of Alabama spoke in favor.  Yancey gave a lengthy, powerful speech during which he suggested secession as a future option for the South.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular debate is indicative of the main change which had occurred in the conventions since their inception.  Instead of making decisions for economic advancement, the Southern Commercial Convention was used to spout political beliefs, spreading ideas widely in a short period of time.  Recognizing the political danger within the conventions, Northerners spoke out against them.  The New York Times even published a strongly worded piece announcing that it is high time that those [conventions] of the South end in the production of something better than speeches, resolutions, and reports.'

In debating this tariff, the committee alluded to their forefathers knowing looking to them as an example as to know our duty, so we know it is our right.'   They found the tariff to be peculiarly unfavorable to us' and refused the shallow idea of a system forced upon us under the imposing name of American''.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is interesting to note that many of these excuses these South Carolinians are makings are the same most slaves would be thinking.

This meeting sparked others throughout the Palmetto State including one in Cheraw on July 25th.  Obviously, this issue would not go away and later on, when President Jackson permitted the Tariff of Abominations', talk of nullification (voiding a law that is seen as unfavorable to a particular area) began to stir first in the Palmetto State.

The soil of Missouri was considered by planters of Maryland and Virginia to be admirably adapted for the cultivation of tobacco and evidently must become a staple commodity of Missouri.

For the North, it spread greater fear that slavery was not going to just die out like many had predicted.  Tobacco may use up farmland quickly, but states like Missouri now provided thousands of acres to be settled and cultivated by young and idealistic slave owners in the South who could not find land in their native state.

The states of Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, and New York were represented. Roughly two hundred delegates attended this conference. At the convention, attendees discussed the economic condition of the South, and they also proposed and passed resolutions to remedy this situation. The main issues debated included the increase of direct trade and immigration, the creation of agricultural societies, the incorporation of stock-raising as well as other economic improvements. All were hoped to develop the South into a more lucrative and productive region of the nation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reporting the dealings of the convention, the Charleston Daily News detailed the decisions of the delegates. The topic of direct trade and immigration entailed the establishment of direct railroad lines from the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina to the West as well as the establishment of direct steam connections from the same coasts to Europe. There was also the hopes of increasing immigration of skilled, willing labor from Europe through circulating pamphlets throughout Europe, printed in different languages and revealing the advantages of working in the South. Next, the issue of creating agricultural societies throughout the nation hoped to improve the relations of agriculture to commerce, manufacturers, and all other industries. Many at the convention envisioned that these societies would inform farmers of the necessity of studying improved methods of cultivation and the art of increasing productivity in order to better the output of the South. Another important matter of cultivation discussed involved the possibility of focusing on sheep farming in place of cotton planting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through this convention, it became apparent that the South was making great efforts to rise from their economic struggles that befell on her after the Civil War. Many delegates retained the reality that the economy of the postwar South would remain tied to agriculture. Thus, in calling this convention to session, the Georgia General Assembly was hoping to inaugurate measures which shall accelerate the return of prosperity; and which acting with the force of example shall;enhance by cooperation and combination all the states of the South,' according to the Charleston Daily News.

Because the border state of Kentucky had never seceded during the war, it did not have to be officially reconstructed.' Following the war, the government established the Freedman's Bureau in Kentucky with offices created to aid African-Americans. However, the new agency was not very active in actually supporting the newly freed slaves. In fact, the only real accomplishment of the bureau in favor of the black population was getting back wages paid to blacks that had been promised compensation but had yet to see that pay after the work was completed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the white- dominated legislature did very little to aid their African American population out of poverty and financial hardship. During the summer Democratic State Convention in 1873, the Kentuckian resolutions passed did not even recognize the inequality and economic strife that a large portion of their society faced. Rather, politicians and legislators focused on maintaining state's rights, limiting the power of the general government, keeping a rigid interpretation of the Constitution, amongst other administrative tasks.

After his appointment, Lyons gave a speech maintaining that the South wished to uphold the Constitution of the United States, but would also be ready to deal with whatever contingencies the future might hold.  Essentially, Lyons stated that the South would uphold the Constitution as long as it fit the South's plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several measures were proposed during the convention which lasted multiple days.  One such proposal by a Mr. Keane of Virginia advocated the encouragement of Southern books, newspapers and manufactures (Lynchburg Daily, Dec 11, pg. 3).'  This measure demonstrates the sectionalism that was growing during the era.  The South strove to become a self serving entity, independent of the north and its influence, and thus encouraged the spread of this principle through the rest of the South.  Another measure that was proposed was the reopening of the slave trade.  This measure was highly contested in the convention because while some thought the renewal would be an affront to the North and drive away the whole Christian world (Lynchburg Daily, Dec 11, pg. 4),' others felt its reopening benefited both races and slavery in general came from God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, they did not attempt to reopen the slave trade, but it is certain that their belief in slavery did not lessen.

Cotton consumption grew sevenfold between 1880 and 1900, the value of mills in the South multiplied nine times to about 95 million and the number of men employed in the industry grew from about seventeen to nearly one-hundred thousand. Cotton was unquestioningly the largest industry in the South, significantly outperforming the iron and steel factories and the tobacco industry.

The Railroad had recently purchased the South Carolina and the Georgia road. The Railroad intended to use this road to construct a direct line from Columbia, SC to Savannah, GA. Cities like Barnwell paid close attention to the expansion of the railroad and to where the new lines would be placed because they stood to benefit greatly economically if the lines ran through their town. &lt;br /&gt;In their book, The American South: A History, authors William J.

Railroads offered the ability to traverse the difficult geography of the South, offering opportunities to expand trade and develop local economies into regional ones. Railroads fostered the spread of the cotton culture because it allowed farmers in more remote areas to transport their crop to a city center where it could be sold. According to the authors, while railroad mileage in the South doubled in the fifteen years between 1865 and 1880, the boom increased in the final two decades of the century with mileage tripling between 1880 and 1900.&lt;br /&gt;While railroads clearly offered many opportunities in the South, Cooper and Terrill argue that, by the 1890s, the result was too much of a good thing'.

Cameron owned several large mills in Roanoke Rapids and Weldon, Virginia. Weldon had large hydroelectric engineering plants and Cameron planned to furnish electric power for these new areas from the plants in Weldon, which he claimed were second only in the country to Niagara Falls. The only drawback, he refused to say how much it was going to cost citizens in these areas. &lt;br /&gt;As urbanization swept the South in the latter part of the nineteenth century, citizens began to demand more goods and services from the government and the private sector. Water, sanitation, street improvements, sewer systems, transportation, police and fire protection, schools, some health services, and in times of economic stress, a modicum of public assistance for the most needy,' all of these services became expected as people settled into larger communities.

The bill was sent to the Whole House Committee where it would spend a great deal of time being debated and edited but never passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bill was important because it showed the increasing resistance to free blacks in the United States.  The free black was of little use to many Americans North and South because they could not be seen as reliable or hard working as the slave or they might harbinger delusions' of equality.  Irish and German immigrants saw that since blacks no longer constituted free labor they were now competing with these inferiors' for jobs in unskilled labor, which could be seen, in the eyes of the immigrants, as a hindrance to their well being.  The problem was most people did not know exactly what do with them, and where they fit on the social hierarchy but it was certainly not equal to any white man.  Gradual emancipation was becoming a topic of merit, but could they really survive in the land that oppressed them for so long.  To several people, blacks could be free just not here.  Many were so moved they had already serviced a ship, the brig Doris with Captain Matthews for Virginian free blacks willing to embrace this opportunity'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this was not a majority opinion.  Some believed that slavery was serving a good, eradicating their natural savagery' and that a trip to Africa would be unsuitable for these newly civilized' blacks. Therefore, this petition was not completely supported by any one area.  Fear would not really play a role until after Nat Turner's rebellion and free blacks were seen as a catalyst towards revolt.  The main impetus was maintaining social superiority but the plan failed because of wealthy slave owners' hostility in the South to any discussion on the topic.  Though not speaking for the entire South, they were a substantial part of the higher social ladder, and therefore a force to be reckoned with.  Congress feared the backlash from irate plantation owners, infringing on property rights' struck severe Constitutional problems for some Congressmen.  The American Beacon put it this way It was opposed by others as containing principles injurious to a certain description of property and contemplating an immediate emancipation'.

This bill was meant to provide some relief for the debtors but as the Charleston News and Courier put it the voting was a solemn one, leaving no room to look for a reversal of it'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, Senator Sanford did try just that, trying to add a clause that this bill would only affect merchant and traders only'.  This reignited a debate, including comments from future Vice-President and President Martin Van Buren.  He expressed his approval (in concept) of a bankruptcy bill but had found fault with the language of the first one.  He believed a bill for merchants and traders only might cause him to change his vote.  Before the topic could become thoroughly discussed, the Senate leadership flexed some muscle and cancelled the matter right then and there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event is significant for it shows not just the economic troubles of the time, but the class differences as well.  The Senate was full of upper-class, property owning loaners, not debtors.  Their interest was not in helping the poor farmer in deep amounts of debt with a national plan, their interest was in making sure what they loaned was returned to them as quickly as possible.  Though they had elections to worry about, this bill was a demonstration of making an effort towards relieving bankruptcy and yet one they knew would turn out unsuccessful.  Also Senators had the luxury of a six-year term while House representatives had to worry about re-election every two years.  Therefore, it should come as no surprise that it was the Senate that brought this bill to an end.  Bankruptcy would become an issue prevalent throughout the nineteenth century. Debate sparked about the question of whether the penitentiary system was the most practical solution to solve debt problems since they could not earn money behind bars.  These issues continued in the twentieth century and today over the debate on welfare, Keynesian economics and government's involvement with economic matters.  It may have evolved into bigger concepts, but the Bankruptcy Bill exemplifies the beginning of a difficult social issue."],"display_date":"February 1, 1827","search_date":"1827-02-01","locations":[{"id":1272,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":222,"title":"Cotton crop produced at abnormally low numbers.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1827-10-04","end_date":"1827-10-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Southern economy thrived on its ability to sell cotton to England and other European nations.

The cotton states of South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and Virginia would all fall far short of their usual quantity'.  Other crops suffered as well; in some areas of the South they could only produce barely a bushel of corn per acre.'  This severe bust for the South came from an unusually dry season ruining crops and yielding pathetically small dividends.  As a result, everyone in the South felt the economic hit that such an unlucky year had from the wealthiest plantation owner to the poorest white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event marks much more than agriculture problems, but problems with the Southern way of life.  Slavery could be an economic tool but it could not make rain appear from the skies and it could not force other countries to buy their goods.  However, the failure of cotton this year did not force Southerners to find other means of prosperity; instead it made them even more committed to agriculture.  By feeling such a lean year, plantation owners began to realize just how dependent they were on cotton, and therefore had to find every way to protect its perseverance.  This fear would make them resistant to any sort of change in their system coming from outside influence (particularly Northern states and abolitionists).  It would lead some ardent leaders to reject any kind of compromise with the North and really feed to the sectional nature inherent for an impending Civil War.

Free silver advocates were people who advocated the Federal Government to allow silver to be minted at 1 per troy ounce as opposed to the gold standard which valued gold at 20 per troy ounce.  The result of introducing silver into the market would have been an increase in money supply and inflation.  Those who backed free silver were in favor of inflation because it enabled debtors to pay debts off cheaper; wealthy creditors like banks, leaseholders, and landlords were against the free silver movement.  &lt;br /&gt;From June 12-14, 1895, the Convention of Free Silver Supporters met in Memphis Tennessee to discuss the forming of a new silver party.  The meeting was intended to be non-partisan, but was promoted by the Democratic Party, which made an effort to attract Populists and Republicans. Over 2,200 delegates from all over the Southern and Western states attended.  Representatives came from almost every state south of the Ohio River and West of the Mississippi River. &lt;br /&gt;The governor of South Carolina, Benjamin R. Tillman, had predicted a failure of the free silver movement within the Democratic Party and was one of the main advocates for the formation of a new party.  Pennsylvania Congressman, Joseph C.

Opposing the formation of a new party and urging Democratic unity was Senator Isham Harris from Tennessee.  &lt;br /&gt;Prior to the convention, an associated press report in the Nashville Banner on June 12, 1895 predicted that the convention was not likely to result in anything more than an enormous amount of speech-making and the adoption of strong free silver resolutions.'  At the termination of the convention on June 14, the press's prediction rang true; speeches continued from mid-morning until evening and while several Southern Populists were appointed to the Committee on Resolutions, no resolutions were agreed upon.  The Convention adjourned without conclusive action for adopting resolutions.&lt;br /&gt;Despite the unsuccessful nature of the convention in Tennessee, the free silverites continued to hold conventions throughout the United States.

The mills were created in 1835 for the manufacture of cotton goods in Lowell, goods designated for consummation and export.  At the end of the nineteenth century, competition arose from the cotton mills of the south as a result of cheaper fuel and labor.  The Boott mill claimed that if they were to continue to make the goods, they must make them where they have the same advantages as the southern companies.'  &lt;br /&gt;Historian Laurence Gross in his book, The Course of Industrial Decline: The Boott Cotton Mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, 1835-1955, says that the wages and conditions [at the mill] impaired both effort and effect' (78).

But, it had an inauspicious start, with a case sent before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1819. This case, <em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em>, upheld the legality of the Second Bank of the United States. The Bank would quickly gain allies and enemies, and the Bank War was underway.

The new bill was a protectionist tariff, attempting to protect local producers from foreign competitors by setting the tariff on imported goods, or using some other method to reduce importation. But, it would not protect those domestic producers evenly. It benefited the textile industries in the North by forcing people to buy more domestic products. At the same time, it hindered southern cotton farmers, because the English textile industry couldn't buy as much cotton.With the debate raging, several southerners were wary of the coming effects. One wrote that the passage of this act could lead to resistance and the dissolution of this glorious Union. At the time, this seemed like a drastic opinion, but it proved somewhat prophetically.

Most states did not agree with South Carolina's drastic action, but the issue of states' rights was laid on the table for the first time.

Jackson easily succeeded, becoming the first president to hail from a state other than Virginia or Massachusetts. This distinction can help symbolize the expansion of the United States during his eight years in office. Originally, the Democrats had not anticipated Jackson's running for a second term, but it became necessary because of the growing feud between Secretary of State Martin Van Buren and Vice-President John C. Calhoun. Despite some objections, Van Buren would take over as Jackson's running mate on the presidential ticket. The campaign was defined by the Bank War, the question of the Second Bank of the United States. This issue dominated the election so much that one newspaper wrote, The people of this country are at last invoked to decide whether they will have for President, Andrew Jackson, or the Bank of the United States. But, there were some other intriguing aspects to the election. It was both the first to have its candidates elected through party conventions and the first to include a legitimate third party, the Anti-Masons. William Wirt ran for that party, whose influence resided mostly in New York and Ohio. The other main party, in opposition with the Democrats, was the National Republicans, who ran two candidates, Kentucky Senator Henry Clay and Virginia Governor John Floyd. However, the election would be forever connected to the Second Bank of the United States. The incumbent Jackson believed the bank was unconstitutional and had failed to create a united currency. Earlier in 1832, he had actually vetoed the bill for re-chartering the Bank. The National Republicans hoped this issue would steal the election, with Jackson's harsh line taking away from his popularity. However, the President won handily, 219 electoral votes to 49 for Clay, 11 for Floyd, and 7 for Wirt.

The economic deeds of the summer of 1832 did not prevent Jackson's return to office, but, at the same time, they did not go unnoticed. A huge movement against the Tariff of 1832 was headed by the state of South Carolina. The state believed that this tariff was extremely detrimental to its well being. So, it compiled a convention to discuss the issue. The decision was made, and on November 24, 1832, the South Carolina legislature passed the Ordinance of Nullification, which declared the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional, and thereby null and void. The Nullification Crisis began with this act. The doctrine of nullification asserted that a state could resist a federal law that was not specifically authorized by the U.S. Constitution. The crisis also involved the idea of states' rights that, in any conflict, the power of the state should prevail. Not all southern states and not all South Carolinians believed in this action. One man believed the South Carolina convention had acted unconstitutionally in its own right: It is the very basis of a free government, that the Legislature are a limited body. But the Ordinance has conferred upon them the UNLIMITED power to do any and every act, which may be necessary to give it effect. Another man believed the state was left with few alternatives: For the nullifying state there would remain, only the two alternatives, of humiliation, and civil war. ","But, the Nullification Crisis would not lead to such drastic measures; it only brought forth certain ideas, such as nullification and states' rights, that would play an important role in the country's history.

In a time when political party affiliations were never stable, Calhoun aligned himself with Andrew Jackson half-way through his first term as Vice-President of the United States. Calhoun would join Jackson on the Democratic ticket in 1828, in an effort to succeed him to the presidency. But, Calhoun's political designs were met with a fight. He and Jackson never fully got along, and a competitor arose in New York's Martin Van Buren. After failing in his presidential bid in 1832 and losing his spot on the ballot to Van Buren, Calhoun ran for the Senate again. Having won that position, in a letter dated Columbia, South Carolina, 28th December, 1832, Calhoun said he was resigning the office of Vice President of the United States.

The boom in railroad reconstruction in the South coupled with successful westward expansion projects such as the Union Pacific Railroad had caused investors and speculators to bet heavily on new transportation projects (like a second transcontinental railroad, the Northern Pacific).  Once Cooke realized his firm had overextended itself financially in rail investments and was unable to meet its debt obligations (loans), he had to declare bankruptcy.  Fearing more defaults, banks around the country began calling in loans, causing more firms and investors to default, cutting off the rail industry's cash flow, causing more banks to call in more loans, and so on to cause a major financial depression; the New York Stock Exchange was closed for 10 days.  Between 1873 and 1879, employment reached a high of 14%, 89 of the nation's 364 railroads went under, and 18,000 businesses failed.  &lt;br /&gt;The aftershocks of the financial crash were soon felt in the Deep South, despite initially hopeful reporting that the worst has been seen;In Petersburg, Virginia several banks have been suspended; But off in the South and West no trouble is apprehended save some monetary stringency for a while' (Atlanta Constitution September 25).  The diary of a Northern Pacific Railroad employee named Thomas Rosser reveals the profound and rapid downward spiral Cooke's default initiated.  On September 18, 1873, Rosser learned; that Jay Cooke & Co. had failed. and [sic] the future of our co. is dark and uncertain.'  By October 13, less than one month later, the railroad had to send Rosser to Fargo in the Dakota Territories to represent the company at an auction sale to liquidate the last of the Northern Pacific's quartermaster dept. [property].'  In Rosser's words, the Northern Pacific [was] uttering its last gasp.'  The Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad soon joined the Northern Pacific in bankruptcy; by mid-November it was in the hands of receivers appointed by the Circuit Court of the United States, sitting at Mobile' (Montgomery Daily Advertiser).&lt;br /&gt;In this context of financial failure, Southern whites found it easy to blame Republican politicians in Washington and in their state governments, which in many cases had promised state funds to rebuild war-ravaged railways throughout the region (over 10 million alone to three North Carolina railroads).  The repercussions of the Panic reached across the South, as financial malcontent coupled with Republican corruption, lingering Civil War hostilities, and racial polarization lead to the North's retreat from Radical Reconstruction, making way for the Bourbon Redemption in 1876.  The South's large and influential agricultural sector took an especially large hit in the months following Northern investment failures, hurting black and white alike.  Crop prices dropped sharply: in just six short months, cotton prices fell by 50%, from around 20 cents per pound in July 1873 to just 10 cents per pound by December (prices quoted in the Atlanta Constitution). The double-whammy of a precipitous decline in profitability and steady deflation caused by a shortage of gold with which to back currency (the U.S. was still on the gold standard at the time) meant that farmers' debts were becoming more expensive at the same time that their crops were bringing in less money to pay those debts.  Property sales and bankruptcies were common, leading farmers to unite their collective woes and demand government aid, touching off the rapid expansion of the Grange Movement and the entrenchment of sharecropping."],"display_date":"September 25, 1873 - December 31, 1879","search_date":"1876-11-11","locations":[{"id":14181,"lat":37.1906306855,"lng":-77.2352563232,"zoom":10,"place":"Prince Georges, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":318,"title":"The Grange Movement Explodes\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-07-02","end_date":"1896-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1867, the National Grange of the Patrons of Husbandry was established to unite small farmers around the United States in the aftermath of the Civil War and combat problems facing them.  Grangers around the United States began calling for railroad regulation to lower crop freight rates in addition to negotiating better credit rates with local merchants and combating falling crop prices.  One local example of the incredible growth the Grangers experienced was in Tennessee.  On July 2, 1873, representatives from 40 local granges convened to form a Tennessee-wide grange and elect a Worthy Master of the State Grange.  By November of that year, there were 215 local granges, and by May of 1874 the total was 823.  Meanwhile, regional attempts at coordination also began to emerge, including interstate connections and communications among granges.  In August of the year, well before the Panic had begun, the Atlanta Constitution published a substantial article describing the rise of the Farmers' Movement as absolutely astonishing, and without precedent for rapidity of growth;in no part of the country is the movement gathering strength faster than in the cotton belt.'  With agriculture already a powerful legislative force in Western states like Illinois and Kansas, the agrarian South during the summer of 1873 was a veritable powder keg of potential political power; the disastrous events of September 18 simply provided the flashpoint which ignited it.&lt;br /&gt;It has always been said that the agricultural interests of the country [are] the slowest to move, or to change, but when they do once start, the movement is steady, strong, and irresistible.' These words, written by a Constitution staffer in August, proved prophetic after the Panic of 1873 hit.  The Grange Movement gained a new urgency as crop prices began a precipitous five-year decline; the price of cotton was slashed by nearly fifty percent between July and December.  Adding to farmers' woes was the steady deflation which accompanied falling prices.  Deflation (caused by a shortage of gold to back currency) meant that farmers' debts were becoming more expensive as their crops were bringing in less revenue, which made for a dire situation indeed.  The secretary of the Georgia State Grange telegraphed an open invitation to Patrons of Husbandry and farmers generally of the Cotton States' to a mass Granger meeting in Atlanta on November 25, 1873 to devise and consider measures looking for relief of prevailing distress.'  Nationally, Grange membership peaked in 1875 at 250,000.  The popularity and political power of the Granger Movement, fueled by the severity of farmers' financial situations, lead to the passage of Granger Laws' regulating railroads, as well as laying the foundation for the Populist movement and Greenback Party of the late 1880s and 1890s."],"display_date":"July 2, 1873 - December 31, 1896","search_date":"1885-04-01","locations":[{"id":11955,"lat":36.1695702654,"lng":-86.7859142705,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":324,"title":"Crop lien system &#40;sharecropping&#41; entrenches itself in former plantation areas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-10-29","end_date":"1873-10-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As a result of the costs of rebuilding after the Civil War and the depression during the 1870s, many farmers saw falling production and prices for their crops, with cotton dropping nearly fifty percent between 1872 and 1877.  Other crops formerly produced by slave labor (tobacco, sugar, and rice) also saw steep declines in their prices.  In the heavily agricultural South, especially Black Belt and coastal plantation regions, falling crop prices meant that smaller farmers' credit dried up with their profits, while medium- and large-scale farmers struggled to turn a profit and pay their employees.  Unable to meet their debts, many were forced to sell their land in assignee's sales or had it seized by banks, only to be bought by the same large landowners that had owned slaves before the war.  One such man was Edmund Richardson (Willis p. 13), who bought up seized property along the Mississippi River during Reconstruction until he owned cotton plantations' in 4 different Mississippi Delta counties, with a headquarters' in Washington County; Richardson's land produced over 100,000 bales of cotton per year.  &lt;br /&gt;To work these vast tracts, many former slave owners initially employed black squad labor for cash wages, a system which did not last long.  In the words of the New York Times' correspondent in coastal Jacksonville, Florida, When the war ended, the negroes were without homes.  The old planters owned all the finest lands in the state; They made the best contracts they could with the freedmen to raise their cotton crops [but] the planters had no means, and could scarcely restock their estates, depleted after the war.' Pricey post-Civil War rebuilding, the Panic, and competition for workers in heavily black agricultural areas like the Mississippi Delta and the heaviest cotton counties in the State [of Florida],' made squad-labor prohibitively expensive, forcing planters to find a middle way between squad labor and autonomous black production.' (Willis 33)  Sharecropping seemed to be a good compromise for whites because it maintained the prewar social power structure by keeping blacks dependent on the white elite for land, tools, and credit while simultaneously maximizing crop output by giving workers a financial incentive to produce.  The crop-lien system of agriculture was particularly widespread in the Deep South belt stretching from Louisiana to South Carolina, lasting from Reconstruction until the mechanization of agriculture and industrialization of the New Deal and World War II."],"display_date":"October 29, 1873","search_date":"1873-10-29","locations":[{"id":1328,"lat":30.4938122303,"lng":-81.4274627631,"zoom":9,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":329,"title":"Passage of the Hawaiian Treaty Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-08-14","end_date":"1876-08-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Concurrent resolutions of the Hawaiian Treaty bill passed both houses in mid-August of 1876.

When the Panic of 1873 began causing financial problems for railroads, many had to cut wages and lower their orders from iron, steel, and cement suppliers; others, like the Northern Pacific, went bankrupt and ceased production immediately.  Subsidiary industries, in turn, were forced to cut their own employees' wages and hours or shut down.  In the face of cuts on all sides, workers began to use their only real defense: strikes.&lt;br /&gt;The Upper South was a hotbed of rail-building activity after the Civil War because so much of the fighting and, consequently, the destruction, had taken place in border states.  Additionally, parts of the Upper South were less agrarian than areas like the Black Belt and Carolina low country, making states like Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee more likely to turn to industrial employment.  These factors taken in conjunction with the Panic of 1873 produced a number of labor-relations problems.  In Louisville, the steel-rolling and iron-molding mills were forced to close as workers protested recent wage reductions and shift cuts, putting over 400 men out of work at the rolling mill alone.  The cement mills also had to shut down as a result of having large stocks and light sales,' the classic marks of a recession.  Just to the south, southern railroad company leaders met in Chattanooga to form a united front and face down aggressive strike tactics by workers, while also affirming the justice of any reasonable reduction of wages by companies.'  In Knoxville, the East Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia Railroad attempted to deal with striking employees who insisted on riding trains to prevent scabs from doing their jobs, while the Knoxville and Ohio line was forced to temporarily [cease] all trains,' the result of a total strike by its workers.  &lt;br /&gt;Railroad companies' financial difficulties caused by the Panic got much worse before they got better.  Consequently, the labor situation for subsidiary industries and rail workers kept deteriorating.  The freefall hit bottom in a wave of strikes in 1877, after which the economy and rail industries began their slow recovery.  The Panic affected all parts of Southern society, not just cotton farmers and political leaders, causing widespread malcontent which in the case of Tennessee and Kentucky, manifested itself through strikes and aggressive negotiations with the business elite.  The power of unions to halt production and at least have their demands heard by business leaders was not lost on employees at the time, setting the stage for the age of the union in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century."],"display_date":"November 5, 1873 - December 31, 1877","search_date":"1875-12-03","locations":[{"id":12157,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":376,"title":"Henderson, North Carolina Cotton Mills Announce Plan for a New Mill","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-08-07","end_date":"1895-08-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the 1890's, the size of the cotton crop was growing at a rapid rate as more and more land in the western part of the United States was being devoted to cotton.

Determined to , in his own words , overthrow an aristocracy which had come down to us from colonial days', he mounted a campaign in the 1880s to foment discontent amongst the agricultural community within South Carolina with the ruling agricultural political establishment.  Championing diversification and agricultural education, he was one of the founders of the Edgefield Agricultural Society in 1885.  &lt;br /&gt;However, it was the decision by Francis W. Dawson, the Editor of the News and Courier, to publish several of Tillman's letters in his newspaper in November of 1885 which dramatically increased his notoriety and popularity around the state.  In these letters he made a forceful case for increased agricultural education in South Carolina.  Praising the agricultural-specific colleges of Michigan, Kansas, and Mississippi, Tillman decried the pitiful, contemptible, so-called agricultural annex' at the South Carolina College in Columbia.  Claiming a desperate need for additional scientific training in agriculture within the state, he pointed to the distinct agricultural character of the state's populace , three-fourths of which are farmers -- as evidence that less of the farmer's money' should be used to fund the study of the professional arts.  Tillman proposed that the state legislature use the interest it had earned off the 30,000 acres appropriated to it by Congress in 1862 , roughly 11,520 , to finance such an agricultural institution as is found in the aforementioned states.&lt;br /&gt;In a later letter, Tillman delivered a stirring indictment of the institutions set up to support agricultural interests within the state of South Carolina , namely, the Board of Agriculture, the State Agricultural Society, and the College of South Carolina.  He intricately described a Board dominated by non-farmers uninterested in furthering agricultural progress, an Agricultural Society whose noble intentions are marred by bureaucratization and partisanship, and a College barely devoted to inculcating agricultural knowledge amongst its student body .  He proposed that South Carolina hold annual farmer's conventions as they do in many Northern states, and advocated the formation of agricultural societies, fairs, and farmer's institutes.  Tillman ended his letter with a call to the farmers of South Carolina to organize and push such reforms, and pleaded that the prosperity of the state is intimately tied to their implementation, especially that of agricultural education.&lt;br /&gt;Often depicted as a populist,' Tillman went on to serve both as governor and United States senator for the state of South Carolina, where he became , once again, in his own words , the most powerful political factor in South Carolina.'"],"display_date":"November 19, 1885","search_date":"1885-11-19","locations":[{"id":11459,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":451,"title":"President Andrew Jackson issues the Specie Circular\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-07-11","end_date":"1836-07-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1832, President Andrew Jackson refused to re-charter the Bank of the United States, opting instead to deposit government funds in select state or pet' banks.  The state banks, facing little regulation, freely loaned paper money to virtually anyone who asked for it.  A flurry of land speculation and inflation followed.  To curtail these alarming trends, Jackson issued the Species Circular on July 11, 1836.  The executive order meant that federal land could no longer be bought with paper money, but only with gold or silver.  In Jackson's view, this hard' money was the only currency that could be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issued by Secretary of Treasury Levi Woodbury, the Circular to Receivers of Public Money, and to the Deposite Banks' was meant to eliminate the frauds, speculations, and monopolies' that were fueled by an excess of easy credit from state banks.  The circular predicted that such transactions would have an evil influence' on the public interest and the national currency, and sought to contain the problem by ordering all deposit banks to refuse bank credits and paper money as payment for public lands beginning the 15th of August, 1836.  Since it was speculation that Jackson sought to end, purchases of less than 320 acres would be payable with bank notes up until December 15 if the purchaser could demonstrate that he intended to settle the land.  However, everyone would have to pay with specie following that date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the limitations imposed by the circular took effect, land speculation abruptly slowed.  After December 15, settlers were not even allowed to pay with good' paper money.  An Arkansas native explained in the Louisville Daily Journal that this measure, far from aiding the average settler, caused great harm; people in essence had to use their notes to buy specie at a premium from the banks, and in turn use the gold or silver to buy land.  When land sales dropped off, it meant state governments, especially in the West, lost income.  At the same time, higher interest rates in England were beginning to lower the price of cotton.  These circumstances would eventually help precipitate the Panic of 1837."],"display_date":"July 11, 1836","search_date":"1836-07-11","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":453,"title":"American Tobacco Company Established\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the several years preceding 1890, brothers Ben and Buck Duke initiated several reforms of their tobacco manufacturing business.

The American Tobacco Company, known as the cigarette trust', dominated the cigarette business and resisted economic fluctuations.  It was also the first tobacco manufacturer to adopt the central departmentalized structure of a modern corporation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The establishment of such a cigarette trust' created a response of anti-trust groups including the Farmers' Alliance.  On January 11, 1890 the Farmers' Alliance held an Anti-Cigarette Trust Convention in Oxford, North Carolina.  The Alliance initially kept their proceedings and resolutions solutions.

It subjected all able-bodied men between the ages of 20 and 45 to military conscription. The guidelines were later clarified so that even those of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath his intention to become a citizen of the United States' would be subject to conscription.&lt;br /&gt;They could, however, evade the requirement by paying a fee of 300 or enlisting a substitute draftee. The first two draft calls produced an army that was approximately ninety percent substitutes. After two months, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, decided that the language of the act read that the acceptance of a fee to waive conscription was optional, and that he had the authority disallow payments in lieu of military services, and to discourage the economic bias of the law suspended the measure. Stanton argued that such a clause should be avoid because the law was intended to be a war measure' and not a revenue measure.' However, the provision to allow substitutes remained permissible, and those conscripted who were well off continued to pay others to serve in their stead. However, conscripts still made up only a fifth of the entire army. These practices were deemed unfair to poorer residents, and resulted in riots in New York City. One reason for the necessity of the Conscription Act was that, subsequent to the Emancipation Proclamation, military enlistments dropped and desertions become more frequent. This led to a need for mandatory conscription of Union citizens.&lt;br /&gt;Of the thirty Southern members of the House of Representatives, a surprising twelve voted for the bill, and a number of the others were absent from the vote. Southerners detested the act, seeing it as an encroachment on their freedoms, and arguing that a war that deserved to be fought ought to have enough support from volunteers to avoid the necessity of a draft.

Hill, a Missouri creamery owner, produced 43,500 pounds of butter in 1890.  He sold all of his butter in the eastern market.  Increasing railroad building and growing connections with places like Edina, Missouri made possible the sale of agricultural products across the country.  While some like Hill thrived because of this more open trade, others opposed the expansion of markets.  They believed railroads brought more outside goods and competition within the local market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making profits from butter production was not unique to Missouri.  Raising cattle and butter production played an important part of the livelihood for G. Pearce Wood, a farmer in Decatur County, Georgia.  Wood made such a name for himself that an Atlanta newspaper interviewed him and shared some of his techniques.  Over the course of the year in 1889, Wood sold 2,100 pounds of butter for a total of 630.  His neighbor's production and profits amounted to about the same.  Wood not only used the grade Jersey cows' milk production for butter but also to feed his hogs thereby increasing their value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the commercial aspects of dairy farming covered in the Atlanta newspaper, a North Carolina newspaper published an article detailing the steps in making butter.  According to the article, temperature maintenance remained one of the crucial considerations in making good butter.  The article instructed the farmer to not jab your finger in [the butter] and say it is just right, use a dairy thermometer.'  The article also recognized the growing commercialism in dairy farming and ends with instructions for the packaging and shipping of the butter.  It instructed the reader to [p]ress into one pound cakes with a butter press, with some plain stamp on it, and wrap each cake separately in parchment paper, place it in a tin can send to market.

In North Carolina, pleas from the western counties for internal improvements were going unheard by prosperous, mostly Democratic planters, who were overrepresented in the legislature.  The Whig strategy, therefore, was to garner support by demanding state aid to education and transportation projects, using North Carolina's share of the federal surplus.  (This agreed with Whig ideology, which espoused economic development through government projects.)  This plan of attack proved successful, and Whig Edward Dudley defeated the incumbent Richard D. Spaight (a Democrat) with 53.6% of the vote.  The Whigs also gained a majority in the senate, and were only two seats short of controlling the house.  The Democratic Macon Georgia Telegraph lamented, We give it up: Dudley, the Whig candidate is elected Governor over Spaight the Administration candidate.  The presidential question however did no control the election... There is but little doubt but North Carolina will be for Van Buron.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to the election, the Whig-supporting North Carolina Star averred, Should Spaight be elected, it will be forthwith claimed as decisive of the strength of parties on the Presidential question.  When therefore the voters recollect that in voting between Dudley and Spaight, they are to a considerable extent voting between White and Van Buren, we trust there will be no indifference.'  The paper further reminded its readers that Spaight had abandoned republican principles in voting against the declared wishes of his constituents,' and that he was opposed to the land bill , to North Carolina's receiving her portion of the proceeds of the public domain...'  Whiggish concerns about tyrannical leaders and internal improvements apparently struck a cord with North Carolina's poor and/or progressive-minded inhabitants.  The election drew 67% of potential voters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, as the Telegraph predicted, Democrat Martin Van Buren would win the presidential election only three months later.  Following Dudley's victory, Whig leaders began campaigning for White almost exclusively on the slavery issue.  Voter participation in November dropped to 53%; it simply seemed less important to vote to protect slavery in a region where people universally opposed abolition.  The North Carolina experience made it clear that an emphasis on relevant local issues other than slavery would be necessary to win state elections."],"display_date":"August 1, 1836 - August 30, 1836","search_date":"1836-08-15","locations":[{"id":9841,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":463,"title":"Thirty-eight Sheriff Sales Reported in Local Missouri Newspaper\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-02-02","end_date":"1890-02-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Many Missouri farmers lost their farms in sheriff's sales during 1890.

The sheriff then sold the seized property on the courthouse steps.  The locality listed the seized properties in the newspaper in an attempt to attract new settlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farmers in other places across the South experience the same hard times as the displaced farmers in Missouri.

The need for railroads, canals and roads was a necessary complement to the rapid territorial expansion of the U.S.  In addition, commercial centers with limited access to waterways needed land transportation in order to grow and compete with better-situated towns and cities.  On the same day that the county court of Fayette, Kentucky appointed delegates to the convention, it authorized 15,500 to aid in the completion of all the Turnpike roads within the county.'

According to a Treasury Department report issued on February 1, 1836, the surplus amounted to about 30,000,000.  In 1833 Congress had passed a bill to distribute the surplus among the states, with the support of Andrew Jackson.  But in 1836 the fate of the surplus became a point of contention between Democrats and Whigs.  Jackson began to assert that its distribution would be unconstitutional.  Meanwhile, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster strongly supported distributing the surplus, and succeeded in passing legislation to that end in the Senate.  The House, however, would not pass the bill in its current form, citing constitutional bounds.  Whigs, of course, clamored for the measure in order to support internal improvements.  Edward B. Dudley made it a major campaign issue in his run for governor in North Carolina.  Finally, the proposed legislation was modified to diffuse the surplus in the form of deposits to be repaid by the states. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On June 23, 1836 the measure passed as part of the Act to regulate the deposites of the public money.'  The handling of the surplus was addressed in Section 13, which read: And be it further enacted, That the money which shall be in the Treasury of the U. States; reserving the sum of five millions of dollars, shall be deposited with the several States, in proportion to their respective representation in the Senate and the House of Representatives.'  The state governments would vote to accept the deposits, and within a year of their receipt, state banks would have to redeem the notes in specie.  Section 14 provided for the transfer to take place in four installments throughout 1836.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The requirement that the U.S. government be repaid in specie proved problematic.  After states accepted their share of the surplus, often using it to fund internal improvements, they found they did not have the hard' money to back up inflated bank notes.  Much of the wealth generated by land sales in the West was artificial, and by the end of 1836 it was clear that the states would be unable to repay the federal government in specie.  This would lead them to suspend specie payments, precipitating the Panic of 1837."],"display_date":"June 23, 1836","search_date":"1836-06-23","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":546,"title":"A Book of Legal Forms Published in Tennessee\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1818-12-01","end_date":"1818-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A book, entitled Forms of Precedents for the use of Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, Coroners, and Constables in the state of Tennessee, filled with all sorts of legal forms which can handle all types of situations and can be used by many different people, was published in Tennessee (specific for Tennessee law).

The journal quoted from a report in the London Athenaeum.  British authorities in India had begun to consider the viability of growing all the cotton necessary for their nation in their Indian possessions.  At the time they estimated that Britain imported between 4 and 500,000,000 pounds of cotton per year.  Most of this came from the American South, with only about a tenth being produced in India.  The subcontinent had long grown cotton, but this was generally a household industry and the varieties cultivated were coarser and less valuable than American cotton.&lt;br /&gt;The East India Company sent their agent, Captain Bayles, to the American South to investigate the possibility.  There he recruited American farmers to assist the Company in its cultivation projects.  The Manchester Guardian reported the arrival of several individuals from the United States, with saw-gins and other machinery for the cleansing of cotton.'  The plan seems to have come about not only for current economic considerations, but also so that in the event of war with America, we shall thus, in due time be independent of that country for the supply of a staple commodity of very extensive utility, and productive of no inconsiderable profit.'  The editors of The Charleston Mercury, observing all this, had no doubt that the great Anti-Slavery agitation in London, also set on foot by the East India Company.'  According to some southerners this was a threat to the basis of the southern economy as well as a scheme to undermine the southern slaveholding system.&lt;br /&gt;Over the next decades the British began to build up the Indian cotton industry.

Corporations also had the option of complete liquidation of assets to avoid bankruptcy.  The act further established a bankruptcy referee to be appointed by the state judge.

He planned to further fortify the coasts, borders, and frontiers of the country, and emphasized the importance of local militias, while expressing his preference for peace over war.  This spoke to the people of the South, who were happy to be done with the War of 1812, but still felt threatened by Indians and foreign countries.  He hoped to discharge the national debt as soon as possible, and to use the government's funds as efficiently as possible to help the people.&lt;br /&gt;A Virginia native, Monroe would later introduce the Monroe Doctrine and help establish a definite border between the U.S. and Canada.

In 1817, grain prices were 154% of the price in 1815 in the United States.  In the month of January, the price of grain was nearly twice the original 1815 price.  This was partially due to a low grain harvest in America, but also reflected the large amount of grain exported to Europe, where the famine was much worse.  The season of the fall of 1817 saw grain supplies returning to their pre-drought levels.  On September 5th, 1817, the Richmond Enquirer noted the price of grain in France was down 5 francs, and that the price of grain was falling every where'.&lt;br /&gt;A letter from Saxony, Germany dated May 31st was printed in the Raleigh Minerva.  It blamed a stunted grain harvest for the widespread and severe famine in Germany that had been going on for years.  The Saxony man explained the economic toll the famine was taking.  Since people had so little money and food, they were unable to save up or store for the future.  Even after the famine ended, it would be hard for the town to return to it's previous economic independence.  In contrast, the grain producers of the southern United States were thriving on the increased demand for their produce outside of the country.&lt;br /&gt;The Milledgeville Republican of Georgia reprinted an article from London expressing a worry that they were importing too much grain from the United States.  London imported over a million barrels of flour from the United States in 1817.  This amounted to about three million pounds sterling paid to the U.S. for grain in that year.  France, Spain and Portugal were also suffering from a shortage of grain and ended up buying a lot from America.

Rumors spread like wildfire about the failing U.S. economy and the depleted U.S. Treasury. Both the North and South began to feel the side effects of the struggling economy, although each part of the nation seemed to react to the signs and signals in a different way. The North seemed more hesitant than the South to quickly report the extent of the trouble the nation was facing, even if they were aware at the time. Week after week in May 1893, the New York Times reported banks closing in Chicago, but never actually came out and questioned the financial state of the country or what that might have to do with the failing banks. Even when the National Bank of Deposit Decides to Stop' on May 23, 1893, the article on the front page of the New York Times reports that, according to the National Bank of Deposit, the board laid the loss in deposits to the recent circulation of rumors affecting the bank' (1). &lt;br /&gt;Weeks earlier in the South, however, the Atlanta Constitution runs a front-page headline reading Nearly a Panic' and reports on the immense failures on Wall Street the day before. Throughout the day there were rumors that other failures were impending, and brokers and speculators were kept in a state of trepidation and excitement by the fear of further calamities' (1), read the dramatic article.

Archibald D. Murphey, a member of the North Carolina state Legislature, suggested several proposals to the state Senate as ways to improve this.  The proposal of which he was most proud was for the universal education of white male children in the state.  He called for the creation of primary schools, academies, and a University of North Carolina, to be funded in part by the state government, and in part by local governments.  Children who could afford to pay would be required to, but poor children would be allowed to attend primary school for free.  If they were deemed intelligent enough, they would be allowed to attend the academies and University for free as well.  His proposal was not enacted at the time, but was very popular among the people.  Murphey also was an advocate of other ways to improve the state, including making rivers fully navigable, and clearing land for roads so as to create a major commercial center in North Carolina.&lt;br /&gt;Murphey's plan was one of many throughout the South.  Senator Elliott, from Liberty County, Georgia suggested a similar program to the state legislature of Georgia.  He argued that educating the people of the state would lead to be better state security.  In South Carolina, there was a system of free schools instituted in the county of Kershaw.  They had yearly meetings in which those who wished to build a new school or have a new school built near them could voice this request.  The Virginia General Assembly established a committee to look into the possibility of public education throughout the state.

The national bank was not any more fiscally responsible than the state banks, and together they flooded the state with currency.  Before the new banks, currency had not been widely used in the state, and bartering had been the common method of trade.

Affects of the Civil War had created a dominant middle class, as well as a strong African American vote, in Clarke County. When the 1892 elections for Governor of Alabama arrived, most Clarke County residents supported one of two political parties- the Democratic Party or the Farmer's Alliance. The race for governor between Democratic candidate, Thomas Goode Jones, and Alliance-backed candidate, Reuben F. Kolb, promised to be a close one. Local newspapers enhanced the dramatic race by publishing warnings from the Democratic Party, stating that Misrepresentations and falsehood are the chief weapons of the Kolb party' (2). Conflict began immediately after the election, with claims that Jones' victory was the result of illegal actions, such as ballot stuffing. The front page of the Birmingham Age-Herald reported, just days after the election, that The political situation in Alabama is critical and the gravest fears of the leaders of two legislatures and two state governments from present indications, may be realized' (1). Democrats carried the black vote in Clarke County, infuriating citizens of the rural precinct of Mitcham Beat, who had turned to the Alliance after feeling ignored by their own local Democratic Party. This group of citizens of Mitcham Beat, secretly named Hell-at-the-Breech, didn't have a loyalty to the Alliance, either, but voted that way simply to be accepted politically. When the Alliance began reporting lawlessness on the part of white men in Mitcham Beat, the men took out their frustration with violence.     &lt;br /&gt;The murder of elite Democratic Party member Ernest McCorquodale, allegedly over McCorquodale's foreclosure of a Hell-at-the-Breech member's farm , was investigated, but never solved after all suspects were found to have alibis. Not long after, in June 1893, a black man, William Howze, was murdered outside of Mitcham Beat for mistreating a white woman. When the black man's brother was accused of the same crime a month later, two prominent citizens of Clarke County stepped forward to prevent his lynching. When the Hell-at-the-Breech posse confronted an upper-class store owner in a neighboring town over allegations that the store owner had mistreated a boy from Mitcham Beat, leaders of Clarke County saw connections between McCorquodale and Howze's murders. The Mayor stepped in to protect Clarke County around the same time that McCorquodale's death was avenged by the murder of Hell-at-the-Breech member, Lev James. Soon after, Hell-at-the-Breech members' names were given by tortured members and, to make a point, the mob of Clarke County men publicly shot one of the most prominent members of the group, Quincy Bledsole. Although this ended the reign of Mitcham Beat's Hell-at-the-Breech, the bitterness of the working class would live on in Clarke County."],"display_date":"June 1, 1893 - August 30, 1893","search_date":"1893-07-16","locations":[{"id":83,"lat":31.6766489025,"lng":-87.8308040287,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":775,"title":"The Zebulon M.

The pioneer of tobacco manufacturing in Winston was Hamilton Scales. By 1880 there were 126 tobacco factories in North Carolina and most of them were located in Durham and Winston. The rise of the tobacco industry is an example of the power of private enterprise. Unlike the cotton industry, which was highly regarded in the press, the development of the tobacco industry was almost solely the result of private initiative and intense competition. &lt;br /&gt;After the Civil War, the tobacco industry in the South was extremely profitable, just as it was before the war.

The tobacco industry had an impact on the South as a whole because it helped repair and re-establish the economy in the South after the Civil War."],"display_date":"1871 - 1880","search_date":"1876-01-01","locations":[{"id":9439,"lat":36.1386276872,"lng":-80.2459805907,"zoom":10,"place":"FORSYTH, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":820,"title":"Sorghum Arrives in America\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-07-02","end_date":"1853-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sorghum, a grass that grows in the tropical regions of the world, made its grand entrance to the South via Georgia and South Carolina in 1853.

Even though sorghum entered the United States through Georgia and South Carolina, it would become most popular in Tennessee. The process to create sorghum syrup from the sorghum cane was lengthy.  Farmers had to remove the leaves and seeds from the plant.  They then had to boil it, and skim off the chlorophyll that bubbled to the top.

The mortality rates were so bad that nearly fifty percent of children were dying before they reached adulthood on the coastline of Texas. Doctors were deficient in engineering sanitation standards, enforcing quarantines, and educating citizens about the importance of good hygiene. Supplies were also lacking, as doctors asked surgical patients to imbibe whiskey because there was no anesthetic to apply to them. <br />Another pestilence in the land arose from a worrisome number of medical quacks. They would tell patients that they were physicians when all they really had training in was sales. They “prescribed' (sold) “magical' pills that were supposed to have the qualities of a modern-day Viagra, and they urged people to drink and eat exorbitant amounts of tonics and pills. The formally-educated physicians warned the public about the dangers of medical quacks by publishing articles in Houston newspapers. Finally, in 1853, they formed the Texas Medical Association in order to set a quality standard for medical practice. The United States Senate later took notice of the Texas Medical Association when its president, a Mr. Spencer asked for the Senate to pass a law that would protect Texas physicians in the United States Navy. He claimed that doctors in the Navy had been given random and unnecessary orders by their superior officers. The Texas Medical Association simply wanted to protect its physicians who were in the Navy and give them the same rank and rights as those who might attempt to give them orders.

Neville.  During the duration of the trip, news somehow reached the sheriff of Todd country, KY that there were some blacks on board the train who were engaging in illegal commerce: the selling and buying of cigars and liquors on board the train without license.  Sheriff Johnson and Deputy Sheriff Wilcox were able to stop the train in Kentucky and went forward to arrest both Mark Johnson and Hut Barton , both black men.  &lt;br /&gt;According to the Courier Journal, the two police officers, fearing retaliation by these two men, felt that handcuffs were a necessary precaution.  Soon after, though, scores of black men on board the train rushed forward to try to stop the arrest and to rescue both Johnson and Barton.  Some sources believed that the arrest was a simply a retaliatory measure against Mark Johnson because the police believed that he was linked to the death of an Irishman from Guthrie, named Jeffcot which had occurred several months prior.  In the fracas,' a bullet apparently struck Johnson and would eventually lead to his death at his mother's home early the next morning.  In addition, Sheriff Wilcox sustained injuries as he was shot through his arm.&lt;br /&gt;The event's significance stands out on a number of fronts.  First of all, the illegal selling of goods aboard trains is a fine example of two new vices which became prevalent throughout the South at this time for black people: liquor and tobacco.  With blacks now free from traditional slavery and with an increase in ready cash, the historian Frances Simkins claimed that there use of alcohol, and alcoholism, increased.  Simkins recounts that the black lower classes' new-found access to alcohol scared many local officials as they believed the blacks were the cause of the profanity, vagrancy, murders, and assaults' which permeated Southern streets on average Saturdays now.

Shortly after VMI was created, South Carolina tried to recreate VMI in their version which they called the Citadel.  The cadets at both schools had rivalries concerning who had more state patriotism' (Volo, p. 188).  At VMI and the Citadel, cadets learned the arts of tactics, operations, drill, and horse riding in addition to the traditional subjects.  Occasionally, the cadets at VMI would march off campus and into the town of Lexington to show off their skill at drill.  The whole state of Virginia was immensely proud of VMI. &lt;br /&gt;               One of the proudest parents of a VMI cadet was Philip St. George Cocke from Belmead, Virginia.

Cocke saw many additions to the grounds of the school including additional barracks, society rooms for the cadets, and even a new mess hall.  With all of the funding and pride that Virginians poured into VMI, it paid off during the Civil War when the Confederacy raided the stashes of officers from VMI alumni.

On a larger scale, the creation of the Mississippi river commission sought to create a national policy for promotion of commerce.  On October 16, 1879 in Quincy, Illinois, the commission discussed their numerous recommendations to the federal government.

Though Georgia at first attempted to remove these prospectors, tensions continued to mount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem for Georgia was that Indian tribes at the time existed as semi-independent states within the boundaries of existing U.S. states. Historian Louis Masur notes in his book 1831 that the Georgia General Assembly passed law after law asserting its own sovereignty over the entire state,' but the Cherokee were very reluctant to uproot. As a result, the events in Georgia became an important factor behind the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which allowed the President to negotiate with Indian tribes to relocate west of the Mississippi River. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indian Removal and access to Indian territories for white settlers also became an important political issue in Georgia.

The problem was simple: gold and other resources had been discovered on a huge tract of very rich and fertile land that was inaccessible only because it was occupied by people who white Americans at the time saw as uncivilized savages.

This, in combination with the Tariff of 1828 -- which many Southerners saw as a direct assault on their well being -- was seen as a violation of the role of the Federal government in relation to the states. This apparent violation in turn set off a series of Senate debates between Thomas Benton of Missouri and Robert Hayne of South Carolina on one side, and most notably Daniel Webster of Massachusetts on the other side. Though this debate peaked in the Senate in from the 18th to the 27th of January, 1830, it continued and expanded the growing debate throughout America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary motives behind Hayne's and Benton's argument was that the restrictive Federal tariff was greatly damaging the economy of the South and was hurting U.S. consumers as a whole -- a tariff which they argued could be nullified by the individual states if they so chose. In article in The Federal Union on July 24, 1830, Hayne's is quoted saying that the Constitution is a compact to which the States are parties' -- that as the Federal Government derives its existence, and all of its powers from that instrument, its acts are no further valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated in that compact.'' Thus, from Hayne's point of view, ultimate authority and power rested in the individual states who could nullify a federal act deemed damaging to the welfare of the state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This opinion did not hold true everywhere in the South, however. Whereas the Charleston Mercury argued on August 3, 1830, that the tariff had resulted in an annihilation of commerce,' President Jackson suggested, in a letter reprinted in The Globe on December 7, that the effects of the present tariff are doubtless overrated.' Moreover, many Southerners were disillusioned with the extreme position taken by Hayne and others. On April 1, 1830, after printing a section from the Columbia Telescope saying that if the Tariff Law is not repealed, there must be bloodletting -- the Southern States must stand to their arms' the Raleigh Register declares we (are) not yet prepared for such an extraordinary declaration as this. We hope and believe that the people of South Carolina are nor prepared for it.' Clearly this debate sparked a great deal of controversy, because though many Southerners disliked the Tariff, many also accepted it as part of a democratically elected form of central government and were appalled by Hayne and South Carolina's doctrine of nullification."],"display_date":"January 18, 1830 - January 27, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-22","locations":[{"id":6076,"lat":39.603674835,"lng":-77.8141711851,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1053,"title":"South Carolina Supreme Court adjourns after decisions to repeal the homestead exemption, and pay back most of the state debt","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-10-28","end_date":"1879-10-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 28th, the South Carolina Supreme Court adjourned after making a series of significant rulings that signified the restored control by the white planter class after reconstruction.

While the city struggled to achieve public improvements and increase urban development, a disproportionate number of natural disasters struck, such as the hurricane of 1804.  Incidents of yellow fever and cholera outbreak resulted in large-scale mortality and interference with business.  A vast fire, on the lot belonging to the estate of Isaac Fell, in Baptist Church square (Arkansas Gazette 4/1),' struck in the early morning of January 11, 1820. It spread with the winds and destroyed about 500 buildings before subsiding that afternoon.  The editor of the Savannah Republican' reported that the whole of the town north of Broughton Street to the Bay (Arkansas Gazette 4/1)' was gone, along with Savannah's Branch Bank of the United States. &lt;br /&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the fire that ravaged the city, the government had no clues as to the origin of the calamity, but some were estimating the damages to be near ten million dollars.  This number was later revised by the Committee of Aldermen and Citizens of Savannah, who reported the amount claimed for losses as closer to one million dollars , still an immense sum in the early nineteenth century (Southern).  Because the fire had such a devastating effect on the Savannah and its citizens, people across the nation responded to aid those affected.  A committee was established to distribute clothing, food, and other provisions collected primarily from Georgia and surrounding southern states.  &lt;br /&gt;The federal government took action by passing a Senate bill on March 8.  During the first session of the Sixteenth Congress, Mr. Sanford of the Committee of Finance instructed the Senate on a bill for relief of sufferers from the Savannah fire.  Its main provision was for the lessening and postponement of debt for those citizens who had lost literally all they had to the fire.  The bill stipulated that one fourth part of all duties due and remaining unpaid to the United States, at the custom house at Savannah, upon imported merchandise, which was destroyed;and was not insured against fire, be, and the same is hereby, remitted (A Bill).'  In addition, Sanford's bill provided for a two-year extension of credit to make payment on the other three fourths of duties.

The writer used primary evidence to make the argument that those who criticized Southerners for upholding the institution of slavery were hypocritical because many of them made money from illegal importation of slaves overseas, the act that produced this servitude (Alexandria).'  The transportation and selling of slaves from West Africa, or any other country, was officially outlawed in 1808 as a response to Northern persistence.  Nevertheless, between that time and 1860, the South illegally imported over 250,000 slaves.  &lt;br /&gt;This crime had become a major topic of controversy, especially earlier in the year in which the Herald published its article.  On January 7, 1820, the Secretary of the Navy, Smith Thompson, submitted a letter to the House of Representatives regarding any and all information he had on the introduction of slaves into the United States.  The US government required copies of communication about bringing slaves into the country since 1816.  Thompson's letter contained a few short letters he received about suspicious activity on the seas, as well as instructions he had sent in January, 1819, to all the commanding naval officers to make them aware of the illicit activity.  &lt;br /&gt;The Alexandria Herald correctly pointed out that though Northerners began to abolish slavery within their borders and speak out against the institution, it was frequently the shippers and merchants from those same states who engaged in the slave trade.  The moral ideals of the North were undermined by the economic mindset of these traders, looking to profit from illegal slave imports for the South.  The newspaper backed its accusation by reporting a recent capture of a Rhode Island schooner with a full cargo of slaves.  Sectional tension heightened as the frustrated South complained that they [Northerners] can bellow and rave in favor of Missouri restriction in public, and in private employ their wealth and enterprise in this unrighteous business (Alexandria).'"],"display_date":"June 9, 1820","search_date":"1820-06-09","locations":[{"id":14380,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ALEXANDRIA CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1268,"title":"Cotton in the South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-02-11","end_date":"1860-02-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Cotton was one of the largest cash crops in the majority of southern states, but especially dominant in South Carolina.

Railroads were also built more upon the north-south lines as opposed to the existing east and west lines.  Although rivers were helpful, the train was much more efficient for transportation of economic goods.&lt;br /&gt;Among many bills passed was the one passed in the Tennessee Senate incorporating the Mississippi Central and Tennessee Railroad Company.

The ulcer' of abolitionism has pushed the south away from the north, thus it must form other ties.

The Montgomery Advertiser that a conspiracy must be proved against every one of the defendants or every one of them must be acquitted' since they were united by the indictments that it was impossible to separate the verdict. &lt;br /&gt;On August 17, Jeff Carpenter led the defense, particularly for the defendant Brady. He stated that fraud meant getting something out of the government without returning an equivalent in value.'  He argued that a good trade was not fraud, and that a man had the right to make the best bargain he could. Mr. Blias, however, argued on August 18 that there was a large discrepancy between stock annually employed upon the route and the number set out in the contractors' affidavit.' This had then benefited the contractors and was a great loss to the department. &lt;br /&gt;On September 4, the State argued that the trails were never intended for conviction;. Even should the jury find a verdict against them, they would not be punished. New trials would be asked and granted; or the appeals taken would lead to reversals of verdicts.'  Judge Wylie's charged, delivered on September 8, went heavily against the defense at every point, but the verdict satisfied no one, and two of the defendants were acquitted. Klotsche states that the Judge set aside the verdict because of its general unreasonableness,' and because of irregular conduct' of certain jury members on September 15, 1882."],"display_date":"June 1, 1882 - September 8, 1882","search_date":"1882-07-20","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1358,"title":"Northwestern region of Virginia breaks away from the state\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-01","end_date":"1861-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Although Virginia decided to secede from the Union, the northwestern counties of the Allegheny region had different beliefs about the state's actions.

The rigid blockade was established on the Southern coast to affect the seceded states.  The fort at the mouth of Cape Fear river commands the principal part of her trade, as that river is the only one of importance in the State.

Foreign powers due to the strain of importing and exporting could no longer rely on the South as a viable trade partner.  The North retained their ports and Atlantic coast at the time.

The Knights of Labor refused to accept this offer and the great strike' began on March 14, 1882. Edward Ayers explains that the Knights of Labor fought to gain better wages, hours, and working conditions.' The Knights furthermore attacked the concentrations of power and monopolies that dominated the economy. Workers often sought the support of their local Knights of Labor organization to aid them when needed. &lt;br /&gt;On August 22, 1882, the District Assembly and the Knights of Labor had a long session in Frostburg.

The article reported that, indeed, in some cases the organization was successful in obtaining an increase of wages, but almost all the strikers had to continue working under the old wages and the loss of the laborers amounted hundreds of thousands of dollars.' The State stressed that the failure of the strikes were a result of the bad timing of the strikes. At that time, the employers were considering cutting wages because of a general dullness of business and a gloomy outlook for summer trade.'

When McKinley summoned a special congress in 1897, their donations were rewarded with a new tariff.  &lt;br /&gt;Headed by Nelson Dingley, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman from Maine, the Dingley Tariff was shaped around the desires of manufacturers.  On June 7th, the Tariff Bill was passed in the senate by a vote of 38 to 28 in a very heated session.  Senator Tillman, SC, was adamantly against the new tariff bill, calling it the worst bill ever passed.'  Senator Butler, a Populist of North Carolina, refused to vote because he believed the tariff question was being used as a political foot ball by the two old parties'.  Amidst the heated debate, the House passed a revised Tariff Bill on the 19th of July by a vote 185-118.  Senator Tillman again caused great strife in session, threatening a filibuster in the Senate the following day.  Despite all of the negativity and controversy surrounding the bill, on the 25th of July the tariff passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the President, making it a law.    &lt;br /&gt;Under the new tariff, rates reached a new high, averaging 49% and in some cases up to 57%.  The South, in general, was against higher tariffs, because other countries would generally place their own higher tariffs on the cotton and tobacco coming from the South.  An obvious protectionist measure, it resulted in good labor relations for the McKinley administration while farm state representatives who fought to block the new duties lacked the political clout to substantiate a formidable response.  In fact, the act was so protectionist in the eyes of many Republicans that they sought cover behind other issues in hopes of turning the public's eye away from the tariff. Democrats, on the other hand, claimed that the high rates created monopolies.  In general however, the new tariff did not affect larger products such as steel or iron but rather was highest on the necessities of life.  Not until the passage of the Payne-Aldrich Tariff in 1909 would the tariff be overturned, when the Taft administration came under intense scrutiny to lower the rates for fear of monopolization."],"display_date":"July 24, 1897","search_date":"1897-07-24","locations":[{"id":6082,"lat":39.603674835,"lng":-77.8141711851,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1419,"title":"Meeting and debate over future of the Petersburg Railroads\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-02-11","end_date":"1878-02-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The evening of February 11, 1878, many concerned citizens of Petersburg, Virginia met to discuss the future of the Petersburg Railroad.

Under this system, private businesses could lease convicts for a small fee.  Tennessee adopted this system as a way to deal with the rising prison population and to help relieve the burden of its state debt.  In 1884, the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company leased the state penitentiary.  The system caused many free laborers to lose their jobs and work for cheaper wages.  In addition, the conditions that the prisoners lived in were atrocious.  Much sickness, suffering, and starvation prevailed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opposition to the convict lease system soon developed.

By 1830, prices had bottomed out in at 9 cents per pound, and Southerners searching for the cause narrowed in on Federal tariffs, specifically the Tariff of 1828. Newspapers such as the Charleston Mercury on August 3 argued that the tariff resulted in the annihilation of commerce' which would of necessity produce an annihilation of our means of naval defense' as well. This perception of the effects of the Tariff, though controversial, is what most impacted the Southern political identity, especially in South Carolina.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight of the argument came with Congressman George McDuffie of South Carolina's 40 Bale Theory, which argued that a 40% tariff on imported finished cotton good resulted in a 40% increase in price to consumers. He thought that this in turn caused a 40% decrease in US sales of imported finished cotton good, which meant a 40% decrease in the demand for raw cotton abroad and thus a 40% decrease in income for planters. In an April 26, 1830, speech before the House of Representatives, reprinted in the Richmond Enquirer on June 1, McDuffie asks for the same reason, therefore, that a duty upon the exports of cotton cannot raise the price of that cotton in the British markets, a duty upon the imports of British merchandise cannot depress the price of that merchandise in those markets?' In other words, the American tariff can only hurt Americans. It does nothing to effect Britain's sale prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 40 Bale perception, therefore, means that although the restrictive federal tariff may protect U.S. industry to some degree, it directly hurts U.S. planters and consumers as a whole -- an idea that is based in what is now known to be economic reality. In addition, though, the Tariff was a major part of the Federal tax income, an income which Congress was attempting to spend on controversial internal improvements such as roads and canals. This, then, only helped fuel anger over the Tariff and what from hindsight can be seen as the growing sectional debate over the proper role of the Federal government."],"display_date":"April 6, 1830","search_date":"1830-04-06","locations":[{"id":11653,"lat":33.8522812111,"lng":-80.2797613977,"zoom":8,"place":"SUMTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1441,"title":"Tennessee Internal Improvements Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-02","end_date":"1830-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 2, 1830, the state of Tennessee passed an Act to establish a board of Internal Improvement, and set apart one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to be appropriated to the improvement of the navigable rivers and other objects of Internal Improvement in (the) state,' as reported by the Knoxville Register on January 27, to be divided on various works across the state. Designed mostly to make the Tennessee River passable to shipping, this appropriation was a tremendous endeavor for a state which had existed for only thirty-five years and was still very much an undeveloped and sparsely settled frontier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, the government of Tennessee was beginning to recognize the importance of developing an efficient and usable infrastructure network not only to improve trade and the flow of goods, but also to improve communication. By clearing the Tennessee River and building roads and canals in other parts of the state, Tennessee not only improved its internal trade and communication, but it also more firmly link itself to the Mississippi River network. This network was an integral part of the U.S. economy as it stretched from New Orleans up through the frontier to the Ohio River Valley, the Northwest, and even the Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence River, and eventually the Atlantic Ocean. By linking themselves to this network, Tennessee ensured not only an increase in the flow of goods and information, but a strengthening of bonds with the United States as a whole. Indeed, the Raleigh Register takes note of this Act on January 28, 1830, declaring it of very considerable importance, inasmuch as it will give an impulse to public enterprise.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This developmental sentiment was representative of the U.S. as a whole as well. In Virginia, for example, a letter from residents of Staunton to the General Assembly desired to incorporate(e) a Company, with the usual powers of a Turnpike Company' to construct a road from Staunton to intersect the Ohio and Chesapeake Canal.' However, acts such as that in Tennessee were overshadowed by a national debate on the proper role of the Federal government in development. Specifically, President Andrew Jackson contended that the Federal government did not have to right to invest in state projects such as those in Tennessee or the construction of the Maysville Road because it would give the Federal government too much control in local affairs. Thus, it was up to the states to conduct such improvement internally, making Tennessee's bill could be construed as an early precursor to this debate."],"display_date":"January 2, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-02","locations":[{"id":11951,"lat":36.1806707867,"lng":-86.8728574445,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1445,"title":"Maysville Road Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-05-22","end_date":"1830-05-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One of the most controversial Acts of its time, the Maysville Road act authorizing the purchase of 50,000 worth of stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Company, otherwise known as the National, or Cumberland, Road. To begin with, the road itself, or what was actually built of it, was a significant advance in construction technology. The four mile stretch that was constructed between Maysville and Washington, Kentucky as was a macadamized' road which was passable in virtually any weather conditions, and greatly reduced freight costs by allowing for heavier loads. Its fifty foot width involved innovative construction techniques such as drainage ditches, and marked a step forward in internal improvement technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project, however, had far more important national implications because there was a Constitutional question as to whether the Federal government could invest in a private corporation. Though Congress clearly believed the Federal government should encourage internal development this way, many Southerners believed that such investment was an infringement on states' rights because it would give the Federal government too much direct control. The Richmond Enquirer, for instance, wrote on May 25, 1830, that they do most religiously hope (President Jackson) will sign this Maysville Road Bill.' The Inquirer was therefore enthused to print Jackson's message to Congress on June 1, 1830, in which he return(ed) to the House of Representatives the enrolled bill.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President Jackson's reasoning in vetoing the Maysville Road Bill is fairly straightforward, yet lay at the heart of the controversy at the time over the proper role of the Federal versus the state governments and the respective powers of each. In a later letter to Congress, reprinted in The Globe on December 7, 1830, Jackson writes that if the interest of the Government in private companies is subordinate to that of individuals, the management and control of a portion of the public funds is;.. beyond the supervision of our constituents.' Yet, at the same time, Jackson points out that the power which the Central Government would acquire within the several States by becoming the principal stockholder in corporations;. is almost inconceivable, and, in my view, dangerous.'

These links were vital in the pre-railroad era of 1830, because although railroads existed the U.S. was still very much a riparian economy. Thus, linking itself to this network not only improved shipping costs and speed throughout the region, but it also linked the local economy much more firmly into the national and international markets. This allowed for the flow of imports and exports, as well as the better communication of ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Louisville-Portland canal, however, was also an example of the great controversy at the time concerning the role of the Federal government in Internal Improvements. The Canal, which was constructed and run by a private company, included Federal investments which President Andrew Jackson called the first erroneous step ;..

On June 30, 1892, a three-year contract with the National Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers expired.  The Carnegie Steel Company, managed at this time by Henry Clay Frick, attempted to cut the wages of the skilled steel workers.  When the workers refused the pay cut, the entire work force was locked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frick called in strikebreakers to work and Pinkerton agents to protect them.  On July 6, an army of 300 Pinkertons arrived.  Union and non-union workers joined forces against the Pinkertons.  The ensuing battle lasted thirteen hours, with the Pinkertons surrendering to the workers.  Several strikers and Pinkerton men died in the fight, and many others were wounded.  The state militia was called out to weaken the union forces and restore order.  This initial battle was a victory for the strikers and encouraged other strikers around the nation to take action.  As a result, strikes occurred at Coeur d'Alene in Idaho, at the mines in Tennessee, at New Orleans in Louisiana, and in the city of New York.  These strikes demonstrated the unrest among workers in the age of industrial progress.  Many workers felt that slavery had not ended it had just taken a different form.  Workers toiled for long hours in poor conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 20, the Homestead strike was finally declared over.  The army of strikers had given up the fight, and the Carnegie Steel Company resumed operations without the union.  This strike was one of the most disastrous in the history of the United States.  It involved nearly ten thousand men at one time.  The loss of wages amounted to approximately 2,000,000, and the loss of the firm was estimated at nearly double that.  Thirty-five deaths were caused by the strike.  Following this event, there was a lack of labor activism for decades."],"display_date":"June 30, 1892 - November 20, 1892","search_date":"1892-09-09","locations":[{"id":1279,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1459,"title":"Rate war begins among southern railroads\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-08-13","end_date":"1892-08-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After Reconstruction ended, the South began to rapidly construct railroads.

The Trail, which was an overland trade route between St. Louis, Missouri, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, was critical to the growing economy of Missouri. It had resulted in a tremendous amount of trade through the mid-West, and had also spurred new industries such as wagon construction in Missouri. Indian attacks on caravans posed a major threat to the route, however, and threatened to disrupt it entirely. Senator Benton's bill therefore sought to secure federal protection for the area and had important implications in the development of US Western and Indian policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bill shows, as well, overarching national sentiments on Indians and the problems of state governments trying to assert their sovereignty over Indian territories. In The Globe, for example, a December 14, 1830, section entitled Missouri Politics includes an address by Missouri Governor Miller in which he states that the citizens of Missouri have already been greatly harassed by the depredations of Indians,' yet that the ground (the Indians) occupy is not attached to any county, and hence State officers cannot act in relation to the offences committed upon it.' The Governor goes on to declare the situation manifestly inconsistent with the sovereignty and policy of the State' and to call for the Federal government to ensure state sovereignty within their borders, including Indian territories within existing states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The situation in Missouri, in addition to representing a large threat to local stability and to the local economy, also represents a much larger movement in the United States of states demanding the right to sovereignty within their recognized borders. Eventually, this results in the Indian Removal Act enacted on May 28, 1830, which allows for the relocation of Indian tribes to unorganized territory west of the Mississippi River, and which inherently recognizes states' rights within their borders."],"display_date":"March 13, 1830","search_date":"1830-03-13","locations":[],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1477,"title":"Hatch Act of 1887\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-03-02","end_date":"1887-03-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During and after the Civil War, many farms and ranches were without the man power needed to cultivate the land.  William Henry Hatch of Missouri joined forces with Norman J. Coleman to create legislation that would promote all aspects of agriculture.  The Martinsburg Gazette reported that President Grover Cleveland approved the famous Hatch Act on March, 2 1887,' which created agricultural experiment stations in each state.  At these experiment stations, scientists worked with farmers, ranchers, suppliers, and processors to promote better food production at faster rates.  Also, the bill created an executive department to be known as the Department of Agriculture and Labor.  One of [the amendments] provides for the transfer of the Bureau of Labor to the proposed new department,' stated the Martinsburg Gazette.  After the agriculture department received cabinet status, weekly bulletins were issued to farmers free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;Before the Morrill Act of 1862, little attention had been given to education as a means of developing better agricultural methods,' describes McReynolds about the effects of the Hatch Act, but by 1900, schools began adopting agriculture in their curricula.  This helped spread agricultural knowledge to the younger generations and assisted current farmers with new techniques and machines as the farming industry rapidly grew.  Campbell expresses how the stations stimulated agricultural growth in Texas by saying, The Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, established in 1887, researched every aspect of agriculture in [Texas] in an effort to increase production, lower costs, and expand markets.'  As a result of combining and expanding the agriculture industry, many people no longer had to live in poverty or eat meagerly because American agriculture had been revolutionized.

The letters, sent by a number of farmers expressed concerns over the delay of the railroad construction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The farmers worried over two possible delays. The first resulted from the recent state appropriation of 500,000 to the building of the railroad. As a condition for the money, the Tennessee General Assembly appointed new Directors for the Railroad Company. Farmers worried the new Directors would cause disruption, and delay construction. Financial provision for the railroad created the second problem. The farmers recognised that Tennessee suffered from an economic depression, like many ex-Confederate states, yet urged that the line be completed before the harvest of 1867. Although the state had appropriated money, not enough had been provided to complete the line in time. The farmers urged the state Directors to postpone the building of machine shops, so that the 20,000 could be used to finish the railroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The farmers' concern for the railroad construction came from their livelihoods' dependence on the railroad. It connected them to the markets in the big consumer centres across the United States, especially to the large consumer population on the East coast. If the railroad remained incomplete by harvest their crops would not be sold, but wasted, and their chances of provision lost. The worries of the farmers further reflected the importance of the railroad, which began to experience a post-war boom, continuing until 1916. It opened up further land that had been inaccessible, due to the lack of transportation for goods, for agricultural use. Farmers in these areas depended on the railroad to make a living, for without it they could not send their produces to be sold."],"display_date":"April 9, 1867 - May 1, 1867","search_date":"1867-04-20","locations":[{"id":12156,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1483,"title":"President of The National Bank of Atlanta investigates Georgia&#39;s gold specimens\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-03-13","end_date":"1867-04-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During March and April, 1867, John Rice, the President of the National Bank of Atlanta arrived in the Cherokee Gold Belt of Georgia to investigate the quality of recently mined minerals. He declared the beauty and high value of the gold and quartz specimen qualities. Rice's arrival in the Gold Belt reflected the rapidly growing interest in the mining of minerals in Georgia. Many had declared Georgia mineral rich, and resulted in much interest from many areas. Since the Civil War, the investment of 10 million had already provided for the cost of 400,000 for flumes, and the development in new hydraulic mining techniques. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gold Belt spanned the distance of 300 miles from the boarder of Alabama to the Carolinas. People had known about the presence of gold, silver, copper, and other valuable minerals since 1829 when John Witheroods had discovered gold in Georgia, which resulted in thousands of intruders on Cherokee land. The Gold Rush in Georgia resulted in the establishment of a mint at Dablonega, but the Civil War brought its destruction. The Gold Rush had gradually died out because primitive mining methods failed to reach the inexhaustible mineral supplies other than those easily accessible. Slaves had done most the mining by hand, but with the end of slavery and the need for investment, new mining technology developed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eagerness to develop mining in Georgia resulted from the poor state of the post-Civil War economy. Although many still placed hope in the revival of cotton farming, the cotton fields lacked much opportunity. Georgia, hit with economic depression in 1867 and a bad cotton crop, had no means to pay war indemnity, taxes and the high level of personal and public debt, or to reinstate itself into the market economy. People hoped the mining of minerals would bring economic revival, as mines would provide jobs and investment, pulling Georgia, especially the poor people of the mountains, out of their backward, impoverished state. The revival in mining did succeed in bringing millions of dollars of investment. Atlanta, especially prospered from it. As the natural outlet for the mining region, Atlanta established the new mint, and saw the development of 3000 houses, and a population growth of 30,000.  However, despite the romantic hopes of everyday men simply waking up to find 50,000 worth of gold, the gold mining in Georgia failed to help the poor, but helped the rich get richer."],"display_date":"March 13, 1867 - April 16, 1867","search_date":"1867-03-30","locations":[{"id":1526,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1488,"title":"Birmingham&#39;s Great Day\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-07-22","end_date":"1897-07-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the 22nd of July, 1897, the first successful run of steel was accomplished in Birmingham, Alabama.

According to the May 4th edition of The Louisville Journal, this line would be the fifth, and the first one started south of Baltimore, across the continent from the Atlantic to Pacific.' The Journal heralded the new route as, probably among the most valuable and important enterprises of the progressive age in which we live...and an additional channel through which the vast west can be stimulated to pour out its products in this direction.'&lt;br /&gt;The Baltimore and Ohio Railway, founded by a group of Baltimore merchants, was the first in the nation to offer regular rail service to the American public starting on July 4, 1828.

With only about 5% of the total world population, the country was constructing new railways faster than the rest of the world combined. The Revolution in transportation systems was incredibly important to the history of the American nation. Although canals would persist in certain areas, railroads became the main transportation method.

In practice, the bank prided itself in extending its services to black citizens from all walks of life rather than pandering to the black middle class. By preaching such a philosophy, the bank served to go beyond its original purposes , it unified the black community socially as well as economically.

On Election Day 1884, the Mugwumps were credited with giving Cleveland the slim majority he needed for victory. Four years later, however, the Mugwumps were much smaller in number.

During the convention, the party decided to take a strong line against tariffs, an issue that had divided the country for nearly a century. Southern states across the board saw tariffs as detrimental to their predominately agricultural economies. Tariffs acted as barriers to free trade, lowering the international market demand for the South's products. In committing himself to reducing tariffs, Cleveland nonetheless put himself at risk.

The focus of the first assembly was primarily financial, because with the combined effects of the Panic of 1819 and the increasing state population, there was not enough money in circulation to meet demand.  &lt;br /&gt;The legislature created an act that provided for a state bank with a two million dollar capital.

An outgrowth of the Grange Movement, the Alliance endeavored to solve the economic woes of the agricultural community through collective action, with the ultimate object of having their products marketed at more profitable prices.  Nevertheless, membership in the early years was surprisingly dismal.  However, under the leadership of President W.L. Garvin and his colleague S.O. Daws, the Alliance was able to draw roughly 600 delegates to the 1885 convention, an increase of 300% from the previous year. At the convention, the Alliance mandated the establishment of trade committees throughout the region, empowered with the task of ensuring low prices for their supplies from local merchants in return for their patronage, as well as committees of correspondence charged with guaranteeing pooled sales of the farmers' commodities on certain business days.  &lt;br /&gt;In the convention which occurred next year at the same location, the delegates issued an even more set of seventeen demands , dubbed the Cleburne Demands' , including the uniform coinage of gold and silver, the state's recognition of trade unions, a more equitable lien law, state laws requiring that workers be paid on time and with cash and not scrip, the eradication of convict leasing, and a national convention of all labor organizations.  This platform proved to be quite divisive and almost permanently divided the convention, if it were not for the leadership of Charles W. Macune, who would go on to take a prominent role in the Alliance movement in the ensuing years.  Moreover, the platform he and the other delegates championed at the convention would help spread this movement throughout the South.&lt;br /&gt;Observation of the Constitution of the National's Farmer's Alliance, crafted in 1890, sheds a little bit more light on the principles that these organizations espoused and their administration on the national scale.  The document states broadly that it intends to promote the education of the agricultural class, prosperity for what it calls the toiling masses,' proper compensation for labor, and a just exchange of agricultural commodities.  Although it does craft a tripartite separation of powers within its national government much like the actual federal Constitution, it more significantly details the relationship between the national organization and its counterparts in the states.  Qualifications for being chartered as a state organization included having seven participating county organizations, having a distinct and non-conflicting constitution of their own, and acknowledging the supremacy of the national organization and its constitution.  Similar to the Tenth Amendment to the federal Constitution, the document mandates that all powers not explicitly given to the National Alliance would be reserved for the states' individual organizations."],"display_date":"August 4, 1885","search_date":"1885-08-04","locations":[{"id":12918,"lat":32.3790149365,"lng":-97.3663344715,"zoom":9,"place":"JOHNSON, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1588,"title":"Cowford &#40;Jacksonville&#41; Formally Becomes US Territory\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-12-01","end_date":"1820-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Following the War of 1812, Isaiah D. Hart was living on a farm near the St. Mary's River in Florida.  Learning of the early successes of some small stores opened by white settlers near the Ferry Crossing on the St. John's River, Hart envisioned great potential for the area.  Making perhaps the most profitable decision of his life, in late 1820 Hart purchased what was then known as Cowford from settler L.Z. Hogans, trading cattle for the 18 acres of land.  At the time of Hart's acquisition, the population of Florida, without counting Native-Americans, did not exceed 12,000.   &lt;br /&gt;Because the Floridas were of interest to many other Southerners as well as Hart, Georgia's Southern Recorder provided a thorough description of the territory in an August 15, 1820 article.  The editor gave a precise explanation of the size and location of Florida for the many readers without access to a map or any other geographical background.  The Recorder primarily discussed the two major cities in Florida at the time, Pensacola and St. Augustine, but the article also went into detail about the agricultural advantages offered by Florida as a whole.  Although the soil was sandy, near rivers and lakes planters produced sugar, cotton, potatoes, corn, indigo, groundpeas, melons, plums, and many other goods.  Settlers found immense red and white oaks;mulberry, hickory, sassafras,' and typical animals such as horses, sheep, goats, cattle and swine, and in the deserts, otters, hares, rabbits, raccoons, and foxes (Southern Recorder).' &lt;br /&gt;The opportunity for economic growth in the Floridas, described by this and many other newspapers, provided the incentive for Hart's investment in Cowford.  The town lay in a valuable location in the northeast part of the territory and near a few bodies of water.  Hart built a boardinghouse and store, which soon became the heart of Jacksonville and made him a wealthy merchant and planter.  The city was incorporated in 1832, and once Florida became a state in 1845, it served as an important port specifically for timber and cotton trades.

Floridians followed suit when, in the same year, representatives from the Florida legislature presented a bill proposing a tax upon all voters. Though the legislature did not unanimously support the bill, they finally passed and fully enacted it a year later.

Indeed, convention delegates laid the groundwork for the transition from a special-interests coalition into a significant political platform. Yet, at the same time, their hesitancy underscores the reasons for the eventual downfall of the Populist Party.

This proclamation triggered deep resentment among cotton farmers in the South, who were already struggling because of the oppressive crop-lien system. Raising the price of an essential component to cotton-picking, the jute bag, was adding insult to injury. Farmers Alliances across the South saw the need for a regional convention, and organized one in Birmingham later that year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the convention, farmers discussed three major issues: the state of cotton manufacturing in the South, the need for a permanent organization representing agricultural interests (a predecessor to the Populist Party), and the use of cotton rather than jute bags. The convention produced few answers on the first two issues, which would be more clearly addressed in a convention in Augusta, Georgia the following year. However, the leaders of the convention did urge their fellow farmers to use cotton bags. Their determination to boycott jute eventually forced the jute manufacturers to back down in 1889, concluding one of the few significant victories for the early Populist movement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several politicians took advantage of the situation and expressed their support for the farmers' cause. Most prominent among these were Richard F. Kolb, a county commissioner. He distinguished himself as an advocate for cotton farmers, and the positive publicity gave him momentum for a run for the Governor's seat in 1890. However, by election time, Populist support had declined considerably.

The Union's control meant the freeing of slaves.  This led to a shortage of agricultural labor and a scarcity of resources.

As a doctor early in his life, Linn had seen thousands of cases of dysentery, malaria and other diseases that resulted from life along the Mississippi river. In low-water seasons, the outbreak of diseases increased as blockages in the river forced white and blacks alike to suffer with stagnation and mosquitoes; limited transport along the tributary waterways prevented medicine from reaching affected areas. The blockages accumulated during the low-water seasons of 1839-1843 described by Linn were so great as to render navigation not only dangerous in extreme to commerce but hazardous to the health.","Lewis Linn strove to make changes for his patients' health as well as his own after a series of illnesses he suffered in 1839. With the sudden death of the Missouri senator, Linn would realize his goal when nominated to the position. Linn realized, however, that to garner appropriations to clear out sandbars, large bulk and swampland from major waterways needed a stronger base than health-care reports. Linn worked alongside fifteen hundred St. Louis-area executives and presented a petition to Congress to battle those appropriations that were always strenuously, and sometimes successfully opposed, and the objects intended to be accomplished were never more than half accomplished.","Lewis Linn's work with executives strengthened his argument of the need for change, in both mercantilism and the health of those along the Mississippi. Linn cited the total loss of 3 million dollars in goods and boats along these waterways which were vital to much of the southern-and indirectly northern-trade and commerce. The enormous economic losses for the South and other ports nationwide sparked movement within Congress. As Linn fought to secure money, he created a promising outlook for a large-scale river project. Unfortunately, Linn's sudden death while in office in 1843 left his own efforts unrewarded when legislators failed to garner enough votes for appropriations. "," Yet, his legacy to push for better economic conditions carried to the next group of southern congressional representatives. Businessmen and legislators alike realized the importance of re-tooling the environmental and economic congressional committees not only for the health of their constituents-and their consumer base-but to facilitate faster, more efficient shipping nationwide. Whether or not the government granted appropriations to clear the river ways ultimately affected more than just transportation; the health of the rivers in large part created the success or failure of commerce for the national economy."],"display_date":"January 17, 1843","search_date":"1843-01-17","locations":[{"id":7916,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1962,"title":"Counterfeit Bank Notes\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-03-25","end_date":"1817-03-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser </em>of Easton, Maryland printed an article titled Citizens, Beware of Counterfeiters on March 25, 1817.

","Counterfeiters significantly threatened the efficient development of the American economy. For the merchants of Easton, failure to recognize counterfeit notes resulted in substantial financial losses. In terms of their customers, it meant the loss of one's reputation as a trustworthy vendor. Attempts made by Congress to create a sound currency clashed with the cherished belief held by many Americans that the federal government should have a limited role in the nation. According to historian David R. Johnson, the federal government reserved the right to coin money but neither institution that Congress created, the US Mint and the Bank of the United States, exerted much control over national development. "," Counterfeiters gained a tremendous advantage with the development and proliferation of state banks such as the Union Bank of Maryland. Due to the Mint's failure to produce enough coin for the rapidly expanding economy, Johnson claims that state banks began to compete with the Mint as a monetary source by issuing their own currency. State governments chartered privately owned banks, and granted them the right to issue currency backed by each bank's capital reserves. State Banks claimed that their bank notes did not violate the federal government's currency policy since the states neither directly issued these banks notes nor supported them with their credit. Counterfeiting became far easier with the increase of paper money in circulation. <em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> newspaper article stated, we look to our police, on this occasion, for such vigilance as may bring the whole of these wretches to justice.

Gall brought ice to the homes of his customers in a horse-drawn wagon. Gall delivered ice daily to his customers who could afford to pay for the service. Gall advertised the options of a weekly or monthly subscription in the <em>American Beacon and Commercial Daily</em>. The American people quickly picked up on the amazing benefits of refrigeration, and Gall became one of thousands of men involved in the rapidly growing ice industry. Technological advances in refrigeration allowed for the development of the ice industry."," Gall received his ice from companies that harvested across the vast regions of North America. These regions experienced winters capable of freezing lakes and rivers solid. According to historian Gavan Weightman, companies checked the thickness of the ice after two or three weeks of subzero weather. Men harvested the ice once it froze to 18 inches; a depth that supported the weight of hundreds of men and horses. Men wore cork soles that allowed them to grip the ice, and fitted their horses with spiked shoes. Competing companies that worked on the same river or lake carefully observed boundaries pertaining to ownership. Men marked out the ice after clearing the snow on top to expose the ice surface. To mark the ice, men steered iron cutters drawn by teams of two horses across the surface. These men created a network of parallel lines that divided the area into squares. Horse-drawn plows with metal teeth cut deep enough into the groves that permitted men to pry the blocks free using long-handled chisels. Weightman claims that channels of free flowing water coaxed the giant ice blocks to a mechanism that hoisted them into timber icehouses. Blocks slid down chutes and men hauled them into stacks. These men put sawdust between and around the ice blocks to act as insulation. The discovery that sawdust could act as insulation allowed for the growth of the ice industry beginning in 1820."," Wagons draw by teams of horses or oxen carried ice from the timber houses to ports in nearby towns. Weightman claims that from these locations steamboats carried ice to large ice warehouses in city centers. The technological advances in steamboats, largely in part due to the development of the condensing engine, allowed for much faster transportation of ice."," Gall brought his wagon to the Portsmouth warehouse each morning to receive his supply of ice to deliver to his customers. The favored size of ice cube varied depending upon the location that companies transported the ice to. The size of ice cubes that Gall delivered to his customers in Portsmouth resembled that of a New-York sized ice cube of twenty-two square inches. In Portsmouth households, people kept blocks of ice cut to a standard size in what they called refrigerators or iceboxes. These refrigerators were predominantly built of wood and lined with metal. The technology of iceboxes created a way for Americans to store ice, thus increasing the demand for the valuable commodity.

Rice posted an advertisement in <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em> titled <em>Wool Wanted</em>. Rice claimed that cash will be paid for good, clean wool. In the expanding population of the early nineteenth century the demand for woolen cloth kept well ahead of its productive capacity. In response to the increased demand for wool, a boom in mill construction occurred across America. According to James A. Morris, southern mills had no advantage in raw wool production over the North. Instead, their competitive edge resulted from lower wages created by the presence of slavery that bolstered the economy. "," Virginians used four basic types of mills. According to Morris, in undershoot wheels water flowed against the bottom of the wheel. Undershot wheels depended upon the use of dam and a dependable stream volume. The overshot wheel used a flume or race that brought water against the top of the wheel. Breast wheels received water above the axis. Water set pitchback wheels into motion by running against the back of the wheel. Nature dictated where Virginians built their mills. Men constructed mills wherever a creek had a ten-foot drop or sufficient flow to sustain a dam or millrace. Most mills produced less than forty horsepower since power depended upon water flow multiplied by the height of the fall. Morris claims that mill owners most commonly used the high-breast design. Unless mills used a large wheel, only 60 percent of the streams power could be used. Water proved to be an unreliable source of power, mainly due to droughts and floods. As a result, wool production could not keep up with demand because the South did not have sufficient resources to produce the valuable commodity."," In addition, problems with the insufficient supply of wool resulted from a minimal supply of sheep. The increased market for vegetable and dairy products pushed sheep into grazing lands of the West. Americans used Merino sheep, the only breed of sheep present in America that produced quality wool. However, these sheep required a large amount of grazing land. The other types of sheep present in America in 1821 produced coarse wool that created undesirable, poor quality fabric. Problems also resulted from a lack of effective transportation to carry wool from grazing lands in the West back to cities in the South. The demand for wool exemplified a recurrent problem in the South at the time of Rice's advertisement; the South lacked a sufficient supply of resources to meet the demands of its growing population.

The Maryland accommodated passengers, horses and carriages. The advertisement posted in <em>The Maryland Gazette</em> on April 6, 1820 targeted potential customers by stating that the <em>Maryland </em>is not surpassed in point of elegance or speed by any boat in the United Sates. Customers had to decide whether their preferences laid in paying higher fairs and getting to their destination faster or lower fares with longer travel time. Steamboat companies competed with each other to have the most customers, and often posted advertisements in the local newspapers. Steamboats provided the endless tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay with essential economic and social links to supporting cities of the region."," Steamboat companies on the Chesapeake Bay faced tough competition. Businesses constantly strived to produce engines with increasingly greater power and efficiency. The potential to make large profits existed in the steamboat business, and companies desired to have steamboats with the greatest speed. The <em>Maryland </em>used a condensing engine to increase its power. According to historian David C. Holly, in condensing engines steam discharged from the cylinder after it pushed the piston and entered into the condenser. Once in the condenser, jets of cold water pumped from the Chesapeake Bay condensed the steam into water, and this condensate became the source of water to replenish the boiler. Holly claims that the use of condensing engines prevented the chance of a boiler explosion that often occurred in non-condensing engines. In addition, condensing engines saved engineers up to several hours because they would not have to scrape the boilers and related piping to remove salt scales that formed in non-condensing engines. "," Steamboats played a significant role on the Mississippi as well as in the Chesapeake Bay. Steamboats acted as a means to effectively and efficiently transport goods to towns along the waterways. The <em>Maryland</em>, in addition to other steamboats on the Chesapeake, differed from steamboats on the Mississippi. Holly claims that on the Mississippi, steam exhausted into the atmosphere produced an explosive sound, unlike the quiet engine of steamboats on the Chesapeake that used condensing engines. On Chesapeake steamboats, both side wheels turned together, propelled form the piston that traveled up and down from a single cylinder as a source of power. Chesapeake steamboats displayed a feminine sheer, well proportioned cabin and deck space, and single smoke stacks unlike Mississippi steamboats that had raft like hulls, twin stacks and minimal deck space. Steamboats greatly contributed to the development of tidewater Maryland and Virginia, in addition to waterways all across America. Steamboats provided the endless tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay with essential economic and social links to supporting cities of the region. They served a role that could not have been accomplished by any other means in the early nineteenth century."],"display_date":"August 28, 1817 - August 29, 1817","search_date":"1817-08-28","locations":[{"id":5918,"lat":39.087394033,"lng":-76.4791169961,"zoom":9,"place":"ANNE ARUNDEL, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1967,"title":"Bank Notes: The Second Bank of the United States\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1823-03-07","end_date":"1823-03-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William Booth Taliaferro, a resident of Norfolk, Virginia sent a letter on March 7, 1823 to Mr. Richards, the manager of finances of the George Washington Estate of Westmoreland County, Virginia. In the letter, Taliaferro informed Richards that he received the manager's previous letter enclosed with a check. In Richards's previous letter, he made the check to Taliaferro for 840 dollars. According to Taliaferro, Richards's letter contained a request to have the notes converted into funds current with Taliaferro's banks. In order to make use of the check that Taliaferro received from the George Washington Estate, he needed to convert the money into funds current with banks in Norfolk. This required Taliaferro to visit to his local state chartered bank. State banks acted as commercial enterprises; profit-seeking privately owned institutions that created cash deposits payable in legal tender on demand. According to historian Robert Buckley Tanner, state banks financial success depended on their ability to keep their own notes in circulation, or else they had to rely solely on the assets of their stockholders and depositors. Thus, state banks fought to keep their competitors notes out of circulation. Neither Taliaferro nor Richards wrote of any doubts they had in their local banks ability to convert notes. However, Tanner claims southerners as a whole tended to assert that the power of banks gave an unnatural privilege to the government. Southerners believed this unnatural privilege imperiled both the independence of the community and the control they had over their own affairs. "," In 1823, the year of correspondence between Taliaferro and Richards, Americans experienced a change in the national banking system; Nicholas Biddle became head of the Second Bank of the United States (BUS). Biddle convinced his board of directors to allow him to authorize the issuance of five and ten dollar drafts. Historian Robert V. Remini claims BUS prepared the drafts in Philadelphia in blank, and then distributed them to the branches of BUS. The branches endorsed the drafts 'payable to bearer' and issued them according to their needs. The drafts easily passed as money, because they looked like bank notes in design, color and texture. Biddle presented the paper of state banks for redemption in specie at the same time BUS issued the drafts. According to Remini, this allowed Biddle to drive the depreciated currencies out of circulation, and provide the country with a relatively safe and uniform currency. Conflicts over the banking system led to tensions between the North and South. Congress built the main office of BUS in Philadelphia, and southerners had no difficulty branding BUS a northern institution that benefited mainly northern financial interests. To southerners, the bank brought out their fears of an oppressive central authority, and the necessity for local control to protect liberty.

The companies believe that the change is both practical and desirable. They say that with an oil-run machine, fewer stops will be necessary on long trips and services such as the fast mail will be greatly improved, and have been conducting experiments to test the new technology at Aurora (probably Illinois). Thus, the coal miners' strike indirectly helped force railroad companies into a line-of-thought that will eventually help revolutionize the fuel industry."," Because of its entrenchment in the mining industry, citizens of small valley or mining counties could have a significant effect on the economy of a larger area as well as influence the progression of technology.

With the decline of the economy following Grover Cleveland's election and his repealing of the Sherman Silver Purchase act, his Democratic base began to falter, and the Populist Party support of the free coinage of silver began to invade much of the Democratic Party. An article written on January 16, 1895, in Clarke County, Virginia's, Clarke Courier attacked these Democrats, who have more love for populist teachings than a wise and economic administration of public affairs. The newspaper recognized the great threat that these party dissidents posed to the security of the Party, writing that though the group is a minority, they still have the power to cause the majority to yield to its dictation. The paper holds that this new free silver coinage party will fail just as the greenbackers had decades before. "," The hard-line Democratic loyalists, that is, the Democrats loyal to Cleveland, claimed that Cleveland is the subject of ridicule and criticism due to his unshakable belief in the gold standard. They couldn't believe the idea that some of their own Party members would believe that a free silver coinage system would work; they believed that the United States was too big a place in the world to adopt such a financial policy. What the paper failed to recognize, however, was the extent of the power free-silver Democrats and of the Populist Party. Perhaps the political writers of the paper were in denial, or perhaps they genuinely didn't see it coming. However, in the election of the following year, the Democratic Party (as predicted by the article) yielded to the free silver Democrats under William Jennings Bryan, but fell to the Republican's solid gold standard in part due to the confusion that the Party's platform created in attempting to cater to hard-line Democrats, free-silver Democrats, and even Populists. This confusion and split in the Party affected even the 1894 Congressional election, where Democratic Party fell to the Republicans' 150,000 vote majority. As the split between the Democratic Party widened and the Populist Party remained a threat, the strife between the sections only worsened and the Republican victory in 1896 was virtually assured.","Date: January 16, 1895","Location: Berryville, Clarke County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Economy, Government, Law, Politics","Episode Scope: Local, Regional, National","Clarke Courier, January 16, 1895.

Over twenty years (1880-1900), southern iron output increased from 397,000 tons to close to 2 million tons. Thus, the interest Southerners may have had in building more ships with which to trade seems very reasonable, almost natural. The desire to enlarge the shipbuilding industry in the United States stemmed from the desire to put more American raw materials on a global scale in larger quantities, and the South with its rapidly growing industries was particularly interested in this. The South was a huge source of natural resources for the country, its goods ranging from timber, minerals, and of course, the many agricultural products that were produced in huge quantities during that time (cotton, grains, livestock goods, etc.). With a powerful merchant marine (and even more significantly, a Southern-based merchant marine) these myriad goods could be transported more efficiently and in larger quantities to any foreign buyer. The stronger merchant marine may even be beneficial during wartime, which it proved to be in World War I as the United States used the Europeans' war as a huge source of income. As money continued to pour into the South, the desire to expand its trade increased as well.","Date: March 3, 1899","Location: Christianburg, Montgomery County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Agriculture, Economy, Urban Life/Boosterism","Episode Scope: Local, State, Regional, National","Montgomery Messenger, March 3, 1899.

The Montgomery Messenger, of Montgomery County, Virginia recognized this fact and in an article written on Friday, August 23, 1895, the writer discussed the benefits of a good roads convention. The convention was meant to be statewide and one delegate from each county was expected to attend; thus the event was of statewide significant importance, most especially to farmers and industrialists who wanted to get their materials across the state more efficiently. Furthermore, everyone interested in improving the state's roads was invited. The article goes on to explain that the State Good Roads Association had been very active in improving the infrastructure of the state, and that citizens of the state have every reason to feel satisfied and encouraged with the results of the association's work. The paper estimated (though the accuracy of this statement cannot truly be determined) that some 90% of the population believes in the importance of good roads. The article also went so far as to say that the remaining 10% would agree, if they simply thought about it for a moment. In addition, they estimated that the number of workers employed to improve the roads increased tenfold from the previous year."," Though these numbers seem rather outrageous and are likely to be incorrect and under-researched, the article is still testament to the importance of infrastructure improvement in the South. The burgeoning iron, steel, mining, and timber industries of the South called for better roads for transportations, to accommodate the moving of goods and the travel of northern prospectors and investors. Better roads needed to be built to transport raw materials to the newly built industrial centers located now in the South, unlike prior to the industrialization of the South where materials were either shipped overseas or sent north. Improving the infrastructure of the South (through roads and railroads) was crucial to the development of the quickly growing Southern economy and its important industries.","Date: August 23, 1895","Location: Christianburg, Montgomery County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Politics, Government, Economy, Migration/Transportation, Urban Life/Boosterism","Episode Scope: Local, State, Regional, National","Montgomery Messenger, August 23, 1895.

Hovey, remembering his past trip to the Luray Caverns in Page County, Virginia, wrote a letter to the cavern's newly appointed Manger Superintendent, Lemuel Zerkel. Hovey filled the letter with friendly words and personal anecdotes referencing the caverns, to hopefully illicit a feeling of mutual interest from the newly appointed Superintendent. Hovey had visited and mapped the caverns years earlier, claiming that he had been the source of the names of many of the geological and travel landmarks, with even a set of landmarks named after himself. His interest in the caverns seemed genuine, and the letter concluded with Hovey's assertion of his knowledge of the excavation taking place in the caves, and a request for any facts of interest about any caves in Virginia."," Upon careful reading, this seems like a rather peculiar way to end a seemingly friendly letter of interest. Though interest in business, tourism, or excavation isn't explicitly iterated in the letter itself, after the Civil War, many northerners sought to use the demolished South and its developing industries (like Luray's booming mining and tourism sectors) to their own monetary benefit. They were called carpetbaggers, and their advantageous use of the South's developing economy was evident not only in tourism and mining, but in the development of infrastructure such as railroads and the expansion of the South's burgeoning urban centers. It is likely that H.C. Hovey of Newburyport, Massachusetts was a prospector of the mining or archeologist variety, with his strong interest in the excavations that more than likely took place in the unexplored sections of the mine. He could also be interested in taking advantage of the tourism sector of Luray's bolstering economy, but because the letter is so tactfully written, Zerkel may not have had any idea, and looking at the letter a couple centuries later, it is still difficult to tell. What can be sure, however, is that these types of exchanges were common throughout the Reconstruction period of South and the following several decades; the South's developing economy and industry was very attractive to financial prospectors in the north. It may not be fair to call H. C. Hovey to call a carpetbagger, but the possibility is remains strong.","Date: January, 23, 1890","Location: Lexington, Rockbridge County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Economy, Urban Life/Boosterism","Episode Scope: Local, Regional, National","Rockbridge County News, January 23, 1890.

Hamilton ran a regular advertisement for his services in The Nashville Daily Union. In the advertisement he ran on Saturday, July 6, 1850, Hamilton reassured his former patrons that he planned to remain in the business of buying and selling cotton. Hamilton thanked the public for the business they provided him in that venture. Directly below he advertised his steamboat packets. Through this advertisement, Hamilton reintroduced himself as an agent of the steamers that traveled between Nashville and New Orleans, and Nashville and Memphis. In addition, the advertisement declared Hamilton's need to hire 100 NEGROES to work on the steamboats that traveled back and forth along these two routes. Although he claimed to want to hire these black workers, he did not necessarily mean to hire them independently. Some slave owners often hired their slaves out to others within their community, keeping the salaries for themselves. "," Hamilton advertised two types of steamboat packets. The first he described as regular packets traveling from New Orleans to Nashville. The steamers left the port of New Orleans every Tuesday at four o'clock in the afternoon for Nashville. The steamer left to return to New Orleans from Nashville every Saturday afternoon at four o'clock. The advertisement described the other packet as weekly. It left Nashville for Memphis every Monday at four o'clock and left to return to Nashville from Memphis on Thursday mornings at ten o'clock. "," Before railroads, steamboats provided the most rapid means of transportation of both people and goods. Tennessee played a large role in this river transportation. The Cumberland River ran through the middle of Tennessee eventually intersecting with the Ohio River. The Ohio River indirectly connected cities along the Cumberland River, specifically Nashville, with the burgeoning steam boat economy of the Mississippi River. "," The shipment of iron along the Cumberland River became a vital part of the economy in the middle region of Tennessee. Historian Byrd Douglas argues that if it had not been for the Cumberland River, which served as the only medium of transportation, this essential product, which played such an important part in the development of our country, could not have reached the market. Steamboat packets, like those advertised by A. Hamilton, provided the most efficient means of transportation between the South-western states. Tennessee did produce large amounts of the South?s staple crops, tobacco and cotton. But iron production proved to be more beneficial to the economy of the Cumberland region of Tennessee and thus made Nashville one of the largest cities in the South. The shipment and production of iron made Tennessee an industrial state juxtaposing it to many states within the South that found economic success predominantly through agriculture."],"display_date":"July 6, 1850","search_date":"1850-07-06","locations":[{"id":11953,"lat":36.1785835172,"lng":-86.867295434,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2005,"title":"Hired Laborers on the Farms of Central Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-01-24","end_date":"1876-01-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1876, Dr. Cary C. Cocke, the owner of a large plantation in Fluvanna County, Virginia, was concerned about the security of one of his major investments, his crops.  On January 24, 1876 Cocke received a letter from a store in Richmond, Virginia; the author of the letter regretfully informed Cocke that the wheat received from Cocke's farm fell short of the desired weight.  At the time that Cocke received the letter, R. S. Dunn, Cocke's farm manager, directed the planting, harvesting, and sale of Cocke's crops.  Thus, Dunn bore the responsibility for this oversight.  The store manager admitted that it was obvious to him that the crop fell short the moment that he first saw the wheat.  A competent and knowledgeable manager should have known that the wheat was insufficient according to market standards.  Dr. Cocke was unaware of this problem until the store manager informed him by sending a letter.  Between Dr. Cocke's visits to his plantation, he relied on the reports of his farm manager as a means to remain informed of the status of his crops and livestock.  During the second half of the nineteenth century, a number of farmers in Central Virginia, like Cocke, employed laborers to work their fields; these laborers served as a constant concern to the farmers in Central Virginia who were hoping to profit from sales of wheat and corn.  ","The cooperative nature of farm production in Central Virginia during this period increased the vulnerability of landowners like Cocke who employed independent laborers.  After slavery was abolished, farmers in Virginia abandoned the use of severe physical punishments to influence the productivity of their workers.  Instead, farmers in Central Virginia during the late nineteenth century adopted a more precarious position, as they entered into business ventures with their hired independent laborers, who were seeking to make profits, as well.  These cooperative farming ventures assumed a variety of forms and rendered landowners, especially those who lived away from their farm land, more vulnerable to the vices and virtues of their employees.  In <em>Southern Crossing</em>, Edward Ayers asserts that absentee landowners were growing in number during this time period, especially in the older southern states, such as Virginia.   ","Landowners, such as Cocke, relied largely on other men, in the form of farm managers, laborers, renters, and sharecroppers, to help ensure that their dreams of profit became a reality.  Both James Holladay of Prospect Hill, Virginia and Dr. Cocke utilized hired laborers on their farms.  Farmers' dependence on the labor of hired employees, renters, and sharecroppers was not limited to Central Virginia.  Ayers explains that farmers throughout Virginia, as well as farmers in all southern states, utilized various forms of collaborative labor.  Ayers argues that agricultural work displayed innumerable permutations.  While some farmers in the South utilized daily laborers, other rented their land or allowed sharecroppers to work portions of their land.","Landowners in Central Virginia found that their economic welfare was linked to the agricultural knowledge, work ethic, and trustworthiness of the employees who ran their farms.  This arrangement created problems; managers who failed to cultivate the crops adequately or neglected to realize the shortcomings of a harvest, as a consequence of their lack of the agricultural knowledge, had good reason to emphasize the good news and successes of the farm while downplaying the bad news and failures when reporting to the landowners."],"display_date":"January 24, 1876","search_date":"1876-01-24","locations":[{"id":13822,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2009,"title":"Women in Central Virginia Take Action against Poverty\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-01-01","end_date":"1885-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In January of 1876, Hester Tomlin was a troubled woman.  Hester discovered that her husband, Harry Tomlin, Jr. had written a letter to Dr. Cary C. Cocke of Fluvanna County, Virginia in December of the previous year in which he asked to rent a tract of land on Cocke's plantation.  Hester felt impelled to interfere.  A month after Harry wrote the aforementioned letter, Hester wrote an additional note to Dr. Cocke in which she begged him to deny her husband the land.  Hester explained, I hate to see [Harry] undertake anything that will not bring in money. . .for we are very destitute.  Women of the Central Virginia in the 1870's and 1880's felt trepidation when they envisioned a life of poverty; therefore, women played an active role in maintaining or improving their family's welfare.","Hester Tomlin was not the only woman in Central Virginia who feared poverty.  On the contrary, poverty was a salient topic to women across the region, as they contemplated their marriages, both present and future.  On January 30, 1885, Fredericksburg's local paper, <em>Free Lance</em>, printed a story about a woman who chose to marry a wealthy man and secure her economic future instead of marrying the poor man whom she loved.  This story appeared on the front page of the Fredericksburg paper.  In the aftermath of the economic depression of the 1870's, the topic was salient to the women in Central Virginia.  ","Many women in Central Virginia struggled or failed in their attempts to prevent or end their family's battle with poverty.  In Hester Tomlin's letter to Dr. Cocke, she admitted, I am living now on the charity of others and must continue to do so unless I can help myself in some boarding deportment. . .  Hester and other women of the time considered allowing people to live in their home as boarders so that they could earn money.  Yet, as Edward Ayers explains in <em>Southern Crossing</em>, Women [in the South] found exceedingly few opportunities to earn money in the countryside.  However, those who lived in rural areas, such as the farming areas in Central Virginia, could aid in farm labor.  An advertisement in the Fredericksburg newspaper in 1886 requested a farmer with a wife who understands the dairy business to help with the labor. ","Women, like Hester, throughout Virginia and in other southern states improved the economic wellbeing of their families by using a variety of methods for making money during the late nineteenth century, according to Ayers.  Ayers explains that farm women of the late nineteenth century normally produced and mended all of their family members' clothing.  Some women sold items such as butter, eggs, milk, and honey in order help their families earn more money.  Others made a profit by serving as a midwife to neighboring women.  Ayers also describes the vital role that women played as teachers in their communities during this time period.  In fact, Ayers points out that the number of female teachers in the South doubled in the 1880's. ","In the latter half of the nineteenth century, Central Virginians recognized the active role of women like Hester who worked diligently to better their family's financial situation.  On January 28, 1887, the <em>Free Lance</em> of Fredericksburg printed an article entitled They Never Strike that commended women for their hard work.  Yet, secretive or more subtle actions these women undertook in order to secure their family's future were undoubtedly overlooked.  In Hester Tomlin's letter to Dr. Cocke, she opened by admitting that writing the letter carried the great risk that her husband would find out about her interference.  In closing the letter, Hester requested that Dr. Cocke burn the note and never tell anyone about its contents.  Hester was both frantic and fearful. At times, women in Central Virginia acted against the wishes of the men in their lives in an effort to save their families or themselves from the poverty that threatened the families of Central Virginia during this time."],"display_date":"January 1, 1876 - January 30, 1885","search_date":"1880-07-16","locations":[{"id":13822,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2011,"title":"Farmers in Central Virginia Cope after Economic Depression\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-10-28","end_date":"1887-10-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James Holladay, the owner of a plantation in Spotsylvania County, Virginia was exceedingly proud of his new invention.  Holladay had worked hard to perfect the new silo he designed for his farm, but he wanted assurance from an expert that his silo needed no further improvements.  On October 28, 1887 Holladay wrote to Professor Elliot W. Stuart, an expert in agriculture at the University of Virginia, and inquired as to the soundness of the new silo and machine that would automatically fill the silo that he had developed.  Holladay explained, The increasing difficulty of obtaining reliable labour when needed led me to consider the practicability of substituting machinery for hand labour in this part of the operation of filling silos.  Like Holladay, a number of farmers in Central Virginia who struggled to maintain or increase their plantation's productivity utilized innovative tools which, in the words of Holladay, improved in the quality of eusilage and economized labour.  After the economic depression that occurred in the 1870's, men in Central Virginia whose primary source of income revolved around agricultural ventures explored new options that would allow them to reduce farm expenditures while retaining their land.","Other farmers in Central Virginia did not invent new farm machines but, instead, rented tracts of land to tenants as a means to increase the economic productivity of their plantations.  In <em>Southern Crossing</em>, Edward Ayers explains that status as a renter was viewed as a temporary station that was merely a rung on the agricultural ladder of economic success.  Those who entered into contracts as renters aspired to one day become independent landowners.  On July 18, 1875, in a letter addressed to Dr. Cary C. Cocke of Fluvanna County, Virginia, Thos J. Rowland of Richmond, Virginia inquired about the land that Dr. Cocke was hoping to rent.  Mr. Rowland proposed that he pay rent in the form of annual cash payments to Dr. Cocke in exchange for the usage of five hundred acres of his land.  In December of the same year, Mr. Harry B. Tomlin, Jr. wrote a similar letter to Dr. Cocke in which he too asked to rent a parcel of Dr. Cocke's land.  However, Tomlin offered to make part of his payment by relinquishing a portion of the crops he produced on the land to Dr. Cocke.  ","Some farmers in Central Virginia undoubtedly utilized both of these techniques for increasing their plantation's productivity.  Holladay, the plantation owner who designed the new type of silo, also received a letter from a prospective renter.  On December 5, 1884, Z. C. Daniel wrote to Holladay saying that he would either buy or rent a tract of his land because he was somewhat short for land to put in corn.  Mr. Holladay and other farmers of Central Virginia both rented their land and created new farm machines as a means of coping with the aftermath of the economic depression that occurred in the 1870's. ","In Southern Crossing, Edward Ayers describes the years following the economic depression by asserting, New technologies and techniques offered sudden hope to areas that had been passed over for centuries.  These new technologies offered hope not only to farmers like Holladay in Central Virginia, but also farmers in the other farming regions of Virginia and states of the South.  Dependable help was hard to maintain due to the abolition of slavery and the migration of laborers, according to Ayers.  Therefore, farmers needed to develop methods for increasing production while decreasing the number of laborers they utilized on their plantations.

In a letter to Reuben Lindsay Gordon, an attorney from Louisa County, Virginia, Lyons asserted, I am watching eagerly and anxiously to see Louisa roll up a majority for Daniel and yourself.  You must get as big a majority as you can . . . I do hope you will win by a big vote.  Lyons was referring to the 1881 race between Democrat John Warwick Daniel and William Evan Cameron, the Readjuster candidate, for the position of Governor of Virginia.  The new Readjuster party of Virginia consisted of politicians who represented the interests of poor blacks and whites throughout the state.  Lyons's hopes for a Democratic win did not come to fruition; Cameron won the election, although only 53 percent of Virginians, a slim majority, voted in his favor.  As a result of the shifts in political power that occurred in the early 1880s and hopes for political reform, voters expressed newfound interest in elections.  Constituents from each political party harbored the hope that newly elected officials from their party would win and affect positive change in Virginia politics.","Politicians like Daniel in Central Virginia exerted major efforts during the 1880s and 1890s, not only to ensure that as many eligible citizens as possible would vote, but to also convince voters to vote for the right party.  Lyons articulated his understanding of the importance of every individual vote.  Democrats throughout Virginia worried about growing voter apathy and indifference at this time.  In <em>The Promise of the New South</em>, Edward Ayers points out that many voters in Virginia assumed, and rightly so, that elected officials acted as the puppets of a small number of wealthy, powerful men who made all of the political decisions from a distance.  As party leaders in Virginia knew that a difference of a few votes could determine the outcome of a race, some resorted to bribes, including monetary compensation and promises of appointment, to guarantee as many votes as possible.           ","Lyons had good reason to be excited about the Virginia gubernatorial election in 1881; at that time Virginia political parties battled fiercely for political power and positions in the state government.  The early 1880s witnessed a great deal of change in terms of the prominence of political parties in Virginia.  Republicans gained strength during this time; Democrats lost public support, as voters grew disillusioned over the inaction of the Democrats who had been elected to office, according to Ayers.  The Democrats who controlled the state government after the economic depression of the 1870s had failed to improve the state's debt.  Democrats like James Lyons who expressed strong support for their party in the 1870s and early 1880s quickly lost hope.  Few politicians pressed volatile issues or attempted to draw attention to problems that their party would rather ignore during the 1880s and 1890s.  ","Both the Republicans and Readjusters held Virginia for only a short period of time before the Democrats regained control in the 1884 election of Governor Cleveland.  Ayers explains that the large number of Democrats who continued to hold positions of power and influence during the reign of the Republicans and Readjusters prevented the parties from coalescing and forming a stable and secure power base throughout the state.  Despite the high hopes of the members of each political party of the time, voters remained disappointed by the lack of positive change or progress that politicians initiated in the 1880s and 1890s in Virginia."],"display_date":"September 6, 1881","search_date":"1881-09-06","locations":[{"id":14014,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2021,"title":"Mass Slave Runaway from McIntosh, GA Plantation","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Things were looking promising on Mr. Thomas' plantation, Peru, in 1850. He owned over 150 slaves and 15,000 acres, all of which produced great wealth in the form of cotton and other crops. Most of his slaves had been reared on his plantation alongside him and his son ten-year old son, Edward. Both father and son felt they were very good to their slaves and provided them with ample food, clothing, and housing. Their generosity was such that Master Thomas even allowed many of his slaves to own guns, boats, horses, and to raise their own crops to sell to others. The Thomas' felt they treated their slaves in a fatherly fashion and called them our people, feeling that the relations between master and slave could not have been better anywhere. Both masters and slaves even went to the same church on Sundays, although the enslaved people had to sit in the back and take Communion last. Young Master Edward felt particular kinship with some of the slaves, as he played with them and requested barbeques on the plantation that everyone enjoyed. In the eyes of the Thomas family, life could not have been better for everyone on the plantation during the planting time of 1850. ","However, this content feeling disappeared when the largest slave runaway in young Edward's memory occurred just before the crop planting of 1850. Immense amounts of cotton were due to be planted, and it was a time when the most hardworking slaves were needed. At this crucial time eight or ten of Mr. Thomas' best slaves ran away, along with several other slaves from neighboring plantations, numbering fifty or sixty in all. The whites in the neighborhood were very angry at the fact that the runaways fled to the woods and outlying areas, and were surviving by stealing crops and cattle at night. Mr. Thomas and Edward were most distressed because in addition to ruining the slave-crop ratio needed for the planting, when the slaves left they felt as if fifteen thousand dollars had taken wings to itself and gone. The neighborhood did not see the runaways as men trying to obtain their rightful freedom, but as outlaws and menaces that had to be caught. The neighbors searched on horseback and with hunting dogs, and actually saw the runaways steal a boat and flee further into the woods but could not stop them. After that, nothing more was heard of the runaways until the first of December. That night, they came back to the plantation, sought out young Edward, and told him to tell Master that they were come in here. Master Thomas did not proceed to beat them but instead said he wished them to hell and later hired them out to a railroad contractor for the rest of the winter.","The runaway from Peru Plantation was in no way an unprecedented event for Southern slave owners, and runaways occurred for various reasons across the South. The living conditions of Southern slaves varied. Many were driven from sunrise to sunset, beaten constantly, had little food and terrible housing, and were given virtually no free time. However, despite the harshness of the institution of slavery, some masters were more lenient. Many told themselves they had to be good to their slaves because they were obligated to watch out for them and care for them in a fatherly manner. Many owners in Georgia also gave their slaves rations of meat, instead of just meal and corn. Some, like Mr. Thomas, allowed the slaves free time, which many used to tend gardens and sell their crops, as the slaves on Peru plantation did. Many masters, such as Mr. Thomas did not require their slaves to work on the Sabbath. However, even when slaves were given some leniency, as they were on the Peru Plantation, their masters were foolish to believe that their slaves were satisfied and placated by their master's paternalism and provisions. ","One of the biggest outlets for slaves to express their dissatisfaction was to run away. When they hid out like the Peru slaves, and as many others did across the South, it hurt their masters monetarily and unsettled the white community. It reminded them that their slaves were not satisfied, even if it did not totally ruin their delusion of being good masters. Slaves that fled, often raided crops and joined with slaves from other plantations when running away. These characteristics of the McIntosh runaways were not unique. Another common factor in slave runaways is that the slaves often only left for a short amount of time and sometimes returned of their own accord as did Mr. Thomas' slaves. It was hard for slaves as far south as Georgia to make it all the way to a free state and it was also hard for them to hide in a community where people would recognize them. Often they returned to their masters' plantations and the most common form of punishment was either being beaten or sold. Mr. Thomas did this on a lesser scale by hiring them out for a season. However Mr. Thomas felt, it can be assumed he was surprised by the slaves running away since he thought they had such wonderful conditions and relations, but this was what most slaveholders across the South believed. The nature of the McIntosh runaway was typical and shared many trends with other slave runaways in the South."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":2023,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MC INTOSH, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2022,"title":"Private Beaufort Slave Sale\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-01","end_date":"1836-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Sometime prior to the first of January 1836, slaveholder Thomas Fuller must have checked his books or given some thought to his economic needs. Perhaps he wanted to make some money, maybe he was in debt and needed to get cash to pay back a lender, or he may have been foreclosing on a loan. All of these were common reasons for selling slaves in the South. Or, maybe Fuller was just trying to get certain slaves off his hands for unknown reasons. What we do know is that he put an ad in the January 1, 1836 edition of the <em>Charleston Mercury </em> offering twenty slaves for private sale. In this group there were ten field hands, six children from the ages of five to fourteen, two older women, and two infants, Anyone interested in buying these slaves was to apply to him, but Fuller was sure to add a comment at the bottom of the ad: If these Negroes are not sold before the middle of February next, they will be offered for sale at Public Auction in Charleston.","The selling of slaves, as in the case of Thomas Fuller, was a common practice throughout the South. Masters sold their slaves for many reasons, but no matter the reason, slaves were torn from their homes, friends, and often families. Private sales, such as Thomas Fuller's, constituted the majority of slave sales in the South. These sales were often from neighbor to neighbor, or at least between people who lived in the same general vicinity. During the history of American slavery it is estimated that about 1,320,000 slaves were sold locally, while about 666,00 were sold at public auction or in interstate trades. Thus, sales like Thomas Fuller's were not uncommon at all and were advertised daily in Southern newspapers. The selling of slaves emphasized the principle that slaves were truly seen as property and nothing more, as Fuller's ad revealed. He was selling two infants, who may or may not been sold with either of their parents. The six field hands may well have been married people or parents, and the children, ages five to fourteen, were most likely sold off to the highest buyer, whether they were they were siblings or not. Every single one of these people may have left behind loved ones and each may have gone to a separate buyer. That is not to say that white buyers never bought couples of families. Some felt pulled to do so as slaves used white paternalistic attitudes to their benefit, or because buyers felt that purchasing families lessened the chance that their slaves would run away. Also, some white buyers may have felt their conscience weigh on them when they made their purchases. It is not known whether Thomas Fuller's slaves were sold privately to a neighbor or sold at public auction, but many accounts show that being sold privately was much preferable to enduring sale on the auction block.","Public auctions became increasingly popular cross the South during the nineteenth century as more slaves were needed, especially for the extremely heavy labor in the Deep South. At public auctions slaves were often categorized and rated, broken down by color distinction and supposed ability to work in the field, the home, as skilled workers ect. The slaves were expected to make themselves sell-able to people they have never seen before. Spouses, lovers, families, and friends were not always placed on the block together and were often sold apart from one another. Many buyers were more interested in purchasing a certain type of slave to fulfill a certain type of work than they were in buying families (unless of course) it suited their buying needs or they felt particularly compassionate. By the mid nineteenth century, male slaves could sell for 1300 dollars or more, women for 1000 or more especially if they were likely-looking, teenagers sold for slightly less than women, and children for about half as much. Whatever his incentive for selling was, Thomas Fuller was likely to make a great sum of money. No matter where his slaves were sold, a private sale or public auction, one can only hope that they were sold to decent plantations and kept with their loved ones, although this was a fate many slaves in the South did not experience."],"display_date":1836,"search_date":"1836-07-01","locations":[{"id":11444,"lat":32.4068445137,"lng":-80.4452215468,"zoom":8,"place":"BEAUFORT, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2023,"title":"Slave Family Gets Smuggled to John Clark&#39;s Trader&#39;s Yard\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-01","end_date":"1863-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1861, it was illegal for Missourian traders to sell slaves to slaveholders in a different state. That did not prevent Captain Tirrell from taking Mattie Jackson, her brother, and her sister away from their mother and putting them onto a boat headed to Memphis. However, before the boat left St. Louis, Union policemen stopped the boat and returned the young slaves to their master. The Union policemen took no further action. Mattie recalled, Their power was limited to the suppression of the selling of slaves that go out of the city. Then two years later, seven men, four watchmen, and three traders, forced themselves into her home and put her family into a closed carriage. This carriage took them to a dilapidated prison where they spent the night. Mattie recalled that, [the] kidnapping had been in contemplation from the time [they] were before taken and returned. The family was transferred from one train car to another, until they finally arrived in Louisville where they were held at John Clark's trader's yard. The family was sold out separately, except [her] mother and little brother, who were sold together. Mattie recalled that her mother and brother spent two weeks in the trader's yard, her sister six weeks, and herself four.","Mattie's family was enslaved in Missouri at the beginning of the Civil War. Missouri was considered a border state and ultimately remained a member of the Union. Historian Ira Berlin argues that President Lincoln promised to respect the property rights of slaveholders in border states in order to keep them in the Union. Thus, slavery remained legal in Missouri. As Mattie knew however, interstate slave trading was outlawed. Despite violating the law, Captain Tirrell smuggled Mattie and her family out of the state and sold them in Louisville. Many other slaves experienced similar incidents. Mattie noted considerable smuggling was done. Although Union soldiers protected some slaves from being sold to areas outside of Missouri, slave owners and traders who [pretended] Unionism successfully smuggled slaves out of the state. ","The Union soldiers were not the only people Captain Tirrell fooled while smuggling his slaves out of Missouri. Mattie stated that Captain Tirrell tricked and deceived her family before he forced them to the trader's yard. She recalled that Captain Tirrell's kindness, generosity, and approbation to the contemplated marriage was only a trap. Such lies and trickery were common among slave owners in the South. Historian Walter Johnson argues, Many sellers resorted to ingratiation, deceit, and coercion. Slaveholders told their slaves that they would not be traded and then sold those same slaves weeks - or even days - later. Other slave owners tricked their slaves into thinking they were going to attend an event, such as a party, at another plantation. Once the slaves got into the wagon, they were brought directly to slave traders.","Trickery and lies were just the beginning to Mattie's horrible experience. Mattie described how her family spent considerable time in John Clark's trader's yard before being sold to their new masters.

On November 6, 1863, the commission looked to broaden its mission. Five representatives from the organization wrote to President Lincoln expressing concern that the state of freed slaves in the Mississippi Valley was daily becoming worse. Under the conditions that these blacks lived, sickness and death [prevailed] to a fearful extent. The members of the Western Sanitary Commission, pointing to their contributions to the sick and wounded soldiers, asked for permission and authority to extend [their] labors to the freed slaves. With the President's endorsement, they believed they could raise large sums of money and accomplish great good. They further argued that by lessening the difficulties of emancipation, material aid would help crush the rebellion."," In its letter to President Lincoln, the Western Sanitary Commission argued that the living condition of the freed slaves was so bad that hundreds of the blacks would gladly return to slavery, to avoid the hardships of freedom. The brush tent shelter of the freed slaves in the Mississippi Valley only provided protection from night dews. The government supplied freed slaves with rations, but distribution was often delayed. Furthermore, freed slaves had no facilities of cooking, and [were] almost ignorant of the use of wheat flour. The Western Sanitary Commission included these details in their letter to President Lincoln to illustrate the great difficulty former slaves experienced while adjusting to life outside of slavery. Historian Eric Foner claims that by 1860, most freed slaves worked as poor urban or rural laborers and enjoyed few rights other than not being considered a form of property. Oftentimes in Missouri, as well as elsewhere in the South, freed slaves worked for wages well below the average wage of a field hand. This forced freed slaves to live under the lowest of living conditions."," The authors of the letter to Lincoln suggested that providing aid to the freed slaves would [lessen] the difficulties of emancipation and thus help crush the Confederate rebellion. By providing aid for former slaves, the Western Sanitary Commission hoped to improve the living conditions of freed slaves. The organization argued it would not only be a work of philanthropy, but equally of patriotism, for it would remove an increasing reproach against the Union cause. Although historians Clayton E. Jewett and John O. Allen claim there was a heavy influence of northern abolitionists in Missouri, abolitionism was not overwhelmingly popular in the North. By giving aid to freed slaves to begin life outside of slavery however, the Western Sanitary Commission hoped to prove to the Union that emancipation was both possible and the right thing to do."],"display_date":"November 6, 1863","search_date":"1863-11-06","locations":[{"id":7918,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2030,"title":"A Very Satisfactory Cotton Crop\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-11-27","end_date":"1857-11-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gustavus Henry believed that producing cotton could make him a wealthy man. On November 27, 1857, he wrote a letter to his wife stating that despite encountering troubles for the past month, the gin stands [had] been doing finely for the last five days. Gustavus described the recent production as delightful. He further said it was a beautiful thing that the lead pipe, which brought water from the lake, enabled him to power two gins at once. However, he wrote that the water power was not sufficient enough to drive his saw mill or corn mill at the same time as the gins. Gustavus's excitement continued when he exclaimed that no one here [would] do any better than [he would]. He had reasons to be happy. At the time he wrote this letter, the price for cotton was unprecedently high. Henry estimated that he would likely sell close to 200 bales on this occasion which, thanks to the high price of cotton, would bring in about 10,000."," The detail Gustavus provided about his farm and the description of the work completed depicted that of a typical Arkansas plantation. Agriculture dominated the economy in the antebellum South, and cotton was the main agricultural product in Arkansas. Gustavus devoted the majority of his letter to discussing the status of his cotton crop. As historian Dallas T. Herndon argues, people in Arkansas who had money to invest preferred to invest it in a cotton plantation rather than a factory. In the rural economy of Arkansas, it was more beneficial for a man like Gustavus to invest in agriculture instead of textiles. "," Nearly every time Gustavus mentioned his cotton crop, he got excited and commented on the high price of cotton in the market. Because of the extraordinarily high price of cotton, Gustavus anticipated making 10,000 by selling his 200 bales of cotton. This was the kind of return he expected when he built his plantation in Desha. There was great wealth available to those who grew cotton. The allurement of such wealth enticed many men like Gustavus to grow cotton which made the South one of the largest producers of cotton in the entire world. "," Gustavus attributed the success of his crop to the efficiency of his cotton gins. The cotton gin was not a new machine in 1857. Eli Whitney's invention to separate seeds from cotton fiber had been around for sixty years. However, Gustavus stressed the important role the cotton gin continued to play on his plantation. Although he did not specifically describe the nature of his cotton gins, it was likely that the gins he owned were large. He described a lead pipe that brought water from the lake to power the gins. The use of water power was usually reserved for cotton gins of considerable size. "," Gustavus again focused on his cotton gins in another letter sent to his wife a few weeks later. In this letter, Gustavus described how a fire had destroyed his cotton gins and he did not know if his insurance would repay him for his loss. Gustavus's devastated tone in this letter again reflected how instrumental cotton gins remained in agriculture, even sixty years after Whitney first made his invention."],"display_date":"November 27, 1857","search_date":"1857-11-27","locations":[{"id":548,"lat":33.8857804348,"lng":-91.3151620379,"zoom":9,"place":"DESHA, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2036,"title":"Richest County in the Union\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-03","end_date":"1857-01-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Different cultures define wealth in very different ways. In the minds of the citizens of Dougherty County, Georgia in the late 1850s, they were very wealthy indeed. According to the South Carolina Times in January of 1857, this plantation county claimed to be the richest County in the Union, excepting those containing the great cities. As evidence, they cited the per capita average of nine slaves valued at 5,000, and 10,000 worth of land to work them on. On whole, the county possessed land valued at 1,781,887; 980,000 in city property; merchandise worth 125,000; 650,000 liquid cash; and most importantly, 2,280,912 in slaves. This value, totaling over 5.8 million, is roughly equivalent to 119 million in 2005 U.S. dollars.","While Dougherty gloated, others mocked this definition of wealth. The New York Daily Times, hearing of this boast from its correspondent in South Carolina, saw the calculation in a very different light. The Daily Times pointed out the dominating value of slaves, then argued that by valuing white laborers at the market rate for slaves, each New York county would be far richer than Dougherty. Further, with only 125,000 worth of merchandise in the county, hundreds of stores in New York had more valuable merchandise than the entire Georgia county.","     Dougherty would indubitably have a different story to tell in 1865. The Daily Times might have added that the land in Dougherty was valued so highly because the highly profitable plantation economy drove up land prices. Even without the toll that the war extracted through destroyed infrastructure, seized crops, and the loss of much of the male population, the end of slavery surely crippled the fortunes of nearly all of Dougherty's wealthy planters. With land similarly devalued and any Confederate currency useless, Dougherty County could hardly be the richest county in the Union.","     Dougherty demonstrates the massive wealth that planters could accumulate in antebellum Georgia, as well as their complete dependence on the continuation of slavery to guard their investment in human property.

Even before emancipation shattered the fortunes of slave-holding families across the region, the war and ecology brought privations and shortages that wrecked the economies of entire regions. In this time of constant and deep flux, the wealthiest, especially in the armies, interacted extensively with the poorest elements of society. Distinct cultures sometimes clashed. In this setting, General J. H. Hammond of Barnwell County, South Carolina, wrote to his son, Captain Harry Hammond, in response to a letter from Harry. While Harry's initial letter no longer exists, General Hammon's response makes it clear that Harry complained with some vigor about the manners of the country folk in the Barnwell and Orangeburgh area. The General's response to Harry's inferred comments sketch a dramatic picture of the way that at least some leading, wealthy citizens viewed the poor during the Civil War.","J. H. Hammond, writing to Harry Hammond in the summer of 1861, addresses Harry's comments about the poor community nearby. I am very sorry to hear your account of the conduct of the low country people. You must make great allowances for people who have just fallen in a day from affluence to poverty. According to Hammond, many of these poor families were made so by sudden and recent changed in fortune. This terrible collapse...shakes every nerve moral & physical...Chivalry and...manners were always strangely mixed up among [these] people ...The Chivalry has mostly gone to the war & the sense probably also. What was to be expected of the rest. ","     Hammond, while somewhat condescending, still evinces great pity and empathy for the low country poor. In private correspondence with his son, there is little reason for Hammond to write anything but his honest opinion. That he still shows respect for the poor demonstrates the sympathy that at least some of the upper class felt for the less fortunate around them. If class conflict was an important force in this time and region, J. H. Hammond had little to do with it.","     During the Civil War and Reconstruction, Northerners often saw poor whites as natural allies. To the Northern mind, these poor classes were antithetical to the rich, planter class in charge of the Confederacy. Hammond's letter bring this perception into question - if a sizeable number of poor whites were once wealthier families who had come into hard times, their ties with the planter class were stronger than Northern leaders suspected. Even if Hammond is incorrect, the support he shows for the local poor of South Carolina suggests that this mass of poor whites and the wealthy families were not completely isolated. Still, as Harry Hammond discovered first-hand, poor whites certainly did have a markedly different culture from the wealthy landowners around them.

Cotton-picking was back-breaking work. Always in the past, though, slaves had worked the long hours in the sweltering heat. Slavery ended, but the demand for labor did not. Suddenly the planters had the job of enticing labor that had been so simple, if expensive, to secure just years earlier. They began to question just where that easy labor had gone.","The Milledgeville Southern Recorder addressed just this question in early 1869, at the same time revealing a great deal about white attitudes. Some whites, the Recorder begins, blame the mysterious absence of black labor on the railroads. The paper counters that this is only a partial truth. The greater drain, it insists, is the great number of black families who have a self satisfied confidence in their ability to run a farm of their own, thinking they know as much about cotton making or a little more so than did their masters. This, the Recorder prophesies, is a self-correcting foolishness. A year or two of experiment will give us plenty of negro labor as in days past, it insists, adding, by that time, they will get an idea in their heads as to their ability to be planters.","     In the heart of Radical Reconstruction, freedmen across the South grasped at one of their more central new freedoms - the ability to choose employment, including the right to work for no man but himself. Some chose the railroads, others paid work on plantations, but many chose to find land, whatever the cost, that they could own and farm. Such endeavors were difficult to keep running, however, with the great variance possible in cotton prices even year-to-year. The Recorder's article show an emerging strategy among whites of using control of capital, especially valuable land, to dominate black labor now that political oppression was - at least temporarily - less complete. Sharecropping, a policy where planters would grant a piece of land to farmers in exchange for a substantial portion of the harvest, would become a common arrangement across the South in the decades to follow. This arrangement, while preserving the idea of independence and self-employment, rarely allowed sharecroppers to escape poverty. Over time more complex forms of economic domination would develop. The expectations of black failure are no surprise.

The exploits of these Northern armies quickly became propaganda for Southern newspapers. The Milledgeville, Georgia Southern Recorder, hearing of the Union capture of Barnwell, South Carolina, reprinted a sensational letter from its correspondent, The Constitutionalist. The article, full of rhetoric and exaggeration, recounts Union troops bursting into homes, where the privacy of ladies apartments...was not respected while searching for gold and valuables. After stealing everything worth taking, the troops spoiled the remaining food, assisted throughout by the faithlessness of negroes. The Recorder quotes the men as saying, We cannot whip your men and are determined to make the women and children suffer.

With most of the Southern armies in Tennessee and Virginia, Sherman faced few troops until near the end of the march. In the meantime, he burned and pillaged his way through the heart of the South, focusing special attention on South Carolina, first to secede and thus a potent symbol. Before General Sherman began his march through South Carolina, he received a telegram from Chief of Staff Halleck noting that he hoped that upon Charleston, South Carolina's fall, by some accident the place may be destroyed, and if a little salt should be sown upon its site it may prevent the growth of future crops of nullification and secession. Barnwell was not a particularly important county for the war effort, lacking major cities, fantastic wealth or even a particularly large population. It, like much of South Carolina, was burned as an example to the South as a whole.","     Historians have long debated the role that public morale played in the conclusion of the Civil War. Through articles such as the Constitutionalist's, the Confederate press attempted to turn Sherman's efforts at demoralization into public resolve to continue fighting. The Confederate government, through limited censorship and influence, used the press throughout the war as a tool for propping up continually-declining public morale. The letter reprinted in the Southern Recorder has the subtlety of a lead brick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of the Confederate press' efforts at morale-building were ultimately unsuccessful. While the importance of public morale in ending the war remains open for debate, this loss of popular confidence was certainly a serious problem for the South by 1865."],"display_date":"March 1, 1865 - March 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-03-15","locations":[{"id":11438,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2046,"title":"Judge Douglas&#39; Loss\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-05-10","end_date":"1837-05-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Three thousand five hundred dollars gone. In 1837, 3,500 dollars was a lot of money. Converting the sum to real 2005 terms, it would yield almost 69,000 dollars. The Panic of 1837 rendered every penny worthless. Judge Thomas Douglas of the Florida Supreme Court had been one of the wealthy class sponsoring the flurry of charters that brought unstable banks into existence, and now their failure meant financial ruin for the entire region. Douglas had bought stock in the Southern Life Insurance and Trust Company, established on February 14, 1835 in St. Augustine. His investment seemed safe enough and he was excited about the prospects of his return; the bank could loan to planters cultivating large unused Spanish land tracts, thus multiplying his wealth, that of the bank, and the agricultural production of the frontier. The Second Seminole War broke out and brought these hopes crashing down.","Investment in Florida stopped, outside capital dried up. Potential cotton plantations became dangerous battlefields. Foreign investors in the bank wanted their money to go to work, so loans were made to firms in New York City, much of which was ultimately lost. In less than two years, all the capital of the bank was scattered to the four winds. Judge Douglas lost a great deal of his fortune and Florida entered into its darkest hour as a territory.","In his autobiography, Douglas mentions his personal monetary loss, but the mechanisms of the larger force, the Panic of 1837, were both national and local in scope, draining the wealth out of every segment of the population. On the national level, President Andrew Jackson was engaged in the Bank War against Nicholas Biddle and the Bank of the United States. Jackson denied its re-chartering and removed 10 million dollars in deposits from its vaults, distributing the money to state banks. On the state and local level, charters for banks were approved by state legislatures with little safeguard or restriction, and the inflation of credit expanded to meet the capital needs of planters on the frontier. Cotton prices dropped, contraction of credit was extreme, and, on May 10, 1837, the Bank of New York suspended specie payments. Florida banks followed suit and bank deposits, with nothing to back them up, vanished in a matter of seconds. ","The entire South sunk into a long depression. Cotton prices fell forty percent in two years, and slave prices, derived from cotton, mirrored the fall. Banks in Florida came under investigation, and anti-bank sentiment exploded as the institution was seen as an endeavor of the ruling class. Judge Douglas and his planter friends commissioned banks, ran them, gave loans to, and inflated the property value of other planters. David Levy Yulee, the most prominent politician of Territorial Florida, seized on the resentment of inherited privilege and monopolies to enact legislation and build bank restrictions into the state constitution as Florida gained statehood. Better monitoring mechanisms and regulations, reserve minimums, and higher standards for chartering were put in place to protect the citizens. Ultimately, for Florida, bank failure in 1837 delayed its admission into the Union. Development of the vast interior, of plantations, and of transportation methods, stopped. Coupled with the Second Seminole War, the period of 1835-1842 was an incredibly bleak time for every social stratum in Florida, including the planter elite."],"display_date":"May 10, 1837","search_date":"1837-05-10","locations":[{"id":1455,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST JOHNS, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2058,"title":"Hitting Shore With a Vengeance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Haynie Bradshaw thanked God every time he arrived back on shore. Oystermen were reputed to be daring and unscrupulous men, who regard[ed] neither the laws of God nor the laws of man, but Bradshaw was a devout Methodist who sometimes led services on Sunday. As an oysterman, Bradshaw dredged the Chesapeake Bay aboard one of the infamous bugeye boats. It was a terrible living. Crews received one third of the gross income, with the other two thirds going to boat maintenance and to the captain. Bradshaw helped push a windlass that scraped the bottom of the bay. According to those in the trade, it was like pulling in anchor while the boat was sailing. His shabby clothes froze to his body out in the frigid ocean surf. Bradshaw knew men who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. Others were plagued with oyster hand, an infection that developed if one cut one one's hands while culling oysters.","Crisfield was an oysterman town, and to the town the oystermen bought prosperity as well as debauchery. All the buildings had holes in the floors to toss away emptied shells. The entire town smelled of dead oysters. Girls on the street corner outside Blizzard's were hardly discreet about their employment. The town's residents used guns to disperse the rowdy drunks prowling the streets after dark. While Bradshaw's religious faith was dear to him, the dangers and tension of the oyster season caused him to lapse into drinking. Bradshaw chose Burgess's Saloon, which featured a boxing ring for the customers' enjoyment. Bradshaw wasn't planning on fighting, but then he saw a Virginia waterman who had insulted him earlier, saying, Hey, ain't you one o' them dumb Smith Islanders? In a second they were in the ring. Bradshaw clocked him and the drunken crowd cheered raucously. When the Virginian's friends came to his aid, Bradshaw bloodied them too, one after the other. The saloon in Crisfield was a far cry from his Methodist Church back home.","While the slavery system ended years earlier, the free labor system for both blacks and whites could be awful as well. In each, the living conditions could be atrocious, with poor clothing, poor quarters, and poor food. In each, the work could only be done by forced labor provided by traders. For the oyster industry, the crimps in Baltimore were responsible for delivering the men to the captains, who paid them off for their services and then kept the men at sea for as long as they could. Slaves were usually not paid for their work, and oystermen were sometimes only paid off with the boom: knocked overboard into the freezing waters by the captain at the end of a voyage. Many laborers, such as Bradshaw, looked to alcohol to cope with the dangers. Tough labor conditions were found throughout the South and in many other forms than those in the oyster industry. Both blacks and whites were often exploited by the system of sharecropping, where a farmer worked another man's land in return for a small portion of the crops. Life could be difficult for a working man in the South, even if he was free."],"display_date":1875,"search_date":"1875-07-02","locations":[{"id":6062,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"SOMERSET, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2062,"title":"The Washington Globe, addressing different views","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-10","end_date":"1837-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One article had the headline, ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN D.C., the other article, CASH FOR 400 NEGROES, the year was 1837. On January 10, 1837, the issues of slavery and abolition were weighing heavy on the minds of many Americans. The House of Representatives had accepted petitions and memorials on January 9. One of those was from Representative Adams of Massachusetts. His petition was signed by one hundred and fifty women, wives, and daughters. The women, his immediate constituents, were praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. The petition was objected to by Representative Glascock. Adams was shocked by the objection; he did not expect any hostility to his petition. It was written in respectful terms, by women, mothers, and daughters. Congress had been decided previously that petitions of this kind would be received but disposed of afterwards. Adams felt that Glascock's objection violated the decision of the House as well as his constituent's freedom of speech. Adams argued that his petition was from persons of the greatest respectability and should be treated with dignity. The two men continued to debate the issue of petitions but ultimately, this was an issue of slavery, one man trying to keep an abolition petition from being recognized and another fighting for the right to petition. ","In the same paper and on the same day, an advertisement was posted for slaves wanted. The headline read, CASH FOR 400 NEGROES. Mr. James H. Birch, of Washington City, was in hopes of acquiring more slaves on that January day. He advertised for slaves of both sexes, with ages ranging from 12 to 25 years old. He offered to pay higher prices, in cash, than any other purchaser in the market. ","<em>The Washington Globe</em> exemplified the divide between abolitionists and the slave South in its two contradictory features in 1837. That day's article and advertisement, with very differing views, showed the divide between Northern and Southern ideologies. Edward Pessen writes about this distinction in How Different from Each Other Were the Antebellum North and South? He describes the different regions as two distinctive civilizations, the basic similarities within each of which transcended its internal differences.

He made the 40 mile journey by railway; this was Mr. Rawlins first time in Washington.  Traveling was not as accessible when Richard Rawlins was a child.  Therefore, this trip to Washington was a thrill for him. After registering at the Gadsby's Hotel in Washington, Rawlins journeyed down to the capital.  He entered the Rotunda, immediately drawn to four large hanging pictures.  The subjects included, The Declaration of Independence, The Surrender of Cornwallis (1781), The Resignation of Washington (1783), and the Surrender of Burgoyne (1772).  These were so powerful that Rawlins reflected in his journal, They bear such internal evidence of truth that the beholder is almost constrained to forget everything else in looking at them.  A bronze statute of Jefferson, seems to cause a thrill of admiration.  Next he ventured into the Senate.  Again the details of the splendid room stuck his attention.  Each member had a separate desks and large arm-chairs of mahogany.  The House of Representatives was built likewise.  Mr. Biddle defended the U.S. Bank with great energy while Rawlins observed.  ","Mr. Rawlins kept meticulous records of his time in Washington, expressing his pride in the capital.

According to Donald, Baker, and Holt, in their book <em>The Civil War and Reconstruction</em>, cities began to boom during this time.  Mr. Rawlins traveled to Washington via the railway.

However, on the afternoon of May 1, 1844, another new and exciting sight fascinated Whipple. The wonder of wonders was Professor Morse's electrical telegraph. Through the electrical telegraph, information was transmitted with almost the rapidity of thought. Railroad cars left with information of a nomination, for example, at the same time as the telegraph. However, the news transported via the telegraph was received one hour and a half before the cars arrived. The machine was simple and plain. Professor Morse had been working on it for 12 years. He gave Bishop Whipple a specimen of the writing as well as an explanation of the work. He was also able to hold communication with the man at the other end of the route. Bishop Whipple said he would never again doubt the extent of man's inventive powers. Wonderful, it is just wonderful He wrote of his time in Washington, There is much to please the eye, much novel and curious to investigate, and while I live I shall ever remember with pleasure my visit to Washington.","The invention of the telegraph, which so amazed Bishop Whipple, was a development that transformed the nation from in the 1800s. According to Tomas Nonnenmacher, writing in <em>The Journal of Economic History</em>, the telegraph industry began as a single monopoly patent and grew into a national monopoly. Nonnenmacher pointed out the significance of the telegraph in the development of technology: prior to the telegraph people relied on the Pony Express, homing pigeons, and the railroads. The invention spurred growth in many markets across the country, reducing information costs between firms and making news quickly transmittable over long distances.

R. Henry of Tazewell County, Virginia campaigned for a seat in Congress under the Democratic Party in 1886. People from neighboring communities such as Lynchburg, Abingdon and Wytheville voiced their full support of his campaign and hopes for his success in the quest for a seat in Congress in the November elections. Although varied in their syntax, the message behind Henry's supporters emphasized the same ideas and qualities that would make him an ideal candidate for Congress. His supporters all commented not only upon his strength, using words like commanding, but also upon his masculinity and physical appearance. He was characterized as being both tall and handsome and being a true type of physical and mental manhood. They also reflected upon class and status, typifying him as a gentleman of culture and character and a first class man in every respect. His supporters made continual reference to his service in the Confederate Army. With all of the praise that was given to Major R. R. Henry, one can only notice what was not being commented upon by his supporters, his strengths in the political arena. There is no mention of their support of his platform or any political ideas that he may have had, instead emphasizing his physical and moral character.","This article exemplifies the qualities that were found to be important in any political campaign during that time. Henry's character was found to be more important then the political decisions he has made in the past and any experience that he has in the political arena. Also, the continual reference to his service in the Confederate Army is reminiscent of the mounting processions many of the Democratic candidates used at that time. In these mounting processions, the candidate would ride in front of a long line of people mimicking Robert E. Lee to touch Confederate sentiments. Perhaps the lack of hard hitting platform issues may be due to the defeat of the Democratic Party in the assembly resulting in the party trying to avoid any friction that would result in future lost elections. ","It was also during this time that sectional diplomacy in the South became a prominent issue in politics. There was a divide in the South in forming either a Northeastern alliance or a Western alliance. This divide led to the formation of an Alliance Platform, which later became the platform adopted by the Populist Party. Many politicians of this time adopted this controversial platform, which emphasized subtreasury plans and other Southern ideals. It may be the case that for Major Henry, the lack of a political platform in the news article reflects the tension in platforms of the time. By leaving out any political ideation, and focusing on the physical and moral characteristics of the candidate, Henry might avoid the struggle within the political system relating the Alliance platform, and reach the constituents based on a more universally accepted stance - morality and character.

W. Leonard, the sheriff of Smyth County, Virginia received a letter from the sheriff of Barber County in Kansas. A man described by the Kansas sheriff as being 40 years old, 5 feet 8 inches in height and of dark complexion was seen wondering around Barber County, Kansas. The sheriff also described the man as being crazy. When questioned by the Kansas sheriff the stranger, who signed the name William J., said that he was from 7 Mile Ford, which is in close proximity to Smyth County. Also, the man, William, was accused by the sheriff in Barber County to be making paper money. The sheriff of Barber County made no indication that William J. had been arrested in connection to the paper money. Leonard was notified to see if a family member or friend of William J., would come to take him back to 7 Mile Ford. ","This episode highlights another instance of counterfeiting money that occurred in the South during the 19th Century. Although the money made by William J. was not seen by the sheriff of Barber County, Kansas as a systematic counterfeit system, it brought attention to the measures taken beginning in the 1830s to detect counterfeit bank notes. Prior to the national bank system put into place after the war, the predominant system of banking was state run. Therefore there were many state issued bank notes in circulation. The issue of such state bank notes caused much paper money confusion in the 1840s and 1850s. These bank notes had similar characteristics of shape, size, color and engraved notes, but the discount rate of these species varied and were difficult to determine. Between the 1840s and 1860s there was a multitude of state banks, each issuing their own bank notes having particular denomination and design. Many times, unskilled tradesman would accept both legitimate bank notes as well as the counterfeit without knowing the difference between the two. It was not until Robert T. Bicknell of Philadelphia began publishing a bank note reporter and counterfeit detector in 1830 that merchants were able to distinguish between the legitimate and counterfeit state bank notes. These counterfeit detecting services attempted to answer the question presented to many merchants, which were, first, if the note is genuine; second, is the issuing bank still in operation; and third, at what discount rate was this note acceptable. To answer these questions the bank note reporters and counterfeit detector contained items regarding locations of banks, the usual bank note list and a list of counterfeit and altered notes. However, the bank note reporter was no longer published by 1866, when a tax was issued on bank notes, leading to the abolishment of the use of such state issued notes. ","Perhaps William J., being described as crazy was trying to pass off the state money issued prior to the civil war while he was in Kansas, and was unaware that the use of that type of money was no longer valid. But even if William J., had tried to use this counterfeit money during the state banking system of the mid-19th Century, there were many safeguards to identify the illegitimate money in the form of bank note reporters and counterfeit detectors."],"display_date":"December 4, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-04","locations":[{"id":14278,"lat":36.8438879121,"lng":-81.53700883,"zoom":9,"place":"SMYTH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2081,"title":"Counterfeit Money\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-07-30","end_date":"1897-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Bristol County seemed to be up in arms in late July of 1897.

The unit remained in northern Florida throughout its service, where the Union naval blockade intentionally caused serious import shortages on goods like coffee, tea, and salt. Salt was a commodity that was vitally necessary to preserve perishable foods for the army. Before the outbreak of the Civil War, manufacturers would produce salt by extracting it from saline artesian wells and rock salt deposits. However, during the war, due to the Union naval blockade and limited imports, Frier and his comrades had to produce their own salt by filtering it out of the dirt on the floors of meat store rooms. Frier hardly knew what to call the substance they created, for he claimed it looked more like mud than salt, but he was determined to make the most of the discovery. He and the reserve company manufactured several bushels and used them to preserve their meat during the winter of 1863. However, they soon realized that there was limited supply of useful dirt, and Frier worried that a salt famine was on the horizon. ","Since filtering salt-laden mud was not a long-term sustainable practice, Florida residents had to find other sources of salt. The method by which salt production came to be cheapest and most efficient in the state of Florida was boiling sea water, a simple process which required little machinery and which became the largest industry in the state following the Civil War. The industry helped increase civic morale and inter-state interaction during the Civil War, as many Georgians and Alabamans set up operations along the Florida coast to produce salt to sell to their home states. Critical to the development of the domestic salt production industry in the region was, indeed, Frier and his army. The war forced Southerners like Frier to look to new ways of producing those goods of which they were deprived, while it also helped to expand the previously small-scale enterprise of a few Confederate soldiers into a state-wide industry. Although Florida was strategically and physically peripheral to the Civil War, the Union coastal blockade and the occupation of its ports helped shape post war issues and industries.

However, when fighting did cease and Ms. Long saw the Union flag flying above Florida's capitol building, she instead felt crushed and disappointed. In her diary, she expressed her concerns for the future of the plantation economy, as well as for the welfare of the newly freed slaves. She wrote, The blacks will be the sufferers, for there is not one in a hundred that knows how to make a living and many must starve and die for the need of the fostering care of their masters. Ms. Long went on to write that black mothers, in particular, were inadequate and habitually careless and neglectful. ","Ellen Long's fear for the immediate future of the slaves was one shared by other Floridians who did not think that blacks knew how to care for themselves without the provisions provided by the white plantations owners. However, blacks were not the only party for whom Long and other southerners expressed concern. They were, more than anything, anxious about how planters would cultivate their crops if they suddenly found themselves without the loyal assistance of slaves. When the war ended, planters throughout Florida assumed that they could retain their slaves for a few years and follow a process of gradual emancipation. The Federal authorities, however, prevented this and as a result, Ms. Long explained, the Southern planters hated the United States with a hatred that cannot be measured. ","The moral issues which Long brought up after the Civil War were not dissimilar from those introduced earlier by white Virginians in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Since that time, white Southerners perpetually told themselves that slavery was just and Godly and perhaps even the most beneficial arrangement for the slaves themselves. Historian Melvin Ely explained that many Southerners believed that blacks would live in a state of civilization only so long as whites ruled and guided them.

After describing the weather, terrain, and typical lifestyle, Dr. Byme acknowledged the differences between Florida cotton and that grown in other states but made sure to clarify the reason behind the variance. It is true that the average quality of Florida Cotton is not rated so high as that of the Sea Island, but the difference in this respect is chiefly, if not entirely, attributable to the defective manner of preparing the former for market. ","Despite the noted difference in quality, the long staple cotton of Florida sold for a high market price. This led Byme to claim that the lower quality (but greater amount) of Florida cotton was due more to a deficiency of care in its preparation for market than to an inferior product. Perhaps what Byme meant by claiming that there was a deficiency of care in cotton production was that the one-crop agricultural system implemented in Florida was problematic. It used crude, unscientific methods that left slaves incapable of working with the modern agricultural implements introduced in later years. Lacking versatility, Florida slaves could be taught little more than routine operations required in the growth of a single staple. ","In emphasizing the importance of quantity rather than quality for the Florida cotton planter, Byme was describing an economic reality of the region. When the Florida planter found that he could make an average crop of three hundred pounds of cotton to the acre, he was unlikely to bestow as much care on its preparation for market as the planter would on the Sea Islands of South Carolina where, Willie Lee Rose explained, one hundred twenty pounds was a good average crop. Dr. Byme wrote his pamphlet in such a way that clearly illustrated a widespread desire to jumpstart the Florida economy in the mid-nineteenth century. Byme praised the climate, landscape, people, and agriculture of Florida so as to prove the state's superiority over South Carolina and Texas, specifically. He boasted that Florida's seasons were more favorable to the production of cotton than those of any other Southern state. He wrote, Florida not only surpass[ed] Texas, but far excel[led] every other state in the Union.","In 1860, when Byme wrote the main article of his pamphlet, growing and selling cotton was, indeed, the most common way for Florida residents to earn cash. However, in future years, attempting to produce a cotton crop came to be a gamble for households that had limited labor resources (i.e. only had a small number of slaves, all of whom knew how to complete the same exact task). With the onset of the war, Floridians began to realize that they needed to reduce cotton production and increase food production if they wanted the South to survive. Many did not act through purely patriotic motives, however, but to the economic fact that cotton could not be sold in large quantities, and that foodstuffs, especially corn, could be readily sold and could produce a significant profit. Dr. Byme did not foresee the development of other agricultural industries when writing his pamphlet, but those readers who bought into his real estate propaganda soon learned the economic realities and needs of plantation life in the deep South."],"display_date":"April 1, 1860","search_date":"1860-04-01","locations":[{"id":1421,"lat":29.2235069663,"lng":-82.0960676488,"zoom":9,"place":"MARION, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2105,"title":"Economies At Odds\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-08-13","end_date":"1887-08-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Economic change was slow to come to the former Confederacy after the Civil War. Although railroads began to crisscross New South cities like Atlanta, dependence on an agricultural way of life made the cities of the South less likely sites of industrial development than their Northern counterparts. This impeded development was only further hindered by the outbreak of Yellow Fever in Montgomery, New Orleans, and Memphis, and a struggling economy in the decade following the civil war. "," When the long depression of the 1870s ended in 1879, southerners celebrated its passing, historians William Cooper Jr. and Thomas Terrill write, and the South's cities and industries remained small but portended better times. LaGrange Furnace Co. was part of one such industry. A Western Union Telegraph dated August 13, 1887 and addressed to O.M. Dunn Luht of Memphis reads, briefly: We will need the Engine and two flat cars tomorrow send man to run it. Answer. The telegraph represents a picture to which dozens like it in the LaGrange records attest: a southern company growing rapidly in size in a time of economic development, taking advantage of the railroad network expanding across the South to increase their market and expand the reach of their product. These railroads changed life along the Mississippi delta, as elsewhere in the South, for the LaGrange company and society at large. As Edward Ayers has written, the construction of a railroad touched people all up and down the track."," Cooper and Terrill note, however, that even as companies like LaGrange grew, they were no match for King Cotton, who kept southern economies in his grip out of necessity and expediency. Ayers explains it this way: in the immediate postwar years farmers could count on cotton when they could count on nothing else; it was easily grown by a farm family, nonperishable, in demand, seemingly profitable, and easy to get credit for. The records of the rapidly expanding LaGrange Furnace Co. were a window on the future of the South in the post-Reconstruction era (what Ayers and other historians have come to call The New South), but the growth of the sort of economy that the company represented was not imminent at the time their telegraph was sent. Cotton's influence, the most powerful force in Southern economies for generations, dictated that despite the growth of urbanization and industry, it would be a while yet until the South transitioned from its agricultural economy.

The widespread panic alluded to in the letter could scarcely begin to describe the chaos into which Southern communities along the Mississippi river were thrown. In his documentation of the 1878 yellow fever epidemic, John Ellis describes how the disease, which began in New Orleans, spread up the river: refugees from New Orleans and those who subsequently fled other stricken communities carried the infection up the Mississippi valley in successive waves by various means of transportation. The fever broke out in Vicksburg on August 9, and three days later in appeared in the small north Mississippi railroad toward of Grenada where it struck approximately 1,050 of the town's original 2,200 residents. As the yellow fever spread, so did the terror- by the time the threat of the epidemic made its way to Memphis, twenty-five thousand people fled the city.

On board were 145 bales of John A. Quitman's cotton. However, only 17 of the bales actually reached New Orleans as expected. The <em>Vicksburg </em>had an accident, and one hundred and twenty eight of Quitman's bales were unaccounted for. An accident such as this would have been very bad news for any southern plantation owner. Fortunately for Quitman, another ship picked up about two hundred bales of cotton out of the Mississippi River, some bearing the mark of Quitman's plantation, the Palmeya. Quitman could have only hoped that the remainder of his cotton would be recovered. "," On September 20, Quitman received a letter from A&J Dennis, the firm in New Orleans through which he shipped his cotton. The firm obviously had not received his shipment and had heard of the accident. A&J Dennis hoped that only a small portion of the cotton was actually damaged. Luckily for Quitman, he held insurance on his shipment. The insurance would cover the cotton at thirty-five dollars a bale, which would have been close to the value of Quitman's cotton. "," The destruction of the <em>Vicksburg </em>would have been very harmful to Quitman if his cotton had been lost. The importance of cotton in the 1830s cannot be overstated. The staple was the major cash crop of the Mississippi delta, and losing such a large shipment would have a negative economic impact on a plantation owner. The cotton trade had boomed in the beginning of the nineteenth century, making cotton the most important crop in Mississippi. "," The steamboat provided an efficient means to transport Mississippi's large shipments of cotton. In 1812 Steamboats began to run between Natchez and New Orleans.

By 1830 the steamboat was vital to the economic wellbeing of the Mississippi River area.

With very little money or land of their own, they were often unsure of how or where to proceed next. A system of sharecropping thus evolved where the newly freedmen rented tracts of land from landowners and were expecting to give the landowners a portion of the profits made from the crops harvested on that land. Labor contracts were then signed arranging the details of what was expected of the freedmen and of the landowner.","On February 17, 1865, newly freed Henry Kanes, signed a contract with Chandler Sueham in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. The contract allotted that Sueham, the landowner, would provide Kanes with the land and tools necessary to produce a crop, and in return, Kanes was to attend to Sueham's flock (no specific animal stated), as well as pay Sueham back one-third of the profits he gleaned from the land. Contracts like this led to discontent between the sharecroppers and landowners because they often felt like the other was not holding up their end of the bargain. Disputes arose because of beliefs that perhaps the sharecropper was not working hard enough, or that the landowner was not providing what was agreed upon in the signed contract. The Assistant Commissioner for the state of Mississippi, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Land, reported to General O.O. Howard on November 28, 1868, that there had been many complaints filed recently about these labor contracts. The problems reported were specifically prompted by an upcoming election for delegates to the state convention that had impelled many freedmen to leave their work for the purpose of attending meetings held by political aspirants. The landowners from the Mississippi delta region were particularly unhappy because the laborers had missed several prime harvest days for the meetings, and they felt that the crops had thus faltered. "," Instances like these led to the precarious situation that Mississippi found itself in after the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865. The majority of the newly freed people were generally unable to use what little savings they might have had to buy land of their own. Thus, they once again found themselves having to answer to a superior, who was normally a white man. The sharecropping system, originally intended to help the freed people on their way towards full independence had thus began to resemble the system of slavery that had prevailed for so long before it. The labor contracts were usually heavily weighted in favor of the white landowner, and the wages earned by the sharecroppers were so low that black women and children found themselves having to work so the family could survive. Women usually kept house for white families, and children engaged in seasonal field labor. Thus, emancipation did not eliminate the need for large amounts of labor in the South, and the labor contracts that resulted only slightly increased freedmen's control over their situation. In places like the Mississippi Delta, entire freed families found themselves working in order to make ends meet. Labor contracts gave the newly freedmen some sense of independence from white masters, but the conflicts that arose from the differing opinions of the laborers and landowners led to discontent among the majority of southerners dealing with the system of sharecropping."],"display_date":"February 17, 1865 - November 28, 1868","search_date":"1867-01-08","locations":[{"id":7123,"lat":32.4042572998,"lng":-88.6625666857,"zoom":9,"place":"LAUDERDALE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2174,"title":"A Desperate Plea to the Whigs of Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-10-06","end_date":"1836-10-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The nomination of a candidate for president proved to be a trying issue in Augusta County in 1836.

President Martin Van Buren echoed these sentiments in his speech to the second session of the Twenty-sixth Congress concerning the general state of the nation.  As almost half of the speech discussed the economic state of the country, the editors of <em>The Virginia Advocate</em> determined that it was important enough to publish the speech in its entirety on December 12, 1840.  Although Van Buren mentioned several other pressing issues, his main objective was to address the financial future of the nation and the recently confirmed Independent Treasury.  As he reviewed the catastrophic events that led up to the Panic of 1837, Van Buren assigned the crisis' blame to the national bank and the national debt, arguing that both were not merely unnecessary, but in direct and deadly hostility to the principles of [the people's] Government, and to their own permanent welfare.  Thus, Van Buren maintained that the best way to rectify the country's economy was to establish an independent organization to manage the government's funds, hence his creation of the Independent Treasury.  ","As James Roger Sharp has ascertained, Albemarle County only had a slight Whig majority at the time of this speech and thus, the newspaper article would have attracted intense political debate and discussion. At the time, the Democrats and Whigs of Virginia were both desperate to restore the state to its former prestige and influence in national politics; after Jackson refused to renew the Bank of the United States' charter in 1836 and the Panic of 1837, both parties separately hoped that they would solve the America's uncertain fiscal future. The Whigs fervently believed that a national bank was the only way to preserve economic unity and that, when held in check, the credit system was healthy for the economy. While the Whigs had remained united in their efforts to oppose Van Buren's Independent Treasury since its proposal in 1837, ironically, within the President's own party, it produced much more conflict.  In late 1835 a faction of conservative Virginian Democrats had emerged led by William C. Rives who, as historian James Sharp explains, condemned the exclusive use of hard money for the sale of public lands as impractical and the Independent Treasury as another utopian scheme - unfeasible and ineffective.  Although the Democrats managed to avoid a major split within the party they were anxious to maintain that party unity despite the controversial issue of the Independent Treasury. ","By the time of Van Buren's speech in 1840, the Virginian Democrats had regained many of their wandering conservatives but the debate over the economy had proved volatile enough to have successfully created an unforeseen impasse within the party. Liberal Democrats supported Van Buren's Independent Treasury because they had seen the results of wild speculation in the Panic of 1837 while conservative Democrats argued that if credit and inflation were carefully monitored, a system of state and local banks was more efficient.  Rives hoped to turn the Virginia Democratic party against Van Buren's administration but by 1838 it became clear that the majority of Virginia Democrats would not leave the national party, even after the proposal of the Independent Treasury. Slowly conservative Democrats despaired of changing the party's platform and completely lost heart when Rives did not win his bid for reelection to the Senate in 1839.  Most returned to the mainstream Democratic party and by 1840, the presence of the conservative Democrats in Virginia had disappeared.","<em>The Virginia Advocate</em> very astutely appealed to both the Whigs and the Democrats in Albemarle County by printing Van Buren's speech because the financial health of the nation was a mutual concern as both parties tried to resolve the issue.  Furthermore, since another presidential election was fast approaching, the political atmosphere intensified as southerners debated party platforms and the future course of the nation. Thus, Whig and Democrat alike in Albemarle County would have bought this paper and perused the president's speech with equal interest."],"display_date":"December 12, 1840","search_date":"1840-12-12","locations":[{"id":13596,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2195,"title":"Charles Manigault Complains of Slave Labor in 1844 Journal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-01-01","end_date":"1844-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["For at least four generations, Charles Manigault and his family had owned plantations in the Island region of  Chatham, Georgia and the Charleston District of South Carolina. In Chatham County, they invested a lot of money in growing rice, as did many planters across the lowcountry regions of both states. However, in 1844 Charles began to be slightly disgruntled with the labor production of his slaves and began comparing their efficiency to that of other slaves. Other planters told him that twelve bushels of clean winnowed rice would be average one day, but then the next day they would only get about five or six. This inconsistency was unsettling to most large planters. Manigault voiced his concerns with his overseer A.R. Bagshaw. Bagshaw told him that with the twenty-five slaves that were working the threshing area, they should get at least fifteen bushels a day. However, the week before they were only producing about ten bushels. This led to the consternation of Manigault and the overseer, and they blamed the slaves. They accused the slaves of finding ways to get around their production duties, and of only fulfilling them to the rule, not to the greatest extent. Bagshaw said that the slaves were cunning enough to remember that what they are harvesting they will have to thresh, and will tie as small sheaves as they can. Manigault tried to come up with a solution to this production problem, but Bagshaw assured him that the slaves were smart and efficient enough to find ways to get around them.","The problem Manigault had with his rice production was not unique to his plantation. In fact, it happened in plantations all over the lowcountry districts of South Carolina and Georgia. The unique rice-growing agriculture in those districts called for a different kind of labor than did the cotton or tobacco growing areas. There were limits to planter's authority all over the South, because no matter how harsh they were, slaves often were cunning or brave enough to find ways to subvert their master's plans. It was even easier for slaves to do this in the lowcountry rice area, where Manigault had his plantation, due to the type of task forces that were used for cultivating rice. The tasks were not based on time (such as working from 6 am to 6 pm) but on how many crops were produced. Planters decided what they thought was a reasonable amount of product, and the slaves had to cultivate that amount. Once the slaves were done, they often got to use their free time for other activities such as socializing, selling or tending their own crops, and other activities. So slaves, such as those on Manigault's plantation, found ways to produce the right amount of sheaves but made them smaller in size. This way, they could get around their masters orders while still fulfilling his supposed goals. Also, jobs on these plantations were more individualized than on cotton plantations, so an industrious slave could complete his day's work faster and have more free time than his owner expected. To some extent slaves could reject the clock on a rice plantation and work at their own pace as long as they completed the task. Also, not working as efficiently as a master wanted, but still getting working so as to avoid punishment, was a strong form of resistance among slaves. Slaves did not often feel personally about their work, so subverting their masters by producing slightly less was a good way to punish their owners. So although Manigault and his neighbors felt frustrated about the labor on their plantations, these frustrations were most likely felt all across the lowcountry districts of the South, due to the nature of their agricultural system and its needs, and to the cleverness of the slaves that worked their fields."],"display_date":1844,"search_date":"1844-07-01","locations":[{"id":1630,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2197,"title":"James Cody Sues John Baily Over Slander Regarding Illegal Trade\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-12-11","end_date":"1850-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James Cody of Bryan County, Georgia prided himself in having a good reputation as a respectable Southern man. When his neighbor John Baily accused him of buying rice from a slave without written permission from the slave's owner, he was extremely offended. He considered these accusations to be false and demanded to meet John Baily in court to settle this slanderous dispute. Cody felt that Baily's remarks offended his honor and implied that Cody was a dishonest trader and guilty of buying and keeping stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He felt that his good reputation was at stake and he needed to go to court to settle the matter. He also demanded that Baily pay him 5,000 dollars in damages, a huge sum in the 1850's.",">James Cody's indignation and determination to repair his honor, seek redress, and prove that he would not illegally trade with slaves demonstrates many important principles and customs of the South in the 1850's. Lawsuits about slander and false accusations were not uncommon in the South, especially among men. This was due to the fact that a man's honor was central to his sense of self and his public image, so any kind of slander or ill talk would be insulting. Insults, or anything that offended a man's honor, questioned a man's very masculinity. Many people in the South reacted very strongly to an affront to their respectability, and would take the accuser to court. For example, a man in Prince Edwards County, Virginia took his slanderer to court, saying he would rather get back his honor than get money in the case. To those Southerners who did sue for money, such as Cody, the huge amounts of money they asked for probably represented how offended they were at an affront to their honor. ","The second aspect of this case that represented the state of the South, was the fact that the specific slander regarded a white man trading with a slave without the master's permission. Black Codes or laws regarding slaves and their conduct had existed since the very beginning of the eighteenth century, but they got more rigid and more encompassing throughout the nineteenth century all across the South. It was illegal in most states by 1850 for a slave to trade or sell goods without his master's written consent. He was not allowed to trade publicly for his own benefit at all unless his master deemed this acceptable, which some did. A slave guilty of violating a law like this was often punished with a whipping. One reason for this law was that trading and selling allowed slaves some degree of autonomy and gave them their own money, if their master did not demand the proceeds they made from their sales. It also gave them more independence and could make less interested in their master's concerns, which was something whites came to fear more and more as the number of slaves rose. As their numbers rose, so did the potential threat for rebellion or a general challenging of complete white supremacy. Also, as questions over slavery were discussed elsewhere in the nation it added to the insecurity felt throughout the South.","The result of the Cody-Bailey case is not known, or was at least not documented in the court petition record, or it may have been lost over time. However, the important themes that arise in this case are themes that pervaded the pre-war South. The ideas of male honor, the power of slander and the lawsuits that could arise from it, and of the increase in slave codes throughout the South in the mid-eighteenth century, all speak of important ideals and trends in both Georgia, and the South, as a whole."],"display_date":"December 11, 1850","search_date":"1850-12-11","locations":[{"id":1562,"lat":31.8212333753,"lng":-81.1636262055,"zoom":9,"place":"BRYAN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2232,"title":"A Swindling Bookworm.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-09-03","end_date":"1897-12-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A man named William Mills Butler was arrested on September 3, 1896 in St. Louis, Missouri on the charge of mail fraud.

W. Adie wrote to his sister from Camden, Missouri on Janurary 9, 1888 after a lull in their family correspondence. He told his sister that he was recently employed by the Chicago Santa Fe and California Railroad. His main concern regarding this job was the weather in Missouri: you can rest assured it's cold enough. I have caught a bad cold and am not at work this morning. Adie did not mention much else of consequence in his letter except to inquire if another relation was also still employed in the Railroad business. He signed off the short letter by saying, give my love to all. I have nothing to say that would interest you so may as well stop writing these few lines excepting to let you know I am still in the land of the living. "," Before the Civil War, 96 percent of railroad manufacturers were northern based, and throughout the war, the North used their railroads much more successfully than the South. After the war, southern railroads were, almost devastated; much of their rolling stock was gone, and many tracks, stations, and bridges were ruined, according to the Robert O'Brien. But with the help of the federal government that sold cheap military railroad property to the South, along with, northern money and northern iron being poured into the south, by the 1880s and 90s, the railroad industry was at its peak growth point: 70,000 miles of track were laid in the 1880s alone. Historian John B. Boles observed that at this time the railroad grew to an extent matched by few independent nations; and trade networks proliferated and the volume of goods increased apace. The same text acknowledged the growth of railroads not only in places like Missouri where Adie was, but other southern states like Georgia, They quickly understood that railroads held the key to economic development: the rails that carried lumber out could also carry persons and goods back in. As the population of the region grew and the open range shrank, commercial agriculture took root with the railroads."," Adie was reasonably proud of his position on a railroad, since it was one of the only booming southern industries at the time. However, working conditions were still tough on actual railroad workers, especially with such a high demand for railroads in the late 1800s. Places like Missouri were often cold in comparison to the deep South, and men like Adie who were subject to the outdoor physical labor that railroad work required could easily get sick. Labor conditions for railroad work were often less than satisfactory, causing the railroad industry to be one of the first birth places for worker unions. There were particularly violent strikes in 1877 and 1894 over work wages, hours, and conditions. Adie reported working on the railroad just after the first strike, and a year after the Federal Railroad Administration was commissioned to ensure that safety regulations were followed for railroad labor in 1887. In this temporary lull of appeasement in between the strikes, even though he might have been prone to catch cold, Adie's actual labor conditions should have been better than before. "," As the twentieth century drew near, railroads became more regulated. In 1887 The Interstate Commerce Act put railroads under the financial supervision of federal institutions. By the Progressive area (post-1900s), the railroad became such a hugely prominent money making industry, that it eventually developed into a popular breeding ground for corruption and monopolies.

The New York Times reported on Friday, December 3, 1897 that the candidates for the position were Reverend John Gass of Little Rock, and William Montgomery Brown of Cleveland. The Diocesan Convention of the Episcopal Church of Arkansas met and elected Archdeacon William Montgomery Brown to work alongside the current Bishop Henry N. Pierce as Coadjutor Bishop. Bishop Pierce was already relocated to Little Rock, Arkansas in march of 1870 after his election to the position on January 25, 1870, where Brown joined him from Cleveland. His election, however, was not met with much approval from the Little Rock Episcopalian community. The New York Times stated bluntly that, The election of Archdeacon Brown has resulted in great dissatisfaction. "," The frustration that the public felt at Brown's election seems to have stemmed mainly from his economic standing and its potential effect on his clerical policies. On December 2, Governor Jones of Little Rock, a supporter of Reverend John Gass, accused Mr. Brown told the press that he felt Brown was unsuited for the job, saying that, an overwhelming majority of Arkansas Episcopalians belong to the low church, and Mr. Brown's chief qualification is his wealth. Jones also said that he believed that the economic difference, separates him from the people he is expected to bring to the church. If Mr. Brown is a true Christian at heart and desires to advance the cause of the church he will not accept this position."," This strong sentiment by the governor of Little Rock was reinforced by other accusations against Brown and his wealth. Col. Willaim G. Whipple, another active politician at the time, suggested to New York Times reporters that Brown won his position through intimidation by the high officials of the church. He was quoted as saying, his supporters seem to have relied chiefly upon his reputed wealth or that of some relative by marriage. This seems a poor qualification for a Bishop. Despite the initial reaction portrayed by the New York Times in 1897, Willaim M. Brown went on to succeed Bishop Pierce only three years later on September 5, 1900, becoming head of the region's diocese. And looking back, historian Dallas T. Herndon observed in 1922 that, under the ministrations of these several bishops [Brown included] the Episcopal Church has had a satisfactory growth in the state."," The Episcopal Church of the South in the nineteenth century was considered less prominent and had fewer followers than Methodist and Baptist institutions. Historian Samuel S. Hill attributes this smaller following, in Arkansas particularly, to the fact that Episcopalians tended to be of higher economic standing than most, putting them in a smaller demographic. Hill also suggests that, From Reconstruction to World War I the Episcopal Church in the South was concerned with two primary issues: recognizing and reorganizing and rebuilding after the war and continued growth with the creation of new dioceses. This validates the attentiveness given to the election of Archdeacon Brown, as the Episcopalian church was trying to re-establish its foundation in the South."],"display_date":"December 1, 1897 - December 3, 1897","search_date":"1897-12-02","locations":[{"id":752,"lat":34.7798418653,"lng":-92.3166533878,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2237,"title":"Arthur P.

Their son, Glenn, worked nearby on a tugboat that went up and down the Mississippi, and Frank, a tinsmith from New Orleans, continued a desperate search for work throughout the year. Alice, also out of work, remained on the houseboat most of the time, except for a few explorations of the city of St. Louis on foot to entertain herself. Both Frank and Alice wrote regularly to their brother and sister, Arthur and Ellen P. Thrasher. The correspondence from Frank and Alice to Arthur and Ellen illustrates the fact that Frank and Alice are having serious financial troubles harbored in Missouri, from which they cannot seem to get out from underneath. Alice wrote to Arthur on August 2, 1897, not a thing to complain about, only the lack of income. And consequently running behind financially. Alice spends much of her letter to Arthur relating to him how she felt blue and worried almost obsessively over finances, although she was very proud of Glenn for having a job, which was not easy to come by in St. Louis in that time. ","Alice made it very clear in her letters that the living and working conditions of St. Louis were uncomfortable and poor compared to other cities she lived in before that were farther south, like New Orleans. In her letter of August 2, And if we ever succeed in getting out, I think we will give it a 'wide berth' in the future. Alice and Frank had plans to sell the boat to the first buyer and head for home via New York City, but as Frank observed in a letter written on August 24, 1897: There don't seem to be anyone around here with money enough to buy a boat yet but I still am thinking there will be before many weeks now. Frank, who was a little more optimistic in his letters to his relatives than Alice, wrote in a letter postmarked July 12, 1897, Business is about the same with us. I have no work yet but think will have some soon. I put an ad in the paper and may hear something from that but will not be surprised in case nothing comes of it as money is sure scarce. ","From living on a houseboat, the Thrashers were able to get a broader perspective of conditions up and down the Mississippi than most southerners. Alice was aware of St. Louis in relation to other cities in the North and South, which she made clear in her August 2 letter: I am convinced this is the very largest city I was ever in. I have found just that it claims nearly 700,000 population. And since Brooklyn has helped to swell New York city's population, St. Louis has become the 4th city in size in the U.S. New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago being greater; they, running up into the millions in counting their population. She was also aware of the conditions in New Orleans because of her family there. When Mrs. Alice Thrasher wrote to their relations in New Orleans, she indicated that they were well off, and at times was slightly jealous in the letters to her sister, Ellen, Your letter was 'breezy and hopeful': I only wish I had some of the of the work that you and Aunt Lil each do. But while I have not, I am not so one- sided in my sympathies that I can't feel glad that you are prospering. "," Frank and Alice were well-traveled, and could see the differences not only between the cities of the northern and southern parts of the South, but the differences between the North and South as a whole. They often noted in their letters that their poor economic standing was not uncommon in other southern cities in the nineteenth century. Instead of a middle class, the South and its, conservative form of urban industrialism after the Civil War gave birth to a fairly economically polarized society. Factors that caused this gap between the very wealthy and very poor might have been a combination of economic, social and political factors which kept the region off what Jonathan M. Wiener called the classic capitalist path that had been blazed by England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and followed by the northern states. There was a large expectation for the South during Reconstruction to quickly join in the industrial revolution of the North. But cities like St. Louis, although big and bustling, did not always provide enough jobs for skilled craftsmen. Factories wanted men who could act as cogs in textile mills, not men like Frank Thrasher who was a skilled tinsmith. Even if Thrasher took a job in a factory, wages were shockingly low. Historian William H. Nicholls argued that perhaps, had the pace of the South's post-bellum industrial development matched that of the earlier industrial Revolution of England or New England... The Southern middle class would have flowered more profusely. Some historians, like Wilbur J. Cash, argue that because economics in the South were originally based on plantations, the region's middle class remained subservient to the values of the planter, the result of which was an economy that only benefited a small but powerful coalition of planters, merchants and industrialists. Cities like St. Louis in the nineteenth-century urban South did not get the economic boom for middle class men like Thrasher that the North did."],"display_date":"1895 - 1898","search_date":"1896-12-31","locations":[{"id":8037,"lat":38.6358212793,"lng":-90.2450510752,"zoom":11,"place":"ST LOUIS CITY, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2238,"title":"A Swindling Bookworm.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-09-03","end_date":"1897-12-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A man named William Mills Butler was arrested on September 3, 1896 in St. Louis, Missouri on the charge of mail fraud.

Ayers blamed the high birth rate combined with high levels of southern poverty meaning the South had twice as many minds to educate and half as much income to do it with."],"display_date":"September 3, 1896 - December 3, 1897","search_date":"1897-04-19","locations":[{"id":8037,"lat":38.6358212793,"lng":-90.2450510752,"zoom":11,"place":"ST LOUIS CITY, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2239,"title":"Ignoble and Impotent\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-03-04","end_date":"1895-03-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of Monday March 4, 1895, the Fifty-third Congress came to an end. The headlines that ran in the New York Times that day took the opportunity to let lose a harsh critique on that particular Congress. They read: A DISGRACE TO AMERICA, FAITHLESS TO PARTY AND COUNTRY, and, NO ONE REGRETS THE DISSOLUTION. The prestigious newspaper commented on the corruption and ineptitude of the political leaders in the Congress. After discussing several missed opportunities that the Congress failed to take proper action on, the New York Times listed the worst offenders in several states. Arkansas, along with several other southern states, had eight of its representatives' names appear on this list including James K. Jones, James H. Berry, Philip D. McChulloch, Jr., John S. Little, Thomas C. McRae, Willaim L. Terry, Hugh A. Dinsmore, and Robert Neil. Historian Dallas T. Herndon recorded each man's election to that disgraced Senate in 1922, The election for representatives in Congress was held on November 6, 1894. Those elected from the six districts in order were: P. D. McCulloch, John S. Little, Thomas C. McRae, William L. Terry, Hugh A. Dinsmore, and Robert Neill, all Democrats."," The New York Times seemed to be specifically attacking the Congress for its democratic majority. It suggested that the South's overarching democratic political sympathies and politicians were responsible for the problematic congress, not the North: the performance of the Democratic majority, coming into complete control of the government, entrusted with the power to embody in the laws... responsible for the prudent management of affairs, has been so lame and impotent that it may be said without offending Democrats, that nothing in the life of the congress became it so much as its taking off. The paper went on to accuse Democrats of being, stupid and, ignorant in their being out of sympathy with the conservative president of the time, Grover Cleveland. Jones, specifically, was accused of being, a rather narrow, weak, gullible, man who had, an unmitigated aversion for anything that smacks of sound money or loyalty to the president. He was held accountable for swaying the congress with those notions. "," The paper reported glumly that his term did not expire until 1897. In fact, James K. Jones stayed far past 1897, even though his name appeared first for Arkansas on the list of Those Who Have Betrayed the People in the 1895 edition of the New York Times. Jones's continued political career suggests that the political tone against Arkansas Deomcrats was not as hostile toward the end of the 1890s. The six representatives of the congress for Arkansas were then listed in order as, McCulluch a bullion coiner, Little who was willing to pay gold loans in silver, McRae whowould starve the commission out of office, Terry who voted against the silver repeal, Dinsmore who has been all the objectionable things in legislation on finance, and Neil, a starver of the merit system."," Although political tensions between the North and South lessened from the height they had been during Civil War, it was not all together gone, particularly in government. The two different parties came head to head with different ideals and ideas for the administration of the country. This open attack by a northern newspaper on the southern Democratic influence in the national government showed that although the war was long over, America was still working out how to merge a nation distinctly separated into North and South, Republican and Democrat."],"display_date":"March 4, 1895","search_date":"1895-03-04","locations":[{"id":456,"lat":34.2896663051,"lng":-91.374617067,"zoom":9,"place":"ARKANSAS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2240,"title":"Widow made executrix of 3,500,00 property","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-12-01","end_date":"1897-12-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 1, 1897 the papers of the recently deceased John E. Ligget declared his widow the sole executrix of his account. This meant that she had exclusive control over seeing that the provisions of Mr. Ligget's will were satisfied, and had control over all other matters concerning the deceased's estate. Mr. Liggett was a wealthy tobacconist, and upon his death, relinquished his entire estate in St. Louis, Missouri valued at 3,500,000 to Mrs. Liggett. ","The legal status of women in the nineteenth across America was still far below their male counterparts. Edward Pessen noted that this was particularly the case in marriage at this time, where women were often even considered their husband's property in the eyes of the law, and denied many of the same property rights. These social and legal constrictions made it very hard for women like Mrs. Ligget to come into sole possession of any property at all because normally, as Pessen remarks frankly, the wife is dead in law. This suggests that even inheriting property easily turned into an uncertain ordeal in the nineteenth century, because if a man contested a woman's rights to the property, it is very likely the law would recognize his claim over a female's. "," In Pessen's view of women's legal status in the 1800s, Mrs. Ligget is an exception to the general law applications in the nineteenth century. One explanation for this, however, could be that her fortunate property circumstance was affected by where she lived. St. Louis was a growing industrial city, and often cities were not only the first to shift to modern economics, they also tended to be ahead of many rural areas when it came to social and legal reforms. Significant changes in women's rights occurred in the early twentieth-century, so it's possible that St. Louis, as a modernizing city, already began to broaden the legal liberties given to women at the time of Mrs. Leggit's inheritance. The fact that she was of a high social class also could have helped her bypass some legal restrictions against the female possession of the estate after Mr. Leggit's death. "," Though Mrs. Ligget's property circumstance may have been unique to places like St. Louis, it was not uncommon for tobacconists like the Ligget's to hold a high economic status in the post-bellum south at large. One of several economic booms for tobacco companies as a prosperous industry came right after the Civil War. Men like Washington Duke who developed a machine that could produce two hundred cigarettes per minute and Julius Carr who sold about five million pounds of tobacco in a year, proved that the tobacco trade was lucrative in an industrializing South. "," The fact that a woman was on the receiving end of such a profitable business, especially one that functioned on a national level, marked the beginning of a shift toward women's legal rights. Before the Civil War, southern women were often unable to be a significant part of anything politically or economically meaningful. During the Civil War this mentality changed for many southern women, and as Elizabeth Hayes Turner observed in John B. Bowles's A Companion to the American South, roles that formerly had belonged to men blurred as women assumed control over children and slaves, in the absence of their husbands. As the war came to a close, women became more prominent figures in the management and labor of textile mills in particular. With this modification of the social and economic role of women, by the end of the war Confederate soldiers came home to a new woman. But, for the most part it was not until later in the twentieth-century that they were willing to fully recognize it."],"display_date":"December 1, 1897","search_date":"1897-12-01","locations":[{"id":7921,"lat":38.6407017012,"lng":-90.4430188422,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2245,"title":"The Art of Snuff-Taking\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-29","end_date":"1835-01-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Surveying Jacksonville society, Leigh Hunt saw humor in the consumption of tobacco. Men of all classes, of all shapes and sizes, employed distinctively bizarre methods of using tobacco. Inhaling dry tobacco powder seems simple enough, but the means to that end varied upon the artistic originality of the southern man. Some gentlemen were quite convulsive, propelling the powder upward into their nostril and shaking their bodies violently as it entered their systems, while others had a polished demeanor, a smooth relaxation marking their snuff-taking. There were those that liked a fast, sharp movement, and those who enjoyed the experience and refinement that accompanied the act. The mode of their consumption depended on what they hoped to gain from the snuff: public attention or tobacco sensation. For all, however, the thread that bound them was that snuff-taking was, or at least appeared to be, one of the more routine and fundamental acts in their daily lives.","Dr. Johnson was a particularly unique snuff-taker. He was of the kind of tobacco user that had a luxuriance of gesture and a lavishness of supply that would often overflow onto his neck cloth. If there are species of snuff-takers, Dr. Johnson was of the long-armed variety. He stretched forth his arm, as a snuff taking elephant might his trunk, having already pinched the powder from his waistcoat, and shook his head, nose, and snuff all at once. His eyebrows even lifted up to clear space for the onset of the mild tobacco effects. Once finished, he straightened himself, proclaiming victory over the precious moment, and let out a great bah for all onlookers to hear.","Hunt's journal entry published in the Jacksonville Courier describes in great detail an old custom of southern men, imported from the French through London as part of a stream of European cultural influences. The larger narrative here, of tobacco consumption in the South and the world, is the story of the founding of this nation. John Rolfe, leader of the Jamestown settlement, was driven by English investors to make a profit on tobacco. The first shipment of the golden weed arrived in England in 1617 and by 1650, one fourth of English people smoked everyday. Sailors enjoyed tobacco because of the mild high it induced and demand exploded across continental Europe.","Supply raced to catch up and tobacco cultivation expanded outward from Jamestown into Virginia and North Carolina. The New World's economy even used the cash crop as currency and record of debt; Emanuel Driggus, a free black farmer in Myne Owne Ground, once sold a horse for 2000 pounds of tobacco and was fined 475 pounds by the county court in 1672. Small farmers and large planters alike grew tobacco and its lasting impact is in the way it fueled the rise of the plantation agriculture system and African slave trade. Although it would be supplanted by King Cotton as the major cash crop of the South in the 1800's, tobacco consumption, and its manifestation in the custom of snuff-taking, was most influential in the establishment of the early southern economy, its trading partners and local barter markets, and the spread of slavery across the region."],"display_date":"January 29, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-29","locations":[{"id":1324,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2263,"title":"North Carolina Needs Capital-Not Labor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-09-17","end_date":"1877-09-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By September, 1877, Governor Vance of North Carolina, elected in 1876, called upon the immigrant laborers of Northern cities, such as those currently on strike in Baltimore, to venture to North Carolina to fill what he perceived to be a labor shortage in North Carolina manufacturing and industry.

During this period and beyond, the tobacco industry boomed in the North Carolina Piedmont region.

Important enough that it was stored with the Duke family's personal belongings, one postcard from the late nineteenth century displayed a famous Timothy O'Sullivan photograph taken of the McLean family seated on the steps of their home. The postcard told the story of April 9, 1865, where Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant in the house of Wilmer McLean at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. The two Generals met in a room on the left side of the house and drew up the articles of surrender that marked the end of the War Between the States. The interesting part of the Surrender House history was just beginning as shown by the last line on the back of the postcard - This building was torn down to be rebuilt a St. Louis World's Fair.","The discovery of the postcards in the attic added to the history of the Surrender House. In 1867, the McLean family sold the house and moved to Alexandria, Virginia where Wilmer McLean had been born and built his fortune before marrying the widow Virginia Mason and moving to Appomattox County, Virginia. After transferring hands a few times between the Pascoe and Ragland families, M.E. Dunlap of Niagara Falls, New York, who had lofty plans for the property, eventually bought the house. Originally, his zealous plans were to move the house either to St. Louis as stated in the quote of the postcard or to Chicago for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893.","Instead of hiring New York architects and contractors, Dunlap kept the process local and hired a Lynchburg, Virginia contracting company by the name of Hardy and Hancock Contractors to draw up blueprints of the house in order to have it successfully dismantled, moved, and rebuilt in its new location. In February of 1893, C. Hubbard of Hardy and Hancock Contractors made five blueprints of the building: the basement plan and house section, the front porch cornices and columns, the window and mantle details, the first floor plan, and the second floor plan. Unfortunately, the plans to move the house to the World's Fair never materialized, so Dunlap decided to have the house moved to Washington, D.C. where it would be on permanent display. Dunlap ordered for complete dismantlement of the house before running into a shortage of cash and legal problems. Thus, the house sat boxed in Appomattox County for 50 years where the wood rotted and the bricks crumbled.","Either a member of the Duke family bought the postcard at Craighill and Jones, Inc. in Lynchburg, Virginia or someone - a friend or a relative - sent it to the Duke family.

At the time the McLean House postcard was printed, Appomattox County residents including the Duke family believed the house would not remain at its current location, and only pictures and postcards would serve as reminders of the house's rich history.

Brown knew he needed to convey to the statesmen gathered that the division of Florida territory into east and west partitions, and the prolonging of the territorial phase therein, was both inadmissible and undemocratic. Brown, speaking for the Committee on the Territories, implored the House to strike down Bill H.R. No. 431. He began by appealing to the American ideal of self-government, a tactic that should carried some weight in front of a Congress who still vividly remembered the American Revolution. By 1844, the territorial-government phase in Florida had dragged on for 23 years. As such, its citizens had no formal political rights in Washington outside of a single delegate. Self-government was the maxim of America...that high privilege, the right of all men; Florida could no longer be denied participation while being subject to the supreme and despotic rule of those in Washington. Brown sounded much like Thomas Paine that day, and everyone in the room could relate to his words.","Brown then moved to describe the people of Florida as freedmen whose bosoms...heave with all the same impulses of liberty which mark the character of their fellow citizens. To such a population, the 23 years of absolute dependence had been degrading and injurious. The substance of his argument then became clear: Florida's entrance into the Union would serve mutual interests by relieving the federal government of the responsibility, expense, and trouble of maintaining the territory, while Florida would finally obtain formal political rights. In addition, the expedited admission of Florida would coincide with that of Iowa, maintaining the equilibrium of free and slave states. Brown concluded by again asking Congress to throw out Bill No. 431.","A.V. Brown's speech highlighted several divisive issues. The idea of a separate East and West Florida divided Floridians throughout the territorial phase. Not only was there physical and psychological separation between the two areas due to Florida's vast size, but divisionists argued that the cost of running a single state would be too high. They argued to delay the state-forming process, let the population increase, and then divide into two smaller territories. Unionists argued for Home rule, autonomy, and the benefits, such as education grants, that statehood would bring. David Levy Yulee, the most influential figure in Florida's antebellum history, backed the unionists and advocated for a United Florida. He served from 1841 to 1845 as the territorial delegate to Congress, leading Florida to statehood, and was subsequently elected as the first Jewish senator in U.S. history.","The entrance of Florida as a slave state, to balance the Union, was the substantive crux of the positions of Brown and Levy. Slave labor was essential to Florida's economic development; planters had poured in from the lower South after Spanish cession through the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1821 to establish cotton plantations in middle and western Florida, around Tallahassee. Just as with Maine, Missouri, and other territories admitted during the period, politicians sought to maintain a tenuous balance of power. Admission of Florida became more attractive as the application for statehood of a free territory, Iowa, appeared on the horizon and came up in 1846. Less than a year after Brown's speech, on March 3, 1845, Florida became the twenty seventh state of the Union."],"display_date":"June 17, 1844","search_date":"1844-06-17","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2279,"title":"E.P.

Buford, Esquire, he congratulated Buford on being chosen as the Committee's Canvasser for Brunswick County, Va. Ellyson affirmed his confidence in Buford's abilities and willingness and urges him to accept the position early in order to prepare for the contest.","Economically, the Panic of 1893 was one of the worst crises in the history of the United States. Although there was no consensus on the cause of the Panic, several different factors contributed, beginning around 1890. One of the important factors was a run on the gold supply, where people traded in their silver notes for gold notes. Since so many people traded in their silver notes, the U.S. Federal Reserve reached the minimum amount of gold required in their vaults and people could no longer trade in their silver notes. After this occurred, many banks failed, thus causing the price of silver to plummet. Once the banks failed many railroads (and then companies) in the West and Northwest followed suit and filed for bankruptcy. Thus, the estimates for the number of bank failures and companies reached approximately 500 and 15,000, respectively.","Politically, Americans blamed the Democrats and President Grover Cleveland for causing the Panic. Therefore, when it came time for elections, it was important for the Democratic Party to attempt to withstand the pressure and come out on top. The Virginia State Democratic Committee was looking for strong, respected community leaders to help get the votes within each individual county. This role of soliciting votes fell to the county Canvasser, and in the case of Brunswick County, the Committee chose E.P. Buford for the role.

Guion wrote that his plantation had increased in both size and productivity since his first application for a loan due to the fencing of his land, the erection of a cotton gin and a gristmill, and from the cutting of ditches. As security for the additional loan he offered to the bank his plantation and sixteen slaves whose ages ranged from sixteen months to fifty years. It is unknown if the bank granted his loan. ","Banks in Louisiana were encouraged by the state to make large loans to planters in order promote agriculture and commerce. The state mandated that banks open branches in plantation areas and make a certain number of mortgage loans, specifying the geographical distribution of the loans around the state. Although collateralized transactions usually accounted for a small number of credit transactions, slaves were the most popular form of collateral for those short-term and long-term loans that required collateral. For example, slaves accounted for 80 percent of the securities offered in recorded mortgages in antebellum East Feliciana Parish in Louisiana. Slaves could also be used as collateral for purchasing shares in Louisiana's investment banks. ","In the South, slaves were property-they could be bought, sold and transported to any location that allowed slavery. As property, their owners could use slaves when they needed loans. The income stream, or the prospective value of a slave on the present market, influenced the amount each slave was mortgaged for; thus a slave's value was measured in cash. The mortgages usually consisted of recognition of a debt by the debtor and a description of the debt and the property being mortgaged and the time and means by which the mortgaged property had been purchased. Banks all over the South allowed slaveholders to use their slaves as collateral. The Bank of Charleston in South Carolina, founded in 1834, accepted at least five hundred and twenty nine slaves as collateral for mortgages and loans in the years before the Civil War. They also confiscated and owned an unknown number of these slaves when loans were defaulted upon. The Georgia Railroad and Banking Company that was founded in 1832 confiscated at least one hundred and sixty-two slaves from defaulted loans before the Civil War."],"display_date":"April 8, 1838","search_date":"1838-04-08","locations":[{"id":5559,"lat":29.3204554147,"lng":-90.0865534097,"zoom":8,"place":"LAFOURCHE, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2292,"title":"A Letter to Congress\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-06-23","end_date":"1842-06-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Several planters and sugar manufacturers from Jefferson Parish joined with citizens from parishes across the state of Louisiana in signing and sending a letter to the United States Congress pleading for increases in tariffs on imported sugar. Stating that the Tariff of 1832 had caused the agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing interests of Louisiana's sugar industry to become paralyzed, they said Louisiana sugar planters needed tariffs on sugar to be high so that Americans would buy their domestic sugar instead. The planters claimed that soon every mechanic, every manufacturer, every merchant, every farmer, every corporation, in our happy Union, [would become] a bankrupt. The planters urged Congress to reinstate the Tariff of 1816, so as to protect the industry.","This letter shows an instance where economics dominated over regionalism in the South. Generally, the South exported their goods and bought imported goods, making them favor lower tariffs. Tariffs were meant to protect United States industries from foreign competition, and since most of the South did not have U.S. market interests they did not care for the tariffs. But the sugar industry did care; they hoped to dominate the American market, but to do that they would need foreign sugar to cost more, and thus they favored high protective tariffs.","This favoring of high protective tariffs meant that planters across the South voted for politicians who also favored protective tariffs. Generally this meant that Southern planters voted for the Whigs. The Whigs supported high tariffs so as to protect homegrown interests. Tariffs proposed in Congress were usually voted for by Whigs, while Democrats generally opposed and tried to stop the passage of tariffs. The Whigs also appealed to Southerners because they believed in states' rights. These shared values helped create a mutually beneficial relationship between the party and the South.

Because of this, there was less money to spend on education and commonly if money was tight, boys were favored to send off to school. Poor white women had to look for work. Southern ideals, however, called for women to stay away from masculine things like politics and work or else they would corrupt their femininity.","Shirley may have held this idea of womanliness, wanting to come home and help her so she would not be ruined by such masculine endeavors.

Travelers relied on local people along these western routes to help provide them with necessary equipment and foodstuffs they needed on their journeys. Looking to capitalize on the growing market, Fleming Wood and his partner Egbert Harris hoped to establish a trading post in the area bordering the boundary line between the military base of Fort Smith, Arkansas and the Choctaw tribe of the Cherokee Nation. "," However, volatile relations that existed in Arkansas and throughout the South between whites and Native Americans stood in the way of simple establishment of a trading post. This was largely from exploitation felt by the Native Americans forced onto reservations and the cultural devastation caused by the white trade of vices such as alcohol. To help ameliorate these problems, the U.S. government created intercourse laws to regulate trade among the two groups. To work within these laws, Wood and Harris enlisted the help of M. Stokes, a lawyer for the Cherokee Nation; with his help, the traders obtained a trading license. "," Yet their luck as traders turned on September 9, 1837. Captain William Armstrong, the acting supervisor of the Western Territory, revoked their license and claimed that the traders had become among the largest whiskey dealers on the line. Though legalized sale of alcohol in Arkansas to whites was commonplace, the spirits sold by Wood and Harris' in their trading post broke the intercourse law because it created direct mercantile competition with the Cherokee Nation. In the interests of both governments, Armstrong also ordered his men to seize remaining goods in the post in order to keep the Indians from visiting the line as much as possible, [and] to prevent the introduction of liquor into the Indian country, and other violations of law. "," Angered by their loss of property and sales in the post, on December 12, 1838, Wood and Harris appealed the revocation of their license. The already volatile relations between the U.S. government and the Cherokee Nation intensified. Almost simultaneous with the appeal, U.S. government officials forced Cherokees off tribal lands during the Trail of Tears. Years of abuse, killing and enslavement of Native American populations ensued, and created juxtaposition to events in the Fleming Woods case that occurred over the course of the next three years. The Cherokee Nation, U.S. government, and the two traders discussed the issue of licensure and seizure of goods in a major review of the Indian Affairs policies. A turning point in U.S. governmental policy, the Fleming Woods case forced U.S. officials to recognize a greater Native American autonomy even in the face of their actions in forced relocation.

She claimed to have knowledge of the whereabouts of Peter McQueen, an Indian prophet whom the United States Army had been pursuing for some time. General Jackson had recently just narrowly missed capturing his at Natural Bridge. As per his quick temper, the general was enraged. This Seminole woman presumably heard through word of mouth-there were some Indians serving under General Jackson's command-about his near miss. She offered to turn McQueen over to the United States in return for General Jackson to allow her people to be transported to the land of the upper Creeks, with sufficient provisions to tide them over until they could establish themselves agriculturally. In his furor, Jackson readily agreed to this pact, and she departed with a letter to the commanding officer of Fort St. Marks detailing the agreement. This was, however, the last recorded sighting of her. She never upheld her end of the bargain, nor did she seek further assistance from General Jackson in the relocation of her people. McQueen was, indeed, never captured.","The Seminoles, including the unnamed woman, were directly related to the Creeks. They were in fact originally members of the Creek confederacy in Alabama and Georgia. They migrated to Florida, however, in three distinct phases. In the first half of the eighteenth century, they executed small invasions of Spanish territory, but with the intent to raid white villages, rather than to establish settlements of their own. In the second half of the century, they began establishing villages; by 1812, the Seminoles inhabited at least six towns in Spanish Florida. From 1812 to 1820, the political and cultural tensions in Georgia and Alabama led many Creeks to move to Florida and join the Seminoles already living there. So when the Seminole woman asked General Jackson to help her people move back to the upper Creek nation, she was not asking for him to help her people invade another tribe's land. She was just asking to go home.","This incident is also a clear indication of the growing power of Seminole women. From 1812 to 1820, they experienced a significant increase in their ability to exist formally outside of the household. With the migration of Seminoles to Florida, they came increasingly into contact with whites, allowing them to enter into small trade with them. These agricultural business transactions-primarily involving Seminole women growing and selling oranges, melons, corn, rice, and peaches to whites-greatly increased the political legitimacy of these women, thereby giving the unnamed woman the authority to strike her deal with a general in the United States Army."],"display_date":"April 18, 1818","search_date":"1818-04-18","locations":[{"id":1280,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2334,"title":"Captain Call&#39;s Good Call in Pensacola\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-01-01","end_date":"1817-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Captain Richard R. Call was an optimist; he was a man firm in his faith in American superiority. He also would either have made a very good lawyer or had very gullible friends. Captain Call convinced seven of his friends that it would be a good idea to buy land in the territory of a foreign country and in a region that appeared to be overrun by savage and American-hating Native Americans. So, in the fall of 1817, he traveled with some his friends to Pensacola, Florida-which was still Spanish territory and was still heavily populated by Seminoles. While in town, he and his companions purchased 80 acres on the south side of town, 2,000 acres on the bay-two to three miles from town-and a number of unimproved lots within the city. The deeds for all of this property were, obviously, written in Spanish and codified by the Spanish court, not the American. Yet Captain Call was not purchasing this land because he had faith in the future of Spain.

Although Captain Call was certainly not alone in his prediction, the public goal of the war was not to force Spain to hand over Florida. It was a retributive war against the Seminoles, and once which it can be argued, never really ended. The Seminoles, unlike the Creeks, did not have a central leadership structure, making it practically impossible for the United States to sign a treaty with the Seminoles.

Sam advised his son to pursue the profession of medicine. As Sam explained it, becoming a doctor would not prevent him from being a farmer. Rather, Sam found it vitally in your advantage to be acquainted with the science of medicine, and it is an easy profession to acquire. According to historian James Volo, the medical profession in the antebellum period thought of itself as knowledgeable and humanitarian, but its practitioners were neither selective in their methods nor well regulated by their fellows. Such methods were still based upon medieval concepts and home remedies. A country doctor-which William would be if he returned to Clark County, Alabama-was even less advanced in practical methods due to the lack to intellectual stimulation from living in rural areas. In other words, even though studying to become a doctor would be respectable and considered knowledgeable for William, it would still be an easy profession, as Sam stated, for him to acquire.","Sam Forwood's reasoning behind his advice was that he knew about the hardships that farmers in Alabama faced at the time. As William Rogers explains, in Alabama, one of the states making up the Cotton Kingdom, the fluctuation of cotton prices, the higher cost of purchasing goods in a protected market, and the lack of economic development and diversification contribute to the unsettled economic conditions that characterized the time. The uncertainty of farming - when it would rain, how much it would rain, etc. - dominated letters among antebellum southern planters. Sam Forwood himself exclaimed anxiety about his crop of cotton being small, yet hopefully highly priced. Focusing on another profession, William Forwood could ease his dependence on this lifestyle of ambiguity. Although doctors belonged to what would be considered the white elite class, they still depended upon the agricultural success of the Cotton Kingdom. Certainly, doctors were a very separate occupation, which only served to build up the resources in a local society. Nevertheless, such occupations still depended on Alabama's economic vitality, which undoubtedly depended on cotton. With this in mind, William could still find time for farming-that occupation upon which southern society hinged. William Forwood did take his father's advice. In 1848, he returned to Alabama to pursue the medical profession.

First, Alexander thought that slavery allowed a greater number of talented individuals to devote their time to studying and spreading their knowledge through all ranks of society, benefiting all. Without slavery, white young scholars could not attend colleges and academies, which are of infinite advantage to any country. At this point in his essay, Alexander refuted the objection that slavery denied blacks from these opportunities by stating that the slaves were allocated to their proper position in society, seeing that they are entirely incapable of self-government. He felt that slaves were able to perform the drudgery and duties that white people could certainly not do. Furthermore, Alexander argued that, judging from the ignorance and incapability of the wild Africans, blacks benefited from being in subjugation to whites. Slavery taught these barbarians how to be civilized and humane because masters lovingly took their slaves with them to church. Lastly, slavery also helped the country as a whole, amassing wealth and the capability for defense.","On the other hand, Alexander acknowledged disadvantages to the institution of slavery simply because advantages were always accompanied by disadvantages. He explained that slavery mars the peace and tranquility of the overseer by their natural waywardness and stupidity. Furthermore, the number of enslaved occupants of the country diminished the number of free white citizens that could inhabit the country. Last but not least, slavery set an example of autocracy, reputing the republican principles that the Constitution stood for.","These views were common to southerners in Franklin County, Alabama, and across the entire South. Southerners everywhere had to build a body of ideologies and answers in order to classify slavery as advantageous. It is not clear where Alexander retained his opinions. However, the fact that this essay was an assignment in the schooling of a southern youth legitimizes this ideological notion that white southerners had to talk themselves into the morality and rightful authority of enslaving millions of people. The slave South used the concept of paternalism-governing or ruling over a group of people in a fatherly manner out of necessity-as the official defense to slavery, believing that it was beneficial to both master and slave. The fragile contradictions of slavery required southerners to believe that the blacks could not take care of themselves, making it necessary and right that the superior group care for them. In order to prolong society and culture as they knew it, the southerners who were instructing Alexander Allen and his generation imposed these concepts into their basic education."],"display_date":"1830 - 1849","search_date":"1840-01-01","locations":[{"id":162,"lat":34.5339170174,"lng":-87.6962673407,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2341,"title":"Sylvia, the Runaway Slave","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-09-30","end_date":"1836-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1836, Sylvia, about twenty years of age, of common size, very likely and almost black, was sold from her plantation in Conecuh County, Alabama to the plantation of Thomas L.

After several months with no sign of Sylvia, her owner finally decided to make a more public announcement. On September 30 of that same year, the Mobile County Register published a 10 reward pending the return of this runaway slave. Sylvia's rightful owner expected her to return to her former plantation in Conecuh County and whomever she missed there.","Across the South, the domestic slave trade daily uprooted slaves from their homes and dropped them into some foreign land without regard for their personal well-being. Of all the interstate slave sales leading up to the Civil War, twenty-five percent destroyed first marriages and fifty percent destroyed nuclear families.

The Forwood family was generally in sufficient health, despite a fever here and there. However, in this letter, Sam chose to include the conditions of his slaves. He wrote, My family is in good health except one negro woman and a little negro boy over two years old. The black woman had been plagued by a slight fever, and the young slave boy had broken a bone rough-housing with some of the other slave children. Following this mention, Sam continued his letter with the normal discussion of his cotton crop and other business around Clark County.","This is not an exception in the history of southern slavery. Slave owners often included slaves as a part of their household. As Edward Ayers points out, in most instances, masters and slaves mutually cared for one another, and masters would grieve for slaves as a member for the family. Because the idea of family was so important in the southern Christian culture, masters frequently included their slaves in their notion of their family unit. The inclusion would, in theory, civilize the slaves with Christian influences because slaves who respected their masters-as children who respect their fathers-would never seek to harm them. Furthermore, the slaves' own family units, like those of their masters, kept a degree of humanity and happiness instilled in the plantation dynamics.","Moreover, slaves were the livelihood of southern plantation owners, and thus owners were necessarily concerned about the health of their slaves. According to William Roger, slavery was an indispensable component of the cotton kingdom, and so, the success of an Alabama plantation and the success of its owner rested upon the slaves. Surely, a slave with a broken bone or a fever was of no use. Therefore, Sam Forwood had no choice but to care about the well-being of their slaves."],"display_date":"May 7, 1840","search_date":"1840-05-07","locations":[{"id":78,"lat":31.6767353507,"lng":-87.8307270777,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2346,"title":"B.F.

Porter was an important individual around Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Not only was he a practicing lawyer, but he owned a large crop of cotton and produced valuable gin. However, someone apparently had a problem with his extracurricular activities. On February 21, 1842, the Mobile Commercial Register reported that Mr. Porter's gin house, along with his entire cotton crop, went up in flames only a few days before. According to the paper, the fire appeared to have been intentionally set. From this article, it is unclear as to whether Mr. Porter was the victim of an enemy seeking revenge or a dogmatist attempting to make a statement for the temperance movement. What is clear about this time period is a great difference of opinion when it came to alcohol consumption. In the antebellum South, Charles Wilson explains that alcohol was a basic part of life in which isolated farmers, as Mr. Porter may have been, utilized distilling to retard spoiling, reduce bulk, and enhance the marketability of their crops. Even though the temperance movement had begun to gain speed in the nineteenth century, it was not yet able to get a foothold in the South. This was due to the economic circumstances of farmers like Mr. Porter and the perceived link between abolitionism and temperance. In Alabama specifically, the temperance movement took form prior to the Civil War but only strengthened along with the other reform movements during the twentieth century.","Nevertheless, the 8 percent of antebellum southerners who did make temperance pledges were adamant and extreme in their views. Alcoholism brought a great number of dangers to southern society, including violence, economic insecurity, and even suicide. Therefore, the temperance movement was able to build a small base of support despite the customary position of alcohol in society. This small percentage was undoubtedly the most radical of the population, and their extreme views led to extreme action. Unfortunately, Mr. Porter may have been a victim of such action."],"display_date":"February 21, 1842","search_date":"1842-02-21","locations":[{"id":383,"lat":33.2726735133,"lng":-87.5297604234,"zoom":8,"place":"TUSCALOOSA, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2349,"title":"The Cycle of Sharecropping\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-01-09","end_date":"1889-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Widowed and with few options available to support herself, Dolly Lang, a black widow living in Falls County, Texas, signed a sharecropping contract with Mrs. V.C.

On September 18 of that year, Joseph Hawley, a railroad executive in Galveston, wrote to his wife and daughter to share details of the ruin caused by the hurricane that hit the coastal region 10 days earlier. While Hawley sent news that their immediate family had thankfully managed to survive the storm, he described the wreckage and dead bodies that still plagued the city streets. Indeed, Hawley had to deal with this devastation on a daily basis as chairman of the Committee of Public Safety. The storm hit in the afternoon, giving him enough time to take precautionary measures to protect his property; he estimated the resulting personal damages to be minimal, around 200. The storm flooded his office with four feet of standing water and at the time of the letter, he estimated that the storm and its effects had killed five thousand citizens and injured three thousand others.","Hawley told his family of uncovering the bodies of family friends while at the morgue and overseeing the handling of 500 bodies which were taken out to sea, weighted down and thrown overboard. There had been so many fatalities that the city had to resort to collecting the bodies and either taking them out into the ocean or cremating them in large funeral pyres. The situation was grim as there was a limited supply of clean water and much of the area was still flooded, with filth accumulating and baking under the hot temperatures. While the city deployed two thousand men a day to assist in clean up efforts, Hawley estimated that it would take at least another four to five weeks before the initial clean-up was complete. Despite the great work ahead, Hawley concluded his letter on an optimistic tone, noting that Galveston would overcome the disaster and rebuild itself into a modern city. He also commented on the great outpouring of donations and financial assistance from neighboring areas as well as places as far away as Paris, Liverpool and Hamburg.","By 1900, the coastal city of Galveston had a population of almost 38,000 and was a thriving, wealthy city, serving as a banking center and vital deepwater port; it was also a major producer of cotton, wheat, cattle and corn. Prior to the Galveston Hurricane, two previous hurricanes resulted in the devastation and eventual abandonment of a city further along the coast, called Indianola; yet the people of Galveston had not really seen hurricanes as a legitimate threat. While discussions of precautions such as seawalls had been discussed, no safety measures had been taken and the area was completely vulnerable by the time the hurricane of 1900 rolled in.","The storm hit on September 8 and massive flooding occurred, exacerbated by the fact that the highest house in the city was only eight or nine feet above sea level.No exact death toll is available, but most estimates range anywhere from six thousand to eight thousand with financial damages totaling 28 million. While the physical damage was concentrated in one particular region of Texas, the resulting financial burden was shouldered by many as nearby communities and even other countries contributed money to aid in the large rebuilding effort that lay before Galveston. After the storm, the city began enacting changes immediately, including a reorganization of the local government to help relieve Galveston of its now heavy debt. In 1902, locals voted into effect legislation which issued 1.5 million in bonds to pay for the construction of a 17-foot-tall seawall. This barricade between the city and the ocean would prove successful in offering crucial protection during a powerful hurricane that hit in 1915. Despite rebuilding efforts and improvements, the devastation Galveston faced caused it to lag behind cities such as Dallas and Houston which were developing into transportation hubs and enjoying the new oil boom. Due to its extensive financial and human costs, the 1900 storm is still considered to be the deadliest natural disaster to hit the North American continent."],"display_date":"September 8, 1900 - September 18, 1900","search_date":"1900-09-13","locations":[{"id":12779,"lat":29.5143972393,"lng":-94.8756973573,"zoom":9,"place":"GALVESTON, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2351,"title":"The Principles of the Alliance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-04-19","end_date":"1888-04-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Widowed and with few options available to support herself, Dolly Lang, a black widow living in Falls County, Texas, signed a sharecropping contract with Mrs. V.C.

On September 27, 1895, an announcement ran in the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em> explaining the recent arrival of the boll weevil population to the United States. The species moved up from Mexico into certain areas of Texas and was wreaking havoc on cotton crops. The U.S. Agricultural Department considered the cotton boll weevil to be one of the most harmful pests to have existed in the United States. The boll weevil appeared to reproduce rapidly in some areas while in others, populations spread more slowly. Despite scientific studies which took place in Brownsville near the Rio Grande, no solution had yet been discovered to control the boll weevil population. They continued to make their home in cotton bolls, their only known habitat, and ruin cotton crops in Mexico and Texas.","After Texas cotton crops endured years of droughts and inclement weather, the boll weevil made its first appearance in Texas near Corpus Christi in the early 1890s. The boll weevil caused mass destruction in cotton crops as it fed on and laid its eggs in the fruiting structures of the cotton plant. Resistant to common insecticides of the time, boll weevil populations were able to spread across the entire state of Texas and eventually covered a vast area including North Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee. In this region known as the Cotton Belt, the pest caused a decrease in cotton productivity over a period of thirty years.","While the boll weevil population fanned out across the region, its damages were most heavily concentrated in southern Texas. Prior to the Civil War, Texas had not been a high producer of cotton; in 1850, Texas had one of the smallest cotton crops in the South. Yet during the Civil War and leading up to the twentieth century, cotton production in Texas flourished and grew from 58 thousand bales produced in 1850 to 2,584 thousand in 1900 when it was a top cotton producer. As cotton production increased in Texas, the effects of the boll weevil became more far-reaching and added to the volatility farmers faced in the cotton industry. An official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture toured an area in southern Texas in 1894 and reported that around 90 percent of the cotton crop was damaged due to the boll weevil. Ten years later, one estimate revealed that 700,000 bales of cotton were ruined by the boll weevil population in one year, totaling costs of 42 million in Texas. Many southern states continue to work today to keep boll weevils and their capability of destruction under control."],"display_date":"September 27, 1895","search_date":"1895-09-27","locations":[{"id":12520,"lat":29.8870533163,"lng":-96.2779799564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUSTIN, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2372,"title":"Land Allegation Dispute in Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-12-27","end_date":"1885-12-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Alabama's Attorney General, while celebrating the Christmas season in his Gulf Coast home, received notice that he would need to institute a test suit as soon as possible in order to determine the title of government grated lands. In 1885, both timber businessmen and railroad executives repetitively brought cases to the Secretary of the Interior concerning the cutting of timber in certain areas of Alabama. These lands, amounting to some 200,000 acres of fertile soil and dense forests, were granted to the state in order to aid the construction of the Mobile and Girard Railroad in 1856. The Alabamians that wanted to cut timber on the lands claimed that the railroad had no valid title to the area because Mobile and Girard failed to abide by the terms upon which the land was given to them. The Secretary requested that the Attorney General get right to work because the conflict between these two interest groups had been steadily growing, and the state government needed to make a finite decision concerning the issue so as to pacify the competitors for the land usage.","A case of a land controversy such as this would have been common in the late nineteenth century as railroads were becoming an increasingly important means of transportation and focus of development.

Therefore, like the timber producers in 1885, many citizens of the Gulf Coast area felt that the railroad companies had unfair privileges and took advantage of the state, and frequently opposed the development of more railroad funding and support in local and state government.

After numerous invitations from an old Annapolis, acquaintance, Thomas Randal, the wheelwright and millwright from Maryland made the trip south to assess Jefferson, Leon, and Gadsden counties for himself. Wiggins needed a boat, a train, and a horse carriage to complete the 900 mile journey from Annapolis to Belmont, Randall's plantation just south of Monticello Village. To the skilled machinist, except for want of religious society, Florida seemed quite an agreeable place, both in climate and economic opportunity. Though Wiggins had just completed a long voyage he did not have time to rest. Randal, his host, immediately put him to work constructing a screw press. Wiggins had been at work the whole week trying to complete the project. Timber had to be heved for the frame of the press, and many people were needed put the press in its final place. Though he was satisfied with his work, Wiggins did admit the press worked rather slowly. The end price had been 100 dollars. After little more than two weeks in the territory, Wiggins recognized the abundance of money making opportunities. Wiggins, acting in a mindset that would later take him to California in search of gold, made notes in his journal about the potential profitability of plying his trade in the Florida Territory. He remarked at how few mechanics there were in North Western Florida. Those he saw most were inclined to disapation and idleness. Doing some rough calculations, Wiggins figured that an industrious man would make about 10 dollars per day at such work. Having considered the profitability, Wiggins planned to put up a press of his own design and making, which he vowed would work much better then those now used. After reviewing the undertaking as a whole, Wiggins made a projection about his future. Given he stayed well, Wiggins calculated making a fortune in a little time. ","Wiggin's mindset and motivation was similar to many of the frontiersmen who immigrated to Florida and other newly opened areas of land across the south. The abundance of cheap land and high price of cotton brought risk-takers south from all parts of the country, including the North. However, as Wiggins's account highlights, once these initial plantation owners arrived, a huge demand developed for specialized tradesmen. Wiggins, like many, saw his path to a more comfortable future by gaining a piece of this wealth. It is too easy to conclude that all the eventually successful men in antebellum Florida came from wealthy, educated, aristocratic families in the upper and eastern portions of the South. On the contrary, many of larger land and slave owners shared little more then ownership status of those two commodities with the aristocracy of the Upper South. Many frontiersmen had failed at other ventures or were men of modest means. The frontier offered an opportunity for industrious and able men to rise rapidly in the economic spectrum. This was the first and most important step on the way to political and social status among their peers.

The railroad bridge the train intended to pass over collapsed and the train plummeted thirty feet below into Rudd's creek. The impact was so severe that it killed four people and wounded forty to fifty people. The locomotive, caboose, express and baggage car, two passenger coaches, and one sleeping-car all burned down and creating 300,000 worth of damage. "," By the time of the train crash in1869, Tennessee railroads were dangerous because they were poorly kept. Historian Robert Corlew noted approximately 1,200 miles of railroads were built in Tennessee during the decade of the 1850s. They of course offered great potential for improvement and expansion of the state's economy when the Civil War came. The state of Tennessee invested a significant amount to build railroads all over Tennessee throughout the eighteenth century. Yet the damage from the Civil War was so detrimental to the railroad companies that after 1865 many of them could not continue construction. The state-aid system of Tennessee went into a debt of forty-three million dollars, much of which was attributed to their investments in railroads. "," Private railroad companies tried to pick up where state-aid funded companies left off. Their main focus was to connect the old railroad parts built before the war and form greater networks. Edward Ayers in remarks Throughout the 1870s and early 1880's Southern Railroad companies experimented with ways to accommodate themselves to the different widths of track between North and South Thus, the old and new railroad tracks built by various companies varied in size durability and reliability."," With such a high priority on connecting networks and small allotment of funding, companies sometimes overlooked the upkeep of the railroads. Even with the economy still in debt from railroad spending, Tennesseans still relied on the system. Consumers frequently used it overlooking the risks. Railroad companies prioritized the rapid networking of interstate transportation over safety. Few wanted to expend the time or money to inspect the durability of the tracks built before the war by other companies; all they wanted to do was connect them and get them up and running. "," Once they accomplished this, the railroads were very popular, despite the dangers. Southerners depended highly on railroads throughout the South for trade, commerce and rapid transportation. Private companies struggled to improve the economy building a network of train tracks as fast as they could. They filled the gaps between old tracks, but lacked in their focus on keeping the old tracks secure. Nobody checked the status of the bridge outside Clarksville before passing 300,000 dollars worth of goods over it.

As a consequence, it acquired an increasingly diverse population. Individuals came from all over Europe due to various push and pull factors, including the search for land, freedom and the promise of a better life. Texas saw its population grow 173 percent between the years of 1870 and 1890; this was largely due to a migration of fellow southerners searching for relief from the ruin of other southern states coupled with German immigrants arriving in large numbers. As word spread in Europe of the promising land of the West, Germans quickly became one of the largest ethnic groups in Texas; some estimate that during the 1800s, the populations of Galveston and San Antonio were anywhere from one-third to one-half German.","Cities, especially those in the North, were receiving the bulk of immigrants in the 1890s and early 1900s; however, the crowded conditions, competitive job markets, and even government plans were often incentives for people to move out into more rural areas. Texas saw its population of German and Russian Jewish residents escalate greatly in the early 1900s due to the Galveston Immigration Plan. This program aimed to relieve the crowded conditions in the Jewish ghettos in cities by sending newly-arrived immigrants to be resettled in rural western areas and other interior states. In addition to Europeans, a new wave of Chinese immigrants came to the United States and the West in particular during this time period to work on railroad construction projects.","Post-war southern cities also saw a flood of newly-freed black citizens coming in off of the plantations in neighboring counties. While this caused the actual numbers of black residents to increase in many cities, Texas saw the amount of black residents as a proportion of its population actually decrease as they could not keep up with the rapid influx of white immigrants. Yet, despite the implementation of segregation laws and various forms of discrimination and racism, cities continued to see an increase in their black populations; harsh climate conditions and economic instability seen in the agricultural realm at the end of the 1800s drove people into the cities to find work and augmented the population swell, especially when work became available in the railroad and lumber industries. Despite its reputation as being a lily-white South, the region was actually the site of much diversity and many members of the various groups coexisted in a peaceful, mutually beneficial manner."],"display_date":1890,"search_date":"1890-07-02","locations":[{"id":12839,"lat":29.6873298033,"lng":-94.957827752,"zoom":9,"place":"HARRIS, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2395,"title":"More Funds Needed for the Manual Labor School\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-12-12","end_date":"1868-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On behalf of the Manual Labor School of the colored citizens in Rutherford, Tennessee, Reverend Daniel Watkins appealed to the public for extra support. The school aimed to enhance the labor skills of newly freed blacks. The state chartered 15,000 towards the school, but still needed more funds. The board of trustees purchased three hundred acres of land with an estimated worth of 2800 in yielded crops. Yet it did not yet have the bare essentials needed to function. Over 100 pupils attended the school, the rooms were not big enough to accommodate the students, and there were not enough farming instruments for the use of the school's manufacturing and mechanical branches. The board acknowledged Watkins's appeals and sent agents north to seek assistance and support. "," Seeking assistance in the North was necessary because support within their own state was not likely. After congress passed the fourteenth amendment granting citizenship to African Americans July of 1868, many Tennesseans became furious. Riots broke out. Radical conservatives established group aimed to terrorize African Americans called the Ku Klux Klan. Historian Robert Corlew reported that Troops were necessary to stop atrocious murders and numerous outrages which had been committed by violent and disloyal men. "," In response to such violent outcries, Congress worked fast to design the Freedmen's Bureau to help African Americans survive among the chaos. They distributed food, supervised contracts, and established schools. This bureau offered government and abandoned land as a refuge and by December of 1968, already established the Manual Labor School in Rutherford, Tennessee. They created the school to help African Americans develop labor skills in order to function in society and intended to have enough classrooms as well as tools they could use for practice. Education was so popular among African Americans because they had never before had the opportunity to receive it. With such a large turnout of students, the original allotted funds for the school were not sufficient. "," Schools for African Americans in the South had trouble receiving sufficient funds because they were surrounded by so much opposition to their cause, yet the eagerness of African Americans to learn was the key to starting educational institutions. According to Stephen Hahn, the burdens of establishing and running schools fell chiefly to the freed people themselves. They had to pool their meager resources, rent or purchase a tract of land, build a schoolhouse, and hire a teacher. By 1867 African Americans composed about one-third of the teachers in freedman's schools, and was growing. Those dedicated to receiving more funds had to lobby to northerners for support. Republican leaders of the Freedman's bureau made great attempts to respond to the requests of the newly freed blacks, hoping to receive their votes once they learned about the voting process, but it was difficult because there just was not a lot of money to give. African Americans fought and gained slowly the chance to gain the education they never had before."],"display_date":"December 12, 1868","search_date":"1868-12-12","locations":[{"id":12343,"lat":35.8476814553,"lng":-86.4046881374,"zoom":9,"place":"RUTHERFORD, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2405,"title":"Problems with Texas&#39;s Land Policy \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-01-01","end_date":"1839-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["He strode up to Frances Sheridan looking utterly ridiculous. Dirty and unshaven, his tattered, mismatched clothes belied his purpose. Much to the surprise of Sheridan, this raggedy character, whom Sheridan took for a vagabond, tried to sell him land. The man took offense at Sheridan's disbelief, but continued to push the sale of his land. After further questioning, Sheridan learned that the land, although in a good area of Texas, not only was not in cultivation, but also had not yet been cleared. ","Sheridan related this tale in his journal to show one of the problems that confronted a growing Texas: most of the land is in the possession of persons who do not possess a shilling & who consequently are unable to cultivate it. This was true because of the liberal land policy of Texas. The Texas Constitution of 1836 granted a league of land (4,428.4 acres) to heads of households and a labor of land (177 acres) to single men. Later the government also decided to give lands to veterans of the Texas Revolution and their families. With people owning large amounts of land, some who were poorer were unable to make use of all of it. Clearing land was time consuming, and if a man could not afford slaves to help him clear the land, it could easily go uncultivated.","A law of December 1837 produced another problem in Texas land policy. The law created land commissioners whose job was to give certificates to landowners allocating to them their legal amount of land. Once they had obtained their certificate, landowners had to have their land surveyed then approved by the land commission. Sam Houston had opposed this system because he said that it would open the door for fraudulent land certificates and claims to land, and he was right. There were many instances of fraud and shady dealing. The law also created a business for speculators. They would go out and locate the choicest land and obtain for themselves the certificate to this land, all before real settlers could move in. This left those in search of good land at the mercy of businessmen. Texas's generosity with land created opportunities both for eager settlers and slick speculators.

Sitting on the banks of the Deep River, the new Island Ford Manufacturing Company directly faced the Randolph Manufacturing Company.  In less than a year the handsome three-story building sprang up with capital of 14,000, and the company began by running 528 spindles.  It is no surprise that the local paper enthusiastically greeted the new factory and predicted it would be crowned with success, for the economy of Franklinville relied upon the textile industry.  Newspaper editors expected that the capital would increase quickly to 20,000, and that operating spindles would soon double in number.  ","The construction of an impressive cotton factory in North Carolina's Piedmont attests to the dominance of cotton and local efforts to capitalize on its production.  Franklinville was in many ways a suitable location for a cotton mill in North Carolina due to its relative proximity both to a source of falling water and the coastal region.  As North Carolina's Piedmont stretches south and west, increasing distances to markets made freight prohibitively expensive; Franklinville was successful because of its atypical location.","Despite the efforts of the planter class to industrialize the Old South, Stephen Goldfarb dismisses the few textile mills of North Carolina as almost insignificant in comparison to the major industrial areas of New England in antebellum America.  North Carolinians in 1848 had reason to celebrate industrial growth, but ultimately antebellum North Carolina would not process its cotton to the extent that rivaled Northern and international operations.  While the impressive amount of capital and infrastructure attest to optimism, North Carolina's cotton mills rarely exported their manufactures.  Factors including dismal transportation options and lack of capital limited cotton manufacturing to meeting local demands, especially before the arrival of railroads to most regions of North Carolina.  The new manufacturing company, nevertheless, testified to a burgeoning period of economic growth that aided North Carolina in undertaking certain internal improvements. Until the complete establishment of railroads after the Civil War, prohibitive distances between falling water that powered the mills and coastal seaports helped prevent Southerners in the Piedmont from rivaling Northern mills."],"display_date":"April 12, 1848","search_date":"1848-04-12","locations":[{"id":9736,"lat":35.7102732834,"lng":-79.8060567039,"zoom":9,"place":"RANDOLPH, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2418,"title":"Governor Issues Plan for Establishing Railroad\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-12-04","end_date":"1848-12-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Governor Graham called upon the North Carolina Senate for action in implementing his plan to install continuous railroad from Gaston to Charlotte and connecting 250 miles of North Carolina's piedmont.  His proposition required the formation of a joint stock company in which the State and private stockholders would split the 2 or 2.5 million price tag.  In the Governor's estimations, 500,000 North Carolinians would benefit from the railroad extension.  He predict advantages not only for those living within 50 miles of the line, but also for residents in seven counties beyond the Blue Ridge mountains, who could save three days of travel in reaching the State Capital at Raleigh.  ","    His plan required that both the state and private individuals commit between 1 and 1.25 million in equal increments.  The state, he argued, could afford this cost by transferring its deteriorating Raleigh-Gaston Railroad, valued at 500,000 to a new North Carolina Railroad Company.  The State's remaining balance would be paid from the issuance of 30-year State bonds paying six percent per annum.  The state would present its first 500,000 of assets, he argued, only after individuals had first purchased the same amount.     ","    Governor Graham's memorandum was delivered at the climax of Whig ascendancy in North Carolina.  Graham, the third of four consecutive Whig North Carolina Governors, was continuing an era of progress with internal improvements that sought to solve the State's dire need for improved transportation.  Even among Southern states, where transportation greatly limited most states' economic horizons as compared to Northern states, North Carolina was considered backward.  Stephen Goldfarb explains the tardiness of Southern industrialization as a consequence of poor transportation to coastal ports.  Distances of one to two hundred miles between the fall lines of rivers and their coastal outlets, a feature of the North Carolina Piedmont, required the advent of railroads. The State's earlier attempts to organize a productive rail line between Wilmington and Raleigh remained a money-losing venture for the State.  Graham's strong words in favor of continuing railroad investment eventually bore fruit when the North Carolina Railroad was formally opened in 1856 by its president, the former Governor Morehead."],"display_date":"December 4, 1848","search_date":"1848-12-04","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2426,"title":"1841 Harvest Impacts Southern Society as Whole\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-06-01","end_date":"1841-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["To most South Carolina planters, the weather was of utmost importance. They relied on nature to provide them with their livelihood, the planting of rice and other crops. Charles Heyward resided in Charleston for most of the year, but controlled many plantations outside of the city, including Rose Hill, Amsterdam, and Lewisburg Plantations. By 1860, he owned 471 slaves. Therefore, it was in his best interest to record a journal like the one he kept during the years 1835-1855. It was to his benefit to record patterns in the weather.","Heyward recorded that June and July of 1840 were unusually cold and rainy for the summer months, putting a strain on the crops. He noted that although this kind of weather was favorable in the city, it was detrimental to the countryside where his plantations were located. In addition, August was a very wet month, which injured many of the crops and forced an early and unfavorable harvest. The cotton crop was injured the most. In the South during this time, cotton reigned supreme among crops. For a cotton harvest to fail like this created economic alarm among South Carolinians and Southerners in general. The year 1841 did not bring a good harvest, either. In fact, Heyward noted that it brought the worst harvest the area had seen in years. Although it came in September that year, relatively on time, the rain arrived that year in conjunction with the excessive high tides, which crested the river banks and caused the harvest to be quite deplorable.","The weather was just one of many factors that caused Charleston's cotton exports to fall sixty percent between 1821 and 1842. Business was terrible in the Charleston cotton market. Reportedly, grass was growing in the streets by 1842. Charlestonians grew alarmed because each member of the city's society, from slave to wealthy planter had a stake in agriculture. Planters and their families had less money; slaves were treated worse because of the darkened moods of the planters and overseers. They tended to blame slaves for bad harvests since they were the ones working with the crops. It was up to publications like The Southern Agriculturist to help planters think through their options in an effort for agriculture to become profitable once again. Theodore Rosegarten's essay The Southern Agriculturist in an Age of Reform, highlights a society based on the riches of the harvest. Because planters were arguing about what was causing their problems, The Southern Agriculturist was created to help scientifically sort out the issues of the growing season.

Formal delegates to the convention were to be appointed by the governors of those states which held an interest in the cattle industry. The letter, which was signed by Wm. L. Black, chairman (and others), pointed out the government's inability to offer solutions or relief for the depressed condition of the cattle industry. Members of the cattle industry in Texas realized the deficiencies in the system could not be ameliorated without the united action of all those who had something at stake in the cattle industry. Specifically, the letter referenced the commercial problems the industry faced and the consequent desire for merchants and bankers to attend the convention and join the effort for improvement. Cattlemen were suffering as the industry lost money and it seemed that the little profit that did exist went into the hands of only a few. He asked the readers with this terrible depreciation in the value of our resources, it is any wonder that farmers are poor, and that the commercial industries of the West and Southwest are so paralyzed?","In response to the letter's appeal, delegates attended the convention on March 11, 12, and 13 of 1890. At the convention, delegates discussed the issues of the apparent railroad monopoly in shipping cattle and other challenges facing the industry. They also suggested measures that members of the cattle industry could take on their own accord, without having to wait on government action, to improve the current situation. Potential solutions included tariffs as well as an increase in the use of refrigerators and other actions which could reduce the immediate supply of beef and drive up prices.","Texas had long been a major player in the cattle industry; however, it was not until most of the Indian population was driven out of the area and barbed wire was developed that the industry was really able to operate in a systematic manner. Barbed wire, invented in 1874, made it possible for herds to be enclosed and for controlled breeding to take place. The new creation also ended the need for long cattle drives and helped put an end to Indian raids on the cattle. Indeed, the cattle boom existed to such a great extent that cattlemen often faced a problem of market saturation which drove down prices. Breeding was often moved to more northern states in an effort to spread out the supply. The delegates at the convention also pointed out that the invention of refrigeration provided one potential solution since it granted the ability to transport the meat to new markets before it spoiled.","As beef became a major food product, the national and international interest in cattle grew; this prompted the industry to transition from a market of individually-owned herds to a market of corporations, with investors based as far away as Europe. The development of closed range ranching altered the scene of the cattle industry and the Southwest as it grew in scope and productivity. The cattle industry eventually branched out to cover most of the United States, as evidenced by the fact that delegates at this particular convention represented such states as Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri, Colorado, Illinois and Wyoming. As the cattle industry became a major source of investment as well as an increasingly large source of meat products, it became a national and international interest and brought to light economic and agricultural issues that needed to be addressed."],"display_date":"March 11, 1890 - March 13, 1890","search_date":"1890-03-12","locations":[{"id":13232,"lat":32.7703945791,"lng":-97.2918801714,"zoom":9,"place":"TARRANT, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2433,"title":"First North Carolina State Fair\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-10-18","end_date":"1853-10-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Visitors filled every hotel and boarding house in Raleigh. Replete with music fanfares, banners, and daily crowds of over 4,000 people, North Carolina inaugurated its first-ever State Fair in Raleigh on Tuesday, October 18, 1853. Local newspapers hailed the watershed event as a triumph. For North Carolinians, it was as much a matter of state pride as agricultural interest. For years neighboring states had ridiculed North Carolina for its undeveloped agricultural infrastructure. Farmers, merchants, mechanics, entrepreneurs, artists and assorted people converged on the state capital to display and observe livestock, minerals, improved agricultural implements, carriages, and many other exhibitions of North Carolina enterprise. Auctions were held for livestock and implements. The <em>Raleigh Register</em> stated that it had never gloried more in the fact that we were a citizen of North Carolina, than when, on the opening of this Fair, we beheld the evidences of a greatness, prosperity, and progress... North Carolinians congratulated themselves not only with pride in their state's current achievements, but also with the anticipation of progress into a more enlightened future."," The Honorable A.W. Venable imbued the event with its sense of occasion in a well-received address to a large crowd. He began by placing arduous agricultural efforts in the context of Adam's fall from innocence in the Book of Genesis. He further connected farming to a daily awareness of an overruling Providence on whom farmers relied for their produce to grow. The core of the speech addressed the phenomenon of soil depletion and poor land management. In harsh terms, he challenged North Carolinian farmers to take responsibility for replenishing farmland and investing in the quality of their soil. Venable spoke of a growing change in this respect that would move farmers away from unsustainable practices which left base deserts of farms. The process of clearing, exhausting, and abandoning land was denounced. In another challenge to farmers, Venable requested their support for cheap methods of interstate transport that would allow better utilization of North Carolina's resources. "," North Carolina had been pejoratively called the Ireland of America in the earlier nineteenth century as a result of its agricultural under-development. Lacking many basic internal improvements like canals and good roads, farmers devoted considerable portions of their income to merely freighting their produce to markets. People along the coast received goods from Maryland by water less expensively than from the interior of their own state. Furthermore, the soil of the Old South had been depleted by monoculture nutrient-intensive cash crops with little replenishing fertilizer. Avery Craven deems the efforts of Venable's contemporaries as unsuccessful in the long-run. Despite Venable's exhortations, the optimal balance between immediate agricultural profits and soil conservation seems never to have been struck. While North Carolina's first State Fair offered an encouraging sense of economic development, it may not have been as effective in revolutionizing entrenched practices."],"display_date":"October 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-10-18","locations":[{"id":9843,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2438,"title":"Professor Waterhouse Calls for Measures to Secure Immigration of Skilled\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-01-06","end_date":"1871-01-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Professor Waterhouse, of Washington University in St. Louis, sent a letter to Governor B.

Railroads remained important for supplying goods to others for economic profit. However, poor track conditions often made for delayed trips and spoiled products. Train delays plagued the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad. The A&C tracks were in horrible condition following the Civil War and in need of funding for improvements.","In conjunction with the endorsement law, the Alabama legislature found the necessary funds to reequip the railroad, restoring it to working order. However, what the state supplied was not nearly enough. Trustees and bondholders in the business incurred significant debt to be paid off over time to the state government of Alabama. Those related to the A&C began searching for land to acquire in hopes of eventually expanding the entire railroad system. Friends of the railroad system ironically enough were those who had a substantial strong hold on state politics in Alabama. Internal corruption commenced when these friends did political favors for the railroad. Fraudulent funding and land purchases orchestrated by insiders, trustees and bondholders were made by the thousands. With every false purchase came a false promise that led to deepening the debt of the railroad. The total debt, bonded and floating, amounted to nearly 11 million dollars. ","Unable to deal with the mounting debt, trustees called a meeting to discuss the future of the Alabama and Chattanooga railroad. Visibly shaken and incredibly nervous, the trustees conducted the meeting. Unbeknownst to them, this meeting would be their last. The content of the meeting foreshadowed the company's subsequent foreclosure a year later. Demands for payments on improvements and to employs could not be met. After intense deliberation, the trustees were forced to succumb to the U.S Circuit Court of appeals order and foreclose on their endeavor in order reimburse the federal government. The courts confirmed the sale of A&C citing its untimely liquidation and limited protection of property. ","Important in this foreclosure was the fact that the federal government intervened in a state project. The limits of state and federal involvements were not clearly defined. The A&C railroad foreclosure initiated conversations about the greater role of the federal government in private endeavors that affected the public. Reconstruction was an effort to solidify the nation while acknowledging the identity of the South. At the time, southern politics supported a lack of federal involvement in local and state affairs. The railroad foreclosure was just one example of the federal government's continued and unwanted involvement in southern states and local politics.

The storm started slowly, with the rainfall increasing as morning approached. Rain fell steadily and consistently for days, so much so that flooding began to occur throughout central Alabama. Waters roared with such wrath that houses along situated along streams were swept away. The flooding caused nearly five million dollars in damage. ","The flooding not only damaged homes, but it also destroyed crops, particularly cotton and tobacco. Crop production that decreased during the Civil War, resumed as farmers returned from the battle fields to fields of their own. Many crops provided both sustenance and income for Alabamans. However, the flood of 1884 cut the cotton crop for the year by nearly forty thousand bales and set farmers back for the season. Due to minimal technology, only almanac's served as resources for predicting weather. To add insult to injury, a particular infestation of worms accompanied the flood of 1884, infiltrating cotton fields across Alabama making it virtually impossible to produce market-worthy cotton. State-wide production decreased by over five hundred thousand bales from 1860 to 1870. Cotton production bounced back, increasing 196 percent to 299, 814 pounds by 1880. The Great Flood of 1884 set all progress back. ","Called the Great Southern Staple, Cotton was king. Conventions, associations and research dedicated to cotton numbered well into the hundreds across the South. Cotton production was difficult; weather and infestations were often unpredictable. Furthermore, despite the benefits of regional fertility, soil razed during the Civil War had yet to recover in order to generate the nutrients appropriate for cotton growth.","Industrial changes and improvements lent themselves to the greater mission of Alabama but agriculture continued to serve the southern economy.

After docking, Cullmann found his way to Cincinnati, Ohio where we managed to reconnect with friends from the old country. Realizing his dream, a colony for immigrants specifically from his country, Cullmann ventured south in early 1871 in search of land and resources. ","Cullmann came to rest in Florence, Alabama where his efforts were assisted by Governor Robert M. Patton. Patton provided Cullmann with men and horses enough to explore the northern areas of Alabama. After a significant search, Cullmann found land, but lacked the money to acquire it. Cullmann mustered the courage to call on a railroad official for the outstanding funds. The official's aid enabled Cullmann to acquire several hundred thousand acres of land on which he would establish his colony. ","Cullmann's land extended from Decatur to Montgomery, 15 miles on each side of the railroad. In the days that followed, Cullmann scoured the property, documenting and observing the terrain in preparation for the arrival of immigrants. Despite advertising efforts in both Europe and America, people were slow to reply to Cullmann's colony. But on January 5, 1873, Cullman managed to interest 15 Cincinnati families to colonize in the South. In the months that followed, families filtered into what now stands as Cullman City in Cullman County, Alabama. Steady growth and immigration cause Cullman City to thrive on its diverse population. The city had physicians, ministers, and numerous persons of other trades. The city eventually elected its own officials and acknowledged itself as a reason for Alabama's growth. The addition of a hospital, public works, roadways and improvements on existing railroads increased the appeal of Cullman City, making it a popular destination for both immigrants and non-immigrants alike. Cities began to spring up on the outskirts of Cullman City, expanding its boarders.","The establishment of Cullman City was met with resistance. Cullmann's project was opposed by Alabama legislators and citizens alike who were uncertain as to the benefits of opening their southern, secluded state to immigrants. The price of the land he obtained for the venture was also in question. Skeptics wondered if Cullmann had acted legally when acquiring the land, but supporters of the effort appreciated Cullmann for his attempts to better northern Alabama. ","Cullman City provided a tangible example of entrepreneurship coupled with immigration. Nationally, the 1870s welcomed thousands of immigrants to the United States, but few ventured toward the South, preferring to settle in northern, more urban areas.

Clement D. Newman experienced this effect when he made this relocation in 1845. Newman recounts the social life of his new town to his father in a letter dated January 1, 1846. Though Newman surely liked the town of Norfolk, he admitted that the manners and customs are very different from what they are in New York State. The town's Christmas celebration greatly impressed Newman, as he enjoyed the fire crackers, presents, eggnog, turkey, whiskey, and Church services. In fact, Newman claimed that the town's Roman Catholic preacher was the most gifted orator that he had ever heard. He also noticed the importance of the naval shipping industry in Norfolk, which was one of the largest exporters on the East Coast. While talking to a sailor down at the port, Newman learned that orders had been given to outfit all of the vessels at the station in preparation for war. A Negro sale also took place shortly after Newman's arrival to Norfolk, an event which was an interesting sight to Northern eyes. At the sale, a number of slaves were sold, but the most intriguing sale to Newman was that of an old woman for a mere 39 dollars. Though the events and customs of his new home were a bit odd, Newman reiterated his content with Norfolk, and told his father that he was getting along very well in Virginia.","Newman's letter reveals a Northern perspective on Tidewater Virginia society. The festivities and Christmas celebrations that he attends shows the tight-knit community of Norfolk, and the welcoming nature of the town. At no point does Newman feel threatened or unwelcome due to his Northern status; he had no negative words for the kindness of the townspeople. More importantly, Newman's letter reveals two of Norfolk's main economic strengths - the slave trade and naval yards. Since its founding, Norfolk had been a coveted naval outpost for the British and Americans. Situated with the Elizabeth and James Rivers to the south and west, the Chesapeake Bay to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Norfolk had sensational access to shipping and transportation lines. Norfolk's ports were essential to the Union's economy, and also played significant roles in the sea exploration. During the mid-nineteenth century, around the time Newman lived in Norfolk, Wilkes' expedition to Antarctica and Perry's voyage to Japan originated from Norfolk's Gosport Shipyard. Newman also alluded to preparation for the upcoming Mexican-American War, a war in which ships from Norfolk would be employed.","The slave sale that Newman saw represents another facet of Norfolk's economy. Norfolk was one of the major slave centers on the eastern seaboard. From there, slaves were sent down to the slave markets of the Deep South. The slaves from Norfolk were marched overland by chains, shipped around the coast by boat, or taken down the Mississippi River on steamboats. Norfolk's status as a slave sale headquarters was essential to its prosperity and development throughout the first half of the nineteenth century.","Newman's letter highlights the cultural shock that a Northerner would experience after moving to the South, and touches on small events that reveal Norfolk's economic importance to the nation."],"display_date":"January 1, 1846","search_date":"1846-01-01","locations":[{"id":14407,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2475,"title":"The Need for Railroads in Norfolk\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-01-01","end_date":"1854-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Railroads were an essential component to economic growth and stability during the mid-nineteenth century. One letter, written by An Eastern Virginian to <em>The Lynchburg Virginian</em> in 1854, stressed the vital need to fix the railways running between Norfolk and the Valley of Ohio. Though transporting goods to the Valley of Ohio was possible, the route was extremely difficult due to the railway's lack of gauge uniformity. Norfolk's neglect to correct this problem greatly diminished its export potential. The current railway route was divided into five separate sections that totaled 520 miles. Very inefficient when hauling large loads, the divided railway needed to be unified. An Eastern Virginian was convinced that the commercial prosperity of the entire state hinged on this railroad. Since Virginia was experiencing an economic slump, the state's revival rested on the shoulders of the Norfolk line. Due to the Norfolk railways' present state, Baltimore and the North were shipping all of the goods to the West. An Eastern Virginian found this despicable and intolerable. If gauge uniformity were achieved, economic prosperity could be shifted back to Norfolk and Virginia. The Eastern Virginian even set out future plans to connect Norfolk's rail system to St. Louis, Louisville, and Memphis. Furthermore, the Eastern Virginian even discussed the advantages of the railway as a great military road, as it would create a direct route through the heart of the Union to the West."," The improvement of Norfolk's and Virginia's rail systems was a necessity to help boost the lagging economy. Inferior to other Northern and Western railway systems, the Norfolk line and many other Southern railways were unable to transport goods at a profitable level. The problem stemmed from the economic depressions that hit the nation. The depression of 1839 and the crop shortages of 1846, 1847, 1850, and 1851 greatly affected the South's agricultural output. Since the Southern economy depended on agricultural sales, the shortages hit the South much harder than the industrially dependent North. During these hard times, as the other railways grew and improved, Southern railways remained stagnant. Another problem that slowed Southern railway development was a lack of engineers. Engineers were scarce during wartime, as the Union shipped them to aid in the Mexican-American War. By the time they were released, the South was still in economic depression, and was unable to find the capital for railways. Meanwhile, the North and West had high-capital projects waiting to be constructed, and thus hired the engineers. When the South came out of its depression, it was essentially a decade behind the North technologically. This further hurt the railways' development, as Southerners often built their railroads with glaring technical flaws (such as Norfolk's gauge problem). The need to improve Southern railways was a significant task during the mid-nineteenth century. The South's inefficient rail system, caused by the effects of economic depression, hindered the development of Southern trade."],"display_date":1854,"search_date":"1854-07-02","locations":[{"id":14408,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2477,"title":"Norfolk&#39;s New Water System\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-01-01","end_date":"1856-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1856, the city of Norfolk, Virginia asked Wade Burnett, a civil engineer, to construct a plan that would improve the city's water supply system. In his report, Burnett noted the improvements that an efficient water system could have in the community. The townspeople of Norfolk would benefit in many aspects of life- domestic use, manufactures, extinguishment of fires, shipping, public baths, public fountains, street cleaning, and sewage. Burnett stressed the health and safety benefits of the new water system, as an abundant supply of clean water would not only aid in the prevention of fires, but also dramatically improve the overall health of the city and its citizens. Burnett divided his plan into five categories: the Receiving Reservoir, the Engines and Engine house, the Distributing Reservoir, the Principal Main, and Distribution. The town would use the dam at Deep Creek as their water supply, the same source that the Dismal Swamp Canal Company used. Next, Norfolk's government needed to buy a new pumping engine for fire prevention. Burnett advised that the town buy two or three Worthington Patent Engines, as it was the same model that the city of Savannah used. The Distributing Reservoir would be an iron tank with the ability to hold 250 thousand gallons of water. Burnett suggested that the Principal Main Line run from the Engine House into Main Street, and be linked to 125 fire hydrants. Burnett estimated that the city could finish this extensive 364 thousand dollar project in a year."," Burnett's proposal represented an effort for civic improvement that was characteristic of many cities in the South during the mid-nineteenth century. As Southern economic hubs, such as Norfolk, looked to increase their economic output, local governments began to focus on improving the urban environment of their cities. City officials wanted their communities to appeal to prospective business partners. With epidemic being closely related to a city's cleanliness, people looking to trade avoided cities that had a fertile environment for disease. If disease broke out, such as Norfolk's yellow fever epidemic just two years earlier, the flow of goods and agriculture would stop. Therefore, cities in the South created subsidiaries for the improvement of roads, fire protection, lighting, and water supply in order to prevent an outbreak of disease. It is important to note that these measures were mostly run for the economic interests of the businessmen and city officials, not for the health and well being of the people. Though the community definitely benefited from these improvements, the true purpose, driven by powerful business leaders, was to give their city better economic opportunity.

A yellow fever epidemic that spread throughout Eastern Virginia's Tidewater Region during 1855 did just that. Laura Reed, a resident of Portsmouth, Virginia, recounted the state of the town during the epidemic to her sister, Ellen Reed of Hampton, Virginia, in a letter on September 1, 1855. Laura described the damage to the community's population as severe, though the local physicians believed that the epidemic would be over soon. The doctors' opinion was that the epidemic would begin to decline after sixty days of exposure in the community. Since the fever had reached Portsmouth about a week after the Fourth of July, the town was optimistic for a return to good health. Laura noted that there had been a steady decrease in the amount of deaths last night, as only nine people had perished. Though Laura's immediate neighbors were now beginning to show an early sign of the fever, the black vomit, she reiterated to Ellen that she felt quite safe. Laura and her mother, with whom she lived with in Portsmouth, kept the house well ventilated and fumigated with chloride of lime and guano, safety measures that had been working well to ward off the fever. Though Laura and her mother may have avoided an infection, the yellow fever had severely crippled Portsmouth and the surrounding region.","Epidemics ravaged the Southern states during the mid-nineteenth century. The hot, humid summers that were characteristic of the South provided the perfect environment for the contraction and spread of infectious disease. Unfortunately, most Southern cities lacked the proper safety precautions and policies to effectively prevent and contain these deadly epidemics. The reason for this lack of preparation was economic. Since businessmen often ran most communities and cities during the time, they were hesitant to spend their money on costly town improvements. Officials believed the improvements were not worth the money that they cost. Though the need for these safety measures was quite obvious, funding for such projects was usually inadequate.","The economic effects of this yellow fever epidemic were catastrophic on the Tidewater economy, especially in the area's economic hub, Norfolk. The fear that the yellow fever caused was significant. This fear was warranted, as ten percent of the Norfolk population would be killed from the yellow fever. Due to the epidemic, Baltimore, New York, and the cities of Virginia placed a four month trade interdict on goods from Norfolk, a ban that deprived the Norfolk economy of an estimated five million dollars in trade profits. This paranoia effected more than just the economy, as many frightened Virginians rallied to get the state legislature in Richmond moved to a safer location.

This excitement was not lost on the people of Suffolk, Virginia, as many citizens joined this exodus to the new frontier. An article in <em>The Suffolk Intelligencer</em> noted the departure of Suffolk citizens, and publicized the author's disdain for their departure. The article, printed on January 2, 1849, referred to the Gold Rush as the Yellow or the California Fever, and contended that Suffolk was just as victimized by this epidemic as any other city in the nation. If myths of gold fields and instant wealth were not persistent enough, the War Department in Suffolk had several specimens of gold ore, some as large as two ounces, on display to further feed the frenzy. The author questioned whether any permanent benefit from this California rush would materialize, as the chances of unearthing a substantial amount of gold were slim to none. Furthermore, the effects of these citizens' departure affected the local Suffolk economy. Due to the decrease in work force, farms and workshops in the Suffolk area became deserted. On a broader scale, the author worried that this national craze was diverting the nation's attention from developing a solid economic base. The Yellow was not only weakening the stability of Suffolk, but also drying up the true springs of national prosperity.","The Gold Rush created a wild exodus of people to the frontier. By the end of 1849, nearly 80,000 settlers had arrived in California seeking opportunity. The migration of people from Virginia, and other Southern states, played a significant role in the development of new territories in the West. The arrival of these journeymen helped develop the area's resources, infuse more wealth into the territories, and add political importance to the West. The Gold Rush was not the only factor that drew Southerners to the new frontier; the feuding in Bleeding Kansas during the 1850's provoked Virginia and North Carolina to send 4, 721 people to help support slave interests. However, the West was not the only region affected by this migration. With everybody traveling to the frontier, there was nothing to offset the population losses that hit Virginia. Therefore, the Old Dominion faced a decrease in the national House of Representatives and in the Electoral College, weakening its national power. Though the West presented economic opportunity to many people in the Union, the craze to migrate west had a negative effect on the economies of local communities and the political power of Virginia.

In an essay entitled Views on the Internal Improvement System of Virginia, an author under the name One of her sons described the dismal state of Virginia's economy, and stressed the need to take action. He dedicated his opinion to the Norfolk Convention. "," One of her sons was shocked that Virginia had become only the fifth most successful Southern state in agricultural, commercial, and manufacturing production. The Old Dominion had held the top spot in this economic race for years prior. Furthermore, Virginia had allowed the Jacobs of the North to gain power over the nation's economic landscape. While Virginia was waiting for economic repair, New England had swiftly taken control of the balance of trade, and the balance of power that comes with it. One of her sons contended that ten years before the American Revolution, Virginia had exported four times as much as New York. Now, the ratio was one hundred to one in favor of New York. This economic inferiority was unacceptable to a state that had previously dominated the Union's economy."," According to One of her sons, the cause of this downfall was the supineness and neglect of the South to tap the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys, and the wasted appropriations on civic improvements instead of efficient railway systems. This lack of internal improvements resulted in the underdevelopment of the state's mineral resources, and a severe decline in manufacturing. If the state did not improve its mediocre railroads, One of her sons feared Virginia would fall behind in the economic race forever."," A substandard infrastructure posed a serious, crippling problem for the Virginian economy. Despite constant attempts to improve railroads, the South continued to trail the North in economic development. While the North's rail systems stimulated economic diversity, the Southern systems fortified their economic dependency on the plantation system and staple crops. Virginia's failure to diversify left the economy extremely vulnerable to low crop yields and depressions."," Virginia's funding for these developments further hindered the state's growth. The improvements relied heavily on state funding and small local investment. However, both were inefficient. State funding was often slow and uneven; though the state legislature occasionally provided a large grant, it was often sporadic, used inefficiently, and late in its approval. Small local investment was extremely inefficient for funding large projects. Instead of having large capital investors, a technique used by the North, Virginia relied on grass roots investment. To get these donations, hundreds of people had to organize through town meetings and petitions. Adding to the inefficiency, individual towns would quarrel over who should receive the state legislature's funding. Virginia's inability to develop a dependable, efficient infrastructure severely impacted its economy. As the state failed to integrate its railroads and find proper funding, Virginia slipped behind other states in terms of economic superiority."],"display_date":"November 1854","search_date":"1854-11-15","locations":[{"id":14408,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2515,"title":"Wilmington Port Activity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-01-01","end_date":"1825-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As of May 1815, the port of Wilmington, North Carolina, albeit small, was a bustling commercial center and exported a wide range of produce. Joshua Potts wrote about the state of the port for posterity and reported the following: Wilmington traded primarily with the West India Islands and the Northern United States, particularly New York.  The market opened in November, gained momentum from December through March.  It slackened in April and May and terminated in June, making the summer and fall months dull.  Excellent crops of various kinds were cultivated annually including:tobacco, cotton, rice, flour, corn, tar, turpentine, flaxseed, lumber, staves, bacon, butter, beeswax, brandies, whiskeys, beef, corn meal, pork, lard, tallow, deer skins, pees, live stock, pitch, and rosin. Potts's account bore witness to a period of great commercial growth in Wilmington at the beginning of the nineteenth century.  Not only was foreign trade on the rise, but citizens were also increasingly engaged in new ventures.  The First Presbyterian Church erected its first building in 1818, and in the same year, editor David Smith began publishing the Cape Fear Recorder. Historian William Dusinberre contradicts Potts's claim to Wilmington's substantive rice exportation.  The early 1820s bore lower rice production than the peak it had reached thirty years earlier as well as twenty years afterwards.  It wasn't until 1825 that rice planters began to recover from Jefferson's embargo and the War of 1812.  Although there were areas of Wilmington exhibiting great growth, its agricultural sphere, at least in rice production, may not have been operating as smoothly as Potts portrayed."],"display_date":"1815 - 1825","search_date":"1820-07-01","locations":[{"id":9653,"lat":34.4008642849,"lng":-77.6110652671,"zoom":8,"place":"NEW HANOVER, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2524,"title":"Birmingham&#39;s Industrial Boom\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-06-29","end_date":"1899-06-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The figures were in: on June 29, 1899, the southern iron industry made the best showing in its history.  Reporting an estimated 605,919 tons in 1899, pig iron movement in the South increased approximately seven fold from the preceding year's 83,821-ton figure.  The Wall Street Journal noted, of this the Birmingham district shipped considerably over half.  The Birmingham district was also responsible for the shipment of two-fifths of the total cast iron produced in the South in addition to exporting 50 percent of all southern pig iron.  With the increase in domestic prices of iron, this figure confirmed Birmingham as a fixture in the European iron trade.  Breaking all records in movement, shipment, and exporting, the Wall Street Journal's figures proved Birmingham vital in the southern industrial boom.  ","    Birmingham's industry was initially stimulated by the Civil War and the Confederacy's need for raw materials, namely, iron.  Alabama had seven blast furnaces in 1861 and this number increased to sixteen by 1865.  Ironically, though the Confederacy initially fueled the Alabama iron industry, the devastating effects of war temporarily halted industrial progress.  The iron furnaces were destroyed during the course of the war.  Additionally, the aftermath of the war disrupted transportation of iron via southern railways.  Despite these setbacks, Alabama was determined to rebuild their iron industry.  In a series of investments and technological development as well as the juxtaposition of iron, coal and limestone markets in Alabama, the Birmingham industrialization was well under way by the early 1870s.  According to C. Vann Woodward in his Origins of the New South, by 1899 Alabama's iron production was over ten times her tonnage of 1880.  This production was more than twice the combined production of her nearest rivals, Tennessee and Virginia and more than all the other southern states combined.  By 1890 northern capital flooded the state to finance industry and a generous supply of labor worked the mines.  The labor supply was overwhelmingly black, constituting 46.2 percent of the labor force, in addition to a high proportion of Alabama's well-received immigrants.  ","The growth of the iron and coal industry in Alabama was largely facilitated by the extensive rail system planted throughout the state.  The great empire builder of the Alabama mineral belt was the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, according to Woodward.  The L and N laid approximately half a million acres of land in Central Alabama by 1876 connecting Birmingham to all the major iron and coal towns in the region.  The L and N was also responsible for gathering investments of more than 30,000,000 and attracting immigrants to work the mines.  In 1888 the railroads transported a tonnage of pig iron exceeding the average annual weight of the entire national cotton crop for the past fifteen years.  With the railway system of Alabama firmly implanted by the early 1880s the state was able to fully engage in an industrial revolution."],"display_date":"June 29, 1899","search_date":"1899-06-29","locations":[{"id":304,"lat":32.2202206971,"lng":-86.2076124057,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2527,"title":"Jewish Population in the South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-09-14","end_date":"1882-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the morning of September 14, 1882, Philip Henry Pitts ran various errands around town. He needed to make a few purchases, namely tools and home goods. While in town Pitts noticed a few stores had closed signs in the window. Upon returning home to his plantation, Pitts entered in his diary, Thursday Holy day among the Jews - All places of business closed among them this day...and this is new year with them... While it remains unclear whether Pitts referred to the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, or Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish days, his observance of this Jewish tradition positively identified a Jewish population living and working in Perry County, Alabama in 1882. Pitts concluded his diary entry by listing the various goods he purchased including a brass handle and a monkey wrench. ","Jewish immigration into the South was divided into four phases from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century. Jewish immigration to Alabama began in the late nineteenth century during the third wave of Jewish settlement in the South. Abraham Mordecai was the first European Jew to travel further west of the early centers of Jewish life in Savannah and Charleston. While the exact date of his arrival is unknown, he settled in what would become Montgomery, Alabama in 1880, pushing the Jewish population further into the South. ","As Jewish immigrants continued to settle in the South, they progressively gained economic influence in society. According to social historian Ralph Melnick, the collapse of the rural plantation system transferred economic and political power to southern cities and townships. With this economic shift, the Jewish population began to earn clout working as professionals, businessmen, mill operators, commodity brokers, and farm owners. In these roles Jewish workers increased their economic status in times of relative instability throughout the South. Reconstruction and the depression of the 1890s further increased Jewish wealth as they continually offered incentives over gentile competition. Jewish business transactions were strictly cash-only, eliminating the vicious cycle of debt for the consumer and decreasing the merchants' risk of financial loss. The economic prosperity enjoyed by these southern working Jews unfortunately led to an increase of anti-Semitism and resentment across the South. ","  Between 1848 and 1980 Alabama lost half its Jewish population to bigotry and hate crimes. In 1868, the Ku Klux Klan was founded in Memphis, Tennessee and formally began its reign of terror throughout the South. In 1871, the KKK publicly murdered a Jewish shopkeeper in Memphis and established the Jewish population as a target of the organization. Though many Jews fled both Alabama and the South others remained. Despite anti-Semitic sentiments in the South, many Jewish families lingered in the region of their American roots.

This was the assumption made by one advertisement of the Red Flag Store, whose proprietor had recently purchased quality Ready-Made Clothing from Pumperle, Geven & Co. following their bankruptcy. The store, like many others, had been shut down and its workers made unemployed. These stores had attracted business mainly from Southern customers, and prior to secession and growing divisions between North and South, this market was dramatically reduced. Bankruptcy of Northern stores provided wealthy Southerners with a sound investment. Not once did the advertisement mention the Abolitionist contribution to the failure of these stores, other than Abolitionism existed where these stores collapsed. Apart from providing a cheap bargain for patrons of the Red Flag Store, the advertisement dissuaded potential ideological views by connecting inferred Northern thinking with failed economic endeavors. Those who discarded these ideological views were assure not to witness the effect of abolitionism in New York.","While certain aspects of the advertisement are propaganda, Southern economic expansion was a reality. James McPherson establishes the precedent for economic growth in the North and the South. In an effort to create Southern economic independence, Southerners revived the Southern Commercial Convention, which met through the 1850s. This organization ensure that Southerners would only buy Southern goods, and it promoted the construction of railroads, steamship lines, port facilities, banks, factories, and any other institutions that would create a more independent South. When secession was immanent, trade relations soured even more between the North and the South. The economic independence that the South strove for a decade earlier, would help that region create some of its own manufactories and allow for essential products to be made within the region. The North, while growing steadily faster than the South in a commercial and industrial fashion, lacked the raw materials formerly provided by the South.

Directly under and advertisement of ten pigs for sale, there is the section of lost property, for which rewards are offered. There are six articles that report lost animals or slaves. 50 is offered for a stolen black horse, as well as 50 for a dark bay mare. Intermixed with these ads for horses, are rewards for runaway slaves, ranging from 50 to 300 per slave. Descriptions of color, markings, age, and last known location are given for slave and animal alike.

The slave demand had a clear connection to the cycles of the agricultural economy, the harvesting of various crops in different regions.","Walter Johnson outlines the methodical process in which slaves were separated from every part of their person identity, except their unbreakable souls. Slaves were stripped down of their personal character and taught new skills in order to provide a commodity to the customer; whatever type of slave was needed was offered, whether a field hand, a butler or a mistress. Out of this systematic trade of humans, the beginning of self-emancipation was born, Slaves sometimes stood up in defiance of being sold, even if it meant suicide, and all slaves became unified in slave communities, while they waited in pens to be sold."],"display_date":"May 12, 1863 - May 13, 1863","search_date":"1863-05-12","locations":[{"id":13639,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2537,"title":"General Early Protects Augusta County, Virginia&#39;s Economy","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-11-12","end_date":"1864-11-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During 1864, General Jubal Anderson Early commanded the Confederate Army in its last invasions of the North. Early routed almost two-thirds of Sheridan's forces at the Battle of Cedar Creek (October 19, 1864), but Sheridan's forces quickly rallied to defeat Early in a decisive victory there, leaving the remaining troops hungry and exhausted. After the defeat, most of Early's troops would rejoin Lee at Petersburg in December. Between those two events, General Early issued a broadside to troops, detailing expected actions in the counties of Augusta and Rockbridge. Even though his troops were severely undersupplied, General Early demanded that wheat and corn were not to be impressed from Augusta County. If corn was acquired, a proper receipt would provide documentation to ensure that nothing was impressed. Augusta County's economy was based on agriculture, and had these crops been used for Confederate soldiers, financial hardship for the county would have been even larger than it already was.","This broadside depicts an important relationship between the land of individual counties and the Confederate Army. Many citizens had grown angry with the Confederate government because of the infractions on their individual property.

Since citizens felt that their personal liberties were violated, they took it upon themselves not to honor the prohibitions on trading with the enemy. The lack of economic support of the Confederate Army, as well as the lack of moral support from the citizens, because of impressments, created a situation that increasingly threatened Confederate ability to wage war.

Horticulturist, W. G. Fraser spent four weeks in the South during the winter of 1900 testing a new market for Californian oranges. Upon returning to California he reported to the <em>Los Angeles Daily Times</em>, The result of my trip was most satisfactory. I found a very active demand for California fruit... Fraser attributed this demand to the remarkable prosperity of the South giving the citizens the purchasing power needed to facilitate exportation of California produce. The Birmingham economy was of considerable interest to Fraser. He noted, In Alabama, especially, was the industrial activity great. At Birmingham the iron works have government contracts that keep them employed for two years. The skilled operatives earn from 4 to 16 per day. Extrapolating from these estimates, Fraser deemed the Birmingham market worth cultivating. Upon seeing the profitability and stability of the Birmingham iron industry, Fraser only expressed regret that this market had not been studied and served earlier. "," Birmingham's economy was booming at the turn of the twentieth century. By 1899, Alabama's iron industry produced more than twice that of her nearest rivals, Tennessee and Virginia combined. Fraser's account of Birmingham's industrial success was only one of many that were narrated in newspapers at the end of the century. The tale of Birmingham and the greater Alabama industrial revolution remain integral to the state's history. In the mid-1880s Tennessee Coal Iron and Railway Company supported Birmingham's industry and the city soon left all southern competitors in the dust. However, as Fraser applauded the economic success of Birmingham, the iron capital of the South faced an industrial decline. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, [Alabama's] need for vast sums of capital outside the South...conspired to keep Birmingham from attaining what had seemed so close at hand in the early 1890s. The capital that did flow into Birmingham went directly into the production of pig iron and relied upon Northern investment. This capital did not directly enhance the personal wealth of the Birmingham labor force as Fraser suggested. The labor forces of the Birmingham iron industry, while comparably compensated to northern employees, engaged in backbreaking work for marginal personal gain. Additionally, according to Ayers, the volume of cheap labor that flocked to the industrial capital of Birmingham stunted the city's need for technological advancement. With little need to adopt labor saving technology in Birmingham, the city fell behind to northern competitors willing to update their systems. Fraser was correct in mourning California's past oversight of a new fruit market in Birmingham. Yet, Fraser visited the South approximately five years too late to capitalize on the southern industrial revolution.

Recently re-stationed to the city from New Orleans, he found the best hotel in town uncomfortable and unsuitable for a Union officer. In January 1865, Levering encountered a desirable solution. Levering casually visited a local, celebrated lady of society, a Mrs. S--, and informed her that he and his family would be moving in to her house. Levering cited several reasons in his diary as to his selection of this residence. Firstly, it was the comfortable looking home of a clergy man. Levering was informed that Mrs. S--'s religious husband was away from home fighting for the Rebel army. Also, the Arkansas family was wealthy, and this woman came from a plantation, which owned around 200 slaves at the war's commencement. Levering's proposal was initially rejected by Mrs. S-- who even cried at first sight of Levering and during various parts of their tense conversation. She feared he would take her house and her livelihood from her in order to benefit the Union army with a residence full of supplies and food. In addition, Mrs. S-- had already planned to provide her only spare room for her cousin who was returning from the Confederate army after receiving a severe injury. Levering flatly informed her that this ex-Rebel soldier would not be moving into her home. Levering eventually coerced her into submission; Mrs. S-- had no choice but to agree to co-inhabitance with this northern family. Levering asked her at what time they would dine every night; when her answer did not satisfy his schedule, Levering mandated a later supper time. At this point, Mrs. S-- was very discontented and greatly feared what others in society would think of her housing a Yankee colonel."," Eventually, a friendship grew between the Levering family, Mrs. S-- and her Arkansas lady friends who visited the house often. Mrs. Levering and Mrs. S-- became very intimate and both women were melancholy when the Union army left Little Rock and, in turn, the Leverings returned to Indiana. Levering notes his gratification of witnessing an earnest expression of regrets for my leaving, as were manifest, upon my coming. Dallas T. Herndon narrates that on September 10, 1863, Little Rock, Arkansas became a Union-controlled city, and everything north of the Arkansas River fell under northern control. Consequently, the inhabitants of the city adapted to northern presence, but the hearts of many Little Rock residents were overflowing with animosity and disdain. When Levering demanded to take up residence with an Arkansas lady and her family, the northern power over Little Rock, and other southern cities, was quite evident. Women, in particular, experienced Union occupation, as they remained at home while their husbands fought in the war. Many homes housed Union soldiers who entreated these women to accommodate them. Levering, for example, listened disconcertingly to a southern woman's wishes. According to Herndon, women in Little Rock continued to aid the Confederate cause, sewing and helping as much as possible; and a monument in Little Rock even honors the Mothers of Arkansas for their sacrifices and labor. Both northerners and southerners alike found their new relationships challenging and confusing, but they adapted to the times. As the Civil War dragged on, southerners found themselves living side-by-side with Union soldiers, as southern cities fell across all parts of the South. he peculiar relationship between these two families illustrates the possible transgression of regional and ideological differences that many people faced during the Civil War. Levering is shocked that a clergyman's family could descend from a plantation bearing such a large quantity of slaves and also fight with religious zeal for slavery's continuance; the cultural differences between Levering and his southern tenants reflect the tensions, which were widespread during the occupation of an antebellum city. Their flourishing friendship, however, offered hope that large ideological differences could be bridged and the Union eventually might be reunited."],"display_date":"January 1, 1865 - January 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-01-15","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2555,"title":"Professorship at The University\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-07-25","end_date":"1875-07-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Ambition ran high for distinguished men of wealthy Virginia families. For these men, there were relatively few jobs besides running a plantation that were suitable for those in their station. One of these jobs was to be a professor at a prestigious university. On July 25th, 1875, John Jaquelin Ambler wrote his brother from Lynchburg about an open professorship at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, or The University. John clearly had been doing his research about the sought-after position, and informed his brother that Thas. R. Price of Randolph-Macon and yourself were spoken of as being the most prominent candidates for it, at least in Virginia, and the University is too poor to tempt many distinguished men from abroad. ","Clearly the idea of his own brother being chosen for such a coveted position is very appealing to John, perhaps out of mere good will towards his brother or because of the prestige the position would reflect on the entire family. John offers a myriad of suggestions for his brother, including an offer of gathering the Rector of the University, R.J.W. Kean, and the Board of Visitors together to meet with his brother at John's home in Lynchburg. The purpose of this meeting would be to see if the Rector might be of service, and if you might have some friends among the Board of Directors. He also subtly admonishes his brother for what he perceives to be his lack of interest in the professorship by telling him that when a guest in his home had asked about his brother's possible scholarly aspirations, as you had said nothing about it, I could not tell him.","The University of Virginia was an extremely important symbol of Virginian resilience and superiority. A particular point of pride to Virginians was that the University did not close during or after the war. James Douglas Smith asserts that by 1870, the University was once again undeniably the leading collegiate institution in the South, with enrollment up almost to pre-Civil War numbers. A professorship at such an institution guaranteed an active role in the shaping of future generations of southern leaders, and not only Virginians. In the years following the war, new courses were added to keep pace with the times, while the caliber of instruction and general reputation continued to attract students from a wide area.

Describing his marble tomb to be placed beside a similar one already sculpted for his wife on his 12 mile plantation, Hagood continued to allocate his surviving money to pay his debts and to divide the remaining within his five children, Mary, Lucie, Fannie, William and Benjamin. The daughters were to share the base plantation and all attached lands and stock amongst themselves. Fannie was also to receive the family house and lots in Pickens, where Hagood was writing his last testament. All of the land north of the Road was to go to Benjamin Holder while the other half would go to his daughter Virginia Bruce. Lucie would also receive the Folger house and lots in Pickens while also receiving three other lots at about two acres apiece. Hagood continued dividing up the family lands between his surviving children; he concluded his will by appointing his two sons as executors and stating that he wished for all of children to share an equal amount of land.","   While Hagood?s will shows the immediate results of a patriarch's death on the post-bellum plantation; we can also see how land was divided to accommodate every family member. Across the South Carolina upcountry, agriculture was based on a premise of partible inheritance; as a father died, it was expected that his children, especially the sons, were to receive acres of land to cultivate. Hagood gives his children shares of his property; however, the fact that lands had begun to dwindle by the post-Reconstruction era is present in how some gifts were spread across distances, not allowing the consolidation of plots into plantations. Ideally, the family attempted to consolidate individual farms to maintain a single, large plantation consisting of personal farming areas.","   According to Edward Ayers, plantation owners were faced with a new reality in the South after the Civil War. The average size of farms was shrinking annually as parents continued to divide their personal lands between their children. As less land was available, families were forced either to move from the plantation or to work together as a unit while employing the newly freed African Americans. Roger Shugg addresses South Carolinian economic metamorphosis in the 1880s and 1890s as he describes how several individual farms on a plantation could then be allotted to the care of freedmen. He describes how despite the change toward a division of plantations' required labor between white and black laborers, the white plantation owners still had control over their land. Hagood's will directly relates to the new economic problems of the time period as the limited supply of land left on the plantation was divided up between his children; furthermore, it relates to the practice of consolidating individual farms into a familial plantation in order to use freedmen as a labor source."],"display_date":"September 11, 1897","search_date":"1897-09-11","locations":[{"id":11632,"lat":34.890972656,"lng":-82.7237397115,"zoom":9,"place":"PICKENS, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2561,"title":"The Civil War on Civilians\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-03-05","end_date":"1865-03-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was a humiliating experience for Louisa Minor. The Union troops arrived at her home and stole guns, clothing, bonds, and the watches from two slaves, Sue and Mammy E. Louisa was so alarmed at their behavior that she was afraid for her safety. She found Union officers who protected her, but the threat of violence from Union soldiers was real. Louisa Minor experienced fear that day felt all over the South as Union and Confederate troops passed through widespread communities. Like others, Louisa Minor remained defiant.","The destructive force the war had for civilians surfaced as early as in Fredericksburg, Virginia between December 11 and 15 1862. Fredericksburg had been occupied by Confederate sharpshooters slowing the Union advance, so the Union troops probably felt justified in their action. Looting in the town occurred to a severe degree as the entire contents of houses was thrown into the street. The greatest loss felt by southern women like Louisa Minor was the loss of loved ones on the battlefield. Among Virginians alone, 20-30,000 men died in the war, while by 1862 alone there were 42,000 claims for back-pay by families of deceased soldiers. The suffering and fear felt by Louisa Minor and her family in Albemarle County was just a small part of the broader suffering the war brought to American civilians.","Louisa Minor's personal humiliation at the hands of Union troops repeated itself all across the Confederacy, as the movements of Union and Confederate armies initiated destruction of civilian property from Virginia to Louisiana. In Virginia, Gen. Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864 devastated that area's ability to provide food for the Confederacy. Sheridan waged war on the ability of the Confederate population to resist, a method emulated all over the Confederacy by Union forces. Significant resistance by Confederate guerillas forced Sheridan to be even more extreme. Between late September and late October 1864 Sheridan systematically destroyed the Shenandoah Valley's ability to feed Confederate troops. Far from Virginia Benjamin Butler brought the war to the doorstep of Confederate civilians early in the Civil War by confiscating private property in New Orleans after the Union took that city in 1862. Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson's offensive into northern Alabama in 1864 was actually more severe than Sherman's in Georgia though it achieved less renown. Confederate units and deserters from both sides also inflicted severe hardship on the Confederate civilian population. When Louisa Minor's property was taken from her in early 1865, she became one more of the many thousands like her who had experienced the full destructive force of the Civil War.

The Union soldiers had confiscated or destroyed much of the plantation owners' valuable property, and without property or the system of slavery that had sustained the South for so many generations, the agricultural economy plummeted and became extremely vulnerable to carpetbaggers and scalawags. Those southerners who had held jobs in the political or other public sphere found themselves replaced by Yankees or Yankee sympathizers. Many once-affluent whites quickly grew frustrated with their forced dependence on the Yankees - for whom they had nothing but contempt and hatred - and the sense of desperation and hopelessness that pervaded the defeated South. Horace Buckner, the young son of a white Louisa County, Virginia planter, traveled throughout the South in the midst of Reconstruction and expressed his horror at the devastation wreaked upon the entire region. Writing his father in Louisa from Mobile, Alabama, in 1867, Horace expressed woe for both himself and the other southerners he observed. As a public school teacher, he worried that although I employed a competent teacher to serve in my absence with the consent of the board...if they are changed, which I think is very probable, I may lose my position. The military authority, which controls this state, seems determined to throw out every Southerner who has any public office and put Yankees in their places. Within the last week, they have removed the entire city government and replaced then with notorious Yankee sympathizers. ","He expounded upon the hopeless conditions in Mobile, writing times are very hard in this city. There is nothing doing. Money can hardly be obtained at all. The clerks in the stores are idle more than half the time. Hundreds are out of employment and are willing to work for almost nothing. He also worried that the registration of blacks to vote will distract them from agricultural work, and that the depressed economy in the South would discourage foreign capital from the region in the future.","After describing these conditions to his father, he proposed a rather radical solution for his own situation and asked his father's advice and counsel. Rather than stay in the ruined South and attempt to rebuild his life under Yankee rule, Buckner considered the idea of emigration out of the United States. During this period, a small number of southerners chose to leave the country rather than live in defeat. A good many seem to be immigrating to Brazil, Buckner writes. They all seem to be well-pleased with the country. I received a letter from a friend of mine out there, urging me to come out, promising me a good and easy situation among a flourishing colony of Southerners. Buckner's friend had promised him a job and a salary equivalent to 1,200 greenbacks and a place in a community of relocated southerners along the Amazon. In fact, over nine thousand southerners did end up relocating in Brazil. John Lowe, in his article Reconstruction Revisited: Plantation School Writers, Postcolonial Theory, and Confederates in Brazil in the Mississippi Quarterly, discusses this phenomenon. Lowe writes that even before the war, Brazil held appeal to many southerners for its perceived similarities to the American South: namely, an institutionalized system of slavery, warm, agriculture-friendly climate, and the nation's later sympathy to the confederate cause at the outset of the Civil War.","Buckner did not end up leaving the country, but instead spent many years traveling through the South and West, never truly settling into a permanent home. However, the fact that he considered - and other southerners actually went through with - leaving the country completely for a land as foreign as Brazil demonstrates the level of disenchantment and frustration felt by white southerners during Reconstruction. In the book Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction, James M. McPherson wrote extensively about the tensions in the postwar South between Northern and Southern whites. He concludes that most often, Southerners' pent-up rage could not be taken out on the Yankee soldiers themselves, and thus Southern white Unionists, or the notorious Yankee sympathizers, about whom Buckner writes, as well as free blacks, absorb the brunt of Southern anger. McPherson also details the corruption and exploitation of many Yankee officials. The federal government instated a cotton tax of 2.5 cents per pound, which was not revoked until 1868. Often, Yankees sent to collect cotton from Southern farmers for distribution throughout the Union instead simply stole it and sold it for their own profit - or accepted substantial bribes from southern planters not to do so.

Mrs. Brown wrote her sister a short letter explaining why she could not stop and visit, and that she would be away from her native Charlottesville until the end of June. When she wrote the letter, Mrs. Brown was traveling through Lynchburg. She relied on southern railroads to take her where she wanted to go.","Mrs. Brown's went on her trip at a time when southern railroads companies were repairing the damage inflicted upon them by the Civil War. The southern railroads at the end of the war were severely dilapidated. Virginia was one of the first southern states to court northern capital investment in railroads. Without that help, Mrs. Brown might not have even been able to travel as she did in 1868. However even by 1868 southern railroads did not have enough capital to make marked improvement. A large amount of railroad graft involving carpetbaggers also took place that year. The Panic of 1873 made hurt the struggling companies even more. The Richmond and Danville Railroad was one of many southern railroads that Mrs. Brown went on her trip. That year the railroad company registered costs at 61.8 percent of receipts. Railroad travel in south was very significant because southern railroads were absolutely inadequate in comparison with the North. Their lesser capabilities were clearly evident during Civil War and prolonged economic recovery after the Civil War. Mrs. Brown's railroad trip in 1868 exemplified the most modern means of travel, and the possibilities for modernization in the South.

The Tennessee Historical Society hoped  that the exposition would show the future of the South and respect or a proud military history.  Local businesses shut down as a military and civic parade marched down the street.   The most popular exhibit was an exotic Egyptian mummy display and a collection of other antiquities which furthered the description of Nashville as The Athens of the South.  Despite this show of progress and innovations, the conception of The New South was mired in the hypocrisy of lynching.        Southern Industrial Expositions  were intended to show a balance between innovation and a reverence for traditional values.  Former editor of The Atlanta Constitution, Henry Grady, illustrated the balance between the two seemingly contradictory values.  He believed that the South could embrace industry while being proud of its military and agricultural history.  He acknowledged that decades of slavery prevented southern industry from developing.  He and many other southerners believed that racial problems improved since emancipation. The goal was to portray a stable environment that would attract northern investors to capitalize to the large labor force in the South.   The reality was that beneath the pomp and circumstance of the military and industrial parades was the same underlying problem of terrible race relations of the slave South.       Textile mills, sawmills, cotton processing, and other industries developed faster than the North, but the region remained predominately agricultural in nature.   Despite new innovations, southern cities were nowhere near as technological as northern cities.  Nashville was one of the first southern cities to have streetlights by 1880. Most of the area around Nashville remained reliant on the typical  commodities of the Old South  such as cotton and tobacco.  New industrial farming technology actually hurt the cotton economy by creating overproduction and, consequently, lower cotton prices.  Despite industrial expositions in Nashville proclaiming change in the South, the region was still plagued by the same racism and agricultural economy of the Old South.  The Steubenville Daily Herald from Ohio highlighted the contradiction that lynching represented in the  plan for the New South.  In the ideology of the lost cause, southerners fantasized that the Confederacy failed because they lacked the industrial capabilities of the north.   The acceptance of widespread segregation and violence beginning in the early 1870s showed that white southerners were not interested in changing every aspect of the  South."],"display_date":"September 10, 1874","search_date":"1874-09-10","locations":[{"id":12005,"lat":35.1672648222,"lng":-86.1060239614,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2581,"title":"Tennant farmers settled with Mr. Bills after the harvest \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-01-26","end_date":"1870-01-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a cold Wednesday morning in February, tenant farmers Captain Bishop and the African Americans Coleman, Sandy, and Sam Watkins settled their rent with wealthy Tennessee planter John Houston Bills. The total crop for the year for all four men was worth 2,033 dollars  Mr. Bills took 515 dollars for rent, or  twenty five percent of the four men's total crop.   These landless tenants had no choice but to accept the high rent that Bills offered.  Instead of growing his own crops, Bills relied on his dozens of tenants to farm his thousand acres and provide his substantial income.  While Bills returned comfortably to his home, his white and black tenants faced the  bleak economic reality of declining cotton prices. "," Unlike a crop-lien system, Bills charged a flat rate rent in order to reduce the risks associated with tenant farmers. The trend continued on a regional level in Georgia where the number of cash tenants grew from 18,000 in 1880 to 59,000 in 1900. At nearly seventy years old, Bills was too old to oversee that tenants properly tended to the cotton fields.  Although it seemed like a lucrative business, landowners found it difficult to keep tenants because farms competed for the lowest rent.  Heavily indebted tenants could leave unexpectedly without paying for goods that Bills provided.   With cash tenants, landowners did not need to keep a store or furnish any goods.   Landowners increasingly avoided the crop-lien system, as they did not want their tenants to rely on them for food to feed their families. Tenants knew how much they had to produce to meet their rent and landowners could isolate themselves from the harsh realities of tenant farming.  Since landowners did not have any personal stake in the success of their tenants, Bills could retire to a leisurely life of hunting and fishing instead of supervising the farm. ","Lower commodity prices caused by overproduction after the Civil War made farming a difficult life for  landless African Americans and whites.  More efficient cotton processing and new farming methods flooded the European and northern markets with cotton, corn and tobacco causing commodity prices to plummet.  Still, agriculture was firmly ingrained into the landscape of the South  for generations and industrial opportunities were scarce.   Recently emancipated African Americans with little education turned to the familiar cotton farming of the antebellum period. The lack of affordable land forced both white and black landless farmers  to accept high rent.  If there were blight or an early frost, tenant farmers risked not having enough money to feed their families. ","White landowners had a complicated relationship among white and black tenants.  If both the tenant and the owner were white, they enjoyed a closer relationship than with African Americans.  Landowners would often work aggressively to help their white tenants to succeed while having little contact with black tenants.  Black and white tenant farmers developed tensions when they competed for the best crops and the best land.  Whites especially resented successful black farmers who challenged white supremacy.  Even though believed they were racially superior to black tenant farmers, they were on the same economic ground.  In many ways tenant farming placed whites and blacks on equal ground.

Thomas McKee was an official in the Charlottesville school district in 1874. McKee handled funding both for the district's African American school and for the white school. He was puzzled to discover that the African American school received less funding in 1874 than its number of students was supposed to receive. McKee wrote D.P Powers, the local Superintendent of Schools explaining the discrepancy, reminding the Superintendent that the district's white school which had a smaller enrollment, experienced no such funding shortfall. At the end of the letter, McKee humbly deferred to the judgment of the Superintendent, perhaps because he knew further agitation would not help and might hurt the black school's budget. Virginia was redeemed by the white supremacist Democratic Party in 1873, the year before the funding disparity. Assuming that the funding shortfall stemmed from the race of the black students because McKee did not press the issue, he uncovered a form of discrimination which became increasingly common as Reconstruction ended. Though McKee may have been dedicated to providing the public schools, black and white, with their necessary funding, somehow a black school under his charge did not receive the funding it needed. ","Many white southerners in the wake of the Civil War continued to believe that African Americans were beneath them in the social hierarchy. In addition, fear of African Americans taking revenge on white southerners for slavery spurred the creation of Black Codes by short-lived provisional governments dominated by southern whites, which heavily regulated African Americans daily activities. The Fourteenth Amendment ended many of the Black Codes, but not the racism that created them. Thus fear of African Americans led to a need to subjugate them, and even while under the military governors' installed during Reconstruction, white southerners kept these intentions in mind. They argued that blacks lacked the education to be responsible voters, and did everything in their power to keep African Americans from gaining such an education. ","However, the Fourteenth Amendment required equal treatment under the law, so rather than eliminate education for African Americans white southerners undermined it, such as in cases like A. Thomas McKee's in Charlottesville. The southern state legislatures gained substantial black membership once black voters were protected by U.S. troops from intimidation. These more liberal legislatures spread public education throughout the South. Schools were segregated, but blacks increasingly accepted half-way measures such as these over nothing at all. Even Frederick Douglass believed that segregated education was the best that southern blacks could hope for. Nonetheless, freed slaves had an extraordinary desire to seek education, because they knew this was the best route out of the poverty and ignorance in which they were taken advantage of by whites. ","Southern white racism stymied these efforts however, because as Reconstruction ended southern whites gained control over the funding of black public schools. They saw education as a threat to keeping blacks subordinate to whites in society, as educated blacks would be more likely to seek better wages and working conditions. The Ku Klux Klan expressed the most violent form of this white prejudice, terrorizing the black community if members tried to improve their lives. The Klan even committed murder in order to maintain white supremacy. ","The Compromise of 1877 officially ended Reconstruction, as Pres. Rutherford Hayes withdrew all remaining Federal troops from the states of the former Confederacy, which took away the last glimmer of protection enjoyed by blacks. A. Thomas McKee's experience was important because it demonstratedone small part of atrend typical across the South as Reconstruction came to a close, the increasingly blatant campaign of white southerners to subordinate blacks to whites in society. Education played a key role because just as freed slaves understood that it was their best route out of poverty and ignorance, so too did white southerners, who consequently did everything in their power to undermine black education.

Iron ore became the staple of the area and was crucial in the development of a regional transportation center. The reliance on tobacco, Anne Arundel's traditional major cash crop, lessened through the nineteenth century allowing for blacksmithing to flourish in the area. Despite the high economic profitability of iron ore in the area, blacksmithing was quite a dangerous job.

Small farmers and plantation owners depended on the works of the blacksmith to create gates, grave markers and kitchen instruments, and other functional objects of daily life. According to the historians Charles Wilson and William Ferris, the dependency of the farmer and the blacksmith created a sense of interconnectedness and a bond.

In fact, their sales business had seen mostly boon time since they first established in Richmond in 1849.   However, for their merchandise, times were not so good.  They found their families torn apart and their bodies broken; Templeman and Goodwin were slave traders, and their merchandise was human beings.  During the aforementioned period, 33 slaves were sold for a total profit of 12,390.  This was a very large amount of money at this time.  The slaves were sold individually at prices ranging from 700 to 1000 on average.  It is interesting to note that when slaves were sold, only the name of the buyer was listed, that of the slave was omitted.  It was as if the traders wanted to forget that a particular slave ever existed.  Slaves' names were listed when they were first acquired; however, only a temporary first name was entered and an identification number assigned along with it, in what appears to be a tactic for dehumanization.  ","    As a centrally located major southern city, Richmond was a bustling slave trade market.  Traders would often come from the Tidewater area by way of the James River with slaves from all around the South.  The James also served as a highway in the opposite direction as well, with Richmond born slaves being moved to ports such as Norfolk to be sent to the Deep South.  Slave traders themselves were a varied group.  Some were rather unscrupulous men who sought to achieve great wealth quickly and had reputations for overabsuing their charges.  However, other slave traders were working in what they considered a family business.  They often took great pride in their work and on their reputations of delivering high quality slaves at reasonable prices.  In a fashionable metropolis such as Richmond, there can be no doubt that more then a few of the elite citizenry were heavily involved in the slave trade.  In fact, as this ledger indicates, both Templeman and Goodwin would have been in the upper strata of wealth in Richmond due to their very high income.

However, in 1850's Virginia, there was really only one market that was truly booming, and that was tobacco. His analysis of the Virginia tobacco trade was the most important aspect of his job, as the economic prosperity of Virginia walked hand in hand with the fortunes of the tobacco industry. In January of 1853, he issued a report on the state of the tobacco market in Richmond. He described the physical properties of the yearly tobacco yield, as well as how farmers should pack and present them for sale and production. One measure recommended was to be sure to remove all impure tobacco so as not to taint the yield. Brown went on to claim that from 1840 to 1850, tobacco production dropped by ten percent in the United States; however, production increased by ten percent as well. He cited these figures as evidence that tobacco would be able to command a good price in 1853. Brown also stated that Virginia's tobacco crop would never be able to compete in terms of quantity with that produced in the western United States; therefore, farmers in Virginia should strive to tout the superior quality of their tobacco in order to make sales. He went on to advise that in order to achieve this quality, farmers should take proper care of their soil as well as the crops themselves."," There is little doubt that tobacco was at the heart of Virginia's prewar economy, and Richmond itself was the major trafficking point within the state. Farmers from the fertile hills of central Virginia and the Piedmont traveled to Richmond in hopes of securing contracts with large tobacco processors with factories in Richmond. In the city at this time, there were at least 17 major factories that sold and shipped high quality processed tobacco all around the state and country. Richmond's central location proved ideal, with major shipments going by rail and wagon to Washington and Baltimore, while barges carried other shipments down the James River to ports in the Tidewater. From there, Virginia tobacco found its way all around the world. The powerful Virginia tobacco market would again flourish during the hard times of Reconstruction, faltering only in the late twentieth century due to medical warnings over carcinogenic properties."],"display_date":"January 1, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-01","locations":[{"id":14218,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2627,"title":"Finding Fashion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-09-24","end_date":"1860-09-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Fashion in the years following the Civil War was very different from years prior. More cotton and more efficient technology meant larger production and more variety for shoppers. Clothes were expressive and a status show to the public. The expansion of the railroads also made more in style clothing more readily accessible to people from all areas of the nation. While style began to spread across the nation- the South was not always the most up to date. A letter from student Kathleen Boone Samuels to her mother, Eliza Ann Van Noort Boone, in September of 1860 described her distaste in her wardrobe. She complained of having to wear the same dress for weeks at a time and her shoes not being able to make it through the winter because the soles were so terribly bare. Her concern for her attire is like that of many college age females today. Kathleen wanted her clothing to reflect her. She wanted to be accepted and considered as worldly and well off as her fellow classmates. She begged and pleaded to her mother for another pair of shoes for the winter, reasoning that to resole her current ones would cost just as much. Kathleen was excited that she had finally realized the importance of having an education and was proud that she actively pursued it, but she still longed for more material things like the five dollar red dress. Fashion was not only a means of expression but often showcased one's status in society.","Ayers also quoted Octave Thanet of Arkansas, who once said I used to wonder what became of the unsuccessful adventures in fashions of head gear or wraps, but now I understand. They have gone South Because high fashion's center was in the North, primarily in New York City, updates slowly trickled down, leaving the South often way behind. Ayers also wrote about a girl who traveled from Broom Corn Bottom, Arkansas wearing hand-me-downs from a wealthy woman that lived in her county. They dresses were purchased in New York however as the train stopped at each station, she felt her attire gradually becoming outdated with each successive mile. Everyone she saw was wearing newer and more elegant dresses than she. While still trying to keep up with the times, it was nearly impossible for women of the plantations of the South. ","Most of the fashion found in the South was ill-assorted millinery and over trimmed dresses, laboriously made in the vain effort to adopt the NY fashion plates to the backwoods of VA. Kathleen in the letter to her mother wrote of the high necked dress cut large enough for Aunt Ann and that the lining of her dress fits but the waist is too long. Dresses were often passed down from mother to daughter to cut down on cost. Fashion was not yet an art at this time. While it was beginning to expand- it had not yet developed into the modern mega market of today. ","The railroad facilitated the spread of fashion trends; they carried the commodity of fashion as surely as it carried flour and cotton- though fashion often seemed more perishable. Fashion is ever changing and the South fought to keep up just as they did with industrialization. However, better production meant that people owned more clothes because they were cheaper to make. Hired washer-women's work load increased ten-fold because of the affordable cotton. Trade did eventually evolve into specialization. Stores used to carry everything from cooking ware to satins and silks, but now with more accessible trade, businesses began to sell one category of goods more efficiently. Fashion was fun for those who could financially enjoy it. Clothes were used as another means of power and authority to those who were able to possess it."],"display_date":"September 24, 1860","search_date":"1860-09-24","locations":[{"id":14622,"lat":39.0515239409,"lng":-79.0100149991,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2636,"title":"Orphaned to Cloud Nine\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-11-08","end_date":"1865-11-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["November 8, 1865, Miss Mary West Jenkins wed Dr. John F. Boynton in a hot air balloon above the clouds. The bride was an orphan, born in Northampton County, Virginia, and adopted by Mrs. J.L. West of St. Louis as an infant. With over 6,000 spectators present, the bridal party left the Fifth Avenue Hotel for Central Park. His sister and the owner of the balloon accompanied the young bride and her fiance for the ceremony. They floated away from the Park, exchanging vows and signing the marriage contract while ballooning through the sky. Such a fairy tale wedding made reality for a young girl who once had no hopes for such a comfortable future. Social status was determined in large part by family and as an orphan she was left in the cold. She had little hope for education, medical care, and would have most likely been forced to work in a factory to support herself even as a teen. She was so lucky to avoid all of that. ","During the years preceding the war, slavery continued to fade away and forced by low profitability of small scale farming, many men were forced to find other means of work. Often these farmers could not produce enough substantial crops to feed their families, much less enough to commercially sell at market. Livestock also required larger treks of land to sustain profitability. Fishing and hunting were often alternate ways that the poor obtained food. Economic expansion created a great struggle between the classes. As lumbering, steel, and iron industries emerged, employers began to look past racial lines, hiring whites and blacks as equals. Many men who saw their skin color as the only valuable asset they possessed were stripped of their pride when forced to work side by side with newly freed African Americans. ","Occupation, residence, religious affiliation, and such too often determined much of one's societal value. The poor worked for minimal wages while the socially elite could afford luxuries such as Mary West's wedding dress made of the richest of poplin, trimmed with rich velvet, with a silk hat and gloves to match. Wealthy southern aristocracy shared many of the same privileges as those of the north, but often gaining their wealth by use of slaves. Many owned plantations, but other chose to invest in industrial endeavors. The Duke and Winston families prospered from the tobacco market in North Carolina and Mary Ann Todd, wife of Abraham Lincoln was from a Kentucky family that made its money from banking. Southern wealth was no longer the result of solely slave labor.","Mary West's marriage to Dr. John Boynton was certainly one of exceptional status. They were both highly educated. She attended Monticello Seminary in Illinois and was quite talented in music and drawing. John graduated from a medical institution and was well known for his lectures in geology. He also at one time held government office. Their wedding was elegant and very original even by today's standards. Her dress was rose in color and the hot air balloon was adorned with lace curtains and tassels in the colors of the American flag. After landing at sunset, they took a train back to the Fifth Avenue Hotel to share their first night as husband and wife. Mary West was fortunately raised by a loving mother that was more than able to give her all the comforts that she would have never experienced as an orphan on the eastern shore of Virginia. While Mary West's economic prosperity did not make her happiness, it was far more promising than the life that she was born into.

The Richmond Daily Examiner reported that the city council of Richmond now required that Hotel-keepers, restaurant owners, beer saloons, or any place that sells spirits, beer, or cider must close every day at ten o'clock at night and may not open at all on Sundays. Violators of this ordinance were subject to fines of twenty dollars a day. "," In the absence of copious amounts of potable water, Americans consumed alcohol in large quantities during the nineteenth century, becoming a strong target for social reform. Alcoholism continued to become more and more common - husbands abusing or raping their wives, drinking away all of their pay, leaving their children with nothing to eat... and eventually women had had enough. "," Women held an important role in the beginning of the temperance movement. They increasingly became discontented with their place in society. They formed prayer groups and rallied against saloons, preaching that temperance meant purity, marital stability, economic improvement and prosperity, and religious salvation. Women wanted to resettle their lives and rid society of the substance that caused such economic disparity. "," Petitioning continued. Newspapers often ran stories of bar fights, domestic violence, and street scrambles caused by alcohol. Political cartoons published in magazines such as HarpWeek, featured wives with their young children, minus their drunkard father who never returned to provide for his family, leaving them in the cold. Temperance reformers insisted on total abstinence from alcohol and demanded legal prohibition. Many brewers and liquor producers organized public campaigns against women's rights because they knew that once women had a vote, prohibition would not be far behind. "," Temperance became a fight for peace on the home front. Many women felt that their lives had been disrupted by the repercussions of alcoholism. Some Christians believed drinking was sinful against God. Families were falling apart. Something had to change. "," Richmond passed the no sale of alcohol on Sunday's law to appease those who favored prohibition. Limiting the sale of spirits was at least a step in the right direction for reducing the stresses alcohol caused. Many were angered by the passage of the bill. It decreased profits for restaurants and bar owners. Most viewed this act as the precursor to nation-wide prohibition."," Temperance began by encouraging moderate use of hard liquor, but the movement turned quickly into complete elimination. Prohibition by law became a hot topic in every political campaign at every level of government. The Prohibition Party was created to support a candidate for the prohibition efforts. Religions divided between wets and dries. Strong Methodists, Baptists, and Quakers were strongly in support of temperance, while the wets including Episcopalians and Catholics, did not believe that the government should have the power to define morality. "," The war temporarily interrupted the movement simply because everyone was preoccupied with a larger struggle. Nevertheless, after the war, the Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded in 1874 forming one of the largest woman's organizations in the world. Due-paying membership exceeded 200,000 in the late 1800s. Its message was education, if it could 'get to the children' it could create a 'dry' sentiment leading to prohibition."," Temperance was a nationwide issue after the war. Virginia was not alone in restricting the purchases of alcohol. The numbers of women who joined temperance was overwhelming, proving their rising concerns. Women slowly started to gain a voice in government and not long after in 1919, nationwide prohibition came into effect with the passage of the eighteenth amendment.

On January 11, 1868, HarpWeek published a two-picture political cartoon entitled The Pleasure of Tobacco. The first picture featured a young man in bed enjoying his pipe. The caption under the drawing said, To which young and promising Tom Smudger abandons himself. He wasteth the midnight oil. Quantities of Killikinick, and himself simultaneously. However, the second picture is a casket covered in a sheet with a pipe on top. The casket is resting in the grass of the graveyard; captioned Smudge becomes a martyr to his Love, and the Object of the Devotion is buried with him. This cartoon warned against the fatal consequences of smoking tobacco. "," George William Curtis, editor of Harper's Weekly, used to smoke himself but stopped in the 50s. In 1867, he submitted his own editorial to warn his readers of the negative effects of tobacco use on their health. He said that tobacco contained poisons that were harmful to our bodies and that if we quit, we will soon feel in better health. The deadly politics of tobacco was certainly a struggle- on one hand it was the second most profitable cash crop in the South, but on the other, people were dying from it as well. "," HarpWeek published many advertisements for tobacco products as well as those for quit and get fit campaigns. But in the man while people die prematurely of palsy of the heart, cancerous stomachs, and diseased lungs from its excessive use; and they will continue to do so if half the world is depopulated by this vegetable tyrant. Lack of scientific evidence regarding tobacco's harmful effects caused much controversy over the topic. Some claimed that everything in moderation was fine, including tobacco use and that it in no way could be linked to disease. "," Even the last great tax on the luxury of cigars and pigtail, by Congress, which seemed likely to limit its consumption, has had no more effect than beating an elephant with a feather. Efforts were made by governments across the country to tax tobacco more heavily in hopes to reduce its widespread usage; however, it's use continued to only expand. Some saw tobacco as a drug, a killer, and others as just something to do to pass the time. Even a hundred years before Surgeon General warnings, we already had begun to understand tobacco's effects. "," Tobacco was more prevalently grown during the colonial period, than during the years after the Civil War, but it certainly had not disappeared from the scene. Seventy-five percent of cotton came from plantations along with other crops such as sugar, rice and tobacco. Richmond was one of the largest producers of tobacco in the world during this time. The slave trade experienced increased activity and more profitability than any other time thus far and therefore provided even more labor for fieldwork. The new railroads connecting the rest of the country also allowed tobacco to be traded and sold great distances. Tobacco remained a very important cash crop in North Carolina and Kentucky. Meanwhile plantations in Virginia and Maryland were not so fortunate; they suffered from depleted soil and decreasing profits. "," Tobacco was an extremely soil depleting crop. While plantations thrived, small farmers were hard pressed for money for such large-scale productions. They would often plant small plots of lower quality tobacco and rotate with other crops like sweet potatoes and cowpeas to allow the soils to recoup. These small farmers rarely could afford to own slaves because prices had sky rocketed in upwards of 2,000 a slave. In order for plantations to succeed, planters not only had to have plenty of acreage but enough cheap labor to work it. Needless to say, the plantation economy was not the norm for most southern whites but was responsible for the production of the majority of tobacco for the entire nation. "," The years preceding the war, cigarettes became the most popular form of tobacco- both hand rolled and machine rolled. The tobacco industry continued to boom from Virginia all the way down to Georgia. Durham and Winston-Salem North Carolina, Louisville, Kentucky, and Richmond, Virginia became major centers for cigarette production and brought wealth to the areas. The invention of the cigarette rolling-machine and the manufacture of cigarettes so close to home increased the demand for the plant immensely. Annual national per capita consumption rose from 1.5 pounds in 1860 to 5.5 pounds in 1900, a 267 percent rise.

Being located along a river and along a railway line, he saw that cotton production proved to be very prosperous for those in Augusta because they could easily ship their products throughout the nation. Along with the cotton factories, he noticed that there were flour mills and tobacco factories taking advantage of the transportation and opportunities for their products. He commented that there was a greater use of fertilizers to increase the production of cotton. According to the traveler, the farmers used much of the white labor source because the African Americans worked well only if paid well.","Fertilizers were used in greater quantities in order to produce more cotton to trade in on the cash value of the crop. The land used was not productive enough for their needs or had been neglected previous to the high production of cotton, as the historian Lewis Nicholas Wynne argued. He found evidence of people in that time commenting that land without fertilizers 'would not produce over one-eighth or one-tenth of a bale.' The overproduction of cotton lowered the demand for it and lowered the price that farmers received for growing it. Because farmers had to produce cotton to satisfy merchants in the crop lien system, Wynne found that farmers increase[ed] production in order to offset lost income, while really just making the situation worse and reducing their incomes in the long run. The economy was worsened by this seemingly unending system of the overproduction of cotton.","The use of white labor instead of African American labor shows that reliable black labor may have been difficult to find. After receiving freedom from the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War, African Americans sought to assert freedom in their lives. One way that they could have control over their lives was to choose their own way to work. The writing of R. Tracy McKenzie shows that the historian Sharon Ann Holt made a claim to this effect saying that freed people made a freedom for themselves.

The first lynching happened just five days into the new year.

Lawrence Brown, an African American, accused of arson near Cranbury, South Carolina, was the first one to be lynched in 1897. At least one out of the 28 lynched were white. Two of the 28 were women, Mollie Smith and Amanda Franks, both from Jefferson, Alabama. They were accused of using poison and as a result were lynched. Out of all 28 of the people who were lynched, only one survived, William Clement, a black man of Cambell County, Virginia, who was accused of striking a white man.","Lynching increased in the late 1800s at a steady rate. During the 1890s, according to William Brundage, a growing number of conservative whites, concerned that lynching threatened the social tranquility and economic future of the state, agreed that lynching must end. They discussed whether certain crimes deserved mob vengeance or if they should be handled at the courts' discretion. Lynching affected the region, the state and the south as a whole, as it disrupted the economy. "," During the early 1890s, African Americans debated how to protest using appropriate measures and desperately searched for a way to protect themselves from violence. A picture depicted a few lynched men in the Richmond Planet, the question is posed: Shall this barbarity continue until the God of retribution marshals his strength against the barbarians? The idea growing in Virginia was that lynching was unnecessary and need not be tolerated. Some whites also hoped to end lynching and the violence, believing that it hurt their economy. Many blacks and whites did not want lynching to continue, and yet the there was an increase in the numbers lynched in the 1890s. "," Lynching increased in the south after 1880 through the 1950s, where 80 percent of the nation's lynchings occurred. The number lynched each year did not drop below 100 until several years after the turn of the century. Lynching was a community event, in which mothers and children watched, and the lynchers were very rarely arrested. According to William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E.

A local store would have been profitable for Maupin since so many people just produced cash crops and bought necessities from their towns. The crop lien system was a major part of Southern agricultural society. Lewis Nicholas Wynne found that merchants could allow people to buy products necessary for farming and also daily necessities by charging a high credit price and getting a portion of the cotton crops to cash in at the end of the season. Merchants played an important role in how agriculture turned out in the South. They forced farmers to produce cash crops even when the return prices dropped very low. People could not produce crops for subsistence and merely worked for the cash crops. According to Jeanette Keith, merchants could have made an even larger profit than what they were making by taking advantage of uneducated farmers who did not know that they were paying more than necessary. Thus, it would have been very profitable to be a local merchant and would entice those with enough money to invest in it. ","It is not surprising that Maupin's young wife went back to live with her parents after his death. According to sermons from the time that Edward Ayers found, men were expected to provide for and protect their wives while the women took care of the home. Since Maupin's wife would have depended on him economically, she would not have had the means to care for herself when he died. Since women did not provide for themselves, it was important for them to get married. Ayers also found letters that encouraged young women to get married and start their own families.

It would also allow people to produce only cash crops and then buy things they needed that would be transported on the railways.

The southern states could benefit from the industrialization of the North and the products made there while the North could benefit from the agriculture of the South. This would integrate the commerce of the nation and create a greater sense of unity. Local businessmen, however, felt that the railways would take away from their economic profits by monopolizing transportation. There was political corruption concerning the railroads and businessmen were justified in their feelings that some might have been given unfair advantages. Foner noted that Republicans in charge of making railroad assignments were able to accept bribes for control to railway access and distribute based on patronage. Although the railway system had benefits for the greater economy, there were local problems that made legislation on the issue difficult.

Clay spoke on a major economic issue that began to drive the North and South further and further apart in the eras leading up to the Civil War - the tariff. Henry Clay argued in favor of the Tariff of 1824. He declared that the Union had diminished exports of native produce, the depressed state of our foreign navigation, our diminished commerce, successive unthreshed crops of grain, perishing in our barns and barn yards for the want of market. The South was an agrarian society that depended upon agriculture to survive. The North, on the other hand, was beginning to develop urbanized societies and depend more and more upon industry and less on agriculture. The Tariff of 1824 was a pivotal decision to the South in order to keep their culture alive. "," This speech had a far - reaching effect on the South. Henry Clay was a prominent politician of the time and his opinions were heard throughout the country. Virginia wanted to protect its profit on tobacco, while South Carolina was concerned about falling cotton prices. The tariff would have protected the American market from cheaper foreign goods. Southerners, lead by John C. Calhoun opposed this tariff because they saw it as favoring the North. The South needed open markets to sell their products, which were popular in overseas markets. If the tariff were not passed then the economy of the South would continue to flourish. On the other hand, if the tariff were passed, then the markets in the South would slowly diminish because of less interest because of the lost overseas markets. This was a debate that sparked come of the conflict leading up to the Civil War. "," The major markets of the South, including the tobacco markets in Virginia, were in danger with any thought of a tariff. Southerners were not only trying to protect their income, but also their agrarian way of life. This debate was a major political discussion at the time.

The deed needed to be witnessed, signed, and sealed. The land was 132 acres and all the boundaries were listed. Land was essential in social standing and those with land were of higher class than those who weren't even if they were of different races. "," Land not only provided social standing, but it also was vital to the economy of the South. According to Edward Ayers, ideally a farmer of either race was able to work his way up the 'agricultural ladder' from landless laborer to sharecropper to renter to landowner. There were many ways to acquire land; like Archer Williams, it could be handed down within a family. An adolescent boy could also move to a landowner's farm to learn the practices of running of a farm, prove that he is a dependable worker, and earn a daily wage. Once he earned the trust of his employer or another landowner, he could become a sharecropper. Sharecroppers had responsibility for a plot of land and could earn money on their crops from the local market. Renters, on the other hand, paid for the use of a plot of land, provided their own tools and work animals, and could plant any crops they desired. They risked the possible losses, however. Once either the sharecropper or the renter saved enough, they could buy their own farm. No matter which way the farmer acquired his land, his main goal was to have his own farm."," Agriculture and crops were a major source of income for many Southerners. More and more blacks were acquiring land, and by 1900 although still many more whites had farms, 45 percent of blacks had land along the coasts, compared to the 70 percent of whites. The usage of land was different depending on its location and its environment. In the lower south, including Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains and also Southern Virginia, the area was the best suited for agricultural purposes. On the Eastern shore after the Civil War, farmers diversified their crops, so that if a crop failed that year, it did not mean that they would suffer incredibly. This trend was common all over the South after the war.

Farmers are so crippled that they cannot buy as much as usual of the fertilizers made of the phosphate 'rock,' which is one of the chief products of South Carolina . . .

These debates helped foster a general view amongst the rest of the country that the South was backwards, unenlightened, and poor.

Taxes were based on every one hundred dollars worth of property. For example, it was thirty cents for state tax, ten cents for state school tax, and fifteen cents for road tax. Mr. Thomas Brown had 945 dollars worth of property, so he paid thirteen dollars in state tax, 3.97 dollars in state school tax, and 5.83 dollars in road tax. The government collected these taxes to pay for education, improvements in the town, and other public expenditures. Even with these taxes, Virginia was deeply in debt. "," The decade before the 1890s, Virginia pushed itself continuously further into debt as the Conservative party refused to stray from the Funding Act, even in spite of the evil name attached to the origins of the Funding Act, according to C.

In the South, the public schools were 1.5 million dollars in debt, which forced many of them not to reopen the following years. By 1890, the monetary expenditure per student had slowly increased to 81 percent from 59.5 percent in 1871. The money expended augmented to about 97 cents, an increase for the South, but was still less than the 2.24 dollars for the country as a whole. Public schools suffered from this deficiency in funding, and the school termed shortened and did not reach its highest average again until 1900.

Hume, the Arkansas convention was unique, however, because it contained extensive debates about the role of race.The Civil War raged on, yet Arkansas was already underway of Reconstruction and improving race relations.Jesse N. Cypert, a southern white man from White County, pressed for ratification of a constitution excluding black suffrage, while William H. Grey, a black from Phillips County, advocated for black suffrage.Grey's arguments were rational, thought provoking, and supported by substantial evidence, and the convention approved black suffrage.Grey was treated as a gentleman and, at least in this convention, as an equal.The reigning president insisted that Grey be addressed Mr. ----, from ---- County the same way that the white delegates were addressed.Cypert's excuse for unequal address was that He had spoken of him as a negro, because he was such."," This rationale of racial equality reflects much of the Reconstruction South; it was hard for white southerners to abandon suddenly all previous prejudices.Yet, Grey proved his intelligence and deserved respect through his long oration on the reasons blacks deserved the right to vote.He based the majority of this argument on the idea that poor white southerners were worse off than many African Americans.To convince his peers of this idea, he quoted many South Carolina politicians and a Georgia judge who questioned the ignorance of these poor whites.For example, he quotes William Gregg who, in 1851, stated to the South Carolina Institute that he put[s] down the white people, who ought to work, and who do not, or who are so employed as to be wholly unproductive of State.Grey points out that blacks wanted to work and be productive members of society, yet this ignorant group of white southerners was granted more rights than his own race."," The Reconstruction Acts of March 1867 forced southern states to comply with the North to attain readmission to the Union.Hume notes that Arkansas was one of the former rebellious states to undergo a Constitutional Convention to discuss politics and bridge together opposing factions.Among these factions was the meeting of whites and blacks in a political sphere for the first time since emancipation.This instance shows the small, successful steps made during Reconstruction for black suffrage in a southern state; at the Arkansas Constitutional Convention, Grey epitomized the intelligent free black who desired large changes in southern society.According to John B. Boles, white southerners varied along class lines, and the poor white yeoman farmer or the poor white southerner were in a class separate from the slave-owning farmer or plantation owner.Boles narrates that their economic situation resulted in less education, and poor white southerners suffered substantially during the Civil War years.Using the inequality of whites along intellectual and socio-economic lines, Grey aptly proved to his peers African Americans' right to both respect and suffrage.Grey supported his arguments about blacks' deserved equality by exposing the contradictions in southern society.His victory over a bigoted Cypert was a victory not only for Arkansas, but also for African Americans who were now free and struggling with their newfound emancipation in a discriminatory nation.Such minor victories would be hope for blacks across the South, as acts of injustice dominated southern society for years to come.","--J.R."],"display_date":"March 1, 1867 - January 30, 1868","search_date":"1867-08-15","locations":[{"id":712,"lat":34.5311279044,"lng":-90.7753398937,"zoom":9,"place":"PHILLIPS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2731,"title":"The Advancement of Medicine\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-01-01","end_date":"1892-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" On November 3, 1896, the American Journal of Obstetrics recounted a terrifying story from 1888 in Rockingham, Virginia.

According to Michael Perman, farmers were no longer making enough profit and the economy was out of balance. Many were pushing aside interests in agriculture at the same time that self-reliance and independence were becoming more important for the individual farmers. Things had gotten so bad that the governments had to step in and they were proposing remedies, new techniques of farming, and advising the farmers on improving their attitudes in regards to farming. As Perman points out, when the government got involved with agriculture, especially the Democratic Party, claiming that cultivation had to become more efficient and more up to date, even things like elections were influenced over the issue of agriculture. Since the Democratic leaders were perceived as better at advising farmers on these techniques to improve their farming methods, the farmers who followed this advice began to actually see change, and this influenced them to vote for the Democratic Party. Therefore, this led the Democratic Party to success, especially in these regions of the south."],"display_date":"October 19, 1876","search_date":"1876-10-19","locations":[{"id":13761,"lat":38.4860604965,"lng":-77.9559434026,"zoom":9,"place":"CULPEPER, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2736,"title":"Corruption in the Courts\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-01-01","end_date":"1877-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Judge Aylett Nicol, now no longer sitting on the bench but behind the defense council's table, breathed a sigh of relief.

There had been many property disputes of late , this time, Judge Nicol was caught up in one of them. "," Luckily for the Judge, those who presented testimony gave a very clear case and left no room for question. Today for the judge, the charges of official misconduct brought forth by J.J.

Cooper points out that in this time period, with all of the economic reconstruction going on, the land generally remained in white hands but with the difficulty of the times, a lot of times these landowners were not able to maintain their land and lacked the resources for diversification so they were unable to keep their property sometimes. In these cases, they would make agreements among one another or establish written agreements and they would sometimes even take on tenants. Furthermore, Cooper paints the picture that this was one of the largest deflationary periods seen yet in the United States where prices fell by one half between the years of 1865 and 1898. This is much of the reason for the suspicion of corruption in the courts across the South. The people were caught up in the exchange of land and especially someone like Judge Nicol who would have presided over many of these kinds of cases became a target because of his possible ability to exploit the system to his own benefit."],"display_date":"1876 - 1877","search_date":"1876-12-31","locations":[{"id":14190,"lat":38.5089863052,"lng":-77.2972733849,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE WILLIAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2738,"title":"One Family&#39;s Tragic Loss and Wartime Poverty\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-01","end_date":"1865-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While aboard a steamer ship headed from Alexandria, LA for Shreveport, LA, J.M. Bundy, a northern soldier, witnessed human cruelty and the outrageous poverty encompassing much of the South. Bundy and his Union comrades were invited to ride up the Red River to Shreveport on the Confederate flag-of-truce boat before a conference with southern officers about terms of surrender. Flying towards this vital meeting, the steamer ship needed more fuel, and deck hands began tactlessly tearing down fences along the banks of the river. Suddenly, a poor, woebegone, wretched looking old man came rushing down with his children...all crying together, imploring that the northern steamboat spare his fence. This poor white man complained that his crops just began growing, but he was too poor and weak to fix the fence, whose destruction meant starvation for himself and his family."," Both Bundy and a Confederate officer felt sympathy for this man, saying so to the men stealing the wood. The Confederate officer explained the problematic nature of this situation, professing, Our people only know one part of making war. They known how to fight, and that's all. The southern men have no business faculty. Although this officer requested supplies many times, his soldiers were naked and starving in their own homeland, the South. Bundy and the Rebel officer agreed upon the injustice of taking from an impoverished family. The two men were alarmed at the desperate state of affairs in these closing days of war."," Before the Civil War began, the poor white southerner felt the hardships of the plantation economy as a yeoman farmer or a tenant farmer. Expectedly, his situation worsened during the years of economic decline of in a nation at war, as John B. Boles describes. The extreme poverty suffered by a large portion of southerners during the Civil War was horrifying to this northern man. He and his enemy, a Confederate officer, shared the same opinion on the poor white southerner's situation: it was unfair for a quartermaster to destroy a family to attain a few pieces of wood. According to Boles, towards the end of the war, however, conditions worsened for soldiers and civilians alike, as the economy continued to deteriorate through a lack of Confederate economic policy. Boles illuminates families' struggles with starvation, and conquering Union troops, embittered too by the continuing war, made fewer exemptions for civilians, feeling less guilt at taking fence rails and other amenities. Bundy and his comrades were en route to finalize surrender by the Louisiana armies and still civilians suffered at the hand of apathetic officials. Bundy, unable to forget the unfortunate fate of this family, witnessed a typical tragedy throughout the poverty-stricken South, a family unable to sustain itself and apathy of exhausted officials.

Railroads were important because it not only provided a way to connect everyone in different areas, but also allowed for a more widespread distribution of the crops and resources people were growing or using. For the United States, the railroad was a major part in the development of the economy and the lines grew quite rapidly. Historian David Herbert Donald mentions in his work the importance of this growth for the farmers and everyone in general for transportation and the movement of goods, but especially how important this was in the steel industry.

A. Tayloe sat down by the fireplace to read the correspondence he had picked up. Today he received the latest news from a friend he had not seen in a long time, N. H. Hudson. As he read over the news, it was once again, as usual, all about how Mr. Hudson's planting season was going. In this particular letter, Mr. Hudson had finally gotten around to planting his cotton and he still intended to plant more cotton among the other things he was cultivating. Despite his general complaints about the weather, like the rain and his difficulty with getting the planting done as well as getting into town, Mr. Hudson seemed to be in good health as was his family. He discovered in this letter as well that Hudson was not going to be going into town quite as frequently as before because of the lack of service provided by the mail system so he would not be picking up his correspondence quite as frequently. ","After the Civil War was over, a primary concern for many was that without slave labor, it became more difficult to be prosperous agriculturally. For example, in Hudson's life, without slaves, planting and agriculture took over most aspects of his life. He became much more conscious of the weather patterns to the point that he began informing his friends about those in correspondence. As many farmers were feeling the same pressures Mr. Hudson was facing where agriculture dominated their lives, organizations like the Agricultural Wheel or the Farmer's Alliance developed. These groups claimed to stand for the interests of small producers and drew on the political support of the Greenbackers. Both of these institutions attempted to improve the farmer's standing in the competitive marketplace. Michael Holt says that even though these institutions excluded blacks, the blacks were also able to mobilize on their own to achieve some of the same things in the field of agriculture. This was not just a white phenomenon where they had to labor and try to be prosperous with their agriculture; the blacks also faced many of the same struggles."],"display_date":1887,"search_date":"1887-07-02","locations":[{"id":14212,"lat":38.6845288469,"lng":-78.1593262248,"zoom":10,"place":"RAPPAHANNOCK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2766,"title":"Petition of the U.S. Senate for compensation of land confiscation by United States Troops\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-04-10","end_date":"1874-04-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On this day Mr. West petitioned the United States Senate to obtain compensation for lands which he claimed were taken from him by United States troops in Jackson, Mississippi.

Though most of their neighbors were engaged in farming, twenty citizens of Athens, Georgia decided to break the mold. In January of 1849 they announced in the Athens <em>Southern Banner</em>, that they were joining together to form a new business: The Athens Manufacturing Company. In the announcement the company stated, [we] have associated ourselves together as a body corporate for the purpose of engaging in the business of manufacturing cotton and wool yarns and goods, and yarns and goods of which cotton and wool form component parts, and also of the manufacturing of flour and meal, and the repairing of machinery. ","The Athens Manufacturing Company was one of many new cotton-manufacturing companies established in Georgia during the 1840's. This sudden increase in industrialization was largely due to a series of developments over the early 1800's that came together to create a favorable environment for industry in Georgia. Manufacturing companies in Georgia were beginning to exist, but in 1849 they were still few and far between. It took a significant amount of money to start such a business and not many people could afford such a large investment. In the 1810's the change in national business law helped overcome this obstacle. Before this time, individuals or partners owned most businesses. This changed in the 1810's when the government began to recognize new corporate organizations that were composed of multiple investors. ","This group of investors was willing to take its chance at manufacturing but they needed a source of power for the machines they would use to make the cotton and wool products. During the 1820's, people in Georgia successfully harnessed waterpower, which became the source that provided the power for the Athens Manufacturing Company and other industrial businesses. In order to make a profit from the cotton and wool products, the Athens Manufacturing Company needed customers. Without a sufficiently-sized market such a company was not worth investing in; the number of buyers from Athens and the surrounding counties were not nearly enough to support the company. The rapid improvement of transportation systems across the nation in the early nineteenth century was responsible for increasing the size of markets, especially for inland companies such as this one. The Central Rail Road built in the 1830's provided an artery of transportation from central Georgia where Athens was located, to Savannah, an important national and international port on the Atlantic. ","Though Georgia was at the forefront of the textile industry in the South, the North had a significant head start and continued to dominate the national industry throughout the antebellum period. This regional disparity in strength caused political disagreements between the South and the North. This can be seen in looking at the increased tariff on foreign imported products in 1828, which was referred to in the South as the tariff of abominations. The tariff on foreign products was economically beneficial to American manufacturers, who were mainly found in the North, because overseas competition was decreased and they could raise prices. In the South most people were farmers, not manufacturers, and so the tariff was economically harmful because they had to pay more for manufactured goods. The increased price of manufactured products from the North was one source of motivation for the South to move from an almost entirely agricultural economy to a somewhat industrial one. The Athens Manufacturing Company provides an example of this change.

Logie went before a large gathering of farmers and cotton-growers in the Charlotte and proposed an organization of all cotton-farmers in the area. Under this association, farmers would pool their entire product of that year's growth, sell it as one, and share the dividends. This group would be headed by an elected congress of representative farmers who would create a constitution and by-laws for the agency, which would then create chapters in every state. Each state would be under the same management in terms of buying and selling, and all would be under the direction of the central board of control. "," While it is unknown if Logie obtained much support for his proposal, other alliances between farmers were very popular at this time and experienced much success, both economically and even in the political arena. Charlotte was considered to be one of the predominant Southern towns in the cotton industry. However, throughout the 1880s, agricultural depression had run deeply throughout North Carolina, causing many farmers to declare bankruptcy. Therefore, it is not surprising that Logie decided to propose his plan in this city, where he would find a large concentration of cotton-farmers also wondering at how to improve their economic means. The Farmer's Alliance, an organization founded by a group of farmers in Texas in response to the economic depression that ensued after the Civil War, had been increasing in size and popularity at this time, which likely inspired Logie to suggest a very similar society of farmers. "," The goal of the Farmer's Alliance was to increase the prices of their commodities through collective action in groups of individual farmers, which can be seen in Logie's proposal. The association quickly flourished and began establishing chapters throughout the south that helped white farmers buy goods at wholesale and sell their produce without having to pay a middleman. The organization eventually became involved in politics, and the alliance was later reborn as the Populist Party, centering on the same platform of government control of transportation and communication (which would help curb the powers of monopolies), as well as reforms of currency, land ownership, and tax policies. While historian Robert Hinton noted the ultimate failure of the Farmer's Alliance as an economic movement, their influence throughout the south, both agriculturally and politically, must be recognized as an inspiration to people like Logie who also desired to employ those tactics and attempt to improve the conditions of rural farmers.

Unable to reimburse the state for its expenditures, the Confederacy consequently produced a serious drain on North Carolina?s economy. Governor Vance proposed that the mercantile operations conducted under the State legislation, would generate a fair amount of revenue. However, Worth believed this proposal would not solve North Carolina?s economic problems. The trading system that was established with Europe contained many setbacks.

The Salisbury Truth article was composed of statements and facts gathered by a person who has given the subject a great deal of thought. The piece described how, with the help of modern machinery, one man and his two sons were able to complete work that had required 11,000 spinners only a few years ago, while another man was able to do the work of 50 weavers at once. Other machines had greatly affected the amount of labor needed to execute certain tasks, such as cotton printing machines, which had reduced hand labor by 1500 percent, and log sawing machines, which fostered the unemployment of 499 men out of 500. In the manufacturing of paper, the article reported that 95 percent of hand labor had been replaced, and by the use of machinery in loading and unloading ships, one man could do the work of 2000. "," While it is unknown whether these statistics are in fact correct, what they reveal is the profound effect mechanization had upon the South at this time. The author's wonder and admiration at the capabilities of this equipment was profound and sincere, and he predicted correctly that such devices would only improve in number and quality over time. In a society intensely focused on agriculture in particular, these machines were miraculous for the amount of time they saved and the efficiency in which they completed some of the most grueling and labor-intensive tasks. "," The effect these devices had on the South was profound. In previous decades, North Carolina had lagged behind other southern states in agricultural productivity and economic means; Mississippi and Alabama were the only states that ranked lower. However, from 1880-1900, textile manufacturing increased dramatically, along with the development of new railroads, highways, educational institutions, banks, and tobacco factories. These economic advancements were fairly unique to North Carolina compared with other southern states, claims historian Dwight Billings, making it known throughout the South for its progressiveness in the era of the Second Industrial Revolution. However, the effects of labor-saving machinery could be felt throughout the South, inspiring improvements in communication, transportation, and productivity. Those developments brought many rural people into Southern cities to work at mills and factories, and before long, a strong and substantial middle class had emerged.

He argued that instead of sending their daughters to large overgrown establishment outside of Athens, they should take advantage of the good teachers and schools available closer to home.  There are two advantages that this Old Citizen found in using the schools closer to home: it would keep the daughters at home and it would keep the money spent on education in the local economy.  ","The Old Citizen firmly believed that daughters should receive an education, just through different means than were popular at the time. Though his editorial implies that educating one's daughters was a common thing to do, he was writing to a specific audience who could afford to send their children away for private schooling. Though there was a push for the establishment of public education earlier, it would be six years before Georgia established a successful public schooling system.  Before 1858 almost all primary and secondary education took place in private schools or from private teachers.  The ability to pay for private teachers was limited to the upper classes, but sending children to boarding schools caused an additional burden because it prevented them from helping at home.","The advantage of keeping daughters at home is likely related to the important housework women performed.  In her book The Politics of Education in the New South, Rebecca Montgomery suggests a parallel between the position of women and the position of slaves in antebellum society.  She explains that legally both slaves and women were dependent on the patriarch.  In addition she draws parallels between the functions of the two groups.  While slaves did the hard labor in the fields, the women did the domestic work.  The importance of the woman's role in the house may have prevented people from wanting to send daughters away to school where they could not help at home and would not learn the domestic skills they would be expected to perform when they got married.  In addition the Old Citizen may have believed it better to keep daughters at home so that their morals could be guarded.  The patriarchal system centered in the home was the primary source of discipline and moral values in the antebellum South. ","This editorial also reflected on the economy of private education.  The Old Citizen wanted people to school their daughters in Athens so that the money they paid went back into the Athens economy.  This implies that there was an awareness of the value of the local economy in the antebellum South.  Though transportation systems were rapidly developing in the antebellum period, there was still a sense that keeping money at home, in the local economy, was a way to benefit one's community.  This was especially true in a developed urban area like Athens, which by the time of this editorial had been established for 67 years.

The Confederate Army, while withdrawing through Durham, acquainted Green's tobacco with the Federals. The soldiers raided the factory, and Mr. Green assumed his business was ruined.

Rapid growth of Durham in the post Civil War period was due to the surge in the tobacco manufacturing industry. Durham's escape from tradition is one of the main reasons why the city became the chief tobacco manufacturing center in North Carolina. Factories multiplied, warehouses were established, and there was an increase in population.","The development of tobacco manufacturing in the state, as historian Hugh Talmage Lefle found, was almost wholly the result of private initiative. The industry was highly concentrated graphically and completely owned by North Carolinians.

On Wednesday, October 6, 1897, North Carolina Governor Daniel L. Russell dismissed Otho Wilson, the railroad commissioner, for conspiring with the Southern Railway Company to promote his own economic interest. Wilson did this by appealing to the railway company to stop at his hotel in order to increase the eating-house's business. According to Russell and the witnesses gathered by him to testify against Wilson, this had a negative impact on many businesses in Hickory, North Carolina, the stop that was replaced by Wilson's hotel. The town's only restaurant was forced to close when the train ceased stopping there. Others faced difficulties in transporting or receiving merchandise, and many were inconvenienced by the extra travel now required to reach the closest railroad station. Not only did the effect Wilson's actions had on the town of Hickory warrant his dismissal, but Russell argued that by placing himself under obligations not only to the Southern Railway Company it disqualified him to act as a fair, impartial judge and juror in any controversy that might arise between such corporations and individual citizens. "," A few years later on January 25, 1899, a group of people decided to contest this decision and wrote an appeal to Governor Russell asking for an explanation, as they felt Wilson's dismissal was unjust. Russell responded with a lengthy document that described Wilson's misdeeds and explained how severely he had affected the town of Hickory solely for his own monetary gain. Russell, the first Republican Governor of North Carolina since the end of Reconstruction and the last until 1973, was chastised relentlessly by the Democrats, who took Wilson's indictment for bribery, as well as that of Dr. Moss, the Chairman of the Commissioners of Vance County, to reflect personally upon Russel's legislature since he had originally appointed them to those positions. The Democrats argued that those officials' effects on North Carolina politics and the economies of local towns was unforgivable, and must be corrected with a new Democratic governor. "," This scenario reveals a great deal about both the importance of transportation in South at this time and the politics involved with that institution. At this time, the railroad was the most effective means of transportation throughout the South. As the railroad tracks quickly lengthened, so did the population and industry of places with train stations. Therefore, a railroad commissioner usually made decisions about stopping points with great deliberation because their impact on towns would be considerable, which explains why Wilson's crime was so grave. Also, since railroads were the primary mode of transportation, the politics surrounding them were intense, and as historian Leslie Decker claims, often involved conflicts between political and economic interests. This can be seen in Russell's dilemma and in the reasons cited by the Democrats for his incompetence.

Brookes sent a letter to his father from his plantation in Jasper and Jones counties, Georgia. In the letter he discussed many problems he was facing on the plantation.  The troubles he wrote about included having to postpone planting, having to buy animals and having to deal with a fire in a field that burned a fence. He began the letter by discussing a delivery of materials by wagon that he had to send back to the city of Madison in the neighboring county.  The address did not clearly state that he was the intended recipient.  One reason the wagon's return was such a setback to Walker was that, among other things, this delivery contained two sacks of salt.  At the time salt was not only a condiment to improve the flavor of food, but a key nutritional component and a preservative. Without enough salt, Walter's health and food supply could have endangered.","In his book Salt: A World History, Mark Kurlansky recognized that salt had been an important substance throughout history.  People first and foremost had a biological need for salt.  Beyond this, though, salt was important because without easy refrigeration techniques, salt was necessary to store meat for later or to send it to sell in other places. This made salt trade and production an important element in the American economy from its earliest years. ","During the American Revolution there had been a series of salt shortages assuring that people in the years following would not forget salt's importance or the difficulty of obtaining it.  After the revolution there was increased salt production in the United States, this biggest production coming out of New York and Virginia.  Still, most of the salt in the United States was being imported.  ","Salt became especially important in the Civil War.  According to Kurlansky it was not only arms that the Southern army lacked but also salt.  For soldiers on the move salt was essential.  It allowed them to carry meat with them and served as a disinfectant during wars. ","We know that the Brookes family was wealthy, and so their financial ability to obtain salt was probably greater than most people in the South.  Since salt had to be imported either internationally or from a few places in the United States it was difficult to come by for everyone.  The shipping confusion experienced by Walker Brookes demonstrates the imperfections that existed in the system of distributing goods over the South.  Walker could not count on receiving what he needed when he expected it to come.  Having to send back a shipment of salt was not a matter of life or death for Walker Brookes, but it still provided plenty of reason to complain."],"display_date":"January 25, 1848","search_date":"1848-01-25","locations":[{"id":1945,"lat":33.3203883365,"lng":-83.69013905,"zoom":9,"place":"JASPER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2826,"title":"Desolating Epidemic in San Antonio\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-01-30","end_date":"1879-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["An unknown epidemic struck the community of San Antonio, Texas, in January of 1879. There had been much disease spread throughout Texas in this time, but this epidemic was unrecognizable. The symptoms were such as cholera or yellow fever, which had previously desolated the population in San Antonio, and more widely, throughout Texas. ","Cholera is usually transmitted through either the consumption of contaminated water. First seen in the early nineteenth century in Bengal, this disease proceeded to spread to Europe, Africa, and the Americas. There had been a large outbreak of cholera in the late 1860s, which had turned into quite an epidemic around Texas. Today, this epidemic is generally seen in third-world countries. ","In Texas, cholera went hand in hand with yellow fever. Though the symptoms of cholera are quite different than those of yellow fever, these two diseases came to Texas around the same time. Yellow fever, derived generally from mosquito bites, was a reoccurring problem in Texas from the early 1830s through the turn of the century. ","The symptoms of cholera are mainly diarrhea and vomiting, whereas those symptoms for yellow fever are body aches, jaundice, and elevated body temperature. This new advertised disease had similar symptoms, but these symptoms were much worse, though the disease proved less fatal. As far as doctors could tell, they believed this disease was called consumption. ","Consumption is another name for tuberculosis, which today is one of the most prominent diseases in the world, affecting people at the rate of one person per second. This epidemic in San Antonio, however, was not consumption of the lungs, as is typical today, but of a general decay or arrest of the vital processes of nutrition. The tuberculosis virus can infect practically all parts of the human body, which it seemed to do in this case. Symptoms of tuberculosis include loss of energy or weight, fever, and poor appetite. San Antonio doctors said that at the time, the only found remedy was liver oil, though this was debatable because of the terrible taste which prohibited many patients from being able to swallow it.","Today we have the tuberculin skin test that can help diagnose tuberculosis within three days, but in Texas in the late 1800s, they did not have tools such as this. Health problems abounded, the money going into the railroad and the Civil War having taken away from the medical budget in such a crucial and affective time.

After his purchases Isaac wrote to Hayne informing him of what he bought and each items price. His purchases included: 30 men's frock coats, twilled cotton and wool, at forty cents per yard, 12 boys coats, 175 yards of GDB cloth, and 175 yards of wool for women, both at forty eight cents per yard. The bill, which included other clothing materials, amounted to 100.  Isaac makes a defined effort to tell Hayne what materials remained at the same price from his trip the previous year, which was mainly the price per yard of cloth. Isaac did note that there were some increased changes in prices over the past year, to which he asks what the benefits of the Tariff of 1842 were, relating to the effects it had on the price of cloth. ","The Tariff Act of 1842 was passed in response to the Tariff Acts of 1832 and 1833, both of which imposed high duties on goods produced within the United States, including cotton and woolen goods. The Tariff Act of 1833 meant to gradually reduce duty rates, which it did, until 1842, when there was a drastic, forty-two percent drop in rates within a six-month period, down to twenty percent.  Duties were supposed to remain at this rate indefinitely, but only lasted two months, due to a quarrel between the Whig Party and President Tyler, which had caused them to separate.  The Tariff Act of 1842 got caught up in the eventual agreement made between the two, which caused the duties to be higher than the original twenty percent rate.  Consequently, the public was not very enthused about the tariff, as they realized that it did not conform to the wishes of the manufacturers, but rather those of the politicians. ","While the Tariff of 1842 meant to protect the American cotton textile industry, it was not as effective in its actual application. Isaac Hazard asked what the practical effect of the tariff had been, because he had not seen any results from it.  At the time, in comparison to the price of equivalent fabric in Great Britain, domestic fabric in the United States cost twenty percent more.  Despite this, it must be noted that without the tariff many American textile companies would not have survived.  This is because the United State's industry was technologically behind Great Britain's. So, Isaac Hazard's complaint to his boss was largely a lost one, in that while textile prices could have been better than they were there was a cap on how much they could improve.

While there had been an educational revival after the Civil War, public education was still defined by the typical one-room schoolhouse, taught by a young woman with children whose ages ranged from 6 years to 16 years. Teaching was not an ideal job; it was very difficult. Even with the difficulties, many Southern women were schoolteachers. These jobs gave women some independence in a primarily male-dominated world. "," In 1886, a young woman named G. E. Thomas agreed to teach in the Flood school-house for 35 dollars per month, which was just above the national average of 34.27. Her responsibilities included the upkeep of a school register and keeping the school room neat with the floor swept. She had to open school at 9 AM and had to give the children a one 1 hour break for lunch. School was over at 3:30. She was subject to a fine if she did not complete her duties, and she was required to attend a monthly meeting of teachers. While this was clearly a difficult job, G.E. Thomas signed the contract along with Mercer H. Gray, the chairman of the board. ","   Women throughout the South were often forced to work due to economic necessity. Teaching was the most common job that was socially acceptable for young women. Teaching was acceptable because it was an extension of a woman's role to nurture and care for the next generation. Women chose teaching in order to be economically self-sufficient. If a young woman was a spinster, teaching allowed her to help provide for her family and not to be an economic burden. It is unclear why G.E. Thomas decided to teach. She may have been unmarried and therefore needed the job to support herself since, without a husband, she was in a fragile position in Southern society. Regardless or her marital status, it was evident that she needed this job. Her school was for white children, as education was segregated at the time. Therefore, however small her school house may have been, her supplies and equipment were superior to any black school. Through teaching, women were able to contribute to the public sphere and gain some independence in a world where she was expected to be dependent on her family. Teaching was possible for many women because of the increasing standards of education throughout the United States. Especially in an increasingly industrialized society, education was important.

He killed over 4000 pounds of hogs, but gave away 400 pounds to a friend. Perhaps the meat would provide for his family throughout the cold winter, or he might sell it to a local market. Either way, livestock was an important alternative to crops, which were difficult to depend on as they often had bad seasons.

They decided it was better to produce only what their family would need and then grow cotton to maximize their profits.","Although farms and tobacco and cotton plantations played a large role in the agricultural side of the South, many families and farmers also depended on livestock and game. In the antebellum South, hunting provided a way to supplement their limited agricultural sources of food. Also southerners hunted to reduce the overabundance of wildlife that fed on their crops and livestock. Not only was hunting a means of survival, but also the wealthy thought of hunting as a way to demonstrate their social status. After the Civil War, however, hunting decreased due to the urbanization of the South. Cities and towns were forming, and people were becoming more concentrated.

The land was not being used to its highest potential, which was a significant appeal to the Trust company. Their intent was to use their resources to redistribute the land to a dependable group of working class people such as white immigrants that would be willing to revitalize the cotton industry. They would not only be profiting financially, but doing their part in reigniting the market in the area. Although the plantations were being dismantled, Twiggs residents were happy to see an organization take an interest in boosting the economy.","By the end of the nineteenth century, cotton had worn out its welcome as the cash crop of the South. While the North had moved on into industry, much of the South continued to revolve around agriculture, especially with the adoption of the sharecropping system following the end of slavery.

Although agriculture was expanding, the supply became so much higher than the demand that the price of cotton declined. Georgia's failing farming sector became the primary topic of the state's Agricultural Society and its branch of the Farmer's Alliance.","The most criticized aspect of the agricultural system was its dependence on sharecropping. Too many farms were being run by the tenants, mostly black families, to their own advantage without proper supervision by the landowners. Crops were not being cultivated to their utmost potential, but rather as a means to support individual families. The Union Real Estate Trust sought to remedy this situation.

In his correspondence to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox, Farragut mentioned the increasing number of Confederate deserters he and his men picked up from gunboats. The Union used these men for intelligence, however inaccurate, and continued to take them on in hopes of gaining new information. ","Union naval vessels took up more and more deserters as the war progressed. This symbolized a significant flaw in the Confederate cause. By 1865, as much as ten percent of the total Confederate forces had deserted their posts. In numbers, this totaled 104,000 men. In spite of initial zealous enthusiasm, as conditions worsened, soldiers struggled to maintain their drive for the cause. The Confederate government could no longer meet the needs of its soldiers. They could not pay, clothe, or feed their men adequately, and people deserted in response. Throughout the South, men wrote home to their wives lamenting their condition. In addition to having poor supplies themselves, men worried about their wives at home with their farms and slaves. As the war endured, men increasingly abandoned the Confederacy to protect themselves and their families. ","Another possible explanation for the increased desertion can be seen in the conscription of most of the Confederate army after 1862. This placed people in the army who were not necessarily committed to preserving the South. As the Confederate States of America increasingly became a lost cause, these men felt no need to continue risking their lives and those of their families.

Harrington, CSA of Franklin County, Mississippi. It seems Mrs. Jones, most likely a widow at the time of her writing (note that it was she and not her veteran husband who penned the request), had been unable to secure the pension entitled to her by state law as the widow of a Confederate soldier. Although, according to Joanna Short, the most common reasons for this were failure to provide sufficient evidence of military service, disability, or poverty, it seems Mrs. Jones was simply having trouble with the paper work; as most people not directly affiliated with armed forces or government usually were (and still are), she had, up until the time of her writing, been stumped as to the proper procedure for filling out the proper forms and thereby obtaining the proper compensation. To this end, she sought the assistance of Major Harrington.","Mrs. Jones' case was not uncommon during the time period. During the period after the Civil War, many states began giving benefits to families of those killed during the conflict. With the backing of the Federal Government, the practice was most prevalent and more generous in the North, as the northern states could better afford to compensate families, but southern states also adopted the practice. Originally, pensions were afforded only to war widows, or wounded soldiers with variable extent of... disability, from 5 per year for the loss of a finger or toe to 150 per year for the loss of two or more limbs or total blindness. Then, according to the U.S. Government National Archives, Mississippi began granting pensions to indigent Confederate veterans or their widows in 1888. In other words, now any veteran who was down on their luck could be compensated, even if the reasons for their hard times were unrelated to the Civil War. ","The reasons for this expansion of benefits, according to Theda Skocpol, were mainly political, as straightforward compensation for wartime disabilities [turned] into fuel for patronage politics. The issue became so pressing nation wide that in 1882, Representative Roswell G. Horr of Michigan observed: I think it is safe to say that each member of this House receives [at least] fifty letters each week in regard to aid obtaining a pension. The subsequent bureaucracy that grew to deal with the large number of requests resulted in confusion, extravagance, and injustice, claims Judge Parry. The issue grew so large between 1880 and 1910, says Skocpol, the U.S. federal government devoted over a quarter of its expenditures to distributing pensions, which, aside from interest payments on the national debt in the early 1880s...exceeded or nearly equaled other major categories of federal spending. (This figure stands as a stumbling block for historians claiming an absence of federal involvement in social welfare before the New Deal.) ","Returning to Mississippi, Joanna Short notes that the average pension by 1910 in the state was 43.36 per year (41.08 in 1893 by a CPI conversion), and that for many Confederate veterans who struggled to earn a living because of disabilities or their widows, who did not have as much access to the work force, this amount was not trivial. It is unknown whether or not Mrs. Jones was an original war widow, in which case she would have been missing out on a great deal of money due her since 1865, or was trying to take advantage of the expansion of grants since 1888. Either way, the amount of money she would hopefully soon be receiving, with the help of the gentleman Major P.C. Harrington, would certainly help her during the economically challenging post war times in the South. The issue would be especially pressing to her, as the country had just experienced what the Hon. John W.

The wedding was beautiful; everything she had dreamed of for her daughter. Lucia was marrying the distinguished Captain Cooke. Although he was a good deal older than Lucia, he was a kind, Christian gentleman. Mary was confident that this was a good match and was very hopeful for her daughter's happiness. Sadly, the family could not afford a lavish wedding tour, but this was inconsequential since her daughter was happy. Instead, her daughter went to their new house in Cumberland County to start their new life together. Mary couldn't wait to write to her friend Annie Coleman and brag about her wonderful daughter and the beautiful wedding. "," Weddings were clearly an important part of Southern social life. People could come together and celebrate, especially when the match was so highly regarded like the one between Lucia Harrison and Captain Cooke. Women in the South were expected to be married, and marriage was a sign of social status. Marriage was also an economic necessity for most women. A husband provided financial support, for the wife as well as for her family. In order to have a position within society, women needed to be married. Reconstruction had provided more legal rights for women, especially in the courts and with abuse cases. However, women were not equal to men, and they needed a husband to represent them in society. Mary was clearly proud of the marriage, however if Captain Cooke had not been a Christian, or respected, then the situation would be very different. The values of this family, like many other families in Virginia, were based on a sense of morality and religious ethics, and this marriage was everything that the family hoped for their daughter. Christianity and marriage were important aspects in what established, especially in regards to respectability with their neighbors.

The Michigan fields are being heavily drawn upon, while the crop in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin is eminently encouraging, thus relieving fears of an ice shortage. This was especially good news for Mr. Beasly of Crystal Springs, Mississippi, who ten years earlier had build an ice-house in his town in order to supply his neighbors with ice. Beasly had recognized that the ice trade was not only extremely important to warmer climate areas, such as Mississippi and much of the South, but also could be very profitable.","By the 1800s, of ice harvesting had been around for centuries. According to world-renown ice-historian Mariana Gosnell, the so-called ice craze really started in Boston, when a man named Frederick Tudor, in the manner of a drug pusher, set out [in 1805] to create a taste for cold that would get customers hooked. Over the next few decades, Tudor and his foreman Nathaniel Wyeth succeeded in refining the mass cultivation and shipping processes of ice. Harvesting the ice from the fields, which were, in fact, very, very much more than frozen over lakes and ponds, became an intricate and precisely designed process. According to Gosnell, once a thick layer of ice formed over a field, it would be scraped clean, shined, and then carved into a checker pattern of large ice blocks with a single bladed plow. Using saws the blocks were cut free and then, using large pike poles, floated through a carved out channel to a collection area. Although one might think this process would eventually dry out the lake or pond being used, the process apparently removed from a 400-square-foot ice field...each year [an amount of water that is] less than the total amount of water that evaporates from the surface of the very same lake during a single hot summer day. Much less. ","Thus, despite the ice machine's invention as early as 1850 and emergence of ice plants, neither of which were in widespread usage (religious skepticism being one of the reasons against), Tudor and others that had caught on began to sell ice in massive quantities literally all over the world. In fact, according to Gosnell, for years [in the nineteenth century] ice was America's second-biggest crop by weight to be transported by trains and ships, with the first being cotton. Much of that weight undoubtedly went through the South, not only for the preservation of foods, but also because no self respecting Southerner would drink his bourbon warm or her Dom Perignon above the temperature of 38 degrees Farenheit, excepting, perhaps, Jill Masterson.","Upon receiving a shipment of ice, a southern city or town would store it in pits, caves, or trenches underground; in cavities mostly underground but with roofs, or entry structures above ground; or entirely above ground, in insulated houses. Judging by the blurb in the Crystal Springs Monitor, Mr. Beasly's construction was most likely the latter, and was probably painted white to reflect sunlight and to make it look more like an igloo. Between its outer and inner walls there would be some type of insulation, be it tanners, bark, charcoal, sawdust, hay, straw, [or] shavings. With the proper construction, Beasly would be able to maintain approximately 70-90 percent of his stored ice, sometimes for many years. Nevertheless, as the 1890 Clarion Ledger blurb referred to a possible ice famine in the summer, Beasly and the area his business supplied were most likely in want of a fresh shipment."],"display_date":"March 13, 1890 - December 31, 1890","search_date":"1890-08-06","locations":[{"id":7008,"lat":31.8692302776,"lng":-90.4488242966,"zoom":9,"place":"COPIAH, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2866,"title":"Grand Opening of the Greenville Tobacco Warehouse\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-10-01","end_date":"1891-10-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["October 1, 1891 was a day to remember in the history of Greenville in Pitt County, North Carolina. The grand opening of the Greenville Tobacco Warehouse was the beginning of a new era in the prosperity of the town and community. The warehouse would allow the opportunity for farmers in Greenville to sell their tobacco close to home and by opening day, arrangements had already been made to bring in buyers from various other parts of North Carolina and other states.","The advent of the Greenville Tobacco Warehouse began to take form in June 1891 when a small group of men held a meeting in Greenville and made a unanimous decision to erect a local tobacco warehouse. They organized a stock company and the Greenville Land and Improvement Co. tendered a half an acre lot on Ninth Street upon which to build the warehouse. The company then purchased another adjoining lot of equal size to achieve the desired area with a floor space of 70x110 square feet. G.F. Evans conducted the warehouse during its first season with O.T. Forbes as the Floor Manager, L.L. Joyner as the bookkeeper and R.J. Hart as the auctioneer. G.F. Evans was the pioneer of tobacco culture in Pitt County and most farmers attributed its success largely to him. Everybody knew him as an upright, reliable man and believed that the general management of the warehouse could not have been placed in better hands.","The year 1890 had produced a good crop output and nearly every planter had increased his crop in 1891. In 1891, Pitt County planted approximately three thousand acres of tobacco. Tobacco warehouses had already been built in Rocky Mount, Wilson and Tarboro and Greenville's warehouse was characteristic of the greater spread of the tobacco culture along the Carolina coastal plains. While the heavy rains of July 1891 made for a bad crop season, the planters had invested too much time and capital to be discouraged.","As state farmers quickly realized the money to be made in tobacco, they began growing the bulk of their crops for market rather than producing their own food. Milton Ready suggested that the construction of the railroads, growth of towns and industries, multiplication of cotton gins and tobacco warehouses, where crops could be hauled in a day and sold for cash on the spot, made it practical to farm for profit. As this market economy continued to take hold in the South, the opening of the Greenville Warehouse reflects the widespread movement of tobacco culture throughout the Carolina Coastal Plains."],"display_date":"October 1, 1891","search_date":"1891-10-01","locations":[{"id":9728,"lat":35.5940864102,"lng":-77.3680066596,"zoom":9,"place":"PITT, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2868,"title":"The Cotton Planter&#39;s Convention at Macon and its Broader Implications\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-10-27","end_date":"1851-10-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The 1851 Cotton Planter's Convention in Macon, GA brought together 261 cotton farmers, who were agitated by recent criticisms of their economic practices.  More importantly, Charles Goethe Baylor came to the Convention to address the planters while on temporary leave from his position as the United States consul at Amsterdam.  The merchants of Amsterdam had authorized him to tender cash advances, at low interest, to merchants and planters who wished to trade with Amsterdam instead of Liverpool.  On October 14, 1851, a Georgia newspaper editor commented on the broader possibilities of a change in trade: England has of late years given a good deal of aid and comfort to abolitionism.  Her West India policy proves her antagonism to African slavery and her intervention in Cuba shows it still more, to say nothing of the money actually remitted by her anti-slavery societies, to promote abolition in this country.  Hence it becomes important for the south to foster the cotton manufacture of the continent of Europe, so as not to be dependent either on Old or New England. ","Baylor's speech was widely reprinted in newspapers in the weeks following the convention, and the planters were bursting to adopt his ideas.  The convention delegates immediately passed a resolution offered by Baylor favoring direct trade, and they further resolved that any adopted strategy must include direct trade.  The convention delegates, however, could not agree on what plan to adopt.  The one finally selected was widely criticized.  The national movement for direct trade began to grow and the planters became more involved in agricultural movements, but Baylor's activities did not succeed in bringing direct trade to the South.  "," Baylor did manage to empower the southern cotton planters, if only figuratively, by forcing them to consider the possibilities of their taking matters of international trade and economy into their own control.  They were a wealthy and potentially influential group of men who had the power to effect change for their own benefit, and to the advantage of the American free trade.  Baylor was likely one of the first prominent figures to publicly acknowledge that power and to ask the planters to use it.  He was perhaps more successful in doing so because of his valid and personalized appeal to the possibility of no longer being dependent upon England, which held both economic and cultural significance.  The country's abolitionist policies and England's historical control over the American economy were both significant points of tension, but the United States had yet to challenge or address either one.

Her favorite solution was browned, mature okra seeds, which came nearer in flavor to the real coffee than any other.

One white man and five black men were killed. Each side blamed the other for starting the riot. Its repercussions sent shockwaves through the state of Virginia, especially with the November elections so close at hand. In response to the Danville riot, Governor William Mahone sent out a public statement on his views of the Danville riot. Mahone blamed the bourbon managers (referring to the bourbon democrats) for provoking the collision. He claimed the violence was done to intimidate black people and hurt the cause of his Readjuster Party. He explained how United States troops had been requested since the state militia was so biased against blacks in dealing with the violence. The statement was clearly political, as he blamed his political enemies for the violence. "," The late nineteenth century was plagued with political upheaval, especially in the South, as Southerners searched for a postbellum identity. The Readjuster Party was a third party that had an important influence in Virginia politics. The party gave substantial power to blacks and was based on equality for all. The party wanted to lift the state debt and therefore cut many civil service programs. It rejected the radicalism of both the Republicans and the Bourbon Democrats, who were an extreme wing of the Democrat that resisted the compromises that the Democrats were trying to make. With the November elections approaching, the violence in Danville was the result of frustration on the part of whites because of the increase political mobilization and power of blacks. The failure of a black man to show respect to a white man was the catalyst, and the violence caused the situation to spin out of control. This reaction of violence to the perceived arrogance of negroes was typical throughout the South, as the practice of lynching indicates. It also reflected an intense sense of honor that was prevalent throughout the South. Through violence, whites kept blacks in their place and protected a sense of order. Blacks were given little opportunity to express their grievances, since the law was so often on the side of whites.

As the white administrators of the Paris Mountain Water Company drafted new rules of their newly acquired waterworks, they established regulations to prevent or oppress most African Americans in their struggle for survival in the post-Reconstruction era southern United States. For example, as a newly reunited extended family set up sharecropping efforts near each other; naturally, the familial unit was tempted to use the same water service to promote the health and overall welfare of the group. However, as the white power-holders discovered any shared service, the water would be cut off and the amount paid for the service would not be returned. Then, the freed African Americans were stranded with no running water, creating further obstacles against their future success as freed men. "," As Emancipation gave freedom to the African-American population across the South, the Paris Mountain Water Company in a district of Greenville of the same name instituted indirectly oppressing rules on the use of water on November 1, 1899. According to Edward Ayers, areas across the South took pride in their new water works and functioning sewers. As modernization and technological advances made indoor plumbing possible, the white southerners in control of the waterworks industry used their position of power to prevent these health-promoting developments from benefiting those who could not manage to acquire them; furthermore, as the forced division of slave families were sometimes repaired in the years of the 1880s and 1890s, families, whether of blood or not, were formed as support systems in response to oppressive rules and regulations of the post-Bellum South, according to Wilbert Jenkins. "," Beneath the tensions crossing race lines in different utility regulations lies the perseverant tatters of slavery as the whites struggled to keep the increasing African-American population in check; therefore, while the water regulations indirectly limited the African-American populations of Paris Mountain in Greenville and limited their access to health promoting indoor plumbing, it also indicates the pattern of oppression that persists up until the 20th century.

The central issue on the page, however, had nothing to do with crops, but had entirely to do with silver.  Indeed, under a section labeled Alliance Principles and Demands, the first demand was unlimited silver coinage, or certificates based on silver.","Since the 1870s, the Alliance had, no doubt, had much concern over the silver issue.  The passage of The Coinage Act of 1873 and the Resumption Act of 1875 (full resumption of convertibility of paper money into gold, and vice versa, occurring in 1879), the United States returned to a commodity monetary standard as in pre-Civil War times, with the only difference being that silver was omitted and the standard was entirely a gold standard.  According to Milton Friedman, the most obvious, but by no means the most important, consequence of the U.S. return to gold rather than to a bimetallic standard was the sharp rise in the gold-silver price ratio.  A far more important consequence was the effect on the nominal prices of goods and services in general.  The increased world demand for gold...coincided with a slowing in the rate of increase of the world's stock of gold and a rising output of goods and services.  The result of these economic factors was deflation from 1875 to 1896, at a rate of roughly 1.7 percent a year in the United States...[with] the wholesale prices of agricultural and other basic commodities [falling] at a greater rate (3.0 percent a year by one index).  ","In the latter part of the 1800s, this deflation became a serious concern for farmers in the United States, including those in Mississippi, as it exacerbated the ongoing problems with sharecropping and foreign competition. Deflation affected the farmers of Mississippi, as farmers are affected both by the falling prices (the things they are selling are worth less at the market) and also the rise in the real value of their debt (most farmers are debtors, meaning simply that they must borrow money to prepare their farm before they can hopefully sell enough products at harvest time to make a profit and pay off their loans).  As the Mississippi Historical Society states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, from 1870 to 1897, wheat prices fell from 1.06 a bushel to 63c a bushel, corn from 43c to 30c a bushel, and cotton from 15c a pound to 6c a pound. Most of the time farmers received even less for their produce.  The Historical Society blames over production, which may be true, but the overarching reason for this deflation was the monometallic standard.  Especially following 1890, deflation worsened and gave rise to the pro-silver politicians of the 1890s.  Because of the large farming constituency in Mississippi, these politicians were very popular in the State.  Such politicians supported returning to a bimetallic standard in order to ease the deflation and help American farmers (and sellers of silver), thus causing the State Alliance of Mississippi to publish in support of silver and agriculture in 1891.  ","The most influential silver politician of the 1890s was William Jennings Bryan, a Silver-Democrat (as opposed to a Gold Democrat) from Nebraska.  Bryan was especially popular in the strongly agricultural regions of the South, including Mississippi, and West.  Indeed, the Jackson Clarion Ledger repeatedly showered him with praise:  On July 9, 1896, the paper stated, in anticipation of the upcoming Democratic National Convention, that Mr. Bryan...is a finished orator with a resonant voice and command presence.  On October 15, 1896, the Clarion Ledger stated that Bryan is making the most wonderful canvass ever known in this country with his many speaking trips.  With these reports, the Ledger is reflecting his popularity with the farmers of Mississippi and the entire South.","In typical fashion, according to Friedman, William Jennings Bryan mesmerized the crowd at the 1896 Democratic National Convention with his now famous speech, in which he declared you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.  His speech has been called probably the most effective speech in the history of American party politics.  Bryan eventually won and accepted the Democratic nomination for President.  ","Although his platform had many other facets, which were outlined in his acceptance letter published in the Clarion Ledger on September 17, 1896, a bimetallic monetary standard and the free coinage of silver were always his main speaking points.  These points, however, began to lose ground during his campaign due to advances in gold extraction processes made by Scottish Chemists resulting in the beginnings of inflation.  Unfortunately for the Farmers' Alliance in Mississippi, Bryan's other platform stances were not strong enough for him to defeat William McKinley.  According to The World Almanac Encyclopedia of 1897, he ended up losing the election by 100 electoral votes and 603,514 popular votes.  As typical of the South and West, however, Bryan won 63,859 out of 71,184 votes in Mississippi, or slightly under 90 percent.  Election result maps show that McKinley was absolutely dominated in the region, excluding California, Oregon, and Washington.  Bryan's domination was due to the large farming and ranching constituencies in those areas, as well as, according to Richard Bensel, strong silver areas in such areas as Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, South Dakota, and Utah.  No doubt the Farmers' Alliance of Mississippi, as did many other similar organizations, rallied in his support."],"display_date":"November 5, 1891 - November 30, 1896","search_date":"1894-05-19","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2893,"title":"1843 Milledgeville Tax Ordinance Burdens Blacks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1843-01-01","end_date":"1843-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In August of 1843, the city of Milledgeville, GA published an ordinance announcing new tax rates that had been issued for the purpose of extinguishing the indebtedness incurred during past years. Taxable property included land, houses, stock, inventory, modes of transportation, entertainers, and luxury items, but the list also included various classes of people. White men, free black men and women, and enslaved men and women that [exercised] the privileges of free persons of color were taxed. Slaveholders paid taxes on their slaves as well. Higher taxes were levied on the more valuable slave demographics, especially men between the ages of sixteen and sixty. Free black men of the same working-age demographic had the highest tax of any of these groups. ","Notably, the two to four dollar tax on white men was listed as commutation for patrol and road and street duties, but no explanation was given for the levies on other populations. Taxes on slaveholdings resulted from their being legally considered property and taxed as such, analogous to the taxation of stock, inventory, horses and wagons also listed in the ordinance. The slave demographics were specified because age and gender affected a slave's economic value. ","Milledgeville taxation was a standard practice, and the 1843 levies increased because of an economic depression between 1841 and 1843. The taxation of free blacks, however, suggests that taxation was not solely for the purpose of funding municipal activities. Free blacks were not 'property,' and in Milledgeville they did not have to pay as many duties as white men, perhaps because they were not considered privy to the same civic securities. Instead, these taxes served a regulatory function; sometimes as high as sixteen dollars, the city's government hoped that even one or two taxes, if high enough, would force or persuade the free black population to leave the city. An additional fifty dollar tax was levied on free African Americans bold enough to move into the city. In spite of these efforts, Milledgeville remained a popular location for newly freed blacks who sought an alternative to the agricultural plantation work available in the country. ","This 'head tax' was commonly used in the South in order to discourage residency and, ideally, force free blacks to move from the area in question. In some areas of the South, the tax could also result in forced bondage; if taxes were not paid and there was no valuable property to be seized, the county could hire out the offender and force him or her to work off the debt, often for menial wages that resulted in months of involuntary labor. These taxes are only some of the ways in which free blacks were formally or informally discriminated against; between 1810 and 1822, free blacks were not allowed to live in Milledgeville at all, and even in 1843 they were required to present a certificate and bond for good behavior in addition to the tax.

Furthermore, next to each slave's name he wrote descriptions. Not physical descriptions but personality traits. Manigault deemed Jacob smart and intelligent and Plato he thought to be good and trusty; however, his praises stopped with Young John when he described him as lazy and Moses as slow and complaining. Manigault commented on his slaves' characters and personalities, not just their working abilities. He called Bob slow, honest, good. These traits have very little to do with work ethic and mostly with character."," It's not personal, it's business has become a mantra for much of the twentieth-century corporate world. Slave owners in the early nineteenth century, however, did not have the luxury of making that distinction because they were dealing with inherently personal things: humans. Charles Manigault displayed this fascinating balance between humanity and business in many of the records he kept of his plantation, as seen in these records. Slaveholders all had to navigate between the fact that their slaves were human and the fact that they were possessions. Many slaveholders did so by recognizing families and marriages within the plantation, by giving slaves measured freedom during their few days off, and by acknowledging such humanizing characteristics such as temperament and work ethic. Slaveholders did, however, repress this humanity in their slaves. They did so through whippings and constant verbal reminders to their slaves of their enslavement, and very few slaveholders to take familial ties into account when contemplating whether or not to sell a slave. "," This repression of enslaved people's humanity had two purposes. The first purpose was to keep slaves enslaved. By constantly suppressing their humanity and treating them as objects, many slaves learned to act as such, at least towards their masters. This deference and servility most likely made the day to day operations of the plantation far easier. The second purpose of the repression of humanity was for slaveholders' own consciences. Had slaveholders dwelled on the humanity of those people whom they were forcibly enslaving, slavery would not have continued. Instead slaveholders reduced their slaves to only partly human, seeing them as children they had to care for not humans they were enslaving. "," This paradox of understanding slaves' humanity as well as treating them as possessions applied to every slaveholder as well as to many non slaveholders who upheld this system of slavery and paternalism.

And on November 1, 1860, Charleston celebrated a huge commercial step forward with the completion of the Savannah-Charleston railroad. The Charleston News and Courier commemorated the event with a lengthy history of the founding of Georgia and the opportunities the new line would bring economically for both states, boasting, For a new road it exhibits remarkable excellencies, and for its distance and cost it may challenge comparison with any road, European or American, within a maritime belt or region of country.","Accounts like this aside, historians vary between glass-half-full and glass-half-empty views of Charleston's status as an economic center in the antebellum South. Historian Ernest M. Lander, Jr., adopts the former view and concludes that Charleston was the industrial center of South Carolina in 1860, reaching a peak in 1856 of 3,000,000 in industrial production. However, his optimistic outlook is tempered in his conclusion, which notes that capital was limited, Northern competition fierce, and fires between 1856 and 1861 destroyed several promising factories. Historian Leonard Stavisky, in contrast, adopts an overall more pessimistic stance, contending that the plantation system, with its reliance on slave labor, kept an otherwise strategically positioned Charleston from achieving optimal levels of industrialization. ","Regardless of whether or not Charleston was one of the principal industrial centers in the South, this episode-and the reaction by the News and Courier-serves to illustrate the dominance of one particular economic variable in Southern life-trade-and the attempts of Southerners to use it to strengthen their economy. Indeed, as historian R.S. Cotterill notes, Time was when Charleston had been the social and industrial center of the south, but its glory had long since departed...Charleston was not ignorant of the cause of the decline, and set herself to the task of reviving her commerce by diverting western trade from New Orleans to herself. The surest way to divert western trade was to join the flurry of railroad construction occurring nationwide during the mid-nineteenth century."],"display_date":"November 1, 1860","search_date":"1860-11-01","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2918,"title":"A Polite Education\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1828-09-18","end_date":"1828-09-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Education for women in the Antebellum South played a key role in defining and regulating social status. Many Southerners did not see education as a way to enlighten women, but rather to refine and polish them, and make them more suitable for marriage. In the Argus newspaper, published in Savannah, Georgia, an advertisement appeared in September of 1828. It announced Mr. Phillips's new school for young ladies, where they will be instructed in every branch of a polite and finished Education. Mr. Phillips's ad attempted to present his school as safe and innocuous. He called the subjects he would be teaching, polite and finished despite the fact that the formidable list of subjects he planned to teach was 11 topics long and included Writing, Astronomy, Rhetoric, and French. This attempt to make the school sound safe made sense given the tenuous position women's education had in the minds of southerners. "," The education of women in the South was both frightening to white men and necessary to the structure of southern society. In the male dominated South, men acted as heads of the household, and relied on domination of their wives and daughters as much as they relied on domination of their slaves to hold their position in society. An educated woman posed a threat to this domination by setting herself on an equal plane with white men. Education, however, also was a hallmark of the middle and upper classes in the South and a southern woman could not hope to be accepted into higher class society without a minimal education. If a woman was educated it meant that her family had had enough labor in the form of slaves or servants so that she did not have to work to help the family but instead could devote her time to studying. This concept of leisure time for women was intricately connected to the concepts of class and education. Mr. Phillips's advertisement perfectly demonstrates these tensions between male dominated society and the preservation of existing class structures by publicizing a school that he presents as both harmless and impressive at the same time.

President R.T.C. Hunter oversaw the meeting as Mr. J.C. S. Brown discussed the necessary control of labor; he laid stress on the fact that no matter the situation, whether it was the tenant, the cropper, or the hiring system, the farmer was conned out of the most profit. As the President called for open discussion, Mr. E. P. Chalmers argued that if the farmers did not control their labor force in a more contractual manner, farming would be futile. According to this man, the farming community should have banded together in order to agree upon a labor committee; in response, Mr. H. H. Folk described a committee to find common beliefs between all members of the labor clubs across the county, and this concept was later adopted. Then, Mr. Chalmers described his essay on small grain; in his essay, he stressed the importance of independent sustenance farming. The modernization of the upper county yielded this change of food production as the farmers had become accustomed in shipping food stores; however, in the lower portion, the farmers continued to produce their own food, which attributes their success. However, Mr. Frank Moon contested this with the fact that the upper half's increased poverty level was a result of the greater impact of the freeing of the negroes. In response to all statements, Senator J.A. Sligh observed that the farmers were in a ruinous system that needed to be changed from the all cotton system. By raising all cotton, the farmers were forced to buy bread and meat; this economic system had to be restructured to incorporate food production in the economic system's post-war reconstruction."," While the farmers at the Newberry convention had personal arguments over labor in their county, this debate can be seen as a microcosm involving the labor issues across the state of South Carolina. As farmers across Newberry County attempted to stabilize the economy in the increased growth of cash crops, like cotton, which, modernization, according to Gerald Nash, played a major part in the economic metamorphosis after the war. As the slave system fell, industrial powers increased; however, labor was still required. Newberry County, and similar areas across the south, attempted a cotton-only market; however, they found that capital was not found in their constant import of food staples. Modernization decreased hard-labor requirements; however, their complete focus on cotton as a result of this lower labor level yielded economic instability that yielded labor debates across the area."],"display_date":"February 22, 1886 - February 23, 1886","search_date":"1886-02-22","locations":[{"id":11611,"lat":34.2951280342,"lng":-81.6113260746,"zoom":9,"place":"NEWBERRY, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2933,"title":"Wyatt&#39;s Imprisonment\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-05","end_date":"1863-01-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The common practice of hiring out one's slaves ensured that even when work was less plentiful on the plantation, a master's investment in a slave would still be lucrative. A slave in this position identified only as Wyatt landed himself in jail after attempting repeatedly to be sold back to the plantation where his family resided. The current owners who had been trying to sell him wrote a letter to George W. Hamner, owner of Wyatt's family, informing him that Wyatt was for going off with you at all events - we therefore put him in jail - where we will keep him until we hear from you...we think he is too much a man of his own head to hire out anymore.

He writes that at the slave markets, consumers are often able to maintain a moral high ground in comparison to the traders, however misguided.

Thinly-veiled attempts at humane treatment are not enough to conceal the truly vicious nature of slavery. However, Johnson's book focuses mainly on New Orleans in the antebellum period, and this episode took place in Virginia in the midst of the Civil War. This may explain Wyatt's assertiveness - the Emancipation Proclamation had actually gone into affect four days earlier and many slaves pressed for their rights even when resentful masters and slave traders refused to grant them. In fact, in many states in the deeper South, slaves often did not even find out they had been emancipated until after the war ended. However, Virginia's proximity to the North and Washington, D.C. made it difficult for owners to conceal the news of emancipation.

It was the first steam ferry offering service across the Chesapeake, able to complete the trip in a mere five minutes, a feat that at the time was remarkably fast. Previously, ferries were man-powered or run by a blind mule or horse turning paddles by treadmill. The editors of The <em>Norfolk Herald</em> volunteered their confidence that this endeavor was certain to garner a good deal of wealth for its investors who were providing a much needed service to the Norfolk community.","This adoption of steam technology in the Norfolk harbor was quite delayed in comparison to the rest of the Unites States. By 1817, ten steam ships had been commissioned to run between New York and Albany, and steamboats were coming to be a common sight on the Delaware, Ohio, and Mississippi rivers. By the time the Gosport finally arrived in Norfolk, steam technology was already being included in plans for mass transit and exchange across the Atlantic. The Englishman John McGregor wrote a two volume work describing the great benefit to be made in creating a system of exchange using the new steamboat technology, focused largely on utilizing the vast resources provided by American land. Named in honor of that part of the Tidewater area where the navy shipyard is located, the Gosport was part of a larger movement attributable to the invention of the steam engine, which enabled not only the use of steam to power boats, but also the establishment of a national network of railways. The high pressure steam engine, developed in the early 1800s, not only enabled more expedient travel, but also aided industrialization in the North and the growth of sawmills, especially in the lower Mississippi Valley region. These innovations in effect brought the States closer geographically, and helped to fuel both local and national commerce.

The welcome that the workers recruited from California received when they stepped foot on the rich white Gay family's land was far from hospitable.  Moon-Ho Jung's <em>Coolies and Cane</em> frankly describes the scene: Gay's son Andrew, a planter himself, found the Chinese 'the queerest looking creatures he ever saw,' while his daughter 'laughed till she cried when they came stalking off the boat.'  These foreigners were received with a welcome of mocking disdain.  Gay's wife tried to fit the Chinese into her perception of the local racial structure.  She identified the Chinese as a mixture of mulatoe and Indian.  Edward Gay quickly tried to assimilate his new laborers into his plantation culture.  He gave them work clothes and sent them directly to work in the sugarcane fields.  The Chinese were only allowed to wear their Chinese dress on Sundays.  Just like slaves had been treated, these Chinese workers were stripped of their cultural dress the moment they arrived in Louisiana.  Although these were hired laborers, unlike African American slaves, they still faced similar repression in terms of expressing their specific culture traditions.","    Chinese laborers were gathered from California since agricultural labor was so scarce during Reconstruction in the plantation districts of Louisiana.  Many slaves had left the country or the South altogether, trying to shed its memories of bondage; others still just refused to do the same work they had been forced to do only a few years ago.  White workers often refused to take jobs formerly worked by slaves, as they felt such toil to be below them.  Therefore, with a large and continuously growing Chinese population in California, many plantation owners like Edward Gay looked to this other race to supply their need of labor.  As J.R. Tucker states in his article Race Progress in the United States, 75,132 of the 105,465 Chinese living in America in 1880 were located in California.  In addition, over 70,000 of the Chinese living in California were adult males who were prime candidates for the strenuous labor of the Louisiana cane fields.  ","Since labor prospects for post-Civil War Louisiana plantations were insufficient, owners looked to the growing Chinese population of California to assuage their problem.  Once the Chinese arrived in Louisiana, however, they faced prejudiced treatment that lingered from the recent times of slavery.  Racism was still deeply entrenched in many mindsets of the Louisiana Delta, and was reflected onto the unfamiliar Chinese the planters sought to exploit.

If freed from slavery, a person was forced to leave the state, in accordance with an 1806 VA state law. The only reprieve from this forced emigration was to get a special dispensation from the state legislature on account of a good record. Many petitions were made, but few granted, especially in the wake of the Nat Turner Rebellion. More often, manumission was made on the condition of emigration to Liberia, a state on the West Coast of Africa established for the purpose of harboring former slaves. For example, when Billy Pugh, a slave owned by the Overseers of the Poor of Norfolk County, was recommended for such a dispensation in December 1832, he was denied; This man had spent thirty years of his life raising several thousand dollars for the poor, and his only reward was the option to leave his home continent for Africa. Only three former slaves were permitted to stay in Virginia during the mid-1930s, all of whom were elderly and had provided significant service to the white population. The economy of Norfolk at this time was inextricably tied with slavery. Most enslaved men were considered semi-skilled or skilled workers, and the women filled scores of domestic positions. The shear numbers of slaves speak to how dependent upon slave labor the county was: In 1830, in a population of 9,814, slaves numbered 3,756, about 38 percent of the population.

E.B. Gaston took a group of people down to Baldwin County, Alabama on the Mobile Bay. A colony free from all forms of private monopoly, a colony where working people could come together to form a single-tax community was founded. Members of the Fairhope Industrial Association were all followers of economist Henry George, who asserted that the concentration of unearned wealth, or more specifically, wealth accumulated by rent tax, was the root cause of poverty. George's ideas were based on socialist tendencies but gained strength with the Populist movement in the United States. The members of the Fairhope Industrial Association could agree upon the ideals of a single-tax. They were searching to create a colony somewhere in the South, as most of the members were from the mid-western states such as Iowa and Illinois. The problem was finding a location where the Fairhope Single-Tax Colony could thrive. ","The Fairhope Committee presented their final findings after doing extensive field research in the Fairhope Courier, published out of Des Moines, Iowa, on August fifteenth of 1984. The publication's first episode examined potential spots to start a single tax colony, asking members of the Fairhope Industrial Association (assumed to be future colonists themselves) to vote. They visited locations in Tennessee, Texas, Louisiana and Alabama's Baldwin County and reviewed each extensively for their members to vote on. They reviewed agricultural conditions as well as social demographics. The report concluded the presence throughout the south of the black man is a serious drawback to its development, and furthermore suggested that the organization's members should favor lands with the least amount of Black people. They also reported on conditions such as soil type, climate, and geographic location. Three months later the colony was founded in Baldwin County Alabama, chosen for its favorable conditions described in the report: close proximity to the ocean and the bay as well as its fertile soil as well as its social demographics. It was named Fairhope. ","At the time movements with similar visions of social reform were taking place in the South. The Farmer's Alliance, one of the most important agricultural movements to ever come through Alabama, was gaining strength throughout the South, including places like Alabama and The Negro Alliance of farmers claimed 120,000 in 1891 and in 1889 claimed to have 50,000 members in Alabama alone. Eventually these groups became more and more divided on the issue of black membership and participation in politics. There is indication within the initial report published by the founders of Fairhope that they were aware of these issues in the South and wanted to avoid them by altogether avoiding black people in their community."],"display_date":"November 1894","search_date":"1894-11-15","locations":[{"id":17,"lat":30.2786488602,"lng":-87.5482936023,"zoom":9,"place":"BALDWIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2987,"title":"Convict Standoff\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-07-13","end_date":"1886-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was already hot. As the Superintendent lined the convicts up to march back to the Dade County coal mines for another day of exhausting labor, one group refused to move. At the head of a long line of men chained together, the leader of the rebellion spoke up to Colonel Tower. He said that he and all the rest of the men from his stockade refused to work another day in the heat at their awful work. He defied the Superintendent to shoot them down- they were prisoners for life anyway and nothing could be worse than what they were set to do. ","Faced with such a situation, Colonel Tower immediately informed Governor McDaniel. Alarmed at the prospect of a rebellion and a breakdown in the convict lease system, Governor McDaniel ordered out the military and held them ready to intervene if necessary. After some consideration, Colonel Tower decided that the best way to control this outburst of Senator Joe Brown?s leased convicts was to starve them out. Feeling comfortable with the measures taken to guard the compound of stockades and with the presence of military backup, Tower put his method into action. Forty-eight hours later, the convicts were still without food, and the residents of nearby Cole City were fearful of vengeful attack. Colonel Tower stood by the stockade with the inmates inside all night. He tried persuasion and threats, keeping a conversation going with the convicts. By daybreak, the rebels were hungry-and a few of them were hungrier than the rest. These few decided that they wanted to surrender, that they had had enough. Their fellow convicts immediately set upon them physically, upset with their actions. Despite this show of force on the part of the rebellion?s leaders, the sentiments of the few soon spread to the rest. By the end of that day, all save one of the rebels had surrendered the cause. ","This episode is indicative of the perils of the southern convict lease system in the post-war period. As historian Mark Carleton notes, this plentiful source of cheap labor was irresistible to southern state governments with prison management problems. Indeed all southern states used the system after the 1870s. This episode indicates the support politicians gave the system because the leases were a source of state revenue at the same time as they eliminated the drain on the state to house and feed criminals. As evidenced in the protests of these convicts in Dade County, the workers were poorly fed and cared-for and suffered physical abuse by those overseeing their work. Carleton makes the point that as convicted criminals, no one was concerned for their well-being. Thus, when conditions became unbearable, they had to speak up for themselves. Indeed, the terrible conditions described by the convicts here appear to historians today to been a very like those under slavery in the antebellum south.

Immediately, the committee addresses exceedingly low prices of cotton of the time period and the further deflation to come. With prices...lower than they have ever been previously at the time, foreign speculators were holding off purchases to wait for cheaper prices. The committee then stated how, with a climate and soil to allow such amazing crops of cotton, the South Carolinians should have been the controlling players of the cotton-trading world; however, with every cotton worker as an independent entity, the unity required seemed impossible. With a union as the ultimate goal, the committee states that the pattern of success would be to adopt the ideas of the National Cotton Growers? union, to organize propmty, to refuse sale of the cotton on hand and hold off production 50 percent. By doing this, the farmers would cause inflation. The article concluded with, ?The industry will be but an illustration of the survival of the fittest; those who can raise it cheapest and those who cannot compete must accept the cheerless and hopeless lot of the bankrupt and pauper.?"," The struggles of the cotton industry in Columbia during the 1890s are evident as the union flounders in its attempts to stabilize their economy. In South Carolina, the cotton industry increased production immediately after the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865; however, with a surplus of crop, the prices drastically began to fall. By the turn of the century, the toll of the war and the south?s attempts to reestablish their once booming economy was manifested in social and labor unions like the Cotton Growers? Union of South Carolina. Sheldon Hackney describes the South?s economic struggle as a constant race in which hard work only guaranteed maintenance of their minimal industrial capital.

In January of 1897 nearly all the members of the Fairhope community agreed to give from 8am to 12 noon on first and third Saturdays for public work. They agreed to receive compensation other than the results of their labor and the satisfaction of having performed a public duty. In another town this might suggest that the town was in a desperate position and relied on its citizens to accomplish public projects.

They were willing to make personal sacrifices for the greater good and the efforts of the townspeople in Fairhope Alabama reflect strong American ideals about citizenship and responsibility. The citizens of Fairhope went to live there based on their shared ideas about economic reforms to the institutions of government and society but agreements such as the one made in January of 1897 show that they had the desire to fulfill these ideals on a grass roots level and understood how their efforts could be practically applied.

Wiltberger, while sitting at breakfast one morning, was interrupted by his overseer. The overseer angrily informed Wiltberger that Jane, one of Wiltberger's slaves, was missing. Other slaves were being questioned but so far, the overseer could find out nothing. Incensed, Wiltberger questioned his slaves further, but to no avail. He then picked up his pen and proceeded to write an advertisement to the Argus, the Savannah newspaper, calling on all whites to help him regain his property. He offered a 50 reward for the capture of his slave. He described her as a Mulatto Female Slave, named JANE, about eighteen years of age-5 feet two or three inches high-stout and well made-a pleasing and intelligent countenance-long jet black hair. The ad first appeared on July 14, and two months later, was still being printed in every issue of the newspaper. "," Wiltberger's description of Jane does a great deal to reveal why Jane had been successful in evading capture thus far. First, he described her as mulatto meaning that she had lighter skin than most enslaved people. Often, potential slave buyers were hesitant to buy lighter skinned slaves because they had a better chance of successfully escaping. Also, once away, a lighter skinned African American would have a better chance of blending into white society. Wiltberger's ad and the length of time it stayed in the newspaper, both demonstrate the basis on which these fears were founded. Wiltberger also described her as having a pleasing and intelligent countenance. Because many white southerners associated whiteness with intelligence and blackness with ignorance, lighter skinned slaves proved more of a liability and a threat to slaveholders because they were thought to be more intelligent and thus more able to run away."," One of a slaveholder's biggest concerns when debating whether or not to buy a slave was if that slave would run away or not. Many For Sale ads in newspapers made a point of stating that the slave being advertised would never run away. This emphasis shows what a huge issue it was in slave society and the lengths to which a slaveholder would go to in order to regain his property. Jane might not have been perceived as such a huge liability initially, however, because of her gender. Seventy-five percent of runaways were male, simply because female slaves gave birth and had the responsibilities of motherhood so early in life. Jane, at age 18, might already have had children that she was abandoning in her bid for freedom. Her gender also, no doubt, helped in her success because a black woman was perceived as far less of a threat than a black man in the South; therefore, she would likely have had an easier time blending into a crowd. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know whether Jane got away, or whether Wiltberger's ad succeeded.

Their goal, under the guidance of their president, Rev. Howard Hyde Russell, was to unify the anti-alcohol sentiment already brewing in society and to enact further legislation to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcohol. Grounded in moral and religious ideals, the movement was able to spread information via pamphlets, newspapers, and the spoken word. Originating in Ohio, the American temperance organization was able to flow southward, slowly encompassing a nation. ","An article written in the Washington Post in 1897 exemplifies the efforts made by the organization to illustrate their cause and purpose throughout society. The realized the need to come together as a cohesive unit in the area. The Washington D.C. area, with 15 temperance organizations, convened with the Montgomery, Maryland County League seeking greater cooperation. The article made it seem relatively easy. However, the J.C. Jackson understood that the league struggled at first due to organizational and financial difficulties. Besides discussing organizational problems, the meeting conferred about the actions taken by members to badger grocers who profited from alcohol-related sales. The President was then authorized to appoint a committee whose purpose was to prepare a list of all grocers who recently received a liquor license. This was essential to the cause of the Anti-Saloon League. They wanted sales to cease, thus patronizing liquor salesperson was one of many necessary tactics incorporated. Such agitation meetings were usually held on Sunday with official leaders present. In 1908, there were at least 15,000 meetings. This number, however, fails to take into account the numerous meetings regarding prohibition, political good-citizenship, and law enforcement that the league had either a direct or an indirect relationship with.","Such meetings of prohibition in the country were essential to the South. Prohibitionist began making headway beginning with the execution of a new, more powerful liquor law was put into place. It exemplifies the coming of the Progressive movement that was extensive throughout the early years of the 20th century South. Church and political leaders believed that a large portion of societal problems, such as poverty, sickness, and crime were heavily due to alcohol. Due to the help of the evangelicals, Protestants, and Republican party, prohibition laws were able to be ratified. The Anti-Saloon League as well as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, were able to gain local and state wide option laws in most states; finally culminating in 1919 with the passage of the 18th Amendment. Prohibition dealt with humanizing institutions to adhere to newfound prized values and traditions. The southern ethos of the 20th century hurt the liquor industry doing the prohibition era. This resulted in the rise of moonshining.

An anonymous man wrote a letter to the editor of <em>The Argus</em> in the summer of 1828, and in his etter he clearly demonstrated his inherent mistrust of outsiders. This man owned a boarding house and was writing to the paper in search of a solution to a problem he had run into with one of his boarders-a Yankee. This Yankee had requested that the boarding house owner post a large packet of letters to Blossomdale, Vermont, free of charge. The boarding house owner wrote, Now, Mr. Printer, can you tell me where Blossomdale village is, and how I am to get these letters there, without paying postage? Is it on this earth, or in the West Indies, or that Moon? Obviously flummoxed, this boarding house owner allowed his previous misconceptions about Yankees (or, in his mind, the others) to turn this situation into a huge, public ordeal as opposed to a small matter between a boarder and the boarding house owner. Southerners were trained from a young age to mistrust those from outside of the South, particularly northerners. An algebra book used widely in the South included problems where southern students were asked to calculate the speeds of two different Yankee soldiers running away from battle, and the profit a Yankee trader made on selling bad pork. Inculcated early with this mistrust, it is little wonder that the boarding house owner acted as he did. These fears and misunderstandings grew through the subsequent thirty years and exacerbated the escalating conflict between North and South, to the point that, by the early 1860s, some southerners saw themselves as a separate race from northerners. They saw the differences in race between northerners and southerners not as biological factors but factors inherent in their characters.

On August 31, 1899, the unofficial strike of the black men disrupted the handling and loading of ships in the Warwick County port. However, within one day, the shipping company had obtained nearly one hundred white men to fill the vacant jobs. While the stevedores asked the black men to work through the end of the week, in exchange for a promise that the shipping company would reevaluate its hiring of non union whites. The black men declined this offer and stated once again that they would only work if the white men were laid off. As blacks entered into capitalistic competition with whites, the dynamic of race relations changed drastically from what many Southern whites had faced before the War. While this episode indicates the interchange of ideas and economic opportunity, it also shows that skin color played a large role in how minorities dealt with their participation in a predominantly white social and economic order. The blacks that form the union practice a cautiously active role in the economy, stressing interdependence on one another for the strength of the whole, while at the same time engaging in a capitalistic opportunity.What was so risky about the black laborers decision to discontinue working was that it would likely place them into possible unemployment. Despite the economic independence of blacks, as author Robert Ransom describes, many blacks were hired to fill 'black jobs' and were paid 'black wages'. This statement indicates that economic opportunity for blacks remained limited even into the final decades of the nineteenth century. Rather white Southerners have simply adapted institutional barriers barring blacks from equal pay and fair access to economic opportunity. The slow growth of the Southern economy after the Civil War negatively affected all races and maximized the economic competition in the marketplace. In a social order determined by whites it was highly unlikely that the blacks would succeed in leveraging for more pay or greater opportunity in the marketplace. The organization of the blacks in the Longshoremen union certainly increased the leverage of the blacks, but had little realistic ability accomplish their motive.

A company called the Bay Line and Pennsylvania railroad offered to take people in Norfolk to the Niagara Falls for 14 dollars in the Norfolk Virginian, thus expanding the number of places that Southerners could easily visit. This was a new mode of transportation that had revolutionized the pace and manner that southerners conducted their lives. Railroad rates although more expensive than steamboat fare was faster, more efficient, and did not rely on weather, water levels, or other uncontrollable circumstances to operate. In addition, railroads made hard to travel geographic areas much more accessible. For example, there was a fall line stretching from Virginia to Mississippi where the rivers were easy to navigate, but above that fall line the rivers were not navigable according to William Cooper, therefore railroads would enable travel above that fall line. Railroads not only transported people, but also goods. Goods such as cotton tobacco, lumber, cattle coal, and oil became more readily available to regions that did not produce these and also economically expanded these industries. Central Virginia had several major tobacco producing counties such as Prince Edward in the state that was one of the leading tobacco manufacturers, so the railway system was truly to its benefit. ","According to Cooper, the southern railroad tracks more than tripled from the 1880's to the 1890's. By 1890, there were more than 300 companies. However, there was a downside for railroad owners. Mostly rural and agricultural, the southern railroads had peak times of good transportation such as crop harvest periods, but all other times of the year saw little demand. Since railroads connected to so many places, it soon became an enormous industry and became one of the first big business industries of the South. The larger railroad companies soon became big influences in politics and railways leaders, like J.P. Morgan who constructed the Southern Railway became big names both in the industry and in politics. The railroad was an essential for shippers and farmers in the south, and often the monopolistic railroad companies took advantage of this and charged exceedingly high rates. There was rising tension between the two groups, and this tension shifted into politics, and many called for the railroads to be transferred to public ownership. Despite the political turmoil, the railways made the South more accessible and brought it into the national economy successfully."],"display_date":"July 23, 1891 - September 1, 1896","search_date":"1894-02-10","locations":[{"id":14412,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3032,"title":"Mobile Child Labor Reform Laws in 1897\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-01-01","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The movement to reform child labor laws identified a new difficulty in the late part of the 1890's. In the year of 1897 citizens of Mobile and their representative Thomas H. Smith presented a series of bills to the Alabama Senate regarding child labor reform. These bills were purported to have come from the Mobile Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. All were shot down in committees. Though these laws were for the state of Alabama, the child labor reformers saw New England as being somewhat complicit in opposing the bills. In 1901 the Alabama Child Labor Committee wrote an open appeal to the people and press of New England and received wide endorsement throughout the state, including a former governor and the representative John Craft from Mobile.","The Committee engaged New England in what they thought was an important barrier in the reform movement. They asked for the interest and aid in pushing for child labor laws in the year of 1901, telling New Englanders that the responsibility is also yours. The responsibility lay with New England because, as the committee stated, While the proportion of the children under twelve in our Northern and Southern mills is approximately the same, yet in the mills representing the Northern investments, the actual number of such children employed is twice as great as the number found in the mills controlled by Southern capital. The letter called a Massachusetts representative the aggressive and effective opposition to attempts at proposing child labor laws at the turn of the century as well as being influential in stating opposition to laws being presented in the Alabama Senate in 1897. The appeal was a call for an awakening of public interest in the matter but it also directly spoke to New Englanders whose capital was used to erect factories and mills in Alabama.","From the discourse that carried on between the two it appears that any progress on the issue was greatly impeded in 1901. The Northerners wrote back but mostly denied wrongdoing in the matter, citing only four of the forty mills in the state were northern owned. They also argued that they did support the cause for reform but mostly because they believed young children to not be intelligent enough to do good work. Indeed, it was not just the lack of support from the Northern owners and legislators that made progress difficult. Mobile did not have many mills or factories compared to the rest of Alabama so it is natural that other districts and cities in the state would not necessarily agree with their stance. As early as 1887, Alabama had already enacted child labor legislation and it had been supported by Senator Daniel Smith of Mobile. Fines of up to fifty dollars were issued for employers who violated certain laws. Children under eighteen could not work more than eight hours in mechanical or manufacturing jobs, children under fourteen could not work more than eight hours in a factory, and no child under the age of fifteen was allowed to work in mines. These were certainly important milestones in the reform movement; however, as the appeal written by the Alabama Child Labor Committee demonstrates it was not enough. Citizens of Mobile, Alabama were credited with primarily supporting these laws and most any legislation surrounding the issue, most notably in 1897. Because of the efforts of the citizens and representatives of Mobile though, Alabama was considered to be pioneering the cause of child labor reform."],"display_date":1897,"search_date":"1897-07-02","locations":[{"id":288,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3034,"title":"Engines of Progress\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-04-02","end_date":"1887-04-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Deep in the iron-rich north central region of Alabama, industry was booming.

They had negotiated with the managers of the Alabama Car Works for a contract for enough work for the next eight months. ","Over at the engine works of Pender and Co., business was booming as well. The workers there were engaged in making a fifty-horse power patent engine. In fact, the company was planning for the building of a large facility in which to produce these steam engines on a large scale.

In addition to expanding production and capabilities, the company was making use of electric lights in the engines they were producing, a completely new innovation. ","In the post-Civil War period, there were many advantages to situating industries in the southern United States. The south had lower prices for land and labor, making the infusion of capital needed for the establishment of new industries much less and also fueling the move away from an agriculturally centered economy. Anniston, Alabama in particular was significant in the industry of the South as it was very rich in iron ore, and it became one of the world?s largest producers of cast-iron soil pipe. What fueled industry all over the country as well as in the South was the expansion of the railroads during the period 1880-1900, when railroad mileage tripled.

The attack of the North came as no surprise, however to North Carolina's authorities. There had been some recent aggravation by the state of the Northern troops, so it was expected that the enemy would be advancing to the coast. Nevertheless, General Walter Gwynn, in command of North Carolina's northern department of coastal defense, pleaded in vain for more men and guns at his command. His requests were not met with the needed supplication to sustain Hatteras. ","The Union assault was no match for the weak defenses on the Hatteras Inlet. Historians Barret and Yearns state that the Confederate forces could not even stand near their enemy's, and this is demonstrated by the fact that the commander of a nearby fort was even ordered to evacuate his position and flee from the area. The Rebels could clearly not withstand the assault. The Confederates abandoned their location and headed inland. The small island was no longer a Southern possession, but now a Union victory.","The overturn of the Hatteras Inlet was extremely important for the progression of the Union cause, and consequentially, very detrimental to the Confederate's. Although the operation was relatively small, it was the Union's first victory of any kind. The news of the capture was received in the North with great joy. It ignited and bolstered Union morale. The North eventually won the Civil War largely because it kept control of the sea, and this victory was a vital part this. At the same time, the loss of control of the Hatteras Inlet was devastating to the Confederate efforts. It not only affected North Carolina, but the South as a whole, as it allowed access to other states. For example, the Union control of the Hatteras Inlet meant that all communication between Virginia and Europe was effectively cut off. The inlet was an important passageway for the South to the outside world. The blockade that followed the Union win prevented Southern exports of cotton and imports of guns, powder, cloth, medicine, iron, machinery, and other indispensable supplies."],"display_date":"August 27, 1861","search_date":"1861-08-27","locations":[{"id":9829,"lat":35.7678250626,"lng":-76.0805063886,"zoom":10,"place":"TYRRELL, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3070,"title":"Free Silver or Bust\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-04-07","end_date":"1895-04-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A total of 400 Republicans, Democrats, and Populists declared that they stand emphatically in favor of free silver.

","The men of this group stood behind the idea of free silver so unanimously that they forced one member, Hector D.

Unlimited coinage of silver was taken up by people all across the nation as a solution to economic problems, especially those of farmers. Indeed, the Farmer?s Alliance in 1890 and the Populists in their 1890s platforms called specifically for this measure as a balm for the national financial crisis. In Alabama, a region of mostly cash-poor landowners and farmers, free silver seemed to be central to their future economic survival and prosperity. This episode highlights a trend in political alignment at this time. The Populist party and other men standing for free silver joined together in political alliances with traditional Republicans and Democrats in hopes of gaining more power.

According to Edward Ayers, black men were only permitted to unload cotton ","bales outside the mills and black women were not permitted to work there at all.

The farmer wrote that there were two theories about the source of the epidemic that was rotting cotton crops across both South Carolina and Georgia: that the disease arose from degradation of the cotton plants due to over cultivation, or that a scourge of insects was responsible for the ruin. Supporters of the first theory contended that bad cultivation of foreign plants is known to lead to an eventual decline in the vegetable quality, and also cited the fact that the disease spread very uniformly and very quickly across the cotton growing region, suggesting that the cause must be a disease because insects need time to migrate. Proponents of the insect based theory offered support for their theory by referring to several sightings of strange insects in cotton fields and puncture wounds found in the cotton boles of spoiled crops."," The author of the article discussed both these theories as possible sources of the cotton rot affecting the South. However he himself did not claim to hold the answer to the problem, and therefore suggested that the state should provide funding for agriculture societies to further research the matter. He expressed his opinion that this crisis should be a priority for South Carolina because of the economic implications of wide spread cotton rot: if a solution cannot be found it was unclear what crop would provide an acceptable substitute for cotton as a cash crop. The regional land was not suitable for growing tobacco, indigo, or wheat. He also expressed concern that a particular species of property [slaves] will soon be of little value if a solution is not quickly discovered.","The South depended upon the economic success of cotton. In particular, according to Lacy Ford, the introduction of cotton to upstate South Carolina at the end of the eighteenth century was seen as a regional economic salvation. By the time of this recorded cotton rot, the area was exporting around 50 million pounds per year. The success of the cash crop in the region allowed local families to accumulate wealth, and the few slave owning families of the area acquired their wealth from the booming cotton trade.

He began by saying that although South Carolina held an advantage over other areas in rich natural resources, these resources had not been taken advantage of to their full extent, and little interaction occurred within the state's different regions. The author of the letter stated his opinion that it was imperative that the state improve the condition of its roads and rivers. Although clearly these projects would be expensive, it would be well worth the high costs to decrease transportation costs and risks to horses, drivers, and health."," The newspaper letter expressed several suggestions for the state and the citizens as to specific internal improvements for South Carolina. The first was to consult with a state engineer and complete several surveys of the roadways for the purpose of improving passageways from Camden to Charleston. The second suggestion was for the improvement of the river systems so it would be possible for a steam boat to navigate the waterways from Camden to Charleston at any time of year without danger. However, the author also warned that the citizens of South Carolina should not expect much in the form of financial aid from the state or federal government. His reasoning behind this was that the district's representatives only made up a small proportion of the community, the legislature only met for three short weeks each year, and similar requests in the past had been ignored. Such required improvements might therefore need to be financed by town corporations, with the hopes that the state legislature would reimburse them at a later point."," Throughout the antebellum period South Carolina was the target of many different policies of internal improvement because of its economic and agricultural value to the union. According to historian John Conger the state was blessed with a natural expanse of waterways, but massive amounts of funding were needed to better organize the water routes for use in transportation and trading. The state never received the necessary federal funding for such projects because the mountains to the west and northwest made improvements difficult and kept South Carolina isolated from trade with her neighboring states, effectively discouraging the federal government from allocating funds to the state. Frustrations from the lack of funding for internal improvements eventually grew into frustrations with national tariffs because the civilians of South Carolina claimed they never received the same benefits from surplus government revenue as other states in the union."],"display_date":"June 6, 1818","search_date":"1818-06-06","locations":[{"id":11550,"lat":34.3452377501,"lng":-80.5785175162,"zoom":9,"place":"KERSHAW, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3103,"title":"The Organization of Agricultural Societies\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1818-06-27","end_date":"1818-06-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A newspaper article was published on June 27 to announce the formation of a society for the improvement of agriculture, called the South Carolina Agricultural Society. The objectives of the society were cited as being improving the internal conditions of South Carolina, with special interest in Camden County.

The constitution of the society specified intentions to research all foreign and domestic plants and animals, to discover more utilities for all available resources in the region, and to discover the ways in which foreign plants and animals adapt to their new environments when introduced to the region.

According to research by Walter Edgar, there was such a regional reliance on agriculture that there existed a general attitude among South Carolinians that industrialization was a danger to their existing way of life.

The purpose of the bill was supposedly to ensure the survival of slavery in the state, but it was largely opposed. People disagreed on the real intentions of the bill, and on what the consequences of it would be. The Georgia <em>Telegraph</em> called the policy unwise, impolitic, and short-sighted. It was fraught with as much injury to the institution of slavery as if the policy had been generated in Massachusetts for the express purpose of destroying the institution. ","Both sides of the debate were pro-slavery, but could not agree on how to preserve the institution. Most argued that the bill favored the wealthy by increasing the value of the slaves they already owned, thus maintaining the planter class's status quo by making it extremely difficult for other farmers to procure slave labor at a reasonable price. Supporters of the bill believed that if the interstate slave trade continued, slaves would eventually become so numerous that they would no longer be a profitable labor source. Slaves would become less valuable as their numbers increased. Eventually, the cost of maintaining them would exceed their worth, and the practice of slaveholding would die out entirely. ","An editorial published in the <em>Telegraph</em> argued that the measure would have an exact opposite, negative effect. Prohibiting the slave trade would likely inspire other southern states to do the same, and eventually slave-selling states like Virginia would no longer have a market for their primary export.

This bank was supposed to be better than the old one, based in Knoxville: the state should furnish its capital, the legislature should elect its directors and it was supposed to loan money to the different counties in proportion to the taxes paid in each state. After a debate with his opponents, Grundy finally managed to establish the Bank. Grundy's bank was the opposite of the previous Tennessean bank, chartered in 1807, which became known as The Old Bank of Tennessee. The State had a small interest in this bank (20,000 dollars out of a capital stock of 400,000 dollars) but, for the first time in Tennessee history, was a stockholder.","The New Bank of the State of Tennessee was created just after the panic of 1819. The price of cotton had fallen and so had done land values, leading to a period of financial distress which culminated in the West during the years 1819 and 1820. However, in Tennessee, contrarily to other states, only the Western part was seriously affected by these financial difficulties because the eastern valleys were not suitable for the culture of cotton. The foundation of the New Bank is the proof that banks were needed in Tennessee at that time. Indeed, more and more people were coming in the state, especially after the purchase of large portions of land taken from the Indians. Moreover, after the panic, a new order of things emerged: Tennessee had come to be an agricultural state but trade was now becoming more important than agriculture. The need for a new bank also came with this economic transformation which would also bring political changes. Tennessee was therefore modernizing, as was the South in general. It started to make up for the gap between the North and the South. People traded, exchanged, produced, bought, sold, and needed banks to keep their money or lend them some. Competition quickly started between the different banks in Tennessee and newspapers often printed comparisons of the two main banks that is to say the new one and the old one. Grundy's bank, completely state-owned was considered safer by many citizens in Nashville who trusted the new bank. However, the volunteer state was not an exception because everywhere in the South, banks flourished.

In this reader's letter to the editor the following day he remarked about the tone of the dinner and the ill feelings towards Nicholas Biddle and his National Bank.

Slavery had powered the profitable sugar industry in the Delta region, but with its abolition, many planters were left with huge plantations and acres of fertile land, but no labor to cultivate them. Soon, many Southerners realized this trend and began to sell pieces of their land so that a network of small farmers could take over sugar production. Often, these small farmers would partner with one or more neighbors to combine land and resources. Such cooperative arrangements began to revitalize the sagging sugar production that characterized the time immediately following the Civil War. Sugar planters began to take their raw cane to neighbors for grinding and refining sugar that could be sold.  "," One such farmer lived in Assumption Parish, Louisiana. Although he is unnamed in the Farm and Garden section of the <em>Christian Union</em>'s July 17, 1872 publication, this small planter represents many in Louisiana who tried to reinvent themselves after the disruption of the Civil War. With the end of slavery, the large sugar plantations of Louisiana suffered major setbacks in output. As Moon-Ho Jung states in his work <em>Coolies and Cane</em>, In the decade following the Civil War, Louisiana's once thriving sugar industry endured a long-term crisis...Emancipation demolished the entire pyramid of borrowed capital that rested on the market value of black bodies. Slavery had powered the profitable sugar industry in the Delta region, but with its abolition, many planters were left with huge plantations and acres of fertile land, but no labor to cultivate them. Soon, many Southerners realized this trend and began to sell pieces of their land so that a network of small farmers could take over sugar production. Often, these neighbors would partner with one another to combine land and resources. Such cooperative arrangements began to revitalize the sagging sugar production. Sugar planters began to take their raw cane to neighbors for grinding and refining into sugar that could be sold. "," The success of this small rural farmer within a new system of cultivation was made possible only through the generosity provided him by his neighbor. By working together, small farmers provided for themselves and for their neighbors. Only by working together in this fragile farming structure could small planters hope to rebuild their lives."],"display_date":"July 17, 1872","search_date":"1872-07-17","locations":[{"id":5426,"lat":29.9007793721,"lng":-91.0625768699,"zoom":9,"place":"ASSUMPTION, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3147,"title":"The Annexation Debate\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-02-10","end_date":"1844-02-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The weather was the same as usual and so was the company. Adolphus Sterne went with his friends Mr. Houghson, Mr. Hoya, and Mr. Linn to Colonel Raguet's house for dinner. After dinner the Colonel accompanied the group to Mr. Moore's for a meeting of the debating society. Sterne presided over the debate and listened to each side equally. The fiery speech of wild Bill Sparks, a former Republic of Texas Congressman, would be difficult to beat. The debate was on the question of whether or not it was beneficial for Texas to be annexed into the United States. Sterne deliberated then gave the victory to the side which argued against annexation. ","Annexation of Texas into the United States was a big debate, and as early as September 1836, the majority Texans had given their support to annexation into the United States; however, as late as 1844, there were still some who thought that Texas would fare better if it remained an independent republic. One of the major concerns of opponents to annexation was war with Mexico. Since Mexican officials never recognized Texas independence as legitimate, and they disagreed on the official boundaries of Texas, annexation into the United States would certainly cause conflict. A war with Mexico would be tragic for Texas as it would be fought on their own land. Having just finished their own war with Mexico, it is understandable that some Texans would want to avoid further bloodshed. ","Pro-British sentiments also played a role in some Texans' opposition to annexation. Britain had recognized the independence of Texas and played an integral role in peace negotiations between Texas and Mexico in 1843. Some even thought that Britain could force Mexico to recognize Texas's Independence. Britain adamantly opposed annexation and was willing to do what it could to prevent annexation. The British feared the results of annexation: expansion of the United States, loss of profitable trade with Texas, and the extension of slavery. Britain was one of Texas's key allies and upsetting its people could be detrimental to Texas. Trade with the British was profitable for Texans too, and loss of that trade would hurt the struggling economy. ","The annexation of Texas was a hot issue in the 1840s because of its far-reaching consequences for several countries. Just like in the United States, there were in Texas both those who supported and those who opposed annexation. Texans who opposed annexation thought that Texas had more to gain by remaining an independent republic. Sparks was of this opinion and must have had valid reasons to support it, seeing as he won the debate for his side."],"display_date":"February 10, 1844","search_date":"1844-02-10","locations":[{"id":15203,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3148,"title":"A Son Worries over Fathers Corn Harvest\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-04-16","end_date":"1882-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Very few young men in the nineteenth century had the privilege of going to college, much less to the University of Virginia. One not only had to be intelligent, but also wealthy. James N. Greear of Scott County, Virginia was one such man. In a letter home, Greear informed his father of his great interest in medicine and of the recent examinations he had taken. He noted that he had taken the examinations necessary to graduate though he was not sure of his intentions to apply for graduation. A majority of his letter revolves around his financial situation. Knowing it would be of keen interest to his father, he writes that he has spent ?not a lot? of money and then cites each of his expenses and its monetary value. Greear goes on to inquire about his father?s farming situation in Scott County. He asks where his father had been selling his corn crop and how much more clearing of the crop he had left. Noting it was April, he wondered if an early spring would reap more fruit. His inquiry into his father?s corn success is in fact Greear?s only interest in his home town affairs. ","Many southerners were forced to make an entire living off of a single crop. James Greear?s great interest in his father?s corn crop is due to the fact that his tuition money was most likely the direct result of that crop. Corn had been grown in Appalachia for many years before white settlers arrived there. Cherokee Indians, who inhabited the land during the frontier period, heavily influenced the whites that later settled there. Wheat was at first very difficult to grow in Virginia due to high counts of nitrogen in the soil and the difficulty in uprooting tree stumps. Adopting the techniques of the native Cherokee, corn became the most commonly grown crop in Appalachia. Corn took very little effort to grow and thus early on in the settlement of the colonies, most farmers grew it. While by 1882 southern agriculture had become far more diversified, the demand for corn was still present. It is no surprise that James Greear?s letter is mainly focused on his expenses at school and the success of his father?s corn crop. One poor harvest could devastate a farmer financially. Agriculture created some of the wealthiest men in not only the South but the entire country. It allowed fathers to send their sons to the best schools, and those sons to go off and become doctors, as in James Greear?s case, or return to the highly profitable family business."],"display_date":"April 16, 1882 - December 31, 1882","search_date":"1882-08-23","locations":[{"id":14262,"lat":36.7142218778,"lng":-82.6029814945,"zoom":10,"place":"SCOTT, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3160,"title":"Working Women\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-08-26","end_date":"1866-08-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Anne Watson was part of a wealthy Virginia plantation family that flourished in the 19th century in Louisa County. She lived a life of luxury and refinement until tragedy struck and she lost several children and her husband, all by 1853. After her husband's death, she was forced into a dominant role in the running of the household, in both the domestic and business spheres. ","This new role meant that she often had to negotiate with men over money and labor. In August of 1866, Anne entered into a deal with a man identified only as Mr. Winston, over the cultivation of land unto for corn and the purchase and fattening of cattle. She asserts her authority throughout the letter in several ways, informing the reader, who is unidentified but not Mr. Winston himself, that I would be willing to pay Mr. Winston for his time in seeing the corn measured and put into the house. I don't see how he would be bothered in any other way about it, except to see that the tenants did not injure the land. With this assertive statement, Anne is implying that there is absolutely no reason that the deal should not go exactly as she wishes. ","Women in the South in this period were not typically valued for their shrewdness as negotiators or ability to successfully run a plantation. According to Anne's granddaughter, Anne began her marriage with a very typical Southern family and lifestyle. In her 1923 memoir What I Remember, Anne Watson's granddaughter and namesake, Anne Watson Archer, writes of the senior Anne she was the centre of a devoted family and a host of friends...she was happy with grandfather and several young children, perhaps four or five...she was fortunate enough to furnish the house all at once, most of it coming from New York. Until the string of unexpected deaths within her family, Anne would have had a very luxurious life, typical of the wealth and privilege of the richest plantation families.","Melvin Patrick Ely addresses the sometimes diverse roles of Southern women in his book Israel on the Appomattox.

He needed to make a few purchases, namely tools and home goods. While in town Pitts noticed a few stores had closed signs in the window. Upon returning home to his plantation, Pitts entered in his diary, Thursday Holy day among the Jews - All places of business closed among them this day...and this is new year with them... While it remains unclear whether Pitts referred to the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, or Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish days, his observance of this Jewish tradition positively identified a Jewish population living and working in Perry County, Alabama in 1882. Pitts concluded his diary entry by listing the various goods he purchased including a brass handle and a monkey wrench. ","Jewish immigration into the South was divided into four phases from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century. Jewish immigration to Alabama began in the late nineteenth century during the third wave of Jewish settlement in the South. Abraham Mordecai was the first European Jew to travel further west of the early centers of Jewish life in Savannah and Charleston. While the exact date of his arrival is unknown, he settled in what would become Montgomery, Alabama in 1880, pushing the Jewish population further into the South. ","As Jewish immigrants continued to settle in the South, they progressively gained economic influence in society. According to social historian Ralph Melnick, the collapse of the rural plantation system transferred economic and political power to southern cities and townships. With this economic shift, the Jewish population began to earn clout working as professionals, businessmen, mill operators, commodity brokers, and farm owners. In these roles Jewish workers increased their economic status in times of relative instability throughout the South. Reconstruction and the depression of the 1890s further increased Jewish wealth as they continually offered incentives over gentile competition. Jewish business transactions were strictly cash-only, eliminating the vicious cycle of debt for the consumer and decreasing the merchants' risk of financial loss. The economic prosperity enjoyed by these southern working Jews unfortunately led to an increase of anti-Semitism and resentment across the South. ","Between 1848 and 1980 Alabama lost half its Jewish population to bigotry and hate crimes. In 1868, the Ku Klux Klan was founded in Memphis, Tennessee and formally began its reign of terror throughout the South. In 1871, the KKK publicly murdered a Jewish shopkeeper in Memphis and established the Jewish population as a target of the organization. Though many Jews fled both Alabama and the South others remained. Despite anti-Semitic sentiments in the South, many Jewish families lingered in the region of their American roots.

Unfortunately, keeping these animals healthy after the Civil War became a constant struggle for many Appalachian farmers. Disease ravaged the livestock population after the war. In 1884, the Wytheville Dispatch ran an article about ?our friend? Bob Crockett. Crockett was famous in Wytheville for his work in improving the cattle, sheep, and horse population. Disaster had struck, however, when he lost several of his valuable, full-bred Catawold Ewes to poisoning. The newspaper noted that Crockett had a clue as to who was responsible, and it gave its best wishes to him in bringing those who committed the ?cowardly act? to justice.","Cattle, sheep, and horses were invaluable to Appalachian farmers following the Civil War. Responsible for improving the livestock population, Bob Crockett was a local hero. Before the war, cattle fever, or glanders, was nearly non-existent in Virginia. As the livestock in North Carolina, Georgia and other southern states became sick prior to the war, Virginians made sure their cattle had no contact with them. When the war began and livestock grew scarce, Confederate soldiers demanded cattle be brought to them in Virginia. Thus, after forty years of no disease, cattle fever became rampant in Virginia by 1865. Other southerners blamed the disease on northern soldiers who purposely left their diseased horses on southern land, spreading the glanders disease. Soon southern farmers were faced not only with cattle fever but also an equine influenza that would do even more damage. ","The Civil War destroyed the southern landscape. Railroad tracks were torn up, farm land became infertile, and disease was everywhere. The livestock epidemic that ravaged Virginia only made things more impossible. High cattle losses meant farmers had very little homemade fertilizer. Low supplies of fertilizer made farming and recovery nearly impossible. Bob Crockett was a savior to farmers in Virginia for rehabilitating some of the livestock.

Washington at the Atlanta Cotton Exposition on Wednesday, September 18, 1895. The talented representative of the negroes and President of the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial School spoke brilliantly and passionately as he lobbied for African American employment in the burgeoning industrial age. He called upon whites throughout the nation to recognize the burgeoning African American population and their subsequent need of employment in the great leap from slavery to freedom. African Americans had worked under the white yoke for years on end. Could whites yet again place their trust in African Americans to till their fields, plant their crops, and strengthen their business? Washington implored whites to reject the massive influx of immigrants as a source of labor. Why test the mettle of the Irish, Italian, and Eastern European, when a solid and trustworthy base of employment lay right under their nose? The crowd assembled to listen to his speech seized upon several points in Washington's speech, but the passage which best encapsulates his message follows:","To those of the white race who look to the incoming of those of foreign birth and strange tongue and habits for the prosperity of the South, were I permitted, I would repeat what I say to own race: 'cast down your bucket were you are.' Cast it down among 8,000,000 negroes whose habits you know, whose loyalty and love you have tested in days when to have proved treacherous meant the ruin of your firesides. Cast down your buckets among these people who have without strikes and labor wards, tilled your fields, cleared your forests, built your railroads and cities and brought forth treasure form the bowels of the earth and helped make possible this magnificent presentation of the progress of the South. ","Applauded by both blacks and whites alike, Washington's address was one of the most poignant of the entire Convention and arguably in American history. Though some criticized his speech as accomodationist and pandering to the white population, it was still critical in guiding African American resistance to white discrimination and establishing Washington as one of the leading African American spokesmen in America. Ardent in his devotion to African American advancement and education, Washington continued his cooperation with white people, enlisting the support of wealthy philanthropists, to raise funds to establish and operate hundreds of small African American community schools and institutions of higher education.","Reverberations from Washtington's Atlanta Compromise Speech, as it was later called, continue to influence racial politics to this very day. The supposed accomodationist ideas of Washington were frequently juxtaposed with those of other African American leaders of the time. In particular, Frederick Douglass called upon African Americans to Agitate, Agitate, Agitate for social change whereas Washington stressed compliance and hardy work ethic. Washington's ideals also conflicted with other individuals like W.E.B. DuBois who supported the idea of a classical education among African-Americans rather than the industrial model which Washington favored. Both sides sought to define the best means to improve the conditions of the post-Civil War African-American community. Washington's advice to African-Americans was to compromise and accept segregation; however, this perspective incensed other activists like DuBois who labeled him The Great Accommodator."],"display_date":"September 18, 1895","search_date":"1895-09-18","locations":[{"id":1823,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3183,"title":"The Dutch Ferryman\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-01","end_date":"1835-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Presbyterian Reverend Timothy Flint had been settled with his family in Alexandria, Louisiana for 10 years when he set out at the age of 55 to explore the Red River and the people who lived along it. Commissioned by the Missionary Society of Connecticut in 1815 to preach Christianity to the masses of emigrants moving west, Flint was no stranger to such exploration. He ministered in the Ohio Valley, St. Louis and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as taking an opportunity to travel through the new Arkansas Territory in 1819. Due to ill health, he was often traveling between Louisiana and New England, seeking escape from the sweltering heat of summer and the freezing cold of winter. "," After traveling several days east along the Red River in 1835, he finally came to its junction with the Ouachita River, which could take him north through the Arkansas Territory, should he choose. Flint found, even at this remote place, small cabins dotting the landscape where just a few years before there had been no one. He employed the services of one such settler, a Hollander dressed in a shabby and crude Robinson Crusoe costume, to ferry him closer to the Ouachita. Flint was so amused by his new friend that he requested to see where this Dutchman lived. The Dutchman obliged, presenting Flint with a small two room cabin surrounded by cultivated peach and plum trees and a small garden, miles from any other habitation. His home was dug into the side of an Indian mound, which he shared with his animals. Like his clothing, all his tools, eating utensils, and dishes were crude and hand-made. The ferryman took the opportunity to express his opinion on religion as well, pushing a book of Astrology on the Reverend. Flint graciously declined, lamenting a lack of familiarity with the Dutch language. "," Whatever entertainment Timothy Flint gained from such a man, he still expressed regret that so great a proportion of the emigrants are of the class of poor, vagrant, and worthless foreigners, the scum of despotic governments. Many who emigrated to the frontier owned very few slaves or none at all and appear in the tax records as not owning property, much like the Dutch ferryman. These men and their families eked out a small living, and required, as many church officials from the East believed, a revived understanding of the Christian faith due to their removal from civilized society. ","In the same year that the Missionary Society of Connecticut sent Reverend Flint west, a New York paper, <em>The Patrol</em>, reprinted a progress report from the Louisiana Bible Society, expressing concern that the want of Bibles in Louisiana has been extreme. The Presbyterian Church in the East was greatly concerned with increasing the educational and moral principles of society at large, but particularly on the frontier, where they believed lower class migrants, like the Dutchman, were in danger of leading secular lives and forgetting God in the wilds of the west."],"display_date":1835,"search_date":"1835-07-02","locations":[{"id":5632,"lat":31.2441474516,"lng":-92.6921619821,"zoom":8,"place":"RAPIDES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3188,"title":"Sheriff James Herndon Presents a Sale\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-04-06","end_date":"1833-04-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In April, 1833, Sheriff James Herndon of Clark County presented a sale, printed in the Southern Banner newspaper, designated to occur the following month.

His first set only contained slaves: Milley, age 22, her two children, Mary, age five, Henry, age three or four, and Charlotte, a girl fifteen years of age, apparently not within Milley's family. The second set of property included a one-acre lot within the town of Athens, and four enslaved African Americans, a carriage and harness, a wagon, a cart, one yoke of oxen, one cow and calf, four tables, and four glasses.","Placed next to wagons and cows in advertisements, enslaved African Americans took on the face of property. Charlotte had been separated from every person within her family, and her situation sadly reveals one of the tragic truths of the slave trade. Charlotte was only a single example of what happened consistently throughout the South. We are unsure as to whether Charlotte separated from her family during the interstate slave trade or, as was the case in Sheriff Herndon's sale, an intrastate slave trade. If she had been separated from her nuclear family during an interstate slave trade, then she had something in common with one out of every two slaves she met.","Throughout the South, prospective buyers analyzed the slaves intensely and traders worked vigorously to make the sale. Consistent with the thought that many Southerners did not see slaves as much other than property, Jeanette Keith claimed that auctioneers saw women with their potential as 'breeders,' and auctioneers attempted to increase the present value of a female slave by convincing a buyer that she could produce inherently stronger and more efficient offspring in the future. Buyers, such as those that would appear at Sheriff Herndon's sale, however, to ensure that they evaluated their expensive and long-term investment correctly, examined the entire bodies of naked slaves and checked for scars from whip marks.

Franklin Osburn not only ran a farm but also a country store on his property. By looking at Mr. Franklin?s books, it is clear he had many guests and numerous transactions with each of his workers. Osburn sold the goods produced on his farm both to his workers and to those living nearby. His store sold molasses, meats, butter, and liquor among other goods.

While Osburn received a service from most of his visitors, his books show that he profited off of all of them as he was their source of everyday needs.

It was not uncommon for entire families to travel together looking for work. Other migrants had a preference to remain rural and instead traveled from farm to farm in Appalachia looking for work.

In Red River, Butler told to his relative, some plantations had lost as many as 80 slaves.

The mail was also the way for journalists to receive news from the abroad but also and above all, from other states thus local Tennesseans newspapers were full of new from elsewhere. Besides, since dislocation was difficult, the mail was also used for trade and transactions. For example, the journalist described New Orleans as such an important market place: many goods and slaves were actually bought and sold there and it would be disastrous to be isolated from this place.

He owned the Staunton <em>Spectator</em> from 1856-1860. The <em>Spectator </em>reached many residents of Augusta County. He kept an extensive diary during his life, of which the years 1855-1865 are still preserved. On October 15, 1856, after having contemplated the hopeless Know-Nothing campaign of Millard Fillmore and having acknowledged the local impact of national politics, Waddell thought of the assessment of his father's property, earlier that day and gave an estimate of his own possessions. Among those, he noted his printing office, stocks, bonds, two of his slaves, furniture, silverware, and a slew of other commodities, totaling to an understated 8700. His slaves Selena and Moses were mentioned in the middle of Waddell's list of property, but later on in the diary entry, Waddell alluded to a moment earlier in the day when a Dr. McGill offered 1000 for Selena. Waddell wrote that he would not have sold Selena for 20,000, unless she desired to go, or had grossly misbehaved. He continued to espouse his philosophy that, Speculating on human flesh is utterly horrible to me and he explained that he wished slavery were extinct, yet claimed to be no abolitionist and advocated that he lived in a time when emancipation was not prudent."," There was a socially accepted hypocrisy for the slaveholding Southerners. Slaveholders, like Waddell, separated the morality of slavery and the slave market. The slave market was a disgusting profit-driven business, owned by those merchants of disease and disorder slave traders. Historian Walter Johnson illuminates the contradiction that slaveholders could sell slaves as well, but believed that it was not with the intent of making a profit; there was always a noncommercial reason for selling a slave. This invisible line provided enough self-justification for slaveholders to shift the guilt of human exploitation onto those slave traders. Slaveholders were able to control and decide the actions of their slaves because they were property. The hypocrisy lies in the question, if slave traders only sold sub-human property, then why the disgust with slave traders? And if slave traders were trading people, not just property, than how could slaveholders justify owning people? This self-justifying hypocrisy lies at the heart of slave-ownership."],"display_date":"October 15, 1856 - October 16, 1856","search_date":"1856-10-15","locations":[{"id":13638,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3218,"title":"Relief from Crop Devastation\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-03-28","end_date":"1861-03-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A considerable drought met the residents of central Mississippi during the summer of 1860.

He must have developed a large debt to a man named Walo Johnson to warrant the writ of Fi Fa that was issued against him to the Sheriff of Natchitones on May 17, 1877.

Mobley represented the ideals of the People's Party, which promoted government control to boost the agricultural economy. Mobley's main focus centered on how both of the national parties, democrats or republicans, could not be counted on to aid farmers.

The farmers of the Populist Party took different economic actions to aid them in their fight for stronger agriculture in America. The farmers wanted to use the government as a vehicle for readjusting what they felt were increasingly pronounced imbalances of political and economic life in America. They also wanted government ownership of railroads and telegraphs. Many residents of states in the western United States and the South became involved in the Populist Party because these regions relied largely on a strong agricultural economy.","The Populist Party encouraged people to attend their meetings which discussed issues pertaining to the ideals of the party.

On February 25, 1885 it covered the front page news, flags flew at half-mast, locomotives were shrouded, and traffic stopped, while people flooded to his funeral. The city had lost a respected citizen and a leading businessman, regarded as one of the South's best railroad men. Gittio, thinking he had a cold, had called upon a doctor who discovered pronounced heart trouble and, to the shock of the region, he died a few days later. Gittio embodied a rags to riches story, as he started his work on the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad in 1854 as a sixteen year old boy. He would eventually work his way up to becoming superintendent of the line, and he would exert great influence in all the railroads that stretched out from the Norfolk region. Despite his personal high standing, the Norfolk paper explained, He took great pride in the advancement and the prosperity of his native city. As his wife and young boy looked on in grief, Gittio's pall-bearers, railroad men themselves, laid the forty eight year old to rest. "," Evident in the high respect afforded Capt Gittio, railroads would develop a special meaning to the postwar South, as they embodied forward progress and development. At the outset of Reconstruction, the South's prosperity lagged far behind that of the rest of the country, and people hoped railroad construction would revitalize the Southern economy. Due to political mishandling, railroad construction during Reconstruction hardly existed, but thereafter until the turn of the century, the South would build railroads faster than any part of the country. Utilizing mostly Northern capital, Southern railroad mileage increased from 16,605 miles in 1880 to 39,103 miles in 1890. Soon, 90 percent of Southerners would live in a county with railroads. In big Southern cities railroad consolidation and expansion would lead to the creation of a central downtown station, from which a vibrant business district would grow. Such improved access to this reliable, quicker means of transportation revolutionized the way business was conducted, evidenced in the boom of mass production and mass distribution during this era. "," Despite the aura that encompassed them, Southern railroads, like the one Gittio managed, did not always bring prosperity and happiness. Oftentimes railroads and railroad construction could be linked to corrupt ties with political parties, especially evident in Virginia's case. Economically, though railroads lowered transportation costs for businesses, their rates often seemed oppressive to farmers trying to ship their crops, leading to populist calls for rate regulation and government commissions. Socially, they became center stage for the separate but equal theory that would eventually manifest itself into outright segregation. Nonetheless, new railways seemed to bring new opportunities for many of those along the line, and for these reasons the Portsmouth community chose to remember Capt. Gittio and his career so gratefully.

The colored silk line in the genuine are not in the counterfeit. ","The business of counterfeit money was quite a large one throughout the mid nineteenth century according to Johnson. By the time the Civil War had begun 80 percent of the money in circulation in the United States was counterfeit. Because there were so many versions of counterfeit dollars and coins shop keepers and business owners had no choice but to accept the false money because they were not likely to find much real money. During his tenure from 1869 to 1874 as Chief of the Secret Service, Hiram C. Whitley reported (10 percent sample) that 32 people had been caught in the business of counterfeit money in the South in comparison to the 100 in the Mid-Atlantic and seven in New England. After reconstruction the South was left with unused mints that they had relied on during the civil war for the creation of their monetary system. These mints and other newly created ones helped in the increase of counterfeit money throughout the South. Counterfeiting notes, as the article talked about, was much harder than producing coins. It required a large sum of money, dedicated employees and a large group of consumers. Producing coinage was much easier, only requiring an alloy to be poured into a mold and plated. ","The newspaper makes a specific point of telling its readers about the difficulties in picking this counterfeit out. The author stated It is remarkably well executed, and calculated to deceive. The newspaper ran articles through out its existence reporting the creation of new counterfeits. They knew that while the money would still passed through private hands, the banks would be less likely to fall for the trick, causing the readers to lose their money. The widespread use of false money shows the need for stronger government control over the issuing of money and the amount issued.

Making his way through a swampy pine barren, Ruffin found little trace of any cultivation or civilized inhabitation. The few people in the area raised cattle and, since their animals grazed on the open land, the concept of property ownership was completely foreign to these miserable people. Ruffin scorned the crude capitalists, for some of them owned 500 to 1,000 head of cattle and not a single acre of land. In his private diary, Ruffin noted that these men belonged to a peculiar class: In about a space of 10 miles square of Williamsburg and Georgetown districts, the inhabitants are wretchedly poor, have no slaves, scarcely any other property, and almost no agricultural labor or regular industry of any kind. The men live by hunting, often helped out by petty pillage or trespass on the neighboring properties. These people, and even the more industrious and honest of the poor in lower S. Ca. are a most wretched and worthless population - compared to those whose condition that of the slaves is one not only of greatly superior comfort and happiness, but also of respectability and dignity.","Edmund Ruffin had been commissioned by James Hammond, then governor of South Carolina, to perform an agricultural and geological survey of the state. Ruffin had developed new methods of using calcerous manures to improve the fertility of soil, and some South Carolinians hoped that agricultural reform would help develop the economy and preserve the institution of slavery. Ruffin was always a renowned advocate for secession and an ardent believer in the inferiority of the black race.","Ruffin's disdain for the poor whites of South Carolina's coastal plain demonstrates the power of class in antebellum society. Notions of class were always intertwined with the institution of slavery. In his account, Ruffin immediately emphasized that these people owned no slaves, consigning themselves to a pitiful class. But as Stephanie McCurry demonstrates in <em>Masters of Small Worlds</em>, the intricate relationships of power within the yeoman household were just as significant as those more conspicuous class tensions between plantation owners and yeoman farmers. Poor white men set boundaries of power within their household that defined the roles of their wives and their laborers. The yeomen and the powerful planters of the low country were not socioeconomic equals, but they shared a position of power over their respective households, a power rooted in gendered symbols of inequality, command over dependents, and a fundamental assertion of manly independence."],"display_date":"March 31, 1843","search_date":"1843-03-31","locations":[{"id":11523,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3288,"title":"A 5,000 Debt","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-04-15","end_date":"1834-04-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Charles L. Mathews of Greenwood Plantation had one year to pay back half of a 5,000 loan to George Birch of New Orleans. Why Mathews needed the money was unknown. How he was going to pay 2,500 back in one year was also a mystery. The agreement was signed, sealed, and delivered in the presence of two witnesses, George J. S. Walker and J. W. Elliot with no other comment. The Mathews family owned four plantations in West Feliciana, Lafourche, and Rapides parishes in Louisiana. They were no doubt wealthy, owning so much property in three different parishes, but they were by no means close to the trade center of Louisiana: New Orleans. Sugar and cotton planters shipped their goods down river into the rich city to the merchant wholesalers. These New Orleans merchants would in turn sell them to ship captains who would carry them to other parts of the United States and Europe. A plantation's vitality depended heavily on the cultivation of sugar or cotton. Planters were at the mercy of the fluctuations in the market and the fickle shifts of supply and demand.","Most American emigrants to Louisiana, like the Mathews family, came to make a fortune in sugar or cotton or hoped one day to be able to finance such an enterprise, starting out as small farmers. Those beginning out as small farmers hoped to make a profit in their first few seasons, acquire slaves, slowly build up a plantation, and achieve the high social status connected to it. Instead, many acquired massive debt. At least 66 to 75 percent of goods sold to planters in Louisiana were sold on credit. The necessity for Charles Matthew's loan was unknown, but he apparently felt confidant enough that he could repay George Birch within 12 months. He, unlike many planters who acquired loans to buy land and start their enterprise, already had a profitable plantation established. Perhaps the cholera epidemic of the previous year hit the Mathews' plantations hard; perhaps Charles anticipated a good crop and wanted to buy more hands to make the most of it.

Once organized, they forced their way through the barricaded doors of Pier 2. Now inside the docks, they struck out at the scabs, filling their jobs, and ravaged the offices, where they stole a barrel of whiskey. The effects of their new capture only further soured their demeanor, and resulted in them acting like demons. The dockhands' violence emerged as the culmination of a strike, led by a man named Kelly, a member of the Knights of Labor. Effectively organized, the workers had gone on strike for higher wages, but had received no promise from the Company's agent, Col. Bremond, who claimed to lack the proper wage authority. This disappointment prompted the reckless decision to break into the pier, and subsequently, a Warwick County judge's call for five companies of armed troops. The military unit, of both white and black companies, quickly restored order and forced the rioters to disassemble. Accepting failure, many of the dockhands hoped to eventually to return to work for the railroad company. "," The Knights of Labor emerged in the early 1880's in response to the Industrial Revolution, opposing the increasing trend of concentrated corporate power and monopoly in American business. Though more popular in the North (Kelly hailed from New York), union leaders did travel throughout the South, organizing whites and blacks, and men and women. By 1886, the Knights could claim over 50,000 members, spread out over 10 Southern states. This particular strike resembled typical labor disputes led by the Knights, in that they usually demanded a combination of better wages, better working conditions, or shorter workdays. In fact, the Newport News strike existed as one of twenty-two different strikes by the Southern Knights during that decade, but like Newport News, few affected any measure of change."," Very unique to the Knights of Labor, blacks and whites were treated as equals, despite most leadership still remaining white. Yet, compared to other Gilded Age organizations, such as the Farmer's Alliance, the Knights appeared remarkably interracial. Blacks of the Farmer's Alliance would actually comment on the differences when the two unions formed a tenuous alliance in 1889. An Era of Good Feelings existed for the black and white workingmen in the organization, as interracial solidarity and democratic idealism were fearlessly proclaimed. Sadly, this feature contributed to the union's downfall, as newspapers, across the country, attacked the group for blurring the color line. Coupled with failed strikes and uncooperative economic conditions, by the turn of the century, the Knights had faded out of sight. In their place, though, would emerge the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and its leader, Samuel Gompers. Hoping to organize resistance to affect the same types of changes, this union chose to exclude blacks, preferring that they form their own organization.

Corn Bread was the main bread of the South, because of its flexibility and ease of processing. Lots of southerners would eat hoe bread which was corn bread baked over a fire on top of a farmers hoe. Because corn bread did not keep very well the southern tradition of warm bread at meals began to develop. Southern farms and plantations were often ransacked by Union troops traveling through the land; they would often take food and supplies for themselves. It is not surprising given the poverty of the time and the threat of Union soldiers that Mrs. Pitman would want to save her food stores for her family. Southern women were often willing to help confederate soldiers, though, if provided the supplies to do so. In later years grain production spread throughout the west and processing became cheaper prices of grain also fell, allowing poorer farmers to enjoy wheat bread like the elite.

The contract set that Thomas was set to receive a portion of the crop yields along with pork and corn.

","Although slave overseers were not common in small plantations, they were almost necessary for plantations with 50 or more slaves Cooper and Terrill assert. An overseer's job was to ensure that the slaves were doing as much work as they should be and that everything was being done to improve the crop yield. Overseers were generally hired seasonally and a planter would generally try and find a new one for the next season. For this reason overseers worked especially hard to prove themselves to their employer. They needed to show that they possessed the right qualities to push the slaves just enough to produce more without overworking him. Overseers were mostly young men who were looking for experience to some day own their own land. Pay for the overseers ranged from 700 to 2,000 a year for cane and rice plantations, from 200 to 1,000 on cotton and tobacco plantations. Overseers were also usually given a place to live and given a small garden of their own.

And if that livelihood was threatened, the residents knew that they would have to work together to protect it. As the <em>New York Times</em> reported on July 21, 1854, farmers held a convention in Warrenton, Va, entitled The Joint-Worm Convention, in an effort to stop the destruction of the wheat crop in the region by the joint-worm pest. As the article stated, the organizers felt that the wheat crop was of the greatest importance to the state."," When all was said and done, the Convention proved to be a success as the following several recommendations were decided on and put forth unanimously by the community. The members of the convention decided that wheat should be planted early and in the most thrifty and hardy varieties. Additionally, no activities that would retard the growth of the crop, such as grazing, would be tolerated. Farmers were encouraged to work with their neighbors and conspire to sow adjoining fields in wheat the same year. And finally, all the straw that had not been fed before the 1st of May [was] to be burned to protect from infestation by the dreaded pests."," The <em>Times</em> pointed to the Convention in Warrenton as an example for all those who sought to reach resolutions in the form of committee. The Joint-Worm meeting set itself apart from the thousands of Conventions at the time by its apart effectiveness. Along with deciding on the various resolutions, those present at the Convention also appointed committees to oversee the farmers in particular districts. Despite their efficiency in compromising, all present at the meeting were not so bold as to suggest that any of their plans could succeed without the help of the Will of Him who gives and withholds crops."," Agriculture was of the utmost importance to the farmers of Northern Virginia and Fauquier County. Additionally, as mentioned by historians Kenneth E. Koons and Kenneth W. Keller, wheat was the primary crop the residents of the region depended on for economic success throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century. The importance of wheat, as well as its susceptibility to vermin, including rust, joint-worm and the Hessian fly, made it necessary for farmers to cooperate to protect their livelihood. If one farmer's product became infested with a pest, his neighbor also became vulnerable. And if the agricultural output of counties in Northern Virginia, such as Fauquier, was threatened than the region's whole economy, and subsequently the way of life of its citizens, was threatened."],"display_date":"July - December 1854","search_date":"1854-09-30","locations":[{"id":13805,"lat":38.7385889089,"lng":-77.8094319404,"zoom":9,"place":"FAUQUIER, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3360,"title":"The Southern Review\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1827-09-27","end_date":"1827-09-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Robert Y.

I bought 100 acres of land which lay contiguous to my estate [and] paid 600 dollars he explained and was able to make about 500 dollars by only planting cotton on seventeen acres. Cotton was seen as an agricultural gold mine and resulted in a great hunt to search for and obtain this valuable land. ","This widespread desire for cotton created an economical boom in Mississippi which led to an increased number of settlers. After the War of 1812, a substantial number of Native Americans were removed from the area which offered fresh land at a cheep price to anyone who was interested in farming agricultural products. The geographical location of this state consequently turned Mississippi into one of the leading cotton producing areas in the nation due to the fertile soils and excellent climate needed for farming this crop. Because the soil was so deep and rich, farmers could plant cotton season after season without having to rotate fields or worry about exhausting the supply of nutrients in the dirt. This newly liberated land not only became the home for rich plantation owners who cultivated cotton on large plots of land. Poorer farmers were able to purchase property and raise row crops and tend to livestock as well as middle class folk who had dreams of someday entering the plantation society by working their way up to larger plots of land as they became more successful. ","Raising and picking cotton demand a great deal of hand labor, and the crop, typically, was worked by slave gang labor on large plantations. This overbearing stipulation resulted in a search by plantation owners to find more help on farms. Slaves were heavily sought after and cotton became one of the most influential contributors to the slave trade because of the number of people it took to harvest. By 1820 in cotton producing areas of Tennessee the number of African Americans populating this region had increased exponentially consisting of 80,107 blacks which formed 18.9 percent of the total residents. Slaves were so sought after in Mississippi that Natchez became the busiest slave market in the south after Algiers, in New Orleans.

The workingman, having so ardently supported the first Democratic president-elect since Reconstruction, expressed a widespread Southern feeling of discontent towards the man whose election had so recently stirred uncontrollable celebrations throughout the South. As a loyal rank and file Democrat, this man expected to be rewarded for his vote. Instead, he found himself turned away from what, in his own mind, should have been party jobs. Regarding Cleveland's lack of patronage he replied, Whoever heard of an Army [that] after cleaning out and capturing the entire camp, turns over all the spoils of war and commissary stores to the enemy? Why it is the d---dest foolishness in the world Democrats, either turned away from patronage jobs across the city or left to compete for single jobs with hundreds of others, felt betrayed by the administration.

In the 1880's, the Civil Service system, technically, underwent reforms like the Pendleton Act, hoping to replace the spoils system with a more permanent government bureaucracy based on merit. Nonetheless, in practice, government positions at all levels still went to those who had been loyal to the party. Thus, when Cleveland won the election in 1884, the South thought it had great reason to rejoice. Finally, Reconstruction, at the hands of meddling Republican presidents, would be ended and the Democratic South could look to the spoils of their great victory.

Southern Democrats, too busy celebrating, did not anticipate Cleveland to stand by that platform, much like other politicians who ran on such appeals. He left many Republicans in their government jobs, meaning that in Virginia, Readjusters still filled spots that the average Democrats believed were rightly theirs. Southern political figures, especially from Virginia complained to Cleveland and asked him to reward their support, becoming insulted when he refused. Terribly disillusioned, Democrats in Virginia would not forget Cleveland's neglect, and when the national Democratic Party re-nominated him in 1892, Virginian Democratic voters place their support elsewhere. Their statement would ring hollow, as Cleveland regained the presidency. Nevertheless, this encounter with the workingman clearly illustrates the expectations of rank and file voters towards their parties, which operated very much as machines churning out benefits to retain loyalty."],"display_date":"March 25, 1885","search_date":"1885-03-25","locations":[{"id":14411,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3396,"title":"The Mississippi in Flood\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1823-07-02","end_date":"1823-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Financial ruin courted the planters of Ouachita and Concordia Parishes in a taunting dance of destruction in the summer of 1823. The Mississippi River, so vital to the economic profit of the sugar and cotton plantations along its banks, flooded and overflowed the fields of both parishes. Whole crops were ruined. According to B. Levy & Company's Price Current, published in the <em>Baltimore Patriot</em> on July 2, twenty to thirty thousand bales of cotton were lost. ","While sugar production was limited to the city of New Orleans and the surrounding areas in Louisiana along the Mississippi River, cotton production occurred across the Deep South. Production of the crop tripled within five years. By 1820, almost 159,500 bales of cotton were harvested across the southern United States. The demand for cotton, especially for the English textile mills, made average American cotton farmers dominant members of the global market. ","But while U.S. farmers would lead the world cotton market until the Civil War, the mid-1820s brought falling prices due to overproduction. Cotton planters found themselves unable to receive more than ten cents per pound of cotton. More and more farmers found themselves in debt and unable to pay off the government for public lands they had bought to farm. Cotton production continued to increase throughout the 1820s, which only served to exacerbate the problem rather than solve it. The flooding on the Mississippi in the summer of 1823 no doubt only added insult to injury, wiping out an entire season's crop. And while B. Levy & Company were unconcerned since farmers all over the South produced more than enough cotton for one flood to effect the price or availability until a year in the future, the farmers of the Mississippi and its tributaries found themselves in dire straits. ","While the newspaper report covered only the economic impact of product loss, it made no mention of the loss of human lives, property, or homes. Whole farms were completely underwater. The rather impersonal business article failed to express the emotional and physical devastation flooding could cause. In many cases, if a family lost their fields in the flood, they also lost their home, personal belongings, livestock, and perhaps even members of their family or friends and neighbors. Depending on how fast the rivers flooded, many people might have been unable to escape. This included the many numbers of slaves kept to work the cotton and sugar plantations. While slave-owners might not equate the death of slaves with human deaths, the loss of slaves would be considered the loss of a considerable investment. Either way, the results were devastating."],"display_date":"July 2, 1823","search_date":"1823-07-02","locations":[{"id":5604,"lat":32.5536377991,"lng":-91.9563281785,"zoom":8,"place":"OUACHITA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3398,"title":"Bishop&#39;s Mill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-03-11","end_date":"1820-03-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Joseph Bishop owned a mill on the Rivanna River from 1805 to the late 1820?s. He worked in the mill along with the family's two male slaves, and possibly with occasional help from his five sons. Bishop's mill supported his main economic activity, which was tanning leather. But Bishop sometimes allowed the use of his facilities to grind nearby farmers' grain, typically for free. Over the years Bishop twice had to rebuild his mill. It is possible that it was damage by one of the floods that periodically struck eastern Virginia rivers. It is also possible that the mill's wooden moving parts wore out, perhaps exhausted by the extra task of pro bono grain grinding. It is likely that on at least one of the rebuilding occasions, Bishop upgraded the technology of his mill. In 1820, after repairing his mill for the second time, Bishop ran out of generosity toward the neighbors for whom he used to grind wheat for free. He publicly announced that he would no longer grind on any terms whatsoever, and that anybody who needed grinding done should build a simple mill of their own. He may have stood by this threat for some time, but by the late 1820s he joined eleven other Albemarle gristmills in commercial production, and began selling ground corn meal in bulk. "," Historian Melvin Ely described the operation of mills and their place in the daily life of nearby Appomattox, a piedmont Virginia county similar to Albemarle in many respects. Many mills only ground wheat, though many combined that task with sawing, ginning cotton, producing textiles, or making soap. After harvest, small farmers would sell their surplus grain to the local mill. The miller would grind the grain and store it in bulk. Store-owners in towns could then buy grain to retail, or individual families could buy it as needed directly from the miller. At this time a typical barrel sold for somewhere between 4.00 and 12.00, depending on quality of the grain. According to Ely, The typical mill in the area was manned by a miller, a cooper, and perhaps a few helpers. Slaves were often employed in mills, and often became as proficient at the tasks of operation as the miller himself. Free blacks, too, often found employment in mills. "," At the beginning of the nineteenth century one of the most popular books in the United States was comprehensive guide to the science and practice of milling, written by a Delaware entrepreneur named Oliver Evans. The book's success was bolstered by the fact that Evans included descriptions of labor-saving mechanical processes he had recently invented. More important, though, was Evans's ability to relate technical information to a wide audience, in common, unpretentious language. Evans's Miller's Guide was the first of its kind, popular throughout America. Previously, technical advancement often only spread through word of mouth, rough sketches, and ideas in individuals' heads."],"display_date":"March 11, 1820","search_date":"1820-03-11","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3439,"title":"A Summit to Discuss Internal Improvements\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1828-07-01","end_date":"1828-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On July 15 1828, Virginians gathered in Charlottesville to discuss the question of whether the State of Virginia shall herself make her own Internal Improvements, or resign that duty, with all its important political and pecuniary interests to a foreign Corporation. The specific concern those in meeting grappled with was the fact that in March 1827 the General Assembly provided a charter for corporation in Virginia to the Maryland-based Baltimore and Ohio Railroad company. The railroad would have great freedom in choosing what land to occupy, which threatened to intensify intra-regional competitions within the state. Of additional concern, the railroad could obtain a virtual monopoly of land in those counties it chose, and thereby directly threaten the state government's jurisdiction. The railroad or any other State who may, in an unguarded moment, acquire an interest and influence subversive of the great and permanent rights, influences and power of our government was how Virginians like John Coalter of Stafford phrased the problem. It was Coalter who prompted the meeting by circulating an editorial in the state's leading newspapers. He entreated editors to notify the public of the summit, in order that there may be some concert, and as general a meeting procured, from every section of the State.","Internal improvements, which included canals, toll roads, and eventually railroads, were not an all a new consideration to Virginians in the early nineteenth century. In the 1780s George Washington had initiated plans to build a canal connecting the Chesapeake Bay and the Ohio Valley, and to drain the Great Dismal Swamp. The state government chartered several road and canal by 1815, many of which connected the growing Valley region in western Virginia with the Tidewater and Piedmont parts of the state. In these early years, capital for improvement projects in Virginia was raised by public stock companies. Once chartered by act of the state assembly, a company would offer a certain number of shares to private investors. The state government also typically purchased an initial stake in these companies, somewhere between ten and twenty percent. But until the 1820s, the state did not provide any more than that partial financial support. That dynamic would change by the late 1820s. In its previous history, Virginia had generally avoided incurring state debt. The state owed some money to the federal government for the War of 1812, but paid this off by 1826. But that is precisely when the issue of internal improvements heated up. In the next twelve years, Virginia went over six million dollars into debt to encourage the growth of canal and railroad companies within its borders. Baltimore and Ohio was one of the largest beneficiaries."," The financing of internal improvements had become an issue of national scope. Eleven new states, most of which were located in the Mississippi basin, had joined the Union by 1821. Whereas Virginia earlier tried to link the eastern and western parts of the state, now the Americans tried to economically link East and West on the national scale. States directly competed with one another to attract railroad companies. Virginians saw themselves in competition with Pennsylvania and Maryland. New York's Erie Canal, completed in 1825, directly challenged Canadian trade routes in the north. National politicians battled about whether the federal government should shoulder the burden for expensive improvement projects. For example, Henry Clay successfully advanced the National Road, the biggest highway project in the country, while serving as Secretary of State under John Quincy Adams."],"display_date":"July - September 1828","search_date":"1828-08-15","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3440,"title":"A Scarcity of Goods\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1830-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The low water level made the landing of ships near the mouth of the Brazos difficult. And, fortunately for William hunter, the ship that was lost to the sand bar (he could not remember the name of the ship) was not carrying his goods. However, the incident was instructive to Hunter, as he reported to his business associate James Perry (who resided in Missouri at the time), in that after the ship's destruction he began to insure their goods against loss. Though he had not calculated on paying for insurance, he was advised by Mills and McKinstry by all means to insure all [of his goods]. Though Perry judged insurance to be a good idea in light of the uncertain marine transportation, the cost was such that he had to defer his payment to the proprietor of the schooner shipping his goods until he could sell goods to pay him [with the profits].","With the exception of the first and last sentences of his letter, Hunter's correspondence dealt exclusively with business interests and the protection thereof. Hunter proceeded to relate his most recent dealings, payments, and debts to Perry, as well the difficult time he had getting his goods through the customhouse. Such a focus on economic concerns is not surprising in a letter to a business partner, but the detailed analyses of the young Texan market serve as a reminder that the early settlement of Texas was mostly by people seeking economic opportunity. Though the history of the United States demonstrates examples of both economically and ideologically motivated migrations, the colonization of Texas with which Hunter and Perry were associated clearly aligns with the latter. One of the primary motivations for the settlement of Mexico was the availability and cheap cost of land. While land in the United States cost 1.25 per acre, land was available in Texas for about four cents per acre. Additionally, each head of a family could claim 4, 605 acres. Through the efforts of businessmen like Perry, Hunter, and Stephen Austin, settlements sprang up rapidly and Texas became a link between the stagnating economy of Mexico and the booming market of the United States. ","From 1800 to the decades after Anglo-American colonization began, Mexico's economy underwent a slight decline. America, however, saw a massive increase in economic power. The only significant economic growth that occurred in Mexico during the time period was in Mexico's far north (i.e., Texas and New Mexico), and, according to Resendez, this growth was fueled predominantly by foreign immigration, the opening of new trading routes to the United States, the availability of cheap import goods, and the region... as a crossroads of exchange. The relative prosperity of the northern parts of Mexico due to their ties to the U.S. economy is indicative of the overall growth in the American market. Resendez states that at the same time the Mexican economy was undergoing a slight decline (of about ten percent), the United States economy grew 1270.4 percent between 1800 and 1860. This growth was due in part to the increased agricultural production of the South, which spurred entrepreneurs to try their hand at developing the new lands of Texas.

Thousands of Native Americans perished on the over 2000 mile long Trail of Tears in 1838."," It was in this context that O.G. Murrell learned that his children had received an inheritance from his father. Since these children were not of the age to legally stand on their own, Murrell took it upon himself to act on their behalf. He wrestled with the choice of what to do with this inheritance, the choice made more difficult by his lack of detailed knowledge about the property since it was in Virginia and he in Louisiana."," In a letter to his brother - who was in Lynchburg and therefore in closer proximity to the property - Murrell mulled over his different options, deciding that neither cash nor bank stock was a stable enough source in which to make an investment. Another possibility was an investment in Western lands which would in my estimation be a safe one and one that would annually increase in value - but in my condition I could not leave home to attend it. Murrell recognized the benefits of actually following through with claiming such property but had reservations about not being in peak health."," Conversely he acknowledged that Negro property would be of service to him and since he - and his children - will come into ownership of that property during his lifetime, it is of that kind that [he] would like to have possession. In this letter, western expansion and slavery are each referred to within a single paragraph. All across America, citizens were beginning preparations to take up life in a very different part of the country: its territories. The idea of Manifest Destiny was only a few short years away from being introduced to the American vernacular, but whispers of a God-given right to promote expansion had already begun. With this kind of moral argument coming into play, it was only a matter of time before the topic of slavery joined the discussion. Those same citizens that were packing up to move out west came from a variety of backgrounds, some of them slaveholding. They had no intention of surrendering that as they sought more land."," Murrell's letter and its close mention of expansion and slavery is indicative of the contemporaneous stage that was being set for American politics. The two topics came one after the other in his letter, and the proximity of issues parallels the contemporaneous American political scene.

As he is mentioned in a letter to James Perry, who had a number of business interests in Texas, it is probable that he was there in a role of some relation to James Perry's investments. Unfortunately for Perry, the winter of 1831 was the worst winter that Texas had experienced for several years. Upon disembarking from his boat, he intended to venture further on into the settlements, but was detained for four days by bad weather and high water. Perry was, of course, not the only one to suffer from the adverse weather conditions and their effects on the local road systems. ","William Hunter, James Perry's agent who had been running his business in Texas commented upon the economically pernicious results of the impassable roadways. Hunter related to James Perry that he had only been able to transport two loads of their goods up from the river where they were deposited by boat. He declared that he was verry much disappointed in getting hauling done because a team that had started to the river for a load the previous week had returned empty-handed. He further noted that one or two teams were mired down on the roadways at the time. This development was clearly economically damaging, as Hunter could not sell goods that he didn't have in his possession. He lamented that if his goods had arrived before the bad weather, he could have done a good business. Like the financial fortunes of Perry and Hunter, the economic well being of the South was highly dependent on roads and other means of transportation. Well-kept roads were crucial for the shipment of goods, especially from rural areas to urban centers where they could be sold or shipped to larger markets. As a result, local governments communities throughout the South put much emphasis on road maintenance even at a time where municipal services were few. An excellent example of this facet of community cooperation occurred in Virginia's Prince Edward County. As noted in Israel on the Appomatox, the Prince Edward county court expended considerable effort responding to petitions for new roadways. Also, county surveyors, or citizens in charge of certain sections of road were enlisted for general maintenance of thoroughfares. These surveyors had the power to conscript other men's slaves (and free blacks) for several days each year in the interest of improving roads. The yearly cleanup allowed for uninhibited commerce along the county's highways and byways. Because the economy of the South produced primarily agricultural goods that had to be shipped for sale, good systems of transportation were crucial. In addition to roads, transportation throughout the South was carried out by other means such as boats or, later on, railroads. However, at the time of Perry's detainment by muddy paths, Texas was little more than a collection of settlements strung together by roads that were clearly inadequate for year-round business."],"display_date":1831,"search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3454,"title":"Technological Progress in Louisiana\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["New Orleans' geographical location made it a prime final destination for all sorts of shipable goods. The city had become one of the premier metropolises of not only the state but also the entire South, thanks to the convergence of the Mississippi with the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the abundance of water routes, the need for other methods of transportation grew along with the city. Far from being the lazy South that has been romanticized in literature, this part of the country was bustling with trade and a rapid trend towards efficiency. Out of that desire, a minority within the Louisiana Committee on Internal Improvements took it upon themselves to investigate the complete installation of a railroad line connecting Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This committee published a Minority Report in 1853 urging the state legislature to approve immediate funding of this line. Forty-six of the ninety-one mile stretch between the two cities had already been constructed and were in daily use, so it was just a matter of completing the job previously begun. The committee agreed that the New Orleans and Baton Rouge Railroad is a work of great public utility and that the line... is superior to that of any railroad in the state. They claimed that, upon completion of the railroad, travel time between the cities would be reduced to a mere three hours, and at a cost of just 3 per ride. Not only would this be an advantage to anyone living in either Baton Rouge or New Orleans, but it would be particularly beneficial to members of legislature. The railroad could now afford them the opportunity to attend their meetings at shorter notice and still be home by nightfall.","The South was truly growing at a rapid rate, and the addition of a railroad line portrays that growth quite clearly. No longer were waterways sufficient; faster overland travel was a necessary addition to the well-being of Louisiana's inhabitants. The scramble to improve transportation was being seen all over the young country, so much so that the national government became involved. Congress bequeathed land to states for the express purpose of improving travel routes, and Louisiana was no exception. Congress agreed to grant 100,000 acres to its railroad construction, knowing that the state's eventual gains meant that their economic loss would not be sustained for long. Just as a more streamlined transportation system translated into greater productivity and commerce, it also facilitated better and quicker communication within the country. No longer could the North and South co-exist in denial of their counterparts.

By 1826, a new kind of merchant had come to town. John Cochran & Co. took up occupancy in a well-known building in Charlottesville's court house square. The new company offered for sale all manner of impressive goods recently received from New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. Of course they offered the usual groceries, as well as an impressive array of spices and Wines of Superior Quality. Most impressive, though, was the wide offering of luxury items. Irish Linens, Silk, beaver, & horsekin [sic] gloves, Mandarine Robes, Italian Crepes and Shawls, these specialty items and over a hundred more were available on the shelves of Cochran & Co. By 1828, the affluent residents of Albemarle could help themselves to the crime of London fashion together with a variety of other articles; comprising a general assortment of Spring and Summer goods.","High fashion in Virginia emulated European models. This had long been the case, but now the seasonal trends could mimic London more closely than had been possible in the past. The first two dozen items listed in the catalog were cloths and various kinds of other raw textiles; the rest of items tended to be manufactured accessories. Albemarle households at this time made their clothes or had them tailored. Cochran did not list any pants, dresses, or socks, but rather non-vital accessories like parasols, silk shoes, and beaver hats. It is intuitive to expect that plantation-owning families were the principal consumers of this kind of consumer good. In a study of middle-class consumerism in New England, Catherine Kelly describes how typical rural families patterned their consumption on that of their urban acquaintances, yet maintained distinctive social culture. Especially before the elite plantation gentry identity crystallized in southern states, non-elite but economically comfortable free families likely participated in the kind of consumption Cochran?s store made possible.","Cochran's offerings reflect contemporary developments in the American economy. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Southern ports imported comparable volumes of goods from Europe as did cities in the North. In 1806, for instance, Charlestown was home to over forty importation companies. It would be decades before the Erie canal made New York an entrepot for a huge northeastern hinterland. As the nineteenth century continued, the role of cities like Richmond and Charleston as direct importers declined, even though their exports, which exceeded the contemporary North, continued to increase. Many southerners blamed this phenomenon on federal trade policies, such as the tariff and the Bank of the United States that disproportionately benefited northern states. Albemarle, on the outer edge of the slave economy, depended more on consumer trade with northern cities than it did to the capital of the South, Charleston. Northern cities at this time still depended strongly on European manufacture.

Along with this warning of what not to eat, the paper informed the public that people who disobeyed these rules would be forced to pay a fine of five dollars. Provisional laws were given serious thought in regards to what people should be allowed to eat or sell with the intent of reducing the possibility of transmitting infection among the inhabitants of different communities.","Diseases were frequently established and spread by the consumption of poor food, infection, or contacting others who had contagious viruses. As trading increased and people began traveling around the world, new illnesses were found and exposed to people wherever these ships landed. In a conversation between William and John Bisland they discussed how the yellow fever began at New Orleans, and came up to Natchez by the Steam Boat, killing a great number of people. Due to the fear of contracting these unknown diseases states elected a member of their community to establish a board of health. The board of health in Mississippi was extremely concerned with the welfare of their citizens and established preventative measures to avoid the contraction of diseases, to help reduce the number of people exposed to sicknesses and determine rules regarding the presence of foreigners on their land. Incidences such as this one forced Mississippi to determine laws which were immediately enforced and stating that all empty or other boats landing [in this city], shall immediately notify the health officer and that the boats needed to immediately be cleansed, sent adrift or removed. If the possessor of a boat did not comply with the officers request, the owner of such flat or other boats [were considered] guilty of a misdemeanor and were subject to appropriate prosecution. ","Healthcare was a considerable problem in nineteenth century Mississippi because of the little knowledge communities had regarding specific diseases and the shortage of medicines needed to treat these widespread illnesses. Life became much easier for families when the creation of home medical guides were established in the late 1820's. These books were designed to serve as a guide for frontier and rural families who lived great distances from primitive medical care (McClary) so maintaining health would not require the attention of a physician. If any problems or sicknesses were identified, families could easily treat them without traveling to a major city. Books such as this one were easy helpful way to cure uncommon yet simple diseases.

They claimed to have heard of his propensity at the violin and requested to hire him to accompany their traveling circus performances. The pay was quite reasonable and Northup eagerly took on the job. He accompanied them the entire way down to Washington, D.C. without realizing that this was a cruel trick. Those circus performers were, in fact, slave traders looking to make a quick profit off of selling free men. "," Northup did not realize the true motives of his companions until he awoke one morning bound in chains in a damp and dark cell-like room. He never saw the traders again, but the nightmare to which they introduced him continued. From Washington, Northup was put on a ship with other enslaved people and relocated to New Orleans."," After arriving in New Orleans, Northup's outraged cries of his free status went largely ignored or resulted in angry lashings. He was placed in a slave pen along with many others. First thing next morning everyone received a bath, if necessary, a shave, and a set of cheap but clean new clothes. Northup experienced firsthand the degradation that occurred inside those slave pens; when the customers arrived, the traders paraded the slaves around and allowed them to be patted down, walked about, questioned and otherwise examined. Some of these prospective buyers demanded that the slaves open their mouths and display their teeth, precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. The dehumanization continued with mandatory exercise activities taking place. At one point Northup was even called on to provide violin music to the slaves' tortured dancing."," These New Orleans slave pens mocked any notion of innate or universal humanism. The slave traders and future owners translated their own discomfort with the practice of trading people into viewing the so-called 'items' for sale with repulsion. In their eyes, blacks existed purely for the purpose of making them, the whites, a profit. Because of this rationale, traders generally had no desire to attempt to keep many family ties together. Northup witnessed an instance of this: a buyer was prepared to purchase Emily, the daughter of his new slave Eliza, at Eliza's insistence. Before he could make the transaction, however, the trader firmly stated that she was simply not for sale. He wanted to keep her for a few more years until she matured into a more valuable slave. Up until then, Northup had lived his entire life as a free man, but in the slave pens of New Orleans he was audience to the atrocities committed against his people on a daily basis."],"display_date":1841,"search_date":"1841-07-02","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3478,"title":"Settlers and Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-02","end_date":"1830-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The steamboat made it safely over the sand bar and arrived at the mouth of the Brazos River in Texas. Upon landing, William Hunter quickly composed a letter to his business associate James Perry to give tidings of his safe arrival. Hunter noted to Perry the presence of 30 Negroes on board and wrote of his plan to inquire of the owner, a settler from Alabama, about the means of their transport into the Mexican territory that was Texas. Hunter clearly expressed interest in importing slaves to Texas, and he was not an inconsequential businessman. Perry, the recipient of his letter, was the brother-in-law of Stephen Austin, the most important player in Anglo-American settlement of Texas, and Hunter conducted business with both of these men. ","Though Hunter's life is poorly documented, much is known about his traveling companion, Stephen Austin. Austin's father, Moses Austin, originally negotiated with the Spanish government to secure a land grant and to bring 300 Anglo-American settlers to inhabit the sparsely populated northern reaches of Spain's North American possessions. Upon Moses Austin's death in 1821 (the same year that Mexico gained independence), the grant passed to Stephen Austin. The specific attention given by Hunter (and presumably shared by Austin) to the importation of slaves into Texas is of great interest due to its place in a primarily business-related letter and the early date at which it occurs. It appears that like other parts of the American South, slavery in Texas was associated with business and profit, regardless of slaveholders' professions of paternalistic sentiment toward enslaved people. Also, the fact that slaves were brought into Texas at such an early stage in Anglo-American settlement is important as it affected later national politics. ","The Mexican government, in fact, frowned upon the form of slavery found in the United States. All slaves in Mexico were legally emancipated in 1829, however Austin's powerful friends managed to secure an exemption from this law for Texas. In composing the Civil and Criminal Regulations that governed his colony, the laws regarding slavery were the only ones imported directly from codes in the American South. Such Anglo-American support of slavery at the highest levels demonstrates both the pervasive nature of the institution and the reason that it eventually became such an issue of contention. In the years before Texas joined the United States, the annexation debate was influenced by Texas's possible status as a slaveholding state. Reminiscent of the conditions that necessitated the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Northern residents and anti-slavery forces were concerned with the balance of power shared by slaveholding and non-slaveholding states. In 1844 Democrat James K. Polk ran on a platform of annexing Texas and re-occupying Oregon, a bid to please both North and South. Thus, Hunter's seemingly innocuous comment regarding slaves being brought into Texas was actually a portent of turbulence to come."],"display_date":"January 2, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3491,"title":"Sugar Plantations\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-12-28","end_date":"1835-12-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the nineteenth century Louisiana was one of the country's largest producers of sugar. The sugar plantations contributed to the American economy and although they were not always the wealthiest of ventures, the proved to be objects of mystique to travelers passing through southern Louisiana.","One such visitor to Louisiana was William Gray Fairfax of Virginia. Gray was on his way to Texas with a company of men when they stopped near Donaldsonville, Louisiana. While stopped, Madame Toureau of a nearby plantation, showed Gray then inside of her sugar house. The idea of a plantation was nothing new for Gray but he remarked on several things he saw while visiting the sugar plantation. He commented on the slaves, saying, the Negroes could only speak French; this points to the French settlement of the area. Although the plantation in Gray's eyes had the appearance of wealth he wrote further on that the figures he collected on the profit of the industry were a small yield for the apparent size and force. This shows that despite the work put into the crop, sugar cane was not always the most profitable crop in Louisiana.","Sugar plantation, like the one Gray visited, grew out of the vicinity of New Orleans in the period 1742-1795. This originated with French Creole planters that lived in the area. At this time, farmers focused on indigo and tobacco which provided a plantation foundation for the growing industry. In the next two decades, the sugar cane industry expanded in all directions while early frosts, poor soil, and the intrusion of the profitable cotton industry confined sugar cane production to southern Louisiana. The new technological advances in production tools, such as the boiling apparatus, propelled sugar cane's expansion and rooted it in the economy of Louisiana by the second decade of the nineteenth century. ","In order to glean a profit from the sugar business, the partners needed a large amount of labor. The slaves of the plantation supplied the manpower in the fields and in the mills. During the harvest slaves worked even longer hours...[and] raced against the weather to collect the harvest before the first frost and attacks by insects. This was backbreaking work and during the act of processing the crop, it was not unusual for several slaves to be injured by the rollers as they fed stalks into the mill or tried to untangle stalks from flywheels.","Although Gray was only a passerby in the plantation world of Louisiana, his eyes were opened to a larger part of the United States economy. By seeing a working sugar plantation, Gray saw a fixture of Louisiana agriculture and financial system. In his mind cotton planting must be more profitable, and he could not register the need for a large amount of laborers when the profit was small. He observed a part of history where slaves labor was crucial and where the industry profited from it."],"display_date":"December 28, 1835","search_date":"1835-12-28","locations":[{"id":5413,"lat":30.154068203,"lng":-91.0248645369,"zoom":9,"place":"ASCENSION, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3492,"title":"Transportation Problems in Appalachia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1830-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The river was dangerously low. Travelers from Virginia to Kentucky in 1830 needed the river, but fortune did not smile on Robert Whitehead. After a breathtakingly beautiful trip through the countryside to the New River, Whitehead faced water levels lower than any in recent memory. With his chances of catching the steamboat back home dashed, he turned to a precariously small skiff constructed of thin strips of wood. Whitehead simply did not have any other options. "," Whitehead's transportation difficulties reflected the broader infrastructural problem of the South. In Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the North, sophisticated urban capitalists financed the vast majority of railroads. This was not the case in southern states like Virginia. Here the state government and local investors monopolized the development of the railroad system and never pushed to cut through Appalachia. When Virginia's rugged West began focusing on using its coal endowment to build a future with industry instead of agriculture, the eastern planter class that controlled Virginia politics often ignored the West's transportation needs. More firmly entrenched in slavery than their mountain neighbors, the easterners minimized the westerners' political influence because the former feared that in relinquishing political power to the West they would invite attack on their peculiar institution. The planters also resented western Virginia's focus on developing industries like the North, so they limited transportation projects in the western region. This stifled eastern Virginia's economic connection with western Virginia and limited the state's trade with its western neighbors. "," The South's poor transportation development stymied its economic gains from internal trade as well. Well-planned railroad lines and other infrastructural improvements connected and stoked the North's economic engine enabling it to achieve technological and industrial development gains. However, the ill-conceived, haphazard transportation networks in places like Virginia were unable to help develop a large number of the localities surrounding them because they did not tie economies together. By relying on local funding, Virginia's infrastructural network remained invariably spotty because poorer areas could not afford improvements to link up with the rest of the state. The Virginia legislature authorized funding so slowly and sporadically that even Richmond was not connected to the West on the eve of the Civil War.

Alongside wheat and shares of bank stock, his estate bought and sold people in the account books. Lewis's family let Sally keep her child and newborn baby when they sold the three for 17. The newborn baby brought in 5 alone. On the other hand, due to her poor eyesight, Caroline's buyer and seller considered her worth nothing more than the cost of her food and clothes. To the Lewis family, Caroline was an 'investment', and her disability meant that they would receive a poor return. "," Lewis's estate guardians knew they had to pay the bills and they chose to pay off expenses with people. In 1834 and 1835, his family was able to cover their debts by hiring out or selling enslaved people to others. Black families had to suffer for the white family to maintain its comfortable way of life. To soothe their patriarchal consciences, Lewis's family made a point in his accounts to note how they kept mothers and children together when they sold them. Lewis's story was not atypical. Upon his death, guardians had probably taken control of his estate and hired out or sold enslaved people to keep his dependents in comfort. The rising popularity of hiring out enslaved people signaled an economic shift in the South. As some basic industry entered into southern communities, it became more profitable to rent out a portion of the enslaved population to work in the primitive factories that sprouted up in the mixed agricultural economy rather than keeping them on the farms. Slave labor was cheaper than free labor, so it appealed to factory owners as well. "," Some of Lewis's enslaved people might also have been eventually sold further South from Virginia. With land better suited to produce for the booming cotton market than the tobacco-oriented Upper South, the Deep South's demand for forced labor increased even as its northern neighbors' supply of unnecessary labor rose. Deep South demand meeting Upper South supply ensured a forced southern migration of enslaved people. Sophisticated slave trading firms in big southern cities like Norfolk or Richmond used urban slave markets to oblige the economy by sending down enslaved black people from further North to New Orleans and elsewhere. Slave dealers sold the vast majority of enslaved people in direct bargaining processes with potential buyers in the slave pens. Rapid sales in massive public auctions did not occur as frequently.

Such is what James Markell's sister wrote to her absent brother in the winter of 1826 concerning the hog butchering frenzy in that western Virginia area. For the past two weeks, several couples had also celebrated their nuptials never minding the penetrating squeals of the dying pigs around them. New families would begin and there would be plenty of food for Shepherdstown. Energy and happiness filled the Markell household. "," With southern livestock like hogs accounting for over two times the value of the cotton crop by 1860, the Markells had good reason to feel elated. They were part of the army of farmers in the South that would grow to produce two-thirds of America's hogs for the one hundred million dollar US market in that same period. Three types of people led this hog-raising cohort: planters, yeoman farmers, and drovers. Planters generally felt that keeping hogs was beneath them and consequently raised the fewest hogs of the group. In southern Appalachia, wealthy planters often contracted with landless farmers to sharecrop hogs and cattle on some of their more mountainous land. These landlords would supply necessary farm equipment to these poor farmers and then take a majority portion of the livestock yield at the appropriate time. Making up about three times more of the labor force than these landless folk, wage workers played an even more important role in the southern Appalachian livestock economy as short-term laborers or long-term contract employees. Yeoman farmers stood in between the planters with their workers and the drovers in producing sizable herds of hogs. Drovers earned their moniker because they almost exclusively herded animals and drove them to market as opposed to cultivating crops. In the process of taking thousands upon thousands of animals to market, drovers would support local economies by purchasing feed and other supplies for the hogs."," In contrast to some commonly held beliefs, planters did not unequivocally dominate this agrarian social group. Not all rural people aspired to the life of the planter because they had found handsome profits in more mobile lives as herders. Becoming planters was also exceedingly difficult for most southern Appalachians, so they remained in their sharecropping and herding roles across generations. Southern society recognized the important role that these people played and protected their grazing ranges for many years by limiting fencing law protection for the planter class's crops.

Initially, he had partnered with Thomas Edmiston to purchase a piece of property. Edmiston had traveled to the appropriate land office to buy the land in his own name while Buchanan stayed home.

Their official business was to  take into consideration the depreciation of the notes of certain banks, for the economy was at the bottom of a large dip - the Panic of 1819. The citizens decided that the notes of the State Bank of North Carolina should no longer be received at normal value, but rather at a discount that was fixed to same discount in Richmond."," Further, the citizens decided that the merchants in the town should hold onto the   bank notes they received. When there were enough notes to support a trip to North Carolina, the council resolved to send down a confidential person to trade the North Carolina notes for current notes of other states or just plain gold specie."," These were issues being debated throughout the Union that year as they had been, asserts literary historian David Anthony in his article Banking on Emotion, ever since an economy based on national debt and credit rather than on a gold standard had been set in motion in the 1790's by Alexander Hamilton. By the second decade of the eighteenth century, institutions such as the Bank of North Carolina were offering credit with nothing tangible to back it up. The situation was made more precarious as people became cavalier with their debts: it was a time of economic booms, and great speculation in the South. As Melvin Ely notes, in <em>Israel on the Appomattox,</em> people were often debtors and creditors at the same time. During the periods of inevitable busts, like the Panic of 1819, the intricate system of debt and credit came tumbling down, forcing communities like Staunton to face the tough economic reality of the de-evaluation of their bank notes."],"display_date":"June 15, 1819","search_date":"1819-06-15","locations":[{"id":13634,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3512,"title":"Blackburn&#39;s Emancipation\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-03-02","end_date":"1835-03-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["General Samuel Blackburn, a lawyer, general in the militia, prominent and popular resident of Augusta County, died on March 2, 1835.

Their trip was paid by his estate. No mention is made if the slaves reached Liberia, or if his wife, who survived him by five years, liberated the enslaved peoples immediately following his death.

In December of 1831, a petition with the signatures of 28 Augusta men was sent to the Virginia Legislature asking for their support of United States Constitutional amendment which would give the United States Congress the ability to raise and appropriate money to transport free persons of color to the coast of Africa, and also, the power to purchase slaves then transport them likewise."," A belief in slavery was anything but static in the white South. Rather, opinions on thepeculiar institution varied widely. Melvin Ely's <em>Israel on the Appamattox</em>, recounts how slaves from Prince Edward County, Virginia, are set free, given land, and co-exist relatively peacefully with their white neighbors for over forty years. Yet Ely also notes that Blackburn's response, Colonization, was not uncommon among whites with qualms about slavery, although informal surveys taken just after Nat Turner's revolt seemed to show that much of Virginia's enslaved black population had little desire to move from their birthplace to Africa.

According to the Encyclopedia of the South, at the end of the Civil War West Virginia was an undeveloped and rural state with a population of only about 400,000, or about one-third that of contemporary Virginia. In part to attempt to counteract this imbalance, as well as take advantage of the ongoing influx of immigrants into the United States who were moving west, J.H. Diss Debar, the State Commissioner of Immigration for West Virginia, wrote a short book. The book promoted the benefits of moving west and its author hoped to secure for it the attention and confidence of that class of honest and enterprising workers in both hemispheres, whom we are most anxious to welcome as permanent settlers to our infant state. He then proceeded to write a most complimentary compendium of West Virginia and its many assets. Debar's description of West Virginia's assets attempted to take advantage of America's rapidly expanding population, as well as its growing economic prosperity.","West Virginia was, and still is, one of the most rural states in America. Its decision to separate itself from Virginia was related, in part, to the remote and hostile nature of its geography. Slavery, though present in western Virginia, was never as prevalent as it was in the eastern half of the state. The Appalachian Mountains that cover most of the state prevented the establishment of large plantations. The lack of a viable cash crop also reduced the necessity of slavery in the area. Plus, the settlers that had moved to West Virginia prior to the Civil War tended not to be the most industrious of men. As Debar so generously put it, The genuine West Virginian is not much addicted to precipitous motion, rarely loses his temper or self-possession, and beyond the acquisition of the necessities of life, limited by almost Spartan frugality, is disposed to leave the improvement of things around him to time and chance. ","The migration of settlers to the South came to a halt during the Civil War, but picked up speed with the advent of Reconstruction. The main patterns however, usually involved movement north into the more industrialized sectors of the country. West Virginia had benefited from a small oil boom during the mid-1860s which foreshadowed the coal mining and industries that soon became a large part of the new state's identity. The industrial revolution was just beginning in the South in 1870, but, West Virginia's economy had collapsed into mostly subsistence farming around the same time. Thus, though the large coal deposits under the Appalachian Plateau were a draw for the large mining companies that flocked to the region, it was the cheap labor provided by the poverty-stricken West Virginians that provided the strongest reason for the companies to invest in the area. The optimism exhibited in The West Virginia Handbook belies the generally poor conditions of most inhabitants of the state at that time. Though a burgeoning economy would sweep most of the nation into new prosperity, West Virginia would remain one of the poorest and less developed states in America."],"display_date":1870,"search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":14858,"lat":39.2111004793,"lng":-81.5150237232,"zoom":9,"place":"WOOD, West Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3529,"title":"Slave Sale Comes in Many Forms\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-05-20","end_date":"1836-05-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["ohn Stapleton, an English attorney, handled the affairs of several Charleston properties included in the estate of Mrs. Hannah Bull. He managed the sale of her slaves, cattle, hogs, sheep and other effects of Mrs. Bull's properties after her death. In a letter to Higham, Fife & Co. dated May 20, 1836, Stapleton detailed the sale of several slaves and included the titles. As the attorney, the money realized from the purchases was received through Bills of Exchange.","In 1836, the sale of slaves was increasing as the need for their labor moved farther and farther south. South Carolina was at an economic standstill; at the time of this letter, Charleston was about as anti-entrepreneurial as it could become. South Carolina's rice culture was in decline, and cotton farms were appearing all over the Deep South. Therefore, many slaves found themselves sold to outlying plantations and other states at a very fast rate. According to Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul</em> it was necessary for South Carolinians to obtain legal assistance when attempting to sell their slaves, just as Mrs. Bull did. In addition, Mr. Stapleton sold her slaves by private bargaining rather than in a huge slave market. Although popular image dictates slaves were sold in large venues, often there was a lot of behind-the-scenes private bargaining that took place, as it did with this sale. Johnson notes that even though much of the slave trade remained rural and personal like this sale, there were increasing opportunities during this time for trade in large, urban centers, such as New Orleans, Louisiana. ","Selling her slaves through her lawyer may have been one of the least cruel ways Mrs. Bull knew to convey them. Allowing her estate to be liquidated rather than sold through an attorney would have almost guaranteed cruel treatment in slave market, as seen in Johnson's book. Perhaps she was attempting to portray the role of the benevolent slave holder, like so many other South Carolina slave holders did before the Civil War in order to shed a more positive light on the institution of slavery."],"display_date":"May 20, 1836","search_date":"1836-05-20","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3531,"title":"The Great Fire of Charleston and its Cultural Awakening\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-04-27","end_date":"1838-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 27, 1838, an enormous fire broke out in Charleston, South Carolina, around 9:00 pm. It raged until noon the next day, damaging over 1,000 buildings. It ruined many businesses, a new hotel, several churches, a new theater, and the entire market except for the fish section. Many houses were burnt to the ground. In efforts to put the fire out, all the water in the city pumps was used. In addition, several people died in the flames. Most famously, Charleston's Trinity Church was burned. Another important building that fell victim was the new hotel that had been recently built. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. The fire rendered penniless many who were wealthy. The total monetary loss amounted to about 3,000,000, a sum even more significant in nineteenth century Charleston than today. ","A newspaper article mentioned that several slaves died in the fire, but declined to name them, unlike the many white victims who were named. This reflected the social hierarchy. A long obituary was even given for Colonel Charles John Steedman, a Naval Officer stationed in Charleston, on account of his exemplary citizenship both before and during the fire. Additionally, several prominent store owners are listed as having died attempting to save their stores. Ironically, the fire did not cause Charleston's demise. Rather, it caused a great cultural awakening as many homes and business were rebuilt or repaired. ","The Great Fire of 1838 had a far-reaching impact on the city of Charleston. In many ways, it helped to put Charleston on the map as a great cultural and architectural center. Although previous to the fire only a few homes were styled in the Greek Revival, many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued and made Charleston one of the foremost places to view Greek Revival architecture. The Gothic Revival also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion. This may have also represented an effort to portray the slaveholders who were attending these churches are benevolent, Christian men and women. Gothic was not used for state buildings, however, as James Patrick confirms in his article Ecclesiological Gothic in the Antebellum South. In addition to being used for religious buildings in Charleston, the use of the Gothic, according to Patrick, reflected an attempt to portray Southern locales such as Charleston in the most romantic light possible. Southerners were fighting to keep their culture alive, especially in state like South Carolina, where there was constantly talk of nullification and states rights after the Nullification Crisis. All in all, the art and architecture of Charleston had great implications for a city rebuilt after a horrific fire."],"display_date":"April 27, 1838","search_date":"1838-04-27","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3532,"title":"Charleston Women Discuss Support of States Rights\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-01-07","end_date":"1833-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Women like Laura Margaret Cole Smith of South Carolina were not blind to the implications of politics for the Union as a whole. Upon receiving news of the 1832 Nullification Crisis, Laura wrote to her cousin Camille explaining her opinions on the state of the Union. Smith held steadfastly to her belief in South Carolina's states rights. Although the prospect of war saddened her because her father and brothers would have to fight, she believed that it was important for South Carolina to preserve its liberty instead of conceding to the Union. South Carolina was discussing war and succession far before states like Virginia.","The Nullification Crisis was not the first time that the slavery/anti-slavery debate had threatened American political stability. In signing the Tariff Act of 1832, President Andrew Jackson pushed a previous tariff struggle that had been brewing between South Carolina and the federal government to a climax. Tariffs previously established in 1828 had been deemed by South Carolinians unconstitutional because they taxed imported goods, which were popular in the states, more heavily than those made in the North. In the view of many South Carolina planters, the North was being favored by this tariff, and the economic problems of the Carolina rice culture were being ignored. In addition, they saw themselves as unnecessarily persecuted because South Carolina was a slave state. Jackson signed a new Tariff Act in 1832 that lowered the tax somewhat; however, South Carolinians had hoped he would do away with the law all together. In November 1832, the South Carolina assembly came together in a special session to declare the tariffs null and void in South Carolina. It became a struggle of states rights versus federal rights, now known as the Nullification Crisis. ","Letters like Smith's of January 1833 also show that Southern women before the Civil War were required to be involved enough in political affairs to be able to support their husband's or father's political opinions. Their opinions were usually congruent with that of the male members of the families. Sally G. McMillen confirms that women were expected to have the same views as the men in their families in her article Women in the Old South. Interestingly, in Harry L. Watson's long description of the Nullification Crisis in his book Liberty and Power, he does not even allude to women being involved in the political front at all, because, quite frankly, they were not. Although women could discuss politics and support the opinions of their families' males, they did not have a say in politics and were not allowed to vote, showing that women were expected to fulfill the traditional female role of family caregiver. Laura addressed her father and brother in the beginning of the letter; they were absent from the home, and she wished for their return, showing how much she cared for them. Speculation leads us to the conclusion that they were dealing with the nullification crisis in a political context. In addition, she commented that she had discussed the issue of nullification in private with the gentlemen in her life; they were grateful for her support."],"display_date":"January 7, 1833","search_date":"1833-01-07","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3533,"title":"Massachusetts Judge Driven from South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-11-01","end_date":"1844-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The people of Charleston were not above standing up for what they believed in, even at the expense appearing rude and overzealous. Judge Samuel Hoar of Concord, Massachusetts, and his daughter, Elizabeth, traveled to Charleston in November of 1844. Their intentions were not known when the trip was announced; however, soon after they arrived, it became clear that the Massachusetts judge had come to Charleston to assist the state of Massachusetts' citizens in dealing with South Carolina law. Free black sailors from the Northern state were attempting to load cotton onto Massachusetts' ships. However, those were soon impounded, and the captains were forced to pay a ransom or the African Americans on board would be sold into slavery. South Carolinians did not feel that Massachusetts had any business meddling in their affairs. In a resolution passed by the South Carolina state legislature, they called Judge Hoar an emissary of foreign government, even though South Carolina was still part of the Union at this time. In addition, the resolution declared that even free blacks are not citizens of the United States under the Constitution. It also called for Judge Hoar's immediate expulsion from the city. ","It was rumored that Hoar and his daughter left the city on account of actual mob violence. However, the apparent truth was that they left the city after being asked to leave to avoid violence. Although Hoar was not backing down on the issue, he was also not attempting to have physical harm done to him by what seemed to him as some unsavory Charlestonians. ","At the heart of this issue are South Carolina's unwavering commitment to slavery and its loyalty to secessionism. Additionally, Hoar's experience was perhaps all a misconception and misunderstanding, as many Northern visits to the South were. However, by the time of the 1840s, even free blacks who resided in Charleston were in a precarious situation. Many were not legally emancipated, but had found ways to circumvent the law. Although they were often respected as contributing members of the economic totem pole, they had to tread carefully in order not to make the white elite of the city angry. For the Charleston free blacks, their freedom was only determined by how kind the white members of society felt, since they were not actually free. This is supported by Bernard Powers in his book <em>Black Charlestonians</em>. While he acknowledges the great accomplishments of free blacks in antebellum Charleston, evidence greatly supports that their successes were always at the hands of the elite lawmaking white. No wonder outsider free blacks who had no personal ties to the city were taken hostage. In addition to the fact that they were not legally emancipated, by 1850, free blacks were competing with an immigrant population for jobs. Their whole life situation was always at the hands of others. Unfortunately, this particular incident involving Jude Hoar ended quite badly and was eventually a detrimental blow to South Carolina's willingness to stay in the Union."],"display_date":"November 1844","search_date":"1844-11-15","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3539,"title":"Mississippi Congressman Calls for the Annexation of Texas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-02-20","end_date":"1845-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1845, the national debate over the annexation of the young country of Texas into the Union was in full swing.  Politicians stood on either side of the debate, effectively representing their constituents in the matter.  John Henderson, a Congressman from Mississippi, gave a speech to Congress on February 20, 1845, in which he outlined all of the reasons why the Union should annex Texas.  As Congress waited for his speech, Henderson prepared to explain why the addition of Texas would be in the best interest of the country, as well as his constituents. The motives Henderson gave Congress in support of his opinion were very diplomatic in nature, and effectively called on the language of the Constitution.  The underlying reasons, however, represent his attention to Mississippi in his decisions.  Frederick Merk outlined these reasons in his article A Safety Valve Thesis and Texan Annexation, which was published in <em>The Mississippi Valley Historical Review</em>.  Merk said that northern abolitionists, such as Benjamin Lundy, maintained that the entire process of migration, defiance of Mexican law, and revolution, had been a southern conspiracy to extend the area of slavery.  This extremist view shows the contrast between the North and South in relation to the annexation of Texas.  As Merk stated, Henderson wished to obtain more land for his constituents, as well as have complete control of the Mississippi Valley.     Henderson wanted to represent his constituents well, which meant that he should help them achieve more land to expand and develop into farms and plantations.  There was plenty of land in Texas, and the people from Mississippi were very eager to exploit it for personal profit, which so happened to involve the spread of slavery west of Louisiana.

Colonel Edward Lloyd of Virginia had one such vision that he would operate a plantation in Mississippi from Virginia, and its sole purpose would be for monetary gain.  After deciding on his plan, and acquiring the land in Mississippi, he appointed John Hargon to be the overseer on the plantation in Lloyd's absence.  This was not uncommon, and most people made money from such a venture.      Given the nature of the business, though, there will undoubtedly be problems with the plantation.  Hargon dated one letter to Lloyd as October 24, 1850.  There was a problem with the shipment of cotton from the plantation on the Pearl River, which runs through Yazoo County in central Mississippi.  Hargon said that the Freight are 125 c/bale   and only one boat which carry about 400 bale makes a trip once a week when they receive 500 bales a day.  Lloyd faces a predicament that was not unique to his situation.  He put a plantation in an underdeveloped area of Mississippi, and now he cannot ship his cotton to the market. ","At the same time, Hargon was forced to work harder for profits.  Stanley Engerman illustrates the pressure for plantation overseers to reap higher and higher profits.  Lloyd wanted to get the biggest profit for his investment, which forced Hargon to use fresh, undeveloped soil. This soil was farther away from the established commerce routes, and so leads to the predicament in which Hargon found himself.

The greater production is not immediately met with greater transportation capacity, especially in areas that are not near a railroad.

Edward Scott had offered his land to build the first courthouse, in the hopes that commerce would develop nearby and increase the value of his large patent. The proximity of the site to a section of the James River especially conducive to crossing aided this stratagem. In the coming decades Scott's Landing developed into the most important port upstream of Richmond. Various Scotts and nearby merchants tried for years to incorporate the settlement as an official town, but none were successful until John III, in 1818; the town was called Scottsville, and contained dozens of lots on land donated by John. In the following two years the town was party to other favorable developments. The founding of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville promised to bring large shipments of building supplies through Scottsville's warehouses. In the 1810s the state government chartered two stock companies that enabled Scottsville to act as a hub of transportation: one to build a toll road from Staunton, one to improve canals along the James up from Richmond. In spite of these promising developments, John Scott, by fall of 1821, began auctioning off his estate. He described it as the most valuable real estate in Virginia Containing about 15 Hundred Acres. Four hundred of which are Low Grounds, Inferior to none on the stream. He sold the estate at public auction on the premises, emphasizing the 'high state of cultivation' [and] Elegant Building, also offering the stock and crops of the estate, plus a valuable tract of woodland. Curiously, Scott only managed to sell part of this magnificent estate in 1821, and had to hold another auction in 1822.","In the advertisement for his auction, Scott declared that he was intending to remove to the South. Though born in Albemarle, Scott had already lived in the South some years, practicing medicine in Alabama. Like thousands of Virginians, he may have gone down South in the years following the War of 1812, to make a life in one of the new towns that cropped up all over the territory acquired from the post-war Indian treaties. Scott probably only returned east when he inherited the Scottsville estate upon his grandfather's death. Upon receiving his inheritance, he may have discovered himself unaccustomed to estate operation, and wished to return to his medical practice. Another possibility is that the general economic atmosphere discouraged him from focusing his life on the estate. Although the factors mentioned above aided the economy in Scottsville, the overall Virginia economy had been sluggish ever since the national Panic of 1819. It could simply be that when Scott was down South he met a nice southern belle. Well-to-do families from throughout the slave states maintained complex networks of society and marriage over long distances."],"display_date":"1818 - 1822","search_date":"1820-07-01","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3574,"title":"Another Train Wreck\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-04-30","end_date":"1890-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Rather than going to bed early Sunday night after a long day of church and family time, the city of Staunton spent the evening putting out a fire, only to then have a serious train wreck in the early hours of Monday, April 28, 1890. The No. 2 train on the C&O line from Cincinnati had cars derail after losing air power to the brakes. The train picked up even more speed because there is a descent into the Staunton station. Along with the increased speed, the engineer had to maneuver the train along the curves of the rail. The engineer managed to prevent the whole train from jumping track and saved many lives. The derailed sleeper car caused the most damage by destroying the 6-inch iron columns lining the platform. As this was a night train, there were many people sleeping in this car and they suffered the most injuries. The wreck caused the death of a young girl of the Pearl of Pekin Company, a Dramatic Corps. Her body, on which there was the silver cross of the King's Daughters Organization, was taken to a local funeral home and prepared for the journey to Jackson County, Missouri. The other townspeople took the injured to two residences and the Virginia Hotel. "," This article was not the front-page headline of the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>of Augusta County. Instead, it ran as the longest column under the headline A Night Horror on the second page with mostly local events. Oddly, the news writer did not comment about the lack of a hospital. A group of local women, the King's Daughters Organization, did note this absence and started a campaign to build the first hospital in Staunton. "," This one train wreck illumines so many new themes of life in the 1890's. There is the strong danger of railroads. From 1890 to 1900, there were over 6,000 accidents involving mail-carrying trains and the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>listed train accidents and wrecks frequently. Alfred D. Chandler has explained how railroads drastically changed life in the United States. Small Staunton connected to greater America and her almost 200,000 miles of operating line in a way that horses and boats never could have. These railroad connections created opportunities for the citizens. The trains delivered mail demonstrably faster and more efficiently, and kept people who moved (increasingly because of trains) connected. There were new economic opportunities for builders, operators, and those who wanted to sell products to other cities. The grain of Staunton had a new market that enabled farmers to produce and sell more than ever. Railroads also represented the possibility of mobility. People could travel and see cities the average person twenty years before never would have and people could simply travel quicker. The girl who died originally had been a telegraph operator, another important development of the nineteenth century. The young girl imagined a greater life for herself and railroads provided the means of pursuit. She left a steady job in the Midwest and moved to New York City to become a star, as so many people continue to do so today. This one newspaper article intimated to its readers that Staunton was not just a dot on the map.

Randolph concerning the relocation of his, to that point, profitable business. At the time of this particular correspondence, George was in Richmond, Virginia and he was writing back home to Buckingham County, where Benjamin had established himself as a prudent physician and a prosperous community member. This exchange between George and his brother underscores the complexities and anxieties that a nineteenth-century businessman endured on a daily basis, placing particular emphasis on the relationship between creditors and debtors and the complications of relocation.","Benjamin loaned his brother three hundred dollars, no small sum in the 1850s, so that George would have any easier time appeasing his creditors in anticipation of the rearrangement of his business. Because of Benjamin's generosity, George was able to pay his partners fifty more dollars than he had originally bargained for, a beneficent act he stated he was particularly glad to do as [his creditors] have been liberal and gentlemanly in their conduct. One of the most important issues George dealt with before moving south was the financial status of his farm; the balance of the letter takes up the savvy entrepreneur's ruminations over percentages and dollar amounts that he considered in order to best allocate his private assets and reap the greatest benefit from his financial relationships. According to George, things went very well in his latest meeting with his business partners and he assures his brother that his new connections promise to be pleasant and profitable. Finally, despite his previous assertions of his financial wellbeing, George admitted that he may need to avail himself of a man he calls brother Jeff and accept his offer of assistance to the extent of a couple hundred dollars.","In his letter to his brother, George Wythe Randolph typifies an up-and-coming southern businessman. Bright and industrious, George was eager to succeed in his endeavor to sell his farm and move south, perhaps in an effort to capitalize on the economic explosion of cotton that supplanted the tobacco industry of Virginia and the Carolinas. Despite the bountiful opportunity available in the booming industry, moving from one location to another carried with it great risks. George was fortunate in that he was able to establish amicable ties with his peers and create good business relationships, but relocation necessitated uprooting oneself from established social networks in the form of valuable connections that may or may not be renewed. Additionally, George's dealings with other relatively wealthy men illustrate one of the spheres of relationships between men in the South; this type of horizontal, commercially driven interaction was generally limited to white, propertied men with sufficient income to live beyond the level of subsistence, though in a few very rare circumstances free blacks were able to rise to the same level of financial independence."],"display_date":"November 5, 1851","search_date":"1851-11-05","locations":[{"id":13690,"lat":37.5722194747,"lng":-78.5287114945,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3579,"title":"Yellow Fever Hits Florida\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-01-01","end_date":"1889-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Long before the Internet, cable, and airplanes, a global market was emerging. Civilized countries recognized the need of foreign trade to compete in this new arena. Foreign trade required the participation of everyone from government leaders to common citizens. A Florida resident, Cecil H. Alleyne expressed his concern over a Yellow Fever breakout and its effects on the world market. In his letter to the London Times in 1886 Alleyne describes the gravity of the disease in Jacksonville, Florida. ","Without health care systems or emergency rooms, Florida tried to deal with a Yellow Fever epidemic in the late nineteenth century. Subsequently, the disease ravaged parts of Florida including Key West, Manatee, Tampa, and Plant City. In Jacksonville alone by 1888 the disease had claimed 427 lives out of 4,656 reported cases. To try and tame the disease several cities set huge fires of pine and tar in an effort to cleanse contaminated areas. The Jacksonville Sanitary Association managed to raise 350,000 to fight the disease. At every level of government, Florida tried to control Yellow Fever from spreading. The mayor of Jacksonville quarantined areas in an effort to limit the outbreak of disease. Alleyne believed the quarantine and relief efforts that Florida put into effect successfully restricted the disease. One of the more radical approaches against the disease came in 1889 by Florida governor Francis P. Fleming. Fleming pushed for the creation of a state health board to regulate health problems and fight the yellow fever outbreak. Consequently, a new state constitution was created in 1887 putting Fleming's suggestions into legislation.","Alleyne's letter to the London Times Editor connects Florida to England in the world trade market. Alleyne felt that an outbreak of Yellow Fever was important enough to write the leading newspaper in London, illustrating the dependence of both parties for each other's imports and exports. In addition, Alleyne was able to paint a picture of how difficult life on the frontier was in the nineteenth century. Seminole attacks, outbreaks of disease, and aggressive Spanish inhabitants were everyday threats that Florida citizens had to cope with. Nevertheless, the outbreak of Yellow Fever in Florida produced a new state constitution and the creation of the Florida State Health Board.

In a large a state as Florida, transportation posed a serious problem in the late nineteenth century. However, politicians felt that railroads were a priority since Florida is a peninsula. More than 300 miles of land also created a challenge to connect the Atlantic Ocean and trade from Europe to prosperous ports on the gulf side of Florida, like New Orleans. ","Politicians threw around the idea at the turn of the century of the possibility of a canal through the narrowest part of Florida. Feeding the frenzy of the idea of a Florida Ship Canal was the success of the ship building industries in Florida. St. Augustine would serve as the key link for the canal, which shows the importance of this coastal town during this time period. Ultimately, a stagnate economy prevented Florida from investing millions of dollars in a canal. Then after the influx of settlers to the state during the early part of the twentieth century, the idea was pushed to the back burner and considered a moot point. The Florida Ship Canal experiment presented an exciting idea of linking the Gulf of Mexico directly to the Atlantic Ocean. Nevertheless, a canal through Florida would have been difficult for railroads to overcome, which served as the primary choice of transportation through the twentieth century for Americans.

The apprehension of an uncertain economy left many citizens feeling insecure about their assets that they had just started to recover after the Civil War only forty years prior. Many people flocked to Florida after the civil war and there was little work to be found outside of the fruit trade.

In his personal letter to his friends and relatives back home in Alabama Bailey describes a business transaction in which he was trying to decide between a bond for title or a mortgage. This description shows the lack of bank involvement with citizens on personal transactions. It is hard to imagine writing a check for a piece of gum now without a paper trail to a bank, let alone depending on someone for documentation of your property. In addition, Bailey goes on to describe life in Florida in 1885 with trips to Augusta, highlighting the freedom of mobility created by the new railroads. And who could write a letter on Florida without commenting on the warm sunshine and delicious watermelon, both bountiful in Florida? Mr. Bailey showcases the appeals of Florida during this time period after Reconstruction and illustrates why people flocked to see this frontier of America. ","A bitter battle of Reconstruction brought an idle economy and uncertainty about the future. However, Florida Democrat William D.

Three young women received diplomas in Music, but four young women received diplomas in Book-keeping, an economically and domestically practical education. Baldwin had been a pupil at the school and her tenure as principal led to the name change to Mary Baldwin College, also reflecting the more public role of women as leaders in education in the second half of the nineteenth century and fulfilling Beecher's desire.

Carpenter watched all the members of Congress as they descended upon Washington in preparation for the upcoming session. With them appeared lobbyists galore, bureaucrats too many to number and Washingtonians coming from the woodwork with something to sell to the incoming crowds. The city was booming; boarders and hotel owners were tidying and revitalizing their accommodations in order to attract customers, private individuals were opening their homes to newcomers to make a dollar or perhaps a companion, and prices were steadily increasing. Interestingly, visitors self-segregated somewhat based on the region they came from when it came to finding lodging and a social scene during session. There was everything from quiet, demure hotels for politicians who wished to be close to the White House to more raucous, lively hotels where you might find Congressmen bantering the night away. Frank knew where he could find someone in D.C. when Congress was in session. ","This session was marked with particular excitement for two reasons. First, the Democrats had become the majority party in the House of Representatives; second, the national election was right around the corner so Congressmen and aspiring politicians were already hard at work, campaigning for their very near futures. Frank was thrilled to be in the capital at a time like this one. ","Frank G. Carpenter was an author during the 19th century who traveled and wrote commentary pieces on life and society around the world. What he saw in 1882 in Washington D.C. is quite revealing about the dynamic between the city and the Congressmen, as well as between the Congressmen, and other visitors, themselves. Naturally, the city took complete advantage of Congress being in session every year. The influx meant more business, more money, more intrigue - more everything. Between the visitors and between the Congressmen it was very interesting that party lines were very much a function of geographic origin, and even more so, were very segregating. This polarization Carpenter witnessed supports a piece of historian Vincent P. De Santis' view of the political scene at the time, which involved the proliferation of Independent politicians as the parties strengthened.

The candidate that seemed to care the most about the people of the county, especially the farmers was A.G. Carter.  He had been the Senator here for twelve years so if he anything he had the experience to make the best politician.  He promised to not burden people with taxes anymore and to vote for a Senator who will have the best interest of the people and county at heart. Carter seemed so honest and straightforward-the way people in North Carolina want to be represented, and he promised to vote for the good, old traditional Republican doctrines. Carter also claimed in his letter that people needed to fight the annexation of Texas, and reclaim this as American land by negotiating a Treaty with Spain.  Texas was a large piece of territory for our people to settle and this could mean a stronger country.  Carter spoke for common folks, announcing that he would work for the best prices and not let politicians deceive people into paying high prices for cheap goods.  Carter appealed to parental concerns by reminding voters of how defective the education system had become; apparently the people of Rowan are not getting the large amount of money that went into a fund for the state to use on education, and if that money went to the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad Co.  citizens would have to pay taxes directly on it.  This didn't seem fair to the people of North Carolina, especially the children who needed opportunities for education in order to get better jobs, and the railroad certainly didn't provide jobs for all the people of North Carolina. Carter said that there was too much legislation instead of too little, and a lot of people agreed judging by the reactions in his letter published in the daily paper. ","Railroad companies and education competed for state funding.  Although many citizens of North Carolina were still self employed, agriculture being the dominant economy of the South, there was an influx of funding from Southern states into their technological and industrial advances in order to keep up with Northern urban economies.  This is consistent with the views of William Cooper and Thomas Terrill, historians who claimed that significant growth in the later antebellum periods, spurred by the Panic of 1837, severely depressed cotton prices until the mid-1840s, leaving the South considerably underdeveloped in comparison with Northern states.  This was due to resistance from Southern politicians, who garnered support and funding for issues that were intangible for many citizens.

Scott's <em>History of Orange County</em>, the period of time between 1848 and 1860 was relatively serene and well-organized in that particular area of central Virginia. Following the United States' triumphant victory in the Mexican War of 1848, one of Virginia's sons and a decorated hero from the war, General Zachary Taylor, was elected President. The era that began in 1850 is known to historians as an age of industrial and public improvement; the legislature and citizenry of Amherst County, for example, petitioned for the construction of a railroad connection between the cities of Lynchburg and Charlottesville. In 1851, the citizens of Amherst County wrote a petition to the governing body in Richmond arguing the position that the state of Virginia would be well-served if a connecting branch was constructed in their district. Citing the unity, consistency, and harmony that would result from the completion of the railroad, they argued eloquently and persuasively in the three-page memorandum. Their request was granted, and the decision to improve public transportation in central Virginia was not without precedent; in the previous year, a section of the Blue Ridge Turnpike was opened to public travel. The roads were engineered by General William Mahone, a man remembered as one of countless connections and political acumen and commemorated by Scott for his exceptional work on the highways.","Transportation during the mid-nineteenth century was still dominated by horsepower, and the opening of the highways provided an easier, more efficient passage through and around the Blue Ridge Mountains. In addition, the Orange and Alexandria railroad company was given special access to a private lot off the turnpike to construct buildings and operate businesses, a provision that would have increased employment opportunities and drawn a more focused attention at that particular intersection of railway and road. In addition to desiring one grand, systematized improvement, the authors of the Amherst County memorandum cited the increased potential for economic prosperity that would surely follow the construction of the connecting branch.","During the 1850s and 1860s, railroad technology was booming. Building on the advancements of earlier rail-related endeavors, such as the Baltimore and Ohio rail line that was the first to evolve into a major system, the railways of mid-century transported not only material goods but also the promise of economic expansion and proliferation. As the railroad snaked its way through the American South, it brought with it untold benefits of increasing population and the amplified opportunity for financial benefit. The construction and opening of roads like the Fredericksburg and Valley Plank Road and the Blue Ridge Turnpike not only facilitated improved travel in central Virginia but also, through its conciliatory provisions with flourishing railroad companies, opened avenues of future economic gain. Amherst County residents were acutely aware of this and, through a strongly worded petition to Richmond, affected a fortuitous change."],"display_date":"1850 - 1851","search_date":"1850-12-31","locations":[{"id":13622,"lat":37.6048121175,"lng":-79.1451153205,"zoom":9,"place":"AMHERST, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3615,"title":"David Watson Prepares for Battle\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-01","end_date":"1861-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["From December, 1860 to January, 1861 David Watson of Louisa County, Virginia wrote a series of letters back home to his mother. Watson enlisted in the Virginia militia and was writing from several locations, including Charleston, South Carolina at Fort Sumter. Built after the War of 1812 as one of a series of fortifications linking the southeastern coast, Fort Sumter fell on April 13, 1861 to Confederate forces under the command of Brigadier General P.G.T. Beauregard; historically speaking, this battle typically signifies the beginning of the American Civil War. David Watson, however, was writing months before the explosive confrontation in Charleston and the subject matter of his letter details the apprehension over the looming conflict, resilient hope that a peaceful solution could still be achieved, and overwhelming concern for the condition of home life shared by American soldiers who had yet to fall under the polarizing influence of the Civil War. ","In the opening sentences of his letter, Watson gave his mother some bad news; her fears have been realized, he wrote, as her apprehension...with regard to the possibility of [him] having enlisted in the civil war became a certainty. Although he characterized his environment as frenzied and poised for battle, Watson maintained that he and his compatriots [had] not yet quite despaired of a peaceable settlement of the difficulties by the Yankees becoming aware that they [had] nothing on earth to make by attacking us. What is more, the young soldier wrote that the news around the camp indicated that there would be no more Union attempts to reinforce the garrison at Fort Sumter. These efforts to resupply and strengthen the northern presence in Charleston were repeatedly rebuffed by Confederate troops throughout the winter of 1860 and 1861. Lastly, and perhaps most telling of the optimistic mindset of men like David Watson, he expressed his desire to settle up his accounts with his creditors at home. Perceiving the conflict to be only temporary, Watson spoke of account balances and petty debts as if he would be home within the next few weeks to reconcile them personally. ","Before the Battle of Fort Sumter, the event that inextricably defined what were the North and South, men like David Watson held out hope that the conflict would be short-lived. In writing to his mother, Watson expressed his belief that neither side had much to gain from a long, protracted war. His priorities lay at home in Louisa County with his family and his financial wellbeing, evidenced by his anxious desire to balance his accounts and return to his habit of keeping up daily interactions with his business associates. Unforeseen to Watson, the scope of the trifling conflict the central Virginia native mentioned in his letters would expand to an unprecedented level of violent conflict only a few short months into the spring of 1861."],"display_date":"December 1, 1860 - January 30, 1861","search_date":"1860-12-31","locations":[{"id":14012,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3633,"title":"Alligators Protected to Improve Economy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-04-26","end_date":"1890-04-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In April of 1890, the Police Jury of Plaquemines Parish in Louisiana made the decision to prohibit the further killing of alligators. This decision was unfortunate for the fashion industry, as purses, reticules, traveling bags, and footwear were all accessories that could be made out of alligator hide. Apparently, it was fashion's mandate to do so. In Louisiana and Florida, their abundance of alligators added an extra boom in their economy and helped support this fashion craze. However, alligators preyed on muskrats who would eat the crops in the area. The decline of the alligator population led to an increase in the population of muskrats, thus seriously damaging the crops. The Police Jury was so serious about this prohibition that they would fine anyone killing an alligator a penalty of 25 and put them in prison for a month for each offense. Clearly, the ban on killing alligators was not an example of animal rights activism. The banning in Plaquemines was economically and financially motivated.","While this instance could be deemed an early example of animal rights protection, it is much more likely that it is a case of Louisiana protecting its economy. Without their crops, Louisiana, much like many other states of the South, had nothing. Later in the nineteenth century, prices of farm products were consistently low. Poverty was widespread throughout Louisiana's farming population already, and without the alligators there to prey on the muskrats, their crops and income were being hurt even more. Farmers' Alliances were formed to help combat these financial issues. However, at this time, the Democratic Party was dominant in the South, and they essentially stood for white power, while the Farmers' Alliances consisted of mostly black farmers. During 1890, the People's Party was beginning to form, which was supported mainly by farmers in the South. It was similar to the Greenback Labor Party which had formed during the 1880s and opened the door to the concept of populism, which is the appeal to the common person and, likewise, incorporates a sense of working class activism. The Police Jury's response to the alligator situation was in direct correlation with the ideals of the People's Party and populism. The area was much more densely populated with poor farmers, struggling to make enough money to live, than rich people, who would be deeply upset by the absence of alligator purses. Only the wealthier half of the population in the state and the country could afford luxuries such as those. Therefore, the mandate to forbid killing alligators was both necessary and logical. Crops bring in much more money to the states economy than the alligator fashion trend, so sacrificing that fad makes much more sense for the sake of the states' financial well-being."],"display_date":"April 26, 1890","search_date":"1890-04-26","locations":[{"id":5620,"lat":29.1168615299,"lng":-89.3283829847,"zoom":8,"place":"PLAQUEMINES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3634,"title":"Convicts Sent to Work on Plantations\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"12/4/00","end_date":"12/4/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In December of 1900, the Board of Control of the Louisiana State Penitentiary held a meeting in which they decided to set aside two immense plantations in West Feliciana and Iberia Parish for convicts to work. Cotton would be grown on the West Feliciana plantation, while sugar would be grown on the one in Iberia Parish. Approximately five hundred workers were expected to work on these plantations, which is roughly half of the amount of convicts in the state. All of the crops produced from these plantations would end up going to the state, helping to pay for road construction and the like. The program was expected to enact extensive prison reforms after the convict lease system had been abolished.","Convicts working on plantations in Louisiana were characteristic of a productive penalty system that had been taking place in the South for the past 40 years. After the emancipation of slaves in the thirteenth amendment in 1863, farmers, businessmen, and anybody who had used slave labor in their homes needed to find other people to take their place and keep their lives in order. At the same time, many state penitentiaries realized that they could use their prisoners, who were generally black males, to their benefit - having them work for the state. The Convict Lease System, which was put into place throughout the South quickly after slavery had been abolished, was a method of aiding previous slave owners in maintaining their pre-abolition lifestyle and helping the state pay off the cost of prison administration. Farmers and businessmen needed to find replacements for their lacking labor force and convicts were the perfect solution. People using convict labor would then pay the state for their work. This example of convict leasing is especially unique because the state set aside plantations of its own for the prisoners to work, as opposed to leasing them out to private owners. The convict leasing system proved to be very profitable for the government and any business owners who utilized it. Revenues from the program contributed to over 300% of the costs of prison administration. Not only would convicts work on plantations, they would also repair roads, maintain farms, and do other work similar to that of a slave's. However, states slowly phased out of this method of penalty. The system was frequently abused because the convicts, who were mostly African American and male, were readily available and treated inhumanely, similar to the way slaves had been treated before emancipation. Southern states slowly phased out of using this system and it was finally dismantled in 1928."],"display_date":"December 4, 1900","search_date":"1900-12-04","locations":[{"id":5786,"lat":30.8801785658,"lng":-91.420930249,"zoom":9,"place":"WEST FELICIANA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3642,"title":"The Marquis de Lafayette Visits Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-10-19","end_date":"1824-10-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Although a Frenchmen, the Marquis de Lafayette was a man dear to the hearts of many Americans in the early nineteenth century. He led American troops into battle during the Revolution, had sustained a wound at the Battle of Brandywine, and was instrumental in encouraging the participation of the French forces in the siege of Yorktown which led to the surrender of the British in 1781. Lafayette was not the only foreign officer to serve in the Continental Army, but he was revered for his generosity, friendliness, bravery, and genuine love for America, his adopted country. "," It is no wonder then that when in October of 1824 the Marquis, now quite an old man, landed in the city of Norfolk a great reception awaited him. The <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> reported the spectacle awaiting Lafayette upon his landing which included an artillery salute, a triumphal arch erected in his honor, ranks of local militia, the assembled Corporate Societies of the Borough, and large groups of school children including those of the Female Orphan Society. All this made for what the Herald described as a truly animating picture. Additionally, the Herald reported that in the evening the businesses and dwellings of the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth were brilliantly illuminated, the latter municipality lighting 42 bonfires on the shores in honor of the Marquis. Sometime during his stay, a trip across the river to the city of Portsmouth was planned in order that Lafayette might pay a visit to the United States Naval Yard there. Louisa Emmerson, a life-long Portsmouth native wrote that the Trustees of Portsmouth welcomed him to their town, and with military honors conducted him to Crawford Street, where at its intersection with High, a fine triumphal arch had been erected in the General's honor. The arch itself was finely constructed and decorated with American flags, evergreen boughs, and flowers. Mrs. Emmerson wrote that before continuing to the Naval Yard, the procession stopped so that some school children of the city could recite a poem for the distinguished guest. "," Clearly, the Marquis' visit was quite an event for the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth. It certainly was not everyday that a small city was graced with the presence of one of the most venerated heroes of the Revolution, a man that Louisa Emerson described as second only to Washington. For more than a month, the Herald reported on the receptions of the Nation's Guest as he toured the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Richmond, and Williamsburg. Day after day, near full pages of newsprint was spent describing his stay in each city with particular detail. The visit of the Marquis de Lafayette was perhaps the event of a lifetime. Norfolk was only one of many stops on Lafayette's Farewell Tour of America. From 1824 to 1825, Lafayette visited all twenty-four states in the Union. Along the way he was treated to numerous dinners and balls in his honor. He listened to speeches, he attended plays, he visited Revolutionary War veterans, and he laid the cornerstones to several monuments to the American Revolution including the Bunker Hill monument. No expense was spared in celebrating the return of the hero. "," The year 1824 was the perfect moment for Lafayette to make his return. America was experiencing a prosperous and peaceful period in its history. Cities were growing and industry was beginning to develop. The occasion of Lafayette's visit was a chance for the burgeoning American glass, printing, and pottery industries to flex their muscles as they churned out a variety of commemorative items emblazoned with the image of Lafayette. But why was all this attention and money being spent on an aging war hero that was not even a native citizen? Quite simply, Lafayette was one of the last remaining founding fathers. In celebrating Lafayette the man, the people of the United States were not just celebrating the accomplishments of the man but also the American ideals of liberty. Furthermore, the very fact that Lafayette was not a native son endeared him to the American people because he risked his life not to protect his native land, but out of a genuine love for freedom and democracy. Lafayette's visit was a chance for the American people to once again remember the sacrifices of the past and the ultimate triumph of democratic ideals."],"display_date":"October 19, 1824 - October 27, 1824","search_date":"1824-10-23","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3645,"title":"Steamship Lines of Norfolk, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1823-12-11","end_date":"1823-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The American Beacon and Norfolk and Portsmouth Daily Advertiser</em> of Thursday, December 11, 1823 contained two advertisements that concerned a new technology that would greatly change the speed with which Americans traveled their vast continent. Both advertisements concerned the establishment of steamship lines from Norfolk to important cities in the Chesapeake Bay region. The first of the two ads described the services available from the Baltimore Steam Boat Line which operated two ships, the Virginia and the Norfolk. The two ships offered voyages from Norfolk to Baltimore twice a week. The other advertisement of note in the Beacon concerned the weekly voyages of the steamship Potomac. This vessel plied a Chesapeake circuit, beginning in Washington, D.C. and stopping at Alexandria, Virginia before heading south to Norfolk. After stopping in Norfolk, the ship continued up the James River to harbors at City Point and Richmond, Virginia. The whole circuit took exactly one week, but the passenger could choose to ride any portion of it he or she desired, each segment of the trip of costing a different price. The fares ranged from 4 to 11 and included food and drink during the voyage. Although the price may have been a bit steep for the average Norfolk resident, steam travel made the voyage from Washington to Norfolk last only a little over a day.","The 1820s saw the emergence of steamboat travel on the Chesapeake Bay. Although in the early part of the decade, steamboats did little to affect the business of packet ships, they certainly attracted the attention of the citizens of port cities who noted both the curious sight of the little boats with their steam-belching smokestacks as well as the regularity with which the infant steam lines were able to provide services. Steamers such as the Virginia, the Norfolk, and the Potomac constituted this first wave of passenger steamers that began to appear all over the Chesapeake in the first few years of the 1820s. Slowly but surely, stubborn Chesapeake planters also began to realize the value of this mode of transportation that could be depended upon to get their harvests to port within one day in a variety of weather conditions. ","Technological advances like steamship travel and the later advent of rail travel in the 1830s contributed to the emergence of American tourism and the formulation of a distinct American culture. By the 1820s and 1830s, these advancements combined with a growing interest in America's natural attractions and a wealthy population resulted in the growth of American tourism. The construction of turnpikes led to more comfortable and faster stagecoach services, while steamboat travel made water routes both a faster and more reliable option. However, the price of travel in the early nineteenth century often deterred all but the wealthy. "," Tourism also changed how Americans viewed their relationship to the land. The formation of an American culture was greatly tied to American's perceptions of the landscape. Sears writes that from the beginning Americans had sought their identity in their relationship to the land they had settled. In the 1820s and 1830s, tourist attractions helped the young nation cultivate a sense of national culture in a country without the centuries-long traditions of Europe. In essence, tourism provided a means of defining America as a place and taking pride in the special features of its landscape."],"display_date":"December 11, 1823","search_date":"1823-12-11","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3646,"title":"Annual Report of the Norfolk Bible Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-03-07","end_date":"1815-03-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In early 1815, a charitable religious organization in Norfolk, Virginia by the name of the Norfolk Bible Society published its first annual report in the form of a small pamphlet. The pamphlet, which was presented at the annual meeting of the Society remarked upon both the activities of the Society in the past year as well as the Society's plans for the future. The pamphlet stated that the principal duty of the Society was that of procuring Bibles and Testaments and distributing them to the poor. The report stated that the Society had distributed 235 Bibles and 882 Testaments in the prior year. Some of these books were delivered to the poor of Norfolk, but others were delivered to the neighboring counties of Princess Anne, Nansemond, York, Elizabeth City, and even as far away as Matthews and across the Chesapeake Bay in Northampton. Donations were also made to the children under the care of the Norfolk Female Charitable Society and to the crew of the famous Navy vessel the <em>U.S.S. Constellation</em>. Finally, the Society made monetary donations, both to The Bible Society of Virginia and the Bible Society of New York for the printing of a French language edition to be donated to the poor inhabitants of Louisiana and Canada. The Norfolk Bible Society also listed future goals in its first annual report. The chief among these was the establishment of free schools for the poor. The Bible Society recognized that the poor, the objects of [their] charity, [were] often illiterate, and it [was] quite absurd to give them books which they [could not] read."," The beginnings of American mass media culture lay in the efforts of Bible Societies and religious Tract Societies that sprung up all over the country around 1800.

These groups strove to put their printed religious materials in the hands of as many people as possible. The activities of these groups coincided with and served to drive the explosion of the American printing industry in the early nineteenth century. Small printing shops soon became ubiquitous while urban printing companies grew into truly massive industries that were intimately connected to religion. Early nineteenth century improvements in transportation combined with an increased access to capital brought on by the economic prosperity of the era allowed Tract and Bible Societies to reach a national audience. The distribution of religious texts was seen as a means of combating the problems of illiteracy and heathenism amongst the local poor and those living on the geographic margins of the United States."],"display_date":"March 7, 1815","search_date":"1815-03-07","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3647,"title":"The Portsmouth Fire of 1821\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-03-21","end_date":"1821-03-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At around 2:45 a.m. on the morning of Wed., March 21, 1821, a fire broke out in the kitchen of a vacant tenement on the corner of Main and Market Streets in Portsmouth, Virginia. The <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> of Friday, March 23 reported that owing to the violence of the wind, which was blowing at the time a perfect gale from S. S. W., and the combustible nature of the buildings, the fire spread with uncontrollable rapidity to the market house and adjacent houses. After the fire had burned out, it was discovered that 30 to 40 homes and tenements had been totally destroyed by the blaze. This loss constituted a large portion of the small city."," Louisa Emmerson, a resident of Portsmouth at the time, included in her memoirs a description of the destruction. She wrote that most of the east side of Crawford Street was destroyed as well as portions of Queen and Water Streets. Ms. Emmerson surmised that the reason the west side of Crawford Street was spared was due to its width of one hundred feet, while the flames were able to leap across narrower streets such as Queen which had a width of only thirty feet. In addition to the destroyed buildings mentioned in the Herald, Ms. Emmerson wrote that the fire was also able to destroy three ships moored at the Portsmouth docks."," Both Emmerson and the Herald lauded the performance of the Norfolk fire companies and the U.S. Navy fire company for their quick response to the scene of the inferno. The timely response of the firefighters served to check the extension of the inferno and prevented the fire from spreading to the opposite sides of Market and Main Streets, thus saving the citizens of the city from any further damage. Finally, the Herald article speculated that the fire may have been the work of an arsonist, considering that the building in which it originated was uninhabited and the fact that only a few days prior an attempt had been made by some dark-plotting villain to fire the town in another direction by means of a bundle of matches and other combustibles wrapped around an iron spike the sharp point of which was driven into the weather-boarding of a small frame house-the fire was just communicating to the shingles of the roof when it was providentially discovered and extinguished."," In the days before electricity and oil or gas heat, fire was a constant household danger. A soot-filled chimney was a dangerous fire hazard, not to mention the open flames of oil lamps and candles. Additionally, all houses of the time were often built almost completely out of wood or with wooden interiors and brick outer shells. Quite simply, a person's house was a veritable tinderbox waiting to be consumed in a raging inferno. Not surprisingly, newspapers of the day, like the <em>Herald</em>, contained advertisements for so-called fire-proof brick dwellings, like the two-story Fire-proof brick tenement listed for sale in the November 10, 1819 edition. However fire-proof buildings were not the only fire-related advancements in the early nineteenth century. The fire insurance industry also sprang up in the wake of the rapid urbanization and industrialization that characterized the period."," It is interesting to note the influence that fire companies had in controlling the Portsmouth blaze and preventing its further spread. Like the population and economy of the United States, the number of municipal fire departments grew in the early nineteenth century. With the addition of new technologies and better equipment, these fire companies began to increase the effectiveness with which they fought fires. Inventors began to make careers out of designing all sorts of fire equipment from hoses, ladders, and clothing to pumps and engines that could propel water distances of 180 feet. The early nineteenth century also saw the birth of a nationwide fire department tradition that has been maintained to this day: the fireman's parade. A parade was a way for the citizens to honor the fire departments who had done so much for their community as well as a way for the department to show off their equipment and manpower. In an era where structure fires had the potential to level entire cities, a good fire company was invaluable to the community."],"display_date":"March 21, 1821","search_date":"1821-03-21","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3650,"title":"A Request from the American Colonization Society \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-07-07","end_date":"1820-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 7, 1820, the American Colonization Society took out an advertisement in the <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em>. The ad, which was actually more of an announcement, concerned the need for equipment, tools, food, and other supplies by the colonists whom the Society sponsored. These colonists were free African Americans who had volunteered to set up a black colony on the west coast of the African continent. The advertisement announced that the endeavor was so far a success and that there was no doubt that the colonists would establish a permanent settlement. However, the colonists still needed various supplies including tobacco, iron, tar, pitch, nails, medicines, flour, axes, hoes, and other various tools which the Society hoped would in part be supplied by the generous donations of Americans like the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth."," But why would white Southerners be willing to donate these sorts of item to blacks free of charge? What would make the American Colonization Society believe that they would easily receive donations from slaveholding whites? The answer is simple. Southern whites believed that a society where free blacks and whites coexisted peacefully was an impossibility due to the perceived inferiority of the black race. Therefore, the solution to this 'problem' was the colonization of the African continent by the free blacks of the United States. Thomas Jefferson himself believed that the most sensible plan for emancipation included a requirement for colonization. Furthermore, Jefferson believed the national government should bear the responsibility of financing the reversed black population flow. However, this idea seemed threatening to slave states whose entire economy was based on the forced labor of blacks. The 1820s and 1830s saw the greatest push for colonization and although the American Colonization Society succeeded in establishing colonies in Africa, the United States never adopted the program of full scale colonization because the great expense and the possibility of Southern secession if such a plan was carried out."],"display_date":"July 7, 1820","search_date":"1820-07-07","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3651,"title":"Improvements to the Dismal Swamp Canal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-11-17","end_date":"1819-11-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 17, 1819, the Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald rejoiced in reporting the news that the new and improved Dismal Swamp Canal was nearing completion and was soon to be ready for traffic. The Canal was undergoing a process of deepening and widening so that it could accommodate the traffic of larger vessels. To the Herald, the traffic on the Dismal Swamp Canal was the lifeblood of the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth, to whom their very existence depended. The improvements to the Canal were slowed by winter weather and heavy late summer rains, but by November the Canal was once again filled with Boats incessantly passing and repassing, laden with the produce of the country, or with foreign merchandize, present[ing] a continued scene of industry and activity as far as the eye can reach, and impress[ing] the mind of the beholder with a clear conception of the importance of this great commercial thoroughfare.","The Dismal Swamp is a great expanse of soggy land comprising over 100,000 acres in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Though early settlers realized the land was practically useless for farming, it was bestowed with another valuable resource: timber. Following the Revolutionary War, General George Washington formed the Dismal Swamp Company with the intention of digging a canal into the interior of the swamp so that this resource could be better utilized. The canal he constructed was a small one and it became to be known as Washington's Ditch. Later, Washington's Canal was replaced by wider and deeper waterways. The canal was important to the economy of the region because of the timber it transported out of the swamp as well as the produce that traveled through the swamp from North Carolina on its way to Norfolk and Suffolk, Virginia. The goods that were transported on the Dismal Swamp Canal were vital to the economy of eastern North Carolina and eastern Virginia.","The 1820s saw an explosion of canal building in the United States of which the Dismal Swamp Canal was a part. Along with the Erie Canal and the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal, the Dismal Swamp Canal was seen as an important economic link between the coast and the interior. As well as providing coastal markets for interior goods, these canals also served to connect states and regions in commerce, accelerating the economic growth of the period. Finally, these waterways were often the proving grounds for new technologies like the steamboat. In all, canals like the Dismal Swamp Canal factored greatly in the economic and technological development of the young nation."],"display_date":"November 17, 1819","search_date":"1819-11-17","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3653,"title":"Slave Management in Darlington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-10-13","end_date":"1852-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There were always fears of slave rebellions. In a letter dated October 13th, 1849, from E.W. Cooper, Thomas Cassels Law learned of a Negro insurrection in his home district of Darlington, South Carolina. Cooper served on an investigating committee to respond to the matter. Although they could not gather sufficient evidence to have the four leading insurrectionists hanged, they were lodged in jail and later sent out of the state. One of the enslaved men mentioned that word was spreading around Darlington that this was the last year the slaves would be held in bondage; white men traveling between Sumterville and Darlington City were apparently spreading the rumors. Cooper believed his own slaves were largely ignorant of the matter, but he warned Law, You had better keep a look out.","It is unclear how much of an impact this letter had on T.C. Law, but it is known that he was an active member of the Darlington Agricultural Society. In 1852, Thomas Cassels Law gave an address to the society entitled, Report on Management of Slaves - Duty of Overseers and Employers. Law's chief purpose was to give some insight in keeping an efficient and productive operation, and he incorporated an intricate analysis of the relationships between master and slave and overseer. He began, If slaves were brutes, as many seem to view them we might more easily point out their proper management, but they are human beings - morally accountable - committed to our care by a mysterious Providence, for, no doubt, a wise purpose. Law advocated for a moderate and constant work schedule for slaves, with proper intervals of rest. Yet, he also justified the use of the whip by citing scripture: he that spareth the rod hateth his child. Law recommended giving slaves a small plot that they could work in their off time and have a small notion of ownership. When the owner buys crops from his own slaves, it convinces them of your doing justice. ","As Law's report suggests, the relationship between master and slave was intricate and multi-faceted, layered with contradictions. Slaves were seen as racially inferior, yet still morally accountable human beings. Slaves were quite literally the property of their owners, and Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul </em>examines the reduction of human beings to financial numbers. Yet, Law and other planters found it immoral and improper to rule by simple and violent dominion over their chattel. Religious and racial convictions compelled white masters to treat slaves with paternalistic supervision. There was also a level of insecurity. So, giving a token piece of land to the slaves and convincing them of the justice of the system was a rational approach to slaveholding. Though men like Thomas Cassels Law may have applied the industry of slavery moderately and sensibly on their plantations, the existence of slaves as economic property was inherently dehumanizing."],"display_date":"October 13, 1849 - August 10, 1852","search_date":"1851-03-13","locations":[{"id":11496,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3665,"title":"A Breach of Contract in Apprenticeship\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-01-10","end_date":"1838-01-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When Robert Gregory, most likely a white man, entered into a contract with Michael Whissler, a young man most likely white, both thought they were getting a good deal. In return for Gregory giving Whissler six months of schooling, he would work for Gregory and learn the House Joiner's business. However, Whissler left town after one month. Then, on January 10, 1838, Robert Gregory ran an advertisement in the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em>. It gave a reward of six cents and a basket of shavings to whomever returned Gregory's runaway apprentice, Michael Whisler. Gregory described Whisler's physical characteristics such as mentioning that the 19 year old was telerly stout made and had an impediment in his speech. Gregory then warned that if the reader did not return the apprentice to him, but instead, harbored the runaway, he would enforce the law against all offenders, without respect to persons. He concluded his reward advertisement by saying, Look out. ","One week later, in the January 17, 1838 issue of the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em>, Michael Whissler (not Whisler as Gregory had misspelled) wrote back to set the record straight. In a letter addressed to the public, Whissler argued that since Mr. Robert Gregory advertised him as a runaway apprentice, it was his duty to state the facts in the case. He argued that he was not legally bound to him, and that he did not run away, but was in Martinsburg, where he remained since he left his employment. Whissler explained that the deal was that Gregory would give him six months worth of schooling, but that he only gave him one, and he lived with him till only 5 months remained. Whissler then thought that he had fulfilled the stipulations of the contract, but would have been willing to have stayed with him the remainder of his time had Gregory been willing to send Whissler to school the amount of time agreed upon. Instead, Whissler claimed that Gregory refused to do so, and thought it was his duty to leave him.","This presents an interesting case in apprenticeship in the South. Usually, the stipulations of an apprenticeship contract were that the apprentice would work for the owner for a certain amount of time, and in return the apprentice would receive free room and board as well as knowledge of how to run a certain type of business after the apprenticeship was complete. Whissler's case is different in that Whissler was to receive an education as well as room and board and knowledge of the business skill. Although evidence was not given as to the gentlemen's race, Gregory, the owner, was most assuredly white, because he was a business owner and not many black people had successful businesses enough to hire apprentices in the nineteenth century. Whissler was also most likely white, because of the education stipulation. The standard indenture required his master to teach or pay for teaching in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Since this provision disappeared from blacks' contracts early in the nineteenth century, Whissler was probably white because he negotiated education into the contract in 1838. Regardless of being white or black, there was a distinct relationship that came from nineteenth-century apprenticeships. Free children and adolescents both white and black who were apprentices were bound to serve their master until the age of twenty-one. Once a contract was signed, the apprentice would learn carpentry, tailoring, sewing, or whatever other trade he wanted to learn. White craftspeople had good reason to take on apprentices because they needed the labor. The system gave the apprentice an incentive to work hard in hopes that he would gain enough experience and expertise that he would start his own crafts-making business one day. The greatest aspect about apprenticeships in the nineteenth century was that apprentice terms were finite and could not be bought or sold like slave labor, so parents both white and black would send their children to apprentice for someone who guaranteed that they could not be sold away. At the same time, the owner taught them valuable lessons about mechanical business."],"display_date":"January 10, 1838 - January 17, 1838","search_date":"1838-01-13","locations":[{"id":14530,"lat":39.4640522698,"lng":-78.0275332326,"zoom":9,"place":"BERKELEY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3668,"title":"Northern Neck of Virginia Desires Immigrants\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-01-01","end_date":"1872-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Board of Immigration from the counties of Richmond, Westmoreland, Lancaster, and Northumberland assembled to compose their forthcoming pamphlet enticing immigrants to their regions of Virginia: ...our earnest desire is to attract to it and immigration not only from the northern and north-western states, but also from Canada and Europe.

Fredericksburg & Potomac had violated Richmond's laws, the city claimed, by running its steam- propelled cars through Broad Street. According to an ordinance passed on September 8, 1873, no vehicle of any kind was allowed to traverse that specific lane, the most important and populous street of the city. The F&P Railroad Company, on the other hand, charged that when Richmond chartered the company in 1834, the city specifically granted the company's directors the power to place whatever vehicles they deemed necessary on the railroads. The court eventually ruled in favor of Richmond, deciding that the city's inherent right to guard the safety and welfare of its citizens did not violate any contract between Richmond and the F&P Railroad Company."," In the Reconstruction-era South, railroads played a prominent role, expanding in number (mileage doubled in the years from 1865 to 1880) while functioning as a symbol for urban development and economic growth. Between 1868 and 1873, white southerners touted railroad construction as the key to revitalizing their war-torn region, and indeed, Judge Christian mentioned in his opinion that when the railroad company was founded, Broad Street was a mere turnpike, neither graded nor paved, with scattered houses on the side. By the time of the case, however, Broad Street had become a site of many retail businesses and served as a bustling tourist site. "," At the same time, railroad companies suffered their share of critics. Many felt that the railroads exploited their lack of supervision to act like institutions beyond the reach of legislatures or courts. For example, railroads often charged excessively high fees, but denounced suggestions of rate regulations as violations of private property rights. In the Richmond vs. the F&P Railroad Company case, the railroad tried to convince the judge that its charter cemented a right by contract forever, and under all circumstances, to run its cars by steam, thereby exempting the company from any form of city regulatory laws.

During debates for the December Legislative session, several people, including the governor, presented their opinions to defend the bank. Benjamin Yancey, after summarizing the previous remarks, passionately defended the bank. He provided a brief history of the bank in the state and differentiated it from the national bank. He explained why the state bank has served a public good even though most citizens were unaware of it. The bank, according to Yancey, had paid profits into the state treasury department that went to pay off public debt that financed public projects. Furthermore, the bank had never been in better condition and was financially sound where all available assets met its liabilities. Another example of the public good given emphatically was the loan to the Georgia Rail Road Banking Company. This loan provided resources to a company that would build railroads that will bring more connections to the state and bring in untold millions. Finally, Yancey demonstrated how the bank had kept the prices of slaves from depreciating. He cited an example in Alabama to persuade others to realize without the bank, the economy would not be in good shape. ","As seen during the 1830's, the issue of the bank of the United States became ever more important. The historian Michael O'Brien discusses the role Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun played in matters of the bank of the United States. O'Brien provides support to the position that the bank played a very important role in politics. Jackson, against the bank for ideological reasons, fought to defeat it. He removed the bank deposits, effectively killing the bank in 1834. Directly as a result of this, the Whig Party formed in opposition to Jackson. John C. Calhoun, another opponent to Jackson, favored the bank and fought against Jackson when he removed the bank deposits."],"display_date":"December 13, 1848 - December 13, 1855","search_date":"1852-06-13","locations":[{"id":11504,"lat":33.8449766897,"lng":-81.9100531274,"zoom":8,"place":"EDGEFIELD, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3689,"title":"The Spartanburg Female College\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-08-22","end_date":"1855-08-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a hot sunny date in the upcountry of South Carolina, S.

He carefully described the faculty, which included a minister, and the courses of study, ranging from reading and writing to arithmetic and geography. He pleaded with the audience to understand the importance of female education in Southern society. Women were expected to be good mothers, and he wanted to make each woman be a nobly-nursing wife because that is her great mission upon earth. Without proper education, he lamented, women were susceptible to corruption. Education provided the solution to maintaining a proper Southern culture. Without good mothers, he argued, future generations of children would not be raised properly. It was incumbent upon everyone to plan for the future; each one had a moral obligation.

However, there were women who protested this simple mindset, like Louisa McCord, as cited by the historian Michael O'Brien. Women like this provided reasons to create a college like this in order to teach women how to be 'proper'. She wrote an essay in 1852 called the Enfranchisement of Women. She advocated women's rights and wrote that women were out of place, unappreciated, having their talents and powers not only hidden under a bushel, but absolutely thrown away, while she becomes either the slave or the toy of men. As was the case with this college, women learned to read and write in order to be good wives, not for their own edification. Because some women, such as McCord, protested their treatment, the need to indoctrinate women to be subservient to their husbands became necessary. For this reason, educating women in Southern culture was very important.

Shall we continue to make Northern men wealthy in order to promote their abolition doctrines These acts menaced the institution of slavery. Southerners must rally around Southern newspapers and bear in mind that each dollar spent to help the wealthy Northerners was only helping them challenge freedoms enjoyed by the South.

William Freehling argues that South Carolinians thought they were special for representing the 'old South' and for the intellectual stature. This newspaper article matches the scholarship of Freehling and indicates the importance of how Southerners thought they were viewed in the North. They had a high sense of 'self-worth and would challenge anyone who did not agree. By not granting the Southern newspapers on the same stature as Northern newspapers, Northerners were perceived as insulting South Carolinian. ","This reflects the larger concerns over slavery. South Carolinians, even in 1849, feared the abolitionist intentions of the North. The Free Soil Party had run as a moderately successful third party in the 1848 election but was nowhere close to being popular. However, Southerners were aware of Northern abolition intentions, even if they were on a small scale and feared that any disrespectful action towards the South meant that abolition of slavery was coming.

Concerns were expressed regarding what the future would hold in store if California were admitted in the Union as a free state. The great discussion involved several senators, Badger, Downs and Pratt, and whether or not they should enter a formal protest into the bill. Debates continued in the House of Representatives and involved whether or not to establish a territorial government for Utah. Nevertheless, the Bill passed the Senate with Senator Pratt of Maryland voting against the bill and Senators Downs and Badger abstained from voting on the bill.

Clay's dramatic Senate speech early on in the year summed up his life as a politician and continued the approach that slavery was bad and evil but did little to actually bring it to an end. Calhoun, before his death, gave a speech in the Senate saying how the union had lost its old republic sense that the hostility towards the South and slavery had to be stopped or else secession could be justified.

The project was being headed up by four commissioners who would be in charge of deciding who will complete the project. An article in the Greenville Mountaineer informed readers that they should contact one of the following people: FR. Alexander, WM. S. Mills, Richard Morris, M.R. Alexander. ","One of the main policy objectives of the Whig Party was to improve the infrastructure within states with government money. This policy conflicted directly with the Democratic position, mainly against President Andrew Jackson who fought against unnecessary government spending. The turnpike in South Carolina required funding from the state and Whig support. ","As the Whigs continued to build support, projects such as this became more popular and feasible. As the decades continued to pass, railroad construction became a more important issue and encouraged the debate of how to allocate state funds. The historian Walter Edgar cites that as early as 1827, the South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company came into existence and played an important role. Edgar's evidence emphasizes the role played by infrastructure and transportation within South Carolina. ","This narrative reflects the growth of statewide infrastructure and corresponds to the national debates of the proper role of government in the economy. It also demonstrates how infrastructure projects, like the turnpike, were funded. This project would be funded by the government, which would have pleased the Whigs. They believed in the potential of government to positively affect the economy while Democrats believed in as little government action as possible."],"display_date":"July 2, 1836","search_date":"1836-07-02","locations":[{"id":11532,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENVILLE, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3695,"title":"Slave Trade\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-04-12","end_date":"1850-04-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Enticing a willing buyer to purchase a slave was not easy. But there were characteristics that Norton and Steele dramatically emphasized to gain interest in the slaves they wanted to sell. They offered young boys and girls who were desirable, because they are smart and 'copper coloured' and also posses other skills like being good nurses. Choosing to find a willing buyer through the newspaper, they were hoping to find one who needed house servants or young workers in the field. No prices were given for their worth, indicating that a price could later be negotiated. The demand for enslaved persons determined their worth. ","The lack of human dignity in the slave trade was confirmed through advertisements such as this. The cold description of slaves for sale is disturbing because the worth of the individuals centered on how well could he/she serve a new master. The historian Walter Johnson, in his book Soul by Soul, argues that selling children was common and done without concern about breaking up families. This narrative supports with Johnon's portrayal of the slave trade; it was inhuman and even included children without regard to how that may affect families. ","Moreover, the adjectives used are equally revealing as to the attitudes taken by slave owners. When trying to sell slaves, no bad adjectives were used but rather adjectives that make a slave seem to be more valuable. To many people who traded, slaves were just another account entry. In order to determine appropriate prices, however, categories were established by traders who had knowledge of what a slave might be worth. Even paradoxically, slaves were treated well prior to being sold in order to fatten them up and make them seem to be healthier; a healthier slave earned more in return. The appaling treatment of people in the slave trade cannot be overstated."],"display_date":"April 12, 1850","search_date":"1850-04-12","locations":[{"id":11628,"lat":34.811393256,"lng":-82.9187403935,"zoom":9,"place":"PICKENS, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3701,"title":"Gold deposits within Washington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-03-05","end_date":"1859-03-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gold What could be more illustrious to read about during the mid nineteenth century than gold? On March 9, 1859, the Farmer's Cabinet published an article briefly summarizing one man's visit to the sub-treasury gold reserve in Washington, D.C. In a seemingly obvious attempt to bolster national comfort and ease economic pessimist, the lure of gold and more importantly a surplus of gold available in the sub-treasury gave the reader the feeling that though times seemed bleak, there was enough gold in this town to support half the world for life. The Panic of 1857 was a sudden downturn in the economy caused by, among other things, the decision of British investors to remove funds from U.S. banks for fear of economic instability. Beginning in 1848, the California Gold Rush ushered in millions of dollars in gold to many different treasury deposits such as the one located in the city of Washington. Many news outlets following the Panic chose to run stories such as this one to bring about a feeling of national economic security that would ease investors.The author described the sight of a piece of golden cheese worth nearly a quarter of a million U.S. dollars. As the Gold Rush progressed and the rich got richer, local banks and gold dealers issued banknotes in exchange for gold, private mints created private gold coins, and gold was sent by California banks to U.S. national banks in exchange for national paper currency to be used in the thriving California financial system.   Herbert Brayer even went as far as to say that overnight California became the Mecca of America, shipping assets and wealth domestically as well as across the globe. The ramifications of the discovery of gold in California were incredible: towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives were sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.The brightest light shed from the account is that which is seen at the Sub-Treasury in Washington where the author describes the everything-proof bunker, which is filled on all sides with Solid Bars of gold and silver. The author concludes his journey in a very calculating way, forcing the reader to step forth from this cave of wealth and back to the real world. Though the sight of the illustrious gold was gone, the lasting vision of available security and wealth illustrated by the author and Brayer's assessment remains engraved in the readers mind forever. One could even make the argument that booster articles like this one were the reason for the sharp economic recovery that followed the Panic of 1857."],"display_date":"March 5, 1859","search_date":"1859-03-05","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3704,"title":"The Changing Nature of the Institution of Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-03-12","end_date":"1857-03-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the Supreme Court case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press. In an article published on March 12, 1857, The National Era ran an explanatory article breaking down the case and illustrating its ramifications.The article pointed out that, with the Dred Scott ruling, an African American could never become a citizen of the United States. More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable. If he or she were the victim of the ever-increasing practice of kidnapping free blacks and selling them back into slavery as with Solomon Northup, a freeborn person of color, then that person would have no means to pursue any kind of defense in their name.

There, he was drugged, threatened with death if he told anyone the truth about his true identity, and put on a boat bound for New Orleans where he would work as a slave for almost twelve years. Upon reviewing Northup's memoirs, Walter Johnson concluded Northup's account centered on a single question: who can be trusted?

Not only did the city have electricity, but also they had streetlights on some of the main streets. They had a telegraph since the 1850's, but did not mention it, nor did they mention their railroad connections. Not only did the citizens of Staunton enjoy these technological advances, they had a strong arts program. The citizens enjoyed the finest Opera House in the State of Virginia and the largest and best band of music in the South. A troupe from New York even traveled to Staunton to perform, and during travel one of its members met her death in a train accident in the city and the show was cancelled. "," The newspaper featuring this article was not widely circulated and a news wire would not have any reason to pick up this story and publish it nationally. There were plenty of other cities just like Staunton in the United States and nothing special about the technology there, but the arts might have been. They had the telephone and failed to mention their railroad connections, but it had been there since the 1850's and had become such a part of everyday life in so many other areas that it was not unique to Staunton. They did not have to boast of their railroad because it was assumed that a great city like theirs would have a railroad.

The article mattered to the inhabitants though and could only have fostered their sense of accomplishment. "," Edward Ayers has noted Augusta County's position as a border state before the Civil War. Its position in the Great Valley created connections in the North and in the South. The Valley Turnpike provided direct access northward for everything. After the War, Augusta had the same geographic location, but a different mindset because the country held a different attitude. It enjoyed the economic prosperity that the railroads and other technology had brought, but the city was a Southern city at heart. The citizens had a relationship with the South and its customs but there was a constant exchange of ideas, people, and products with the North, too. They could not ignore the stories of Northern events in their newspapers or the information a traveler on the B&O brought from Cincinnati. The Northern influence was strong, but so was that of the South. The Virginia Central Railroad connected the cities in Virginia and strengthened the Southern hold. It is important to note that in the late 1880's when the North and South were separating culturally, the city boasted of their opera house and band in relation to the South. This statement was a sign to the readers that the citizens of Staunton still firmly held their connection to the South, even if they used technological inventions that held greater prominence in the North.

Randolph, representative of Albemarle  County, gave a speech in regards to possible emancipation within the state.  Although it was 1832 at the time of this address, the proposed plan that Randolph spoke about would only affect slaves born after 1840 and would take 80 years to complete.  Virginians would hold male and female slaves until they reached the ages of 18 and 21.  Upon this age, the state would remove the slaves from the Commonwealth.  This produced a heated debate among Virginia leaders, and Randolph sought to promote the plan; at the very least, he wanted to propose the idea to all the constituents of Virginia.     ","            The Virginia emancipation debate of the 1830s rarely consisted of extreme abolitionist views.  However, some Virginians did have opinions about whether or not the institution of slavery was politically and economically necessary.  Randolph suggested that the gradual emancipation plan would not hurt the state economically, as it \"levies no money tax upon the people - each slave pays his own removal by his hire.\"  He argued that slaves would still be in the state until they reached adulthood, and even afterwards, they could be sold to other southern states for a profit.  Politically, Randolph argued that since the plan would take a full 80 years, its effects would not be sudden.  He said even if negative consequences emerged, then \"a repeal of the law\" would bring things back to the 1832 standard.  ","            In addition to the political and economic aspects of gradual emancipation, Randolph discussed the immorality of slavery.  He pointed out that slavery was not justified by the fact that other lands practiced it.  He argued that \"upon the same principle he could justify...plurality of wives...,murder...,\" and other endeavors that Americans considered wrong, but which took place in other areas.  Furthermore, he criticized the many Southerners who used the Bible to justify slavery.  He highlighted the Biblical passages that actually made slavery a dishonorable practice, such as \"that which teaches charity, justice, and good will to all.\"  At a time when southerners rarely questioned the morality of slavery's moral aspect, Randolph clearly took a risk in some of his arguments.","            Following his political, economic, and moral reasoning, Randolph exploited southerners' anxieties regarding slaves in order to advance his argument.  The Nat Turner Rebellion, which led to the deaths of many Virginians, afflicted fear upon the state and led some to question the institution of slavery.  Randolph argued that if gradual emancipation and removal were not put into effect, then the slave population would grow and become uncontrollable.  He said this group could potentially be found \"burning with enthusiasm for the liberation of their race\" and rebel.  Even with this daunting point, there were still many listeners who opposed Randolph's strong democratic views.  Randolph therefore implored that his fellow delegates at least propose the plan to their constituents in order to decide what step to take next.  Mostly western Virginians, along with the state's governor and a few legislators, applauded Randolph's idea. However, other eastern Virginians such as William Brodnax thought it was \"a scheme...destined to produce 30 years of domestic warfare...(and)...to make every patriarch a child-seller.\"   Various ideas emerged following Jefferson's proposal, including Brodnax's plan for immediate deportation, many elitists' hope to discontinue the debate all together, and Archibald Bryce's \"abstract affirmation of colonization.\"  Randolph supported Bryce in hopes to start any sort of emancipation movement. Legislators debated Bryce's plan to fund the deportation of blacks but ultimately only passed it in the House without confirming it in the Senate.  Thus, although, Virginia adopted what historian William Freehling calls \"an ambivalent, ineffective colonization experiment,\" the power struggle between eastern elitists and western egalitarians was significant.  It foreshadowed the tension in Virginia that would persist for decades to come.

Anderson, a prominent creditor in central Virginia, found himself in the midst of a particularly difficult legal battle involving the sale and distribution of coal-rich lands in West Virginia.  The lands in question were the John Lykens and Crescent tracts.  Apparently, two men, James G. Paxton and J.R. Jordan, owned some of the land and allotted it to certain family members after they died.  However, the Kanawha-Gauley Coal and Coke Company did not know this when they decided to invest in some of the land because it contained \"very fine...coal\" and \"a fine seem of black-band ore.\"  Unfortunately for the company, some of their land overlapped with the land that Paxton and Jordan allocated out in their wills to their respective relatives.  The beneficiaries of Paxton's and Jordan's wills and the coal company all bombarded Anderson with letters asking him for a quick and fair end to the trial.  He knew that it would be impossible to satisfy everyone.  After all, there were just too many parties of interest and not enough land.  Anderson was especially worried about the backlash from the coal company if they did not get their desired share of the land.  One letter in particular contained threat upon threat.  Anderson knew that the coal company would not back down until they obtained their land.  Why could they not find other land in West Virginia?  What was so special about these tracts? ","    Around the 1880s, coal became popular in West Virginia.  It would develop into the key export in the early 1890s for three reasons.  One was the introduction and expansion of railroads, most notably the Chesapeake and Ohio railways.  The second reason was the change in preference for southern coal over northern coal, as southern coal was of higher quality than northern coal.  Thus, northern industries started to request southern coal to power their northern factories.  Lastly, when the depression of the 1890s lifted, coal output skyrocketed as larger coal companies infiltrated the area and started new enterprises.  Along with the increase in profits came the increase in population.  In McDowell County, which held the state's richest coal mines, the population rose by 600 percent from 1880-1900.  West   Virginia's prosperous coal mines lured workers and their families, as well as single white men and a large number of free black men who wanted to create a better life for themselves after emancipation.  As the mines drew in more people, production continued to escalate, demand grew, and coal became the catalyst for the economic boom in West Virginia of the late 1800s.  ","    On a larger scale, West Virginia developed into a leader of the industrial revolution that took over the South beginning in 1880.  As agricultural production stopped making large profits, the South realized it needed to revamp its economy if it wanted to compete with the North.  Slowly but surely, industry grew in the South.  Lumber and steel mills started to spring up.  Planters began abandoning their cotton fields in exchange for a position in the numerous and flourishing textile mills scattered throughout the South.  Slowly, the cities of the South started to resemble some of their urban counterparts of the North.  These industries, with coal acting as one of the leaders, destroyed the notion that the South was just one big plantation and successfully transformed the economy into one that could effectively challenge the North domestically and internationally.

In <em>The Mariner's Chronicle</em>, one gentleman on board described the scene in the boiler room as a \"complete wreck - a picture of destruction\".  He witnessed one man with \"the whole of the forehead blown away: the brains were still beating.  Tufts of hair, shreds of clothing, and splotches of blood might be seen in every direction\".  Outside the boiler room \"on every side were to be heard groans and mingled exclamations of grief and despair\" as men and women dealt with the injured.  One man's face \"was entirely black; his body without a particle of skin.  He had been flayed alive\".  To witness such horrors - fellow passengers in pain, near death, and begging for death to \"free them from present suffering\" - devastated the survivors.  The gentleman judged that between forty and fifty people perished either instantly, from injury, from inhaling steam or gas, or from drowning.  "," No doubt people faced danger when traveling during the 19th century.   John Burke in \"Bursting Boilers and Federal Power\" stated that between 1816 and 1848 about 233 steamboat explosions occurred.  The lack of regulation on the boilers at that time contributed to most of the accidents.  Steamboat explosions caused the loss of goods affecting the economy as well as the loss of lives affecting each individual and each family.  Ultimately, the loss of lives and goods played a crucial role in affecting American history.  The number of lives lost compelled American legislation to question how steamboats could become safer and whether federal power had the right to create regulatory agencies.    ","In 1824, the <em>Gibbons v Ogden</em> ruling handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that \"the power to regulate commerce, so far as it extends, is exclusively vested in Congress\" allowing Congress to regulate private business and to interfere where government had never interfered before.  As more steamboat explosions killed more lives, the American people reacted.  In 1830, Secretary of Treasury Samuel D. Ingham gave money to The Franklin Institute to experiment and inspect steam engine boilers.  The combination of the number of deaths due to explosions and the data from the experiments forced the Steamboat Act of 1838 to become law.  The Steamboat Act of 1852 established the Steamboat Inspection Service, one of the first federal agency to regulate private industry, allowing the Act of 1838 to be enforced by a government agency.  Aside from safer traveling, the impact of this legislation still affects Americans.  John Ward in \"The Future of an Explosion\" further explained, \"From that distant carnage on the rivers of the West came the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and all the other government regulatory and investigative agencies that seek to protect us today\".  A steamboat explosion occurring in 1830 changed the lives of Americans far after other transportation replaced steamboats.  The loss of human life makes a difference."],"display_date":"February 24, 1830","search_date":"1830-02-24","locations":[{"id":12366,"lat":35.2121822757,"lng":-89.8820367379,"zoom":9,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3913,"title":"Disaster on the Carolina Railroad\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-01","end_date":"1856-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On May 19, 1856, C.M. Siller wrote a letter to his friend J.L. Twyman, a resident of Buchanan County, Virginia. From his room at the Washington Hotel in Lynchburg, Virginia, Siller described the details of his train ride to Anderson, South Carolina two weeks earlier. His three-page letter discussed in great depth the landscape of the various towns he saw, as well as the agricultural production of each farm he saw. Evidently, the type of soil – whether it was healthy red clay or nasty swampland – was very important to him and his letter's recipient since nearly half of the letter was a commentary on the fertility of the land. Siller additionally described the crops grown in each area, a reflection of his obvious interest in farming. Despite the fact that Twyman was a doctor and Siller presumably a businessman, this interest in agriculture was not uncommon at the time. ","Siller's account of the route his train took comprised a significant part of the letter.  He went into great detail to describe the fares – ranging from three dollars to six fifty per leg – as well as the length of the journey in miles and hours.  His account of the train ride was extensive in part due to the considerable number of stops and connections that the voyage to South Carolina from Virginia required.  Siller described many different towns along the route and mentioned constantly getting on and off the train to have a meal or take a break. At one point during his journey, he was required to descend the train and meet at a steamboat, where the boat took him to switch railroad services. ","The last portion of his letter to Twyman was a description of an accident on the train before the passengers reached Anderson. A piece of iron from the train track broke from the worn out trestles and caused the passenger car to flip and fall into a sand bank. The injuries Siller sustained were worse than most passengers' because his seat was in the front of the train; while most travelers left without a scrape, Siller dislocated his left shoulder and broke his arm. Although he was thankful that his life was spared, Siller was aggrieved by his eventful journey; his letter mentioned that his injuries caused him great discomfort and he was unable to sleep at night. ","Siller's letter to Twyman illustrated that transportation through the antebellum South by train was neither an effortless nor an enjoyable undertaking.  The South did not have a well-organized rail system that allowed for people and products to be moved around the region effectively. According to John Majewski, author of A House Dividing, \"Southern railroads took weeks to transport supplies and raw materials between eastern and western theaters.\" From Siller's emphasis on the agricultural rather than technological aspects of the train voyage in his letter, he demonstrated how much the South relied on agriculture. To a Southerner, farming was the main source of revenue and was considered the single most important aspect of life; technological development did not seem entirely necessary in the mid-nineteenth century. However, Majewski notes that \"a bountiful harvest counted for little if local railroad tracks were destroyed by foes… or if wagons… were impressed to serve the army\". The issue became a major setback for the Confederacy during the Civil War when the South's obsolete railroads created a severe disadvantage against the North's highly industrialized system.

To use the words of her editors, the Gazette continued printing \" at a cost and trouble of which many of our readers have not the least conception; for if they had, there would not be so many who would still withhold what they owe us for our labor.\" ","    The war cost the Confederacy a great deal of resources, making simple and everyday items and foodstuffs scarce. The South sent its young men off to fight the North, which meant that they also sent off a majority of their farmers to go fight. Conscription was strict and only a small demographic of men were exempt from service. The Confederacy exempted only those planters owning twenty or more slaves and those that grew food crops only. Planters and the Confederacy could not waste land on cotton. The women and young sons of these soldier-farmers had a hard time bringing in the harvest without the extra labor of fathers and older brothers or sons, so food was scarce. The slaves also found it easier to resist their mistresses or run away with their masters and overseers away at war. Even a number of slaves were drawn away from the fields to fight alongside or serve the Confederate Army. Historian William Blair writes \"large-scale farmers on whom the burden of production now rested felt besieged by their own people, as nonproducers and the poor clamored for regulated prices on foodstuffs and the Confederacy demanded slaves for production and military work.\" The Richmond Bread Riot in 1863, when 68 women were arrested in the Richmond market after causing a ruckus and breaking into shops to steal bread, illustrated these tensions.","    Not only could the Confederacy not produce enough food, but the Union Army also destroyed what little they had when marching through Southern towns. Blair writes of the destruction the Union Army doled out within \"a five-mile radius around Dayton\" in the Shenandoah Valley. Blair states that the Union Army burned and killed \"a total of 2,000 barns filled with wheat, hay, and implements; seventy mills filled with grain; and roughly 4,000 head of livestock.\" This lack of supplies, coupled with the Confederacy continuously printing its own unbacked paper money and raising the inflation rate, effectively crippled the South's economy. Thus when the Gazette asked for repayment, it offered a variety of methods to pay off amassed debts: \"we will take from those in arrears, 1 in specie, 1 bushel of wheat, 1 1/8 bushels of corn, 7 pounds of good bacon or butter, 75 pounds of clean rags, or a half load of wood for each year as may best suit subscribers.\""],"display_date":"April 27, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-27","locations":[{"id":14234,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3932,"title":"An Editorial on the End of the Civil War in Charleston\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-07-22","end_date":"1865-07-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 22, 1865, in Charleston, South   Carolina, a man by the pen-name of Juhl wrote an editorial in the <em>Charleston Courier </em>describing many elements of city life in the post-Civil War period. The writer's real name was Reverend Julius J. Fleming, a prominent and outspoken citizen of Charleston widely respected for his roles as a preparatory school principal, a Methodist preacher, and earlier in his life, as the editor of the <em>Sumter Watchman</em>, a Charleston area newspaper. More importantly, however, the editorial Fleming penned shows a distinct knowledge of the fundamental problem that plagued Reconstruction South Carolina.","In the editorial letter that he penned in the <em>Courier</em>,<em> </em>one of dozens that he would write during his lifetime, Fleming addressed many problems that the Civil War had laid on South Carolina. In particular, Fleming's message also posed two significant queries relevant to the safety and survival of Southern culture: \"How can<em> </em>peace and quiet be permanently secured?\" and \"How and where will farmers find an adequate, reliable labor force?\" ","Interestingly enough, both of Fleming's questions hinged on one all-important aspect of Southern lifestyle, the slave labor agricultural system that had existed for nearly two hundred years at the time of the Civil War. Fleming, in his editorial, described slavery as \"the life-blood of secession and the real <em>casus belli</em> [cause of war],\" thereby showing that slavery's end was to be the single largest hardship faced during Reconstruction. On this note, he claimed that \"by one sweep the wealth of the country is taken away, and a people accustomed to wealth and ease are suddenly reduced to poverty, humiliation and toil.\" Fleming's idea of South Carolina's economic ruin as a result of emancipation was later supported by Civil War historian W. Scott Poole, who cited the disappearance of \"enormous wealth, founded as it had been on a now defunct social system.\"","There is no doubt that both questions Fleming posed were difficult ones to answer, especially considering the Union Army had freed a gigantic number of former slaves during their march through South Carolina. Nevertheless, there is also no doubt that the author developed several sensible answers to uncertainties faced not only in South Carolina, but the South as a whole, in his landmark editorial. Among these suggestions, Fleming's envisioned arrangement for agricultural change was particularly impressive, and featured a version of sharecropping in which wealthy planters would \"divide up a portion of their estates into small farms which emigrants can readily obtain by purchase or lease.\"  In the post-war South, Fleming's system was put to use on a large scale, and it lasted into the twentieth century. ","Across his editorial, Fleming displayed an acute knowledge of the problems to be faced as the result of slavery's demise in post-Civil War South Carolina. While there is no question that Fleming's editorial addressed on one hand \"a people picking up the pieces of an existence shattered and changed by war and defeat,\" there is also no question as to the overarching theme of his letter.

Pinckney, a plantation owner in South Carolina, did not expect these men to continue working for free, but he realized that without them, his plantation was destined for failure. He stated simply, \"I acknowledged their freedom; did not expect them to work on the old terms, but would pay them for their labor, etc.\" Pinckney respected the knowledge of the land and agricultural work that these men had acquired while working for him, and for this reason he wished them to stay on his plantation. After his request, Pinckney received a largely negative response from these former slaves. Acknowledging their rights as free men, Pinckney told them that if they were to stay on his land they would have to work for him, but they were free to go wherever they wanted. The slaves found themselves in a frustrating bind. Fearing the failure of the federal paper currency (greenbacks), they wished to work for themselves instead of Pinckney employing them. They questioned the actions of the government, asking \"what good does it do for the government to give us our freedom and not give us land to plant?\" Pinckney, probably like most former plantation owners, was equally frustrated because his livelihood relied on the productivity of his plantation, and he could not possibly do all the work himself. ","    The free men did begin to work, but \"it was only starvation that brought them to it.\" Without any land, they could not provide food for themselves or their families, so they had to work under whatever conditions Pinckney offered. On Pinckney's plantation they were \"generally forced to adopt the share system.\" This share system became common throughout the South in the years following the war. In the early stages, the plantation remained the most common unit with free men working on it for a share of the crops, but soon enough a true sharecropping system developed. Black men were granted pieces of land to work, and when the year was over the owners returned to them a share of the crop produced. By 1870 sharecropping was so common in the South that it made any other system seem unusual. Sharecropping did not, however, allow the South to develop any more industry or diversify any more than it had under the plantation system, leaving it lagging far behind the North for many years to come."],"display_date":1865,"search_date":"1865-07-02","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3952,"title":"The Interstate Slave Trade\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-03","end_date":"1832-12-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["        The <em>Alexandria Gazette</em>, a newspaper of Alexandria, Virginia, published a small advertisement for \"200 Negroes\" on December 3, 1832.

Being sold to the Deep South was possibly one of the greatest fears of many Upper or Border South slaves. The prospect of being sold away from family and friends was considered by some, a worse punishment than whipping. ","            According to historian William W. Freehling, economic growth, booming land sales, and the invention of the cotton gin encouraged the interstate slave trade as cotton was very profitable and grew more productively in more tropical climates. Freehling also notes that \"between 1790 and 1860, Border and Middle Souths lost close to 750,000 slaves.\"  This drain was especially prevalent in the 1850s cotton boom, comprising a substantial percentage of the slave population of these states. In comparison, after the \"tobacco bust of the eighteenth century,\" the Border South was much more industrial, grew a wider variety of crops, and was more economically diversified and willing to sell their slaves \"down the river\" for a high profit. Most slaveholding southerners claimed to look down on these slave traders who made transactions possible, but according to historian Jeanette Keith, Isaac Franklin and his partner John Armfield were two of the most affluent and successful slave traders in the United   States. They later retired wealthy, purchased their own plantations, and married into elite families in Tennessee. They were also prominent Methodists. Many factors encouraged the slave trade during the 1820s and 1830s. Economics and profit to be gained in the cotton boom provided ample reason for traders to invest in this market.

He went on to explain that \"with what little (crops) we have to sell won't bring enough to pay for the expense of raising it.\"  Other such maladies that McClure noted were that the livestock was not selling for a sufficient amount, that many people were ill and dying, and that \"this portion of Virginia has suffered very much with hay cholera,\" which made farmers' meat suffer.  The most challenging trouble he described was the state's economic position, which furthered the racial equality dispute.","After the war, much of the South experienced high debt.  Thus, the government was hesitant to fund certain programs but did raise taxes in order to appropriate money for public education.  Proponents of this had various rationalizations.  First, throughout the post-war South there were much lower literacy and school attendance rates among blacks and whites, as compared to the North.  Furthermore, Southern families grew in size, meaning there were more children to send to school.  Finally, given the hard economic times, the Southern states struggled to pay teachers and upkeep school buildings unless they taxed.  Not everyone favored these taxes, though, and as McClure wrote, it caused \"our state to disagree.\"","On the other side of the debate were white Southerners like McClure who feared blacks would \"infect\" the white students.  Another apprehension was that blacks were inherently immoral, irresponsible, and did not deserve an education.  There were also those who worried about what other types of freedoms blacks would seek if granted equal education.  McClure also mentioned the argument that the tax money was wasted on blacks.  He said that \"9 out of 10 of them may go to school 5 years and they won't advance much beyond a spelling book and in 12 months after leaving school will forget everything.\"  Not only did he find blacks ignorant, but he also claimed that they did not value an education because \"everything they care for is to frolic and drink whiskey.\"  Although McClure wrote this letter in 1886, the sentiments on both sides were not entirely new.","The issue of black and white equality versus inequality was present even before the Civil War began.  What was newest to the debate was the political and religious controversy it sparked.  In the 1870s, the Republican Party promoted funding for public education, claiming that it furthered the ideal of patriotism.  Catholics and some Democrats, on the other hand, argued that the Republicans' platform jeopardized individualism.  Catholics instead sought to gain funding for <em>private</em> education.  No matter how many people wanted public education, racial tensions were at a peak, and many did not want to pay for schooling if it was going to be for blacks.  Some historians saw the \"African factor as the difference between success and failure,\" suggesting that \"white racism undermined any movement for meaningful national unification through mass education\" at the time.  ","As the 1880s arrived, so did a new leading political party of Virginia: the Readjusters, who promoted public education for both blacks and whites.  During this decade, the focus on two parties dwindled while various independent political thoughts emerged.  The truth revealed in McClure's letter was that during that era,Virginia political tension was strong.  He also accurately portrayed the anxieties of many southern whites in regards to post-war education.  Yet history does contradict McClure's fear of public education being a complete waste.

His cotton crop had failed and his debts were quickly mounting.  In an 1843 letter to his brother, who lived in Staunton, Virginia, Kinney proposed multiple methods to earn some quick money to satisfy his debtors.  The most promising option was to begin actively engaging in the slave trade.  Young healthy slaves could often sell for hundreds and even thousands of dollars.  The recent migration of planters to the Mississippi Delta from the Chesapeake region had increased the demand for slaves even further.  Even some people from the North came to the region in order to enjoy the economic prosperity of the area.  Some of the migrants came not understanding slavery or even believing that it was unnecessary but ended up purchasing slaves nonetheless.  ","            Kinney defended his decision to become active in the trade of slaves.  This is interesting because his brother, as a resident of Virginia, likely owned slaves himself or was at least exposed to slavery on a daily basis.  In fact, many slaves from Virginia and Maryland were sent to the Deep  South where the demand was much greater for them.  This was because the tobacco boom had come and gone in the Chesapeake while the cotton and sugar rush was just beginning in Louisiana.  The struggling farmer told his brother that the slave trade \"is both a positive good for master and slave.\"  It is easy to see what \"positive good\" the master received, but Kinney failed to mention how this process was beneficial to the slave.  He must have forgotten that slaves were often separated from their families and forced to start life anew whenever they were sold, causing much grief and heartbreak.

Advertisements present in the Norfolk-based newspaper attempted to sell goods such as Christmas supplies, hats, and chlorine tooth wash. While these impersonal objects were goods commonly traded and sold in the marketplace, the advertisement section also included references to Southern property that had run away from their masters. Perhaps the most telling aspect of these advertisements was that no significant distinction was made between missing cattle and missing slaves. To the slave master, steers and slaves were equal under the nature of the law: both were fundamental illustrations of private property. ","To comprehend the importance of the <em>Beacon's </em>advertisements, it is essential to understand the Southern belief that slaves were inherently the property of their masters. This prevalent reasoning had predated the Constitution and was deeply entrenched in Southern culture by 1832. Records from the debates of the Constitutional Convention, presented in the <em>Cambridge Modern History</em>, illustrate that Southerners held a consensus that \"slaves were property only; like other property, they were entirely subject to the wills of the master.\" This conception was no different from the perception regarding steers. In the two advertisements aforementioned, the descriptions of the missing cattle and runaway slaves relied solely upon physical peculiarities. While the two missing steers had \"marks under half moon under the right ear,\" the runaway slave named Lucy was \"stout\" with a \"very yellow complexion.\" In both circumstances, vested rights in private property possessed by the plantation owner dictated that the property be returned. ","The Southern perception of slaves as \"chattel property,\" mirrored in the two advertisements of the <em>American Beacon</em>,<em> </em>supports an underlying observation that blacks and cattle held equal rights under <em>de facto</em> Southern law. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \"chattel\" is defined as \"a personal possession.\" As previously stated, slaves in the South were considered \"property...subject to the wills of their masters.\" The words \"chattel\" and \"cattle\" share a common language origin; both terms come from the Old French word \"chatel,\" which arises from the Latin word \"caput,\" meaning \"head.\" By relegating slaves to the restricted rights and properties of chattel, slave owners fundamentally equalized the rights of slaves and the rights of cattle. As a result, listing rewards for runaway slaves next to advertisements for runaway cattle, chlorine tooth wash, and medical elixirs was not conflicting in either intention or theory.  ","From expressed Southern mentality and advertisements found in the <em>Beacon</em>, it becomes readily apparent that blacks and whites were not regarded as equal beings under the encompassing mantle of equal protection. Blacks, bought and sold as mere chattel, were only regarded as equals to steers, \"glass beads,\" and \"harmonical walking canes.\" The subsequent equality under the law and inherent relation between steers and slaves was a founding principle of the Southern plantation economy, helping preserve the institution of slavery until the conclusion of the Civil War.

We will be pleased to know that the unpleasant matter is settled.\" ","On December 30, 1885, Phillip Haxall, President of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, penned the preceding sentences in a letter to Chairman William H. Mullen of the Boycott Committee of the Knights of Labor. This statement expresses the significant influence the Knights of Labor had achieved in the areas of labor relations and social reform by the end of the 1880s. The organization, noted for its official motto, \"that is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all,\" was established on January 1, 1869 as a secret society in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Knights of Labor prided themselves on establishing a diverse and integrated membership that was committed to the preservation of working-class rights.  ","Before the industrial influence of the Knights of Labor can be explained, it is important to first understand the underlying premise of the boycott staged against the Haxall-Crenshaw Company. Due to racism still evident throughout the Reconstruction Era, black prison populations had vastly expanded in size. State governments attempted to capitalize on this situation by instituting a system of convict labor. Historian Edward Ayers describes the structure of the state prison labor system, stating, \"for a small fee, a railroad builder, a planter, or a mine owner could use the labor of state convicts with little financial risk and with no labor troubles.\" In Richmond, the Haxall-Crenshaw Company used convict laborers to produce the barrels that contained company products. The Knights of Labor, dedicated to free labor and economic justice, believed convict labor competition infringed upon the rights of the free working class. In order to counteract this practice, the Richmond Knights of Labor devised a boycott, one that was ultimately successful.","The founding principle of the Knights of Labor is nowhere more evident than in the surviving papers of William H. Mullen. Commissioned as \"Organizer\" for the Richmond District Assembly, or \"DA 84,\" on November 28, 1885, he was authorized by decree from the General Master Workman (T.V. Towderly). Historian Peter J. Rachleff described Mullen's immediate impact on the city of Richmond when he noted Mullen's order of \"a boycott of the products of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, which packaged these products in convict-made barrels.\" This boycott, instituted in order to protect the interests of black coopers in the Richmond area, was sanctioned through Mullen's power to \"exercise all the authority conferred upon him by the Constitution, Laws, and Usages of the Order.\" Mullen's papers documented the Richmond District Assembly's creation on January 1, 1878, and the continual desire to protect rights of the working class from corporate abuse through the five principles of \"JUSTICE, WISDOM, TRUTH, INDUSTRY, and ECONOMY.\" Thus, the boycott of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company was an opportunity to stimulate social change through non-violent means, drawing upon the strength of an integrated and unified working class.","Perhaps it was the Knights of Labor's superior efficiency in mobilization that led directly to industrial reform in Richmond. Under General Master Workman T.V. Towderly, the labor organization rose to prominence in the 1880s, becoming, as Craig Phelan observes, \"the most significant and ambitious labor organization of the Gilded Age.\" In a document describing the \"Great Seal of Knighthood,\" found among Mullen's papers, the Knights of Labor were instructed to \"hear both sides, then judge.\" Through the work of Chairman William H. Mullen, the Richmond Knights of Labor were able to preside over the \"public court of labor\" on behalf of their working class constituency.

One specific article presented the news of a new tariff bill to be passed by the United States House of Representatives.  This bill was designed to protect young American manufacturers and the economy from competing foreign markets.  The article also gave insight into the fact that many Rockbridge  County residents were unsure the new bill would protect industry and decrease the treasury's debt at the same time.  They hoped the bill would not pass through the House because the tariff would hurt their agricultural society.  The residents believed it was unintelligent to tax foreign imports that Americans had no way of producing themselves, such as coffee.  Moreover, with the passing of this bill United States manufacturers could then charge American consumers, like the Rockbridge County residents, higher prices.  According to the article, this tariff would help the Northern economy but harm the South.  ","There have been many such bills throughout the history of the United   States, especially in the years after Reconstruction.  All of them had the same goal of protecting the domestic economy.  The dispute over tariffs boiled down to the Northern Republicans against the Southern Democrats.  The Republicans claimed they were protecting American industry but they were actually protecting themselves, since Republican voters owned the majority of the industrial United States.  Democrats countered with the fact that tariffs only brought harm to the South. Southerners had to buy imported goods at high prices and they had to buy expensive domestic goods as well because American manufacturers were raising their prices in response to no foreign competition.  In addition, Southerners had difficulty selling their agricultural goods in an angry foreign market.  The Southern Democrats fought hard against any and all tariffs because they knew it was the key to the South's survival.  It was no wonder why the residents of Rockbridge  County were against the bill passing.

It all began in 1828 when Congress enacted the so-called Tariff of Abominations. Many Southerners thought the highly protective tariff was detrimental to agrarian interests.  Under the leadership of John C. Calhoun, South Carolina stated that a national tariff was unconstitutional when it benefited some states and not others.  To ease tension, President Andrew Jackson lowered the tariff in July 1832.  It was not enough.  ","In November of 1832, South Carolina's Nullification Convention met and pronounced both tariffs unconstitutional as well as unenforceable.  If the national government made any attempt to enforce the tariff, South Carolina would secede from the Union.  In response, Jackson sent the tactical strategist Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott and \"five additional companies of Artillery and two companies of the fourth regiment of Infantry\" to Charleston.  On December 10, 1832, Jackson sent a message to South Carolina declaring its actions \"inconsistent\" and \"incompatible.\"  ","While South Carolina reacted vehemently to the tariff, many Virginians demurred.  South     Carolina's governor James Hamilton mentioned that Nullification was a \"peaceful and constitutional\" remedy.  The Lynchburg Virginian, however, scoffed at his diction and saw war and revolution ahead, not peace.  Governor Hamilton readied the State Guard in Charleston and requested the removal of U.S. troops from the state citadel in Charleston.  The paper claimed, \" war is no children's game - least of all, civil war, in which personal revenge is so apt to mingle with the public quarrel.\"  Though Lynchburg was against the actions of its Southern neighbor, Whigs in Richmond were inclined toward Nullification.  In the coming years, Virginia's divisive tendencies would play a more important role."," After the threat of military action, South Carolina agreed to compromise and a much lower tariff was passed in 1833.

The author of the editorial aimed to inspire political support for the Democratic politician Grover Cleveland while describing the fundamental differences between the Democratic and Republican Parties of the 1890's. According to the author, Cleveland's ability to provide justice without offering paternalistic help or hindrance, coupled with his bold stance on tariff reform, made him a human embodiment of Democratic principles.","Overall, the editorial distinguished the political philosophies of the Republican and Democratic Parties preceding the American presidential election of 1892. As a whole, Republicans of the 1890s believed in using the federal government to direct economic expansion. Most felt that it was the business of the government to take complete control of the country's economic development. This activist position was illustrated in the Republicans' support of the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which increased the protective tariff for American businesses. According to historian Davis Dewey, for Republicans, \"restrictive duties were no longer regarded as a temporary stage in the arduous journey toward industrial freedom, but a principle which ought to be permanently adopted.\" The McKinley Tariff was a source of great discontent for many Americans because it raised the prices of goods while lowering the wages of lower- and middle-class Americans. In contrast, Democrats of the 1890s believed \"that it was the duty of the people to take care of the government; that the just function of the government was to protect every man in his rights and allow him the freedom to achieve his density in his own way.\" The Democratic opposition to protective tariffs illustrated their anti-government attitude. According to the <em>Campaign Text Book of the Democratic Party for the Presidential Election of 1892</em>, \"Democrats firmly believed that protective tariffs favored foreigners at the expense of Americans.\" Thus, Democrats argued that the government had no right to impose such tariffs, and those that transcended this limit were essentially guilty of robbery. Clearly, the issue of protective tariffs illuminated the key differences between the free-market Democrats and protectionist Republicans."],"display_date":"December 22, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-22","locations":[{"id":13920,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4008,"title":"Renaissance of the Oyster Industry\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-01-01","end_date":"1895-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"We will be unable to give our children any remnant of our patrimony unless the whole oyster industry is restored without delay.\"  William K. Brooks wrote these words in 1891, fifty-six years and 400,000,000 bushels of oysters after the beginning of commercial oyster revolution.  The natural beds of the Chesapeake were being depleted so rapidly that Brooks predicted a complete extinction of \"a free gift from bounteous nature.\"  \"Our indifference and lack of foresight, and our blind trust in our natural advantages, have brought this grand inheritance to the verge of ruin.\"  Despite this, Brooks believed that there was a solution: oyster harvesting.  \"An army\" of laborers must assemble and begin farming oysters, just as one would grow wheat or cotton. According to Brooks, \"our opportunities for rearing oysters are unparalleled in any other part of the world.\"  The seed for future economic and financial improvement had been planted.","            In 1895, James B. Baylor submitted to the governor of Virginia an idea based on the 439-page survey of the \"natural oyster beds, rocks and shoals\" that would not only revive the oyster industry but also bring significant funds to the ailing Virginia treasury.  Of the entire Chesapeake Bay, only 201,216.3 acres were considered to be natural oyster beds.  Outside of this, however, remained 400,000 acres of \"barren area\" that, under Section 2137 of the Code of Virginia, could be subdivided and rented to farmers for cultivation.  Baylor suggested a series of laws that, through the mandatory use of \"labor-saving appliances\" (acquired from states such as Maryland, which already had an established system of deep-water oyster harvesting) and the implementation of license taxes, would greatly improve the oyster industry and significantly increase state revenue.  Not only would everyone in the Commonwealth benefit from these laws, but also the success of oyster harvesting, which those in William Brooks' day feared might end, could be guaranteed for generations to come.  ","            Since these times, \"the shellfish aquaculture industry in Virginia has added significant value to the State's seafood marketplace.\"  Even today, notes the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, \"watermen continue to harvest both hard clams and oysters from the State's public resources.\"  Were it not for the efforts of the scientists of the late nineteenth century, however, the entire shellfish industry might have perished.

Following the cigar manufacturers' strike in Key  West that same year, Florida was forced to recognize cigars as a major agricultural product.  The opportunities that the cigar industry offered, as well as the profits, made cigar factories in Florida as valuable as tobacco plantations in colonial Jamestown.  In <em>Old South, New South</em>, Gavin Wright contends that \"the interest in keeping the southern labor market isolated disappeared after the Civil War, giving the forces that sought to promote industrial development the upper hand, and tending to integrate the southern labor market into the national one.\"  Such integration of the southern economy into the northern economy after the Civil War explains the success of cigar factories and why they became so significant to southern economy in the nineteenth century. ","As stated by Wright, the \"New South's\" dependence on industrialization forced cigar manufacturers to look elsewhere for employment after the 1890 strike in Key West.  They shifted their focus from Key West to cities like Tampa, Punta Gorda, and Charlotte  Harbor in hopes of gaining access to more job opportunities.  ","The shift in the focus of the cigar factories caused the surrounding cities to set their sights on securing lands for the cigar industry.  The article urged each town to secure at least one or two factories.  Key West launched this local project in order to draw attention to the new direction that the state was pursuing in regards to the growing cigar industry.  The large-scale manufacturing activities of the cigar industry in Florida made cigars a very important financial resource.  ","Paula Harper, associate professor at the University of Miami, traced the beginnings of the booming cigar industry to the \"exodus\" of Cubans into Key West near the start of the nineteenth century.  From there, the cigar industry became extremely pivotal in the economic, social, and political aspects of nineteenth century Florida.  This continued to be a trend until the mid-twentieth century, when cigar consumption severely declined.  The successful industrial transition from the \"Old South\" to the \"New South\" can be explained by the success of industries like cigar manufacturing.  Such an explanation allowed the \"most backward and impoverished section of the United States\" to equal the productivity of its northern counterpart."],"display_date":"January 1, 1890","search_date":"1890-01-01","locations":[{"id":1432,"lat":24.6544423073,"lng":-81.6949104117,"zoom":8,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4021,"title":"Farm for Sale\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-16","end_date":"1856-05-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 16, 1856, John Cooke posted an advertisement in the <em>Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser </em>to sell his farm in King William County, Virginia.

Cooke stressed the fact that along this steamboats river ran straight to Norfolk, Virginia, optimal for farmers who wanted to move grain.  Cooke's farm consisted of 681 acres, 350 of which were in cultivation.  Cooke said that the rest of his acreage was timbered, and was good for chopping wood.

Compiled by Stuart McD. Farrar, the census polled residents of the county on June 30, 1850 and organized the data by household. Each household was numbered and every person who lived in the house was included within the family. Each family had to report every person who lived in the house as well as their gender, age, and place of birth. Additionally, the census reported the value of each estate, occupation of the residents, and the number of slaves on each farm. ","    The information that illustrated what kind of citizens owned slaves revealed much about the social hierarchy of Appomattox County. While most household heads reported their main occupation as either laborer or farmer, very few concluded that they owned more than one slave. In fact, those households that owned at least fifty slaves or more typically reported an additional primary occupation, such as the Flood family, where Henry D. Flood, the head of the family, was an attorney. Additionally, very few masters who owned at least fifty slaves were under the age of fifty. Most families were incredibly young, such as Major and Jettrina Powell, both under age twenty-five. The Powells owned no slaves and resided in Appomattox County as a family starting their new life together.  ","    It is clear from the census that Appomattox County, unlike certain areas of Virginia, was a region of developing infrastructure. While the central Virginia town of Lynchburg had one of the most successful regional tobacco markets, western counties like Appomattox were more focused on self-sufficient farming. Several farms grew tobacco in order to earn more income, but few farmers made a large profit. Competition with the wealthier Virginia counties that produced cash crops was not possible, and so the area was mostly home to families who had established themselves as yeoman farmers.

Eli Thayer for the free white recolonization of Old Virginia has revived the agitation of a great question which will never be stopped until the old State is revolutionized, repopulated, and restored to something of her ancient glory in the Union.\"  Indeed, Eli Thayer and his Homestead Emigration Company had, since his tour of western Virginia in 1856, eyed this region as potential land for his settlement of free, non-slaveholding whites.  Thayer was thus attempting to carry out his \"Plan of Freedom.\"  The newspaper had discovered that \"landowners of Virginia have offered over five million of acres to Eli Thayer, 'as cheap as dirt,' for cash.\" ","            Amongst this, Thayer could have relied upon several other sources of encouragement for his new colony.  The Mormon settlements in Illinois and Impresarios in Texas both demonstrated the successes of mass movements.  The migration of white settlers to western Virginia was not a novel exploit.  In Upshur County, New England farmers and stockmen had already settled the French Creek community in the early nineteenth century.  Thayer's own partner, John C. Underwood, had migrated from New York to a Clarke County dairy farm where he prosperously hired only free labor.","            Thayer and Underwood preferred to enable a large migration that could provide sufficient internal discipline to withstand pressures to \"become orthodox on the slavery question.\"  They wanted to provide a \"test of cultures\" so that free labor would promote the eradication of slavery.  Both Underwood and Thayer privately predicted that economic prosperity in a free labor society would show that unlike slaves, free laborers \"neither malinger, nor intentionally misunderstand, neither 'run away' nor 'steal ham and chickens.'\"  Underwood conceded that white migrants would push 'perhaps inferior' blacks from the Upper South to the \"cursed Lower South.\"  He wrote that because of slavery's \"injurious effects to the white race\" that Virginia should be \"deAfricanized & settled by white men with all the energy, love of Freedom, order, & education characterizing the Anglo-Saxon Race.\"","            The <em>New York Herald</em>, Thayer believed, would be essential to his success, because it had a large circulation within the slave states and its editor avoided \"inflammatory pronouncements on the slavery issue.\"  The paper clearly states its support for Thayer: \"Eli Thayer is now about trying the experiment of waking up the old State to her senses.  Depleted, poor, and crippled with debts, she is now in a good frame of mind for the application of the remedies of common sense.\"  Other papers, such as the <em>Wellsburg Herald</em>, expressed convictions that the people of western Virginia would accept the introduction of free labor.  Thus in the fall of 1857, Thayer established and began physical development of an industrial town in Wayne County where white New England emigrants worked as free laborers.  He named it Ceredo, after the Roman goddess of agricultural fertility, Ceres.  ","            The experiment would eventually fail when money came into short supply from national economic depression and the inability of some investors in Thayer and Underwood's company to contribute.  Both men had certainly \"tried the question,\" but never truly posed any threat to the Southern slave system.  Yet, as historian William Freehling noted, Thayer and Underwood emphasized that the buying, selling, and working of land, not the buying, selling, and working of slaves fueled most economic interests in the Upper South.  By introducing southern upper class land sellers to northern middle-class land buyers, Underwood and Thayer's company attempted to boost the economy.  Underwood once promised to a western Virginia entrepreneur that \"my northerners will double the value of your lands, make your neglected hillsides bloom with cultivation\" lead \"your hitherto neglected waterpower\" to ring \"with the music of the wheel,...and cause your desert to bloom like a rose.\""],"display_date":"April 21, 1857 - December 31, 1868","search_date":"1863-02-24","locations":[{"id":14833,"lat":38.1460994742,"lng":-82.4270334246,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4030,"title":"The Unexplored Riches of West Virginia\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-04-10","end_date":"1876-04-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"I may perhaps startle and astonish gentlemen upon this floor when I assert that West Virginia, the variety, quality and magnitude of her coal-fields and in the extent and quality of her iron ores, is capable of becoming, for its territorial area, one of the most productive States of this Union.\"  Representative Charles Faulkner of West Virginia, in his April 1876 address to the United States House of Representatives, argued in favor of a joint resolution between Congress and the West Virginia House of Delegates.  The bill he discussed (H.R. 3022) determined appropriations for improvements to the Kanawha River and its tributaries, the Elk River and the New River, the Big Sandy River, and the Monongahela River.  He believed that such improvements would allow the state to capitalize on its natural resources, which had previously been isolated from market contact due in part to inadequate transportation facilities.  ","Though the wealth that existed in West Virginia's fertile lands was publicly known, no significant effort was made to \"realize its commercial value.\"  With the growth of settlement in the antebellum years, transportation along roads and waterways became a critical concern for isolated western Virginians.  Rivers and streams, however, proved difficult to navigate due to low water levels in summer, ice in winter, and year-round flooding.  Nevertheless, inland routes such as the Ohio River carried more coal than any other product.  ","Out of the many coal-producing states, western Virginia was one of two that was in a position to take advantage of markets both along the coast and along the interior.  Yet, because it had not developed channels for the distribution of coal by neither canal nor railroad, West Virginia's Kanawha coal fields had outlet only through the Kanawha River.  The Kanawha Company attempted to keep the river clear of rocks and snags, yet it had not made the improvements necessary to permit uninterrupted shipments of coal to the Ohio River.","Faulkner recognized the statements of Mr. Bell, president of the Iron and Steel Institute, the London Daily Advertiser and the British Quarterly, which spoke of the decline of British iron and coal empires.  He noted their claims that the United States would become the only nation that could supply the world's demand for coal and iron.  Faulkner illuminated his belief that West Virginia could satisfy these growing international demands.  He stated, \"doubtless there are many sections of the Union from which large contributions can be made; but where upon this continent is the coal and iron region to be found that can justly compare with West Virginia?  Where is the state or country that in the variety, richness, and manufacturing quality of its coal can rival those wonderful deposits, which are comprehended in our sixteen thousand square miles of exhaustless wealth?\"  ","  Though West Virginia had never before been a dominant supplier of coal, the improvements that Faulkner eagerly supported would finally allow the coal industry in the Kanawha region to become a chief factor in the state's economy.  Only then could the West Virginia coal industry claim its share of competition in the nation's coal market.  As Faulkner asserted, \"for heavy articles like iron and coal no mode of transportation can compare in cheapness to that of water, and when, under the benign auspices  of this Government, our rivers shall be cleared of their obstructions and made capable of floating upon their surface our rich products to market, we shall bid defiance to competition and feel that we are prepared \"to stand up against a world in arms.\"  "],"display_date":"April 10, 1876","search_date":"1876-04-10","locations":[{"id":14656,"lat":38.3365622006,"lng":-81.528129492,"zoom":9,"place":"KANAWHA, West Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4031,"title":"Gradual Abolition of Slavery in Western Virginia\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-09-01","end_date":"1847-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1831, the issue of slavery came to the forefront of political debate following Nat Turner's rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia.  President of Washington College and slaveholder Dr. Henry Ruffner delivered an address in 1847 that outlined the evils of slavery and proposed the gradual eradication of slavery from western Virginia.  In correspondence to Messrs. Moore, Letcher, &c, Ruffner wrote, \"as we are nearly all slaveholders, and none of us approve of the principles and measures of the sect of abolitionists, we think that no man can be offended with us for offering to the people an argument whose sole object is to show that the prosperity of our West Virginia-if not East Virginia also,--would be promoted by removing gradually the institution of slavery, in a manner consistent with the rights and interests of slaveholders.\"  He delivered this speech first to the Franklin Literary Society of Lexington, Virginia, at the close of debates on the division of the state of Virginia.  Ruffner afterwards compiled his emancipation argument into the \"Ruffner pamphlet,\" which made its debut in September 1847.  Throughout his speech, Ruffner rejected the extremes of both abolitionism and pro-slavery extremism, claiming the \"middle way.\"","Unlike the abolitionists, who objected to slavery on moral grounds, Ruffner objected to the economic problems that slavery created.  His protest matched that of trans-Allegheny legislators who called slavery the sure route to economic stagnation.  In western counties, such as the Kanawha Valley, where Ruffner spent his childhood, slavery was not profitable and often took jobs from white laborers.  He argued that, \"our own West Virginia furnishes conclusive evidence, that slavery....has a pernicious influence on the public welfare.\"  Most people in western Virginia engaged in livestock and small farming operations where slavery was not economical.  Industries, such as the Kanawha salt industry, leased and hired slaves, often from eastern Virginia, for lower wages than white laborers demanded.  Any such encouragement to the growth of slave population west of the Blue Ridge, Ruffner felt, was dangerous to the free labor population.  He compared the slave states with free states to provide concrete examples of his logic-\"In the older free states are seen all tokens of prosperity....  In the older parts of the slave states, -with a few local exceptions,-are seen, on the contrary, too evident signs of stagnation or of positive decay....\"  Thus, as Ruffner reasoned, the institution of slavery would not allow the western Virginian economy to prosper.  It was on this basis that Ruffner placed his overall argument.","Ruffner united his discussion of slavery with the \"white basis\" for representation in the legislature, asserting that the two were intertwined.  Representation in the Virginia General Assembly favored eastern Virginia over its western counterpart due to the imbalance of slave populations.  Indeed, western politicians were bitter against east Virginia for using their power to retain the mixed basis of representation and to deny to western Virginia its rights.  Ruffner's argument was coherent with the general sentiments of westerners at the time who attacked both the practice of unequal representation and the institution of slavery.  In them, they saw the sole causes of their political degradation and of their arrested social and economic development.  Historian Charles Ambler noted that \"arguments opposing and supporting these two extremes were poured forth in profusion in the Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830 and in the assembly of 1831-1832, where the expediency of legislating upon the abolition of negro slavery was the chief subject of discussion.\"  Ruffner reminded his audience of the measure introduced in Virginia's legislature proposing gradual emancipation:  \"and so the people of West Virginia then thought, for they were generally and warmly in favor of it, and zealously advocated it through their able and patriotic Delegates.  But in spite of their efforts, it was rejected by the all powerful Eastern majority, though several Eastern delegates joined the West in its support.\" ","In the conclusion of his argument for the necessity of action to remove the institution of slavery from West Virginia, Ruffner outlined a scheme for such a removal with six major components.  He proposed foremost that further importation of slaves be prohibited and that the exportation of slaves be freely permitted (with the exception that children of slaves born after a certain day, not be exported after they had reached five years of age).  Next, he advised that the existing generation of slaves remain in their present condition (but that their offspring born after a certain day should be emancipated at no later than 25 years of age).  Furthermore, Ruffner felt that masters should be required to teach the \"heirs of emancipation\" reading, writing and arithmetic, that the emancipated slaves be colonized, and finally, that the law allow any county to decree the removal or emancipation of all slaves of the county within a certain term of years.  ","  It was not until eighteen months after Ruffner's death, when the Union admitted West Virginia as a legal state, that its constitution provided for a gradual emancipation plan similar to the system proposed by Ruffner.  The legal emancipation of slaves in West Virginia did not take place until February 3, 1865, when the governor approved an act abolishing slavery, providing for the immediate emancipation of all slaves.  They had finally taken the course of action that Ruffner had called for--\"Now fellow citizens, it is for you to determine whether the slavery question shall be considered, discussed and decided, at this critical, this turning point of your country's history...may heaven direct your minds to the course dictated by patriotism, by humanity and by your own true interest.\"  "],"display_date":"September 1847","search_date":"1847-09-15","locations":[{"id":14232,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4032,"title":"Radicalism vs. Rationality\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-15","end_date":"1832-12-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On Saturday, December 15, 1832, the <em>Virginia Herald</em> expressed its grief over the Nullification Crisis with the words, \"alarming as the crisis...is, we cling to the hope, that for the sake of humanity and the honor of our country and her institutions, that means of averting the impending storm may yet be devised...\" While regretting the approaching conflict, the Virginia newspaper never showed support for the doctrine of nullification. Instead, the publication printed both South Carolina and President Jackson's addresses, presenting both sides of the issue. Although it expressed its belief in the sanctity of the Constitution, the newspaper never alluded to whether it approved more of Jackson or South Carolina's constitutional theory. Virginia, like several other Southern states, often struggled to reconcile her beliefs in state sovereignty and in preservation of the Union. However, fearing the damage a military confrontation would cause, the paper expressed desperate desire for compromise stating, \"In common with our countrymen, we shall consider civil bloodshed as to be the most direful calamity that can possibly befall this free and happy land.\"  "," Early in President Jackson's administration, Congress passed the protective tariff of 1828, which quickly came to be known to the South as the \"Tariff of Abominations.\" The tariff intended to protect Northern industry from competing European goods by placing a higher tax on such products. Cotton planters felt the tariff explicitly alienated them because it made their cost of living more expensive and greatly diminished Great Britain's cotton imports. Although the tariff was abrasive to all Southern states, under the leadership of Vice President and states' rights champion, John C. Calhoun, South Carolina led the rally against it. Calling the tariff unconstitutional because it failed to promote the general welfare, Calhoun called for nullification, a doctrine that allowed states to void federal legislation if it breached the constitutional contract made between the states and the federal government. Taking an immediate stand against nullification President Jackson exclaimed, \"...the power to annul a law ... is incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the...Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive for the great object for which it was formed.\" "," At the start of the crisis, most Southern states shared South Carolina's hatred of the tariff, but never quite embraced the radicalism of nullification. The attitude the <em>Virginia Herald</em> took in December 1832 was characteristic of the rest Southern states' feelings about the crisis. These states relied on their representatives in Congress to rectify the tariff issue instead of taking matters into their own hands.  While they were ardent supporters of states' rights, most were unwilling to risk bloodshed, or worse, separation from the Union in favor of nullification. Most Southern states viewed this method as Alabama's legislature did, \"unsound in theory, and dangerous in practise.\" Instead, the majority of the South favored a logical compromise to the sectional controversy. Nevertheless, December 1832 marked a volatile month in politics, giving birth to unprecedented radicalism, thus stimulating a call for Southern rationality.

Between this and the ability of the cotton gin to enable a profit from lesser-grade, short-staple Southern cotton rose to the nation's top cash crop by 1830.  Due to the increase in demand for labor and no legal slave importation, deep Southern planters turned to Maryland and Virginia to supply labor.  Merchants like James Brady came into the picture here, buying and selling slaves for a profit on a route between Washington, D.C. and New Orleans.  According to Michael Tadman's <em>Speculators and Slaves</em>, states with large populations like Virginia exported slaves to the expanding southern cotton and (in Louisiana's case) sugar states.  When the international slave trade ended in 1807, dependence on states like Virginia grew greatly, leaving traders like James Brady in a position to turn quite a profit.  Treating black people like property, individuals such as James Brady separated children from their mothers, endearing dealers to no one North or South. ","Looking over his financial records and personal letters, James Brady was no Simon Legree, the evil slave trader from Harriet Beecher Stowe's <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em>.  James Brady kept thorough financial records and took advantage of a business opportunity.  Because individuals like him had to be callous at times, it was easy to personify all the ills of slavery into one form, thus actually delaying a critical look at the peculiar institution."],"display_date":"May 8, 1829 - July 25, 1832","search_date":"1830-12-15","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4041,"title":"Virginia Gazette: Epic of a Small-Time Newspaper\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-01-07","end_date":"1826-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A man swept into a dimly lit tavern and muttered, \"Whiskey,\" in a hoarse voice before collapsing into a creaky wooden chair.

Though he was not the founding father with the same name, this John Adams led an equally compelling life as a free black contractor and plasterer in Richmond.  He was also one of the extremely few African Americans in the South who owned a substantial amount of property before the Civil War.  Now, seven and a half years after Appomattox, John Adams was dead.  Sensing its approach, he filled out his will on January 8, 1873, just six days before his demise.  In his will, before laying out his possessions, he stated that he wished his debts to be paid.  Everyone immediately swooped in on John's son Joseph, the new holder of the Adams estate.  Barely a month after the loss, a mister Samuel Adams, with the leverage of a justice of the peace, forced Joseph to cover a debt of 73.50, rather paltry in light of the Adams family's wealth.

Bacon, a writer for \"The Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery\" published a statistical pamphlet in 1859 reflecting African American advancements in the nation's first capital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He acquired the statistics by examining the number of blacks associated with particular institutions. Bacon hoped to illustrate his belief that African Americans, just like white men, women, and children could enjoy the rewards of economic progress if given the opportunities of every citizen. The introduction of the new liberties and opportunities provided a chance for growth among the members of the black population in a time which faced great segregation and racism. ","The overall culture of Philadelphia in the 1830s through the 1850s rewarded many blacks who witnessed a new era of political ideology. During this time the city established new liberties such as access to a variety of schools for their children, decreased numbers in convicted persons, and also increased opportunities in mechanical trades. The new possibilities provided a foundation for greater achievement and acceptance into the dominant white culture that encompassed the United States. ","African American children received new opportunities to attend public, private, and reformatory schools. The schools had been refurbished to provide an improved atmosphere for learning. The education efforts afforded to many of the African American students is undeniably associated with Protestant reform. Perhaps one of the most prominent schools for black children was the House of Refuge for Colored Children, established in Philadelphia in 1850. Walter Trattner, a twentieth century scholar, expressed the popular opinion shared by many whites in the North during this time period: \"…in an attempt to cope with the disturbing social and economic conditions and to restore a sense of community to urban America, moralism succeeded benevolence, public aid and private charity were transformed into mechanisms for social control\". The foundation of this school allowed young African American inmates to move out of prison and into reform schools.","The level of tension between races may also be witnessed within the labor market. In 1838, the number of occupations made available to African Americans spanned across 134 categories in Philadelphia. In these categories, 997 consisted of African American workers. Historian Cecil Frey pointed out that in the late eighteenth century the slaves and free men were encouraged to participate in mechanical trades which increased competition between black and white communities. The encouragement did not last long, and according to Benjamin Bacon a majority of the workers within the trades were forced to desert their trades because of increased racial prejudice throughout the city. Few exceptions existed in this community; James Forten, being one of them, was still given boundaries to stand within regards to his 'natural' status. ","The most significant numbers revealed within the pamphlet seem to portray an ambivalent step towards leniency in African American sentencing. The proportion of white men versus African American men in the Philadelphia county prison switched from an equal level in 1835 to almost three white men to one black man in 1858. Willliam J. Mullen, a prison agent, stated within the pamphlet, \"To myself it seems the above list shows the conditions, moral, and civil, of the colored race, to have greatly improved within the last 23 years, and to be far higher at this moment than it was at the commencement of that period.\" At quick glance this assumption seems to be true, but as mentioned previously, the decline in number of African Americans in prison can also be attributed to the opening of the House of Refuge for Colored Children, which took the children out of prison and put them into reform school."],"display_date":"1835 - 1839","search_date":"1837-07-01","locations":[{"id":11227,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4053,"title":"Crop Diversity in Agricultural Virginia\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-07-31","end_date":"1824-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["        \"You wish to know how the Virginians live\" wrote L.W. Howe to his brother John, of Enfield, Massachusetts on July 31, 1824. In meeting his brother's request, L.W. certainly provided an extensive account of the principal facets of life in the state of Virginia. Not only did he recount that the preferred beverage of the state was Whiskey, but he was mystified by the details of cooking because the process was all done in a \"separate house called a kitchen.\" What a strange concept to those hailing from the wintry climate of New England, where a trip outdoors to a separate building was absurd The most palpable aspect of Howe's letter, however, is the prominent role of agriculture and climate in central Virginian life. He noted that the \"wheat has come in very well and the prospect for corn is as good as it every was.\" Yet, when he discussed tobacco Howe displayed concern, in that \"the present prospect is promising, but it is a precarious crop.\" After he bemoaned the \"oppressive heat\" in the state, he promised his brother a copy of the Franklin Almanac when the new edition was published. In describing, \"how the Virginians live,\" the New Englander emphasized not their dress or manner, but instead the weather, soil, and crop yields that dictated planter life in the Commonwealth. ","    By the 1820s tobacco had brought wealth to Virginia for two hundred years. Throughout this time period it made its way from the Tidewater region to the Piedmont and became the central economic factor that brought wealth to the state. Howe's discussions of the climate and the Franklin Almanac were common amongst Virginians, who relied so heavily upon agriculture. The Panic of 1819, however, hit the southern states hard. Along with the plummeting of cotton rates came the decline of other agriculture products, including tobacco. Howe understood that Virginians were no longer able to depend on tobacco as a single cash crop. Aside from the concerns of the fluctuating market, tobacco itself depleted the soil and would not grow in the same area for more than three to four years. This made it significantly less profitable when the crop prices were low. According to Joseph A. CotÉ, in the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</em>, a lack of crop diversity was a danger to the \"overall development of the South.\" Virginia farmers came to this same conclusion and shifted to other agricultural endeavors such as wheat and corn to supplant their livelihoods. As hardship became more commonplace, farmers found it necessary to provide food for their families and slaves. Wheat and corn comprised a significant portion of the crops grown throughout the state. After the economic difficulties surrounding the Embargo Act of 1807, the War of 1812, and most prominently the Panic of 1819, planters could no longer safely rely on the tobacco market to provide for all of their needs.

In particular, there were still a disproportionate amount of railroads in the West and North compared to the South. The attempts to remedy the disparity had been largely unsuccessful up until this point. State legislatures gave railroad subsidies to companies hoping to spur railroad development; while the subsidies did add railroad lines throughout the South, the companies also abused the subsidies, using them for other purposes. Also, the lines were owned almost exclusively by companies in the North, so their effects on the Southern economy were limited.

As many Confederate soldiers deserted and returned to their families, General Robert E. Lee appealed to their \"honor and duty\" by presenting only two options: \"war [or] abject submission.\" The only logical choice seemed to be a continuation of the fight for self-government at any cost. Lee offered pardon to any man \"improperly absent\" as long as he returned \"within the shortest possible time within 20 days.\" He declared that \"no general amnesty [would] again be granted\" in this final effort to reabsorb deserters into the Army of the Confederacy. Unfortunately for Lee, offering a sweeping pardon did not significantly recoup his dwindling supply of men still willing to fight.","Historians have pointed to desertion as one of the primary reasons for the South's defeat in the Civil War. The notion of the Civil War being a \"rich man's war, and a poor man's fight\" was a huge factor in desertion rates. One school of thought believes that as the war progressed, the yeoman farmers who were doing the majority of the fighting came to resent the planter aristocracy that was often exempted from military service due to various Confederate policies. The war became increasingly difficult, and many soldiers deserted due to economics, family, and personal sentiments. The less a man identified with the cause he was fighting for, the more likely he was to desert. Yeoman farmers did not own slaves, and the principles of slavery were not worth fighting and dying for as the war proceeded. In the final months of the war, desertion rates escalated as it became clear that the South would not emerge the victors.","James McPherson examines the Confederate soldier's experience through various diaries and letters and disagrees with this position. McPherson claims that Confederate men did not gain the conventional disillusionment and cynicism that would logically lead to desertion. The sources that he examines show soldiers continuing to assert the importance of the ideals they were fighting for throughout the conflict. Reasons for fighting would include defending their government, their manhood, their families, and their comrades. Although the reasons for desertion are clearly a subject of great debate among historians, it is clear that desertion made it increasingly difficult to pursue the collective goals of the Confederacy on the battlefield and inevitably contributed to Lee's surrender several months later."],"display_date":"February 15, 1865","search_date":"1865-02-15","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4106,"title":"Manufacturing in post-War Mississippi\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-07-01","end_date":"1875-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Did we learn anything from the War?  The <em>Natchez Weekly Democrat, </em>a local newspaper located in Natchez,  Mississippi, asked this question of its readers in more polite terms.  In July, 1875, the newspaper lamented the lack of economic development in the form of manufacturing over the previous years in the surrounding area.  Southerners in all parts of the former Confederacy were aware that the lack of manufacturing capability outside of the state of Virginia had given the North too great of an advantage during the war.  Without citing any specific examples, the paper stated that very little had changed about the local economy in the past decade.  ","Besides the obvious lack of slave labor, Natchez and surrounding environs remained largely agricultural, with no significant manufacturing sector to speak of.  An examination of both the 1870 and 1880 United States census data (which measured the amount of capital invested in manufacturing in dollars) supports the newspaper's claim.  In 1870, there was 4,501,714 invested in manufacturing in Mississippi.  Ten years later, this figure had only grown to 4,727,600, an increase of merely 225,886.  This amounts to an increase of approximately five percent over the 1870 level in the following decade, which is far behind usual growth patterns.  This lack of manufacturing growth means that very few new jobs were created.  The livelihoods of former slaves and poor whites were still largely based in agriculture, but they very rarely owned their own land and instead contributed to the vast increase in the practice of sharecropping.  Natchez was far from unusual in the South.  By 1880, the Southern states accounted for roughly the same percentage of industrial development nationwide as they had before the war.  The South's industrial development continued to lag behind the country as a whole and would well into the twentieth century.

Flagler was one of the wealthiest men in the world.  He was a partner in the Standard Oil Company with John D. Rockefeller and Flagler spent much of his wealth on expanding the state of Florida.  In the winter of 1884, Flagler came to St. Augustine, Florida to spend his honeymoon with his second wife.  The city left a mark on Flagler and he returned in March of 1885 just in time for St. Augustine's annual Ponce de Leon celebration.  Each year the city of St. Augustine would put on a great pageant to celebrate the landing of Ponce de Leon in Florida.  The celebration so impressed Flagler he was inspired to build a luxury hotel, The Ponce de Leon hotel.  Along with the young architect Thomas Hastings, Flagler had a big part in helping to create the plans for the hotel.","The Ponce de Leon hotel formally opened to the public on January 10, 1888.  The hotel cost two and a half million dollars and in its time it was reputed to be one of the finest hotels in the world.  The hotel attracted the wealthy and, President Grover Cleveland attended a ball held at the Ponce de Leon hotel.  In the year the hotel opened, the city's population almost doubled.  Flagler continued to expand the city building two more hotels, the Alcazar and the Cordova, across the street from the Ponce de Leon in the same season.  When Flagler realized transportation to the hotels to the south of Florida was difficult, he turned his attention to building railroads in Florida.","The Ponce de Leon was so well-built it still stands today.  In 1968, after 11 million dollars worth of restoration, the Ponce de Leon reopened as Flagler College, a small liberal arts college named for the man who originally built it.  Flagler's crew constructed the hotel so soundly it has survived all hurricanes that have passed through since 1888.  ","Henry Flagler made a huge mark on the state of Florida.  One of his most impressive structures still stands as a primary structure in the historical city of St. Augustine: The Ponce de Leon hotel.  Though it is now Flagler College, Floridians will remember it for the man who originally created it. Flagler's initial building of the hotel changed the history of Florida as it sparked Flagler to build many hotels all over Florida and railroads to transport tourists throughout Florida.

This crisis was the passage of the Nullification Ordinances by the South Carolina State Assembly in November of 1832.  The unity and survival of the nation depended upon President Andrew Jackson's response.  On December 10, 1832, President Jackson presented his response to the Congress, arguing that the justification for state nullification of federal laws was misguided, unconstitutional, and treasonous to the country.   Jackson began his proclamation by outlining the reasons and reservations that led South Carolina to pass the ordinance; their major concerns were the tariffs of May 29, 1828 and June 14, 1832.  South Carolina believed these measures were unfair and didn't fall within the constitutional power of Congress to raise revenue; they proclaimed the laws null and void and threatened succession.  In his address, Jackson showed that the doctrine of nullification was \"incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.\"   First, he posited that South Carolina's objections based on stated powers and fairness were misguided and incorrect because the Constitution gave Congress the \"discretionary power\" to raise revenue by taxation.  Next, Jackson argued the Constitution joined the states into a single nation, and \"in becoming parts of a nation...they surrender many of their essential parts of sovereignty.\"  Thus, secession was wholly unconstitutional because it is an affront to national authority.  Finally, Jackson warned the people of South Carolina, who he believed were tricked into nullification by political and social leaders, that any action of \"disunion, by force, is treason.\"  He made an emotional appeal for these people to see the error of their position.  His address ends with a hope that the nation will survive and be reconciled by reasonableness and harmony, but also an assurance that it will be reconciled by force, if necessary.  ","    President's Jackson's speech came at a crucial time during his presidency; he had just been elected to a second term, but already his popular and political support was flagging.  But, according to historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Jackson's handling of the nullification crisis and his resolve to ensure the survival of the union, both evident in the December speech, gained him temporary \"popular acclaim,\" making him the \"country's hero.\"  Jackson, a shrewd political, turned his new popularity into a political weapon to further the other policies of his administration, most notably his continued war against the Bank of the United States.  Jackson's speech and eventual handling of the nullification crisis were viewed, by the majority of the nation, as the actions of a strong leader dedicated to the nation and its survival; he used this renewed trust to further the political goals of his presidency.

This was a road that led to economic prosperity for the South.  This was the Blue Ridge Railroad.  In 1860, the President of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, Edward Frost, in a report to the stockholders and the state legislature, reported on the condition and growth of the line, proposed a plan for its expansion, and requested renewed assistance from the government of South Carolina.  Frost started his report with a proposition to finish the railroad form Walhalla, S.C. to Clayton, S.C. Then, he reported on the past development of the railroad; noting that from 1859 to 1860, the government instructed and only provided the company with enough of a grant, 310,000, to finish the line up to Walhalla.  The railroad was initially planned to run all along the Southeast, from South Carolina to Knoxville, Tennessee.  But, the company ran into work stoppages and reduced state funding in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.  In this report, Frost proposed that the South Carolina legislature provide funding to finish the line to Clayton.  He argued that this would provide the other surrounding state governments with the incentive to fund the completion of the other proposed sections of the railroad, the sections in western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and northwest Georgia.  But, the railroad would have to be finished to Clayton, because it was a connecting city to these other areas.  According to the report, the completion of the road would be a major economic advantage, linking markets throughout the South.  Frost argued that the completed road would make this section of the South competitive with Northern industry and transportation.  Frost estimated the cost of the line from Walhalla to Clayton at about 1.5 million to 2 million and the total cost of the road to Knoxville at 4.5 million.  He asked the state legislature to provide 1 million in bonds to continue construction to Clayton.  Finally, Frost made a plea to his stockholders:  \"...in case the work should be discontinued, the officers of this company should be exempt from any aspersions of bad judgment or ill faith...\"  This report was intended to show his proposition and his plan, but if the state legislature didn't grant the bonds, Frost wanted to ensure the security of his position. ","    There was a major disparity in railroad transportation between the North and South; this lack of a developed transportation system would later be seen as a major cause of the Southern loss during the Civil War.   The case of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company is indicative of this trend of struggling railroads in the South.  Historian James Ward showed that Southern railroads, especially in the 1840s and mid-1850s, received less government aide and investment than their Northern counterparts.  He argued that this disparity in financing was due to the long-ranging effects of an economic depression in 1839, the reduced market price of cotton, and finally weakened European markets in the mid-1850s, due to the Crimean War.  These events depleted government resources in the South, creating this decline in government support of transportation infrastructure.  The reduced funding led to the work stoppages that hindered the completion of the Blue Ridge Railroad, and many other railroads in the South.  When the state had money to reinvest in railroads, the South was already technologically trailing the North by a decade or more.   The Civil War was approaching and the South didn't have enough time to complete the development of its railroads. If the South had more peace time to catch up with Northern technology, the Civil War could have played out very differently.

This flourishing trading spot transformed itself into a popular resort where northerners came to flee from the harsh cold northern winters. According to the Seminole Hotel Booklet, the Winter Park area was ideal for northern settlement since it was full of natural beauties such as \"crystal lakes\" and \"southern pines\".  To conserve the natural beauty of this community, the Town Improvement Association was established in 1887.","            Since its establishment in 1881, Winter Park has gone through many developmental changes in order to accommodate its growing population.  Northerners saw Winter Park as an opportunity to gain wealth through the planting of citrus. Transportation became more accessible as a railroad line was placed in between Sanford and Orlando by the end of 1881. In 1882, Winter   Park received its first train station. Its first schools began to open in 1883 including the establishment of Rollins College in 1885. All of these advancements in Winter   Park lead to an economic boom which resulted in its incorporation as a town in 1887. In order to sustain the towns economic success, conservation organizations like the TIAWP were installed.","    A look at the TIAWP's constitution, one can see the conservation methods taken by community members to preserve the towns renown beauty. Article II of the Constitution states the object of the Association is to \"improve and ornament the streets and public grounds of Winter Park\". Members of the TIAWP planted trees as well as cultivated them. Other member duties included cleaning and repairing broken sidewalks as well as embellishing the streets.  Becoming a member consisted of planting a tree in the community or paying a small fee. Becoming a life member entailed subscribing in paying annual fees to the Association. According to Article VIII, members were promised a \"system of premiums\", where they were awarded for their service to the community.","            The Town Improvement Association of Winter Park was necessary for not only conservation reasons, but mainly for tourism. Due to its beautiful landscape, the town seems attractive to northerners. Hotels around the regions thrived due to this natural scheme. The Seminole Hotel Booklet profited from such claiming how the entire state of Florida was \"challenged to produce a prettier or healthier spot\".

The weather grew steadily worse throughout the night, and the storm from the Atlantic Ocean moved in.  According to one Charleston resident, \"Looking out into the gloom during the closing hours of the night and the early hours of the morning, the eye encountered a scene never to be forgotten, and which the beholder would scarcely care to see twice.

Electrical wires covered the streets, trees lay across the roads, and water stood knee deep all around the city.

These correspondences explain that on February 28 the ship Black Warrior stopped in Havana on its way from Mobile to New York as it had done numerous times in the past and upon arriving delivered its manifest to customs as was required. The captain listed his cargo only as ballasts as he had ordinarily done since all other cargo was in transit. However, the Black Warrior also carried 1000 bales of cotton and the customs officer, upon learning of this, seized the ship and cargo without giving the captain an opportunity to change the manifest. The correspondence explained that the outrage stemmed from the fact that under Spanish law a captain had twelve hours from the time the ship arrived in which he could make corrections to the manifest if an error had occurred, a time which had not elapsed when the ship was seized. The captain immediately informed the U.S. Consul in Havana who attempted to resolve the matter by petitioning the Captain General of Havana to release the ship and cargo. But the correspondence states that the Captain General responded \"the law must take its course\" and so made a speedy end to this affair impossible.","Normally such a minor customs battle would hold little importance for the people of Charleston and the nation as a whole, but the escalating political interest in the affair is best explained by tensions between the United States and Spain around this time. The bulk of this tension was the result of the United States' continued interest in acquiring Cuba from Spain; a sentiment especially strong among Southern Democrats who saw it as an opportunity to create another slave state out of Cuba and among some moderates who hoped that the acquisition of Cuba would ease the growing tensions between the North and South. Also, some hoped that a war with Spain over Cuba would turn the nation's attentions from internal divisions onto national affairs and so alleviate the growing regional crisis in the United States. Thus, it is not surprising that in his essay Henry James tells \"Of the sensation created throughout the length and breadth of the Union by the detention of the Black Warrior.\" Many newspapers portrayed the \"Black Warrior Affair\" as an outrage and a slight against American honor that deserved retribution. Strong political pressure was exerted on President Peirce to act, and Peirce himself was not totally indifferent to the political possibilities this crisis created. While sentiments in the correspondence were not so strong, the author did emphasize the idea that the United States had been wronged in some way. He too called for action by the government to intervene in this \"outrageous affair.\" However, the Spanish government, realizing the political implications, quickly resolved the issue by releasing the ship and cargo. While there were some lingering political repercussions, American interest in the affair ebbed with this resolution and emphasis shift back to the problems of the nation.

The first Transcontinental Railway had only been completed a few days earlier but already there were calls from southerners for a route that was more suited to their needs. A southern transcontinental rail route was not a new idea though, and, in fact, there had been serious discussion about choosing it as the primary route before the Civil War. A Southern route became feasible after 1848 with the annexation of Texas and the vast territorial acquisitions from Mexico and in 1853 with the Gadsden Purchase. Moreover, this region's geological features seem exceptionally good for rail building. As the editorial notes, surveys conducted during the early 1850s painted the southern route as the far superior when compared to the northern or central routes that had been proposed. And southerners during this time had their own motives for preferring this route. Many hoped a southern transcontinental railway would liberate the South economically from the North by making the North reliant upon the South for access to the Far East. Additionally, it was hoped that a Southern route would open up the West to southern political influence and possibly pave the way for the spread of slavery. As it was though northern influence put plans on hold and politics leading up to the Civil War were enough to kill the idea for a period.","But shortly after the war hopes for a southern route were renewed. Many still believed that the southern route was the most feasible and efficient route, and the concerns voiced by the author of the editorial about the First Transcontinental Railway were valid ones. Snow has always been a challenge for trains and winters in the Rocky Mountains always have an abundance of it. The conditions the author describes of high, impenetrable snow drifts were not uncommon and long delays were always a possibility. Another problem not mentioned in the article was that of avalanches which could bury or destroy tracks and any locomotive unlucky enough to be in their path. The railroad companies did erect sheds and snow fences in an attempt to alleviate these problems but often times, as the author describes, these proved ineffective. More importantly these structures were expensive to build and maintain and only added to the costs of the already expensive railroads. Even so, the author's hopes for a southern route were not met quickly, for it was not until December of 1881 that the Southern Pacific railway was finally completed.

Upon entering Mr. Campbell's quarters, Charles was greeted by Mr. McKenzie, known as King of Missouri in the area.

"," Charles Larpenteur was one of the many employees that were unsure of the American Fur Company transfer. Under new management cuts were made and new alliances were formed. The American Fur Company needed to revitalize their trade lines in order to establish loyal networks on the borders of Northwest U.S. and Canada to continue to compete with the Hudson Bay Company. Charles was useful to Mr. McKenzie for his experience at Fort William and for the many connections he could provide for the company. "," By requesting Charles as an employee, Mr. McKenzie might have foreseen the need for a different sort of familiarity as the A.F.C. gradually accommodated the changing fur fashion in Europe. Silk was becoming the new chic and the demand for beaver top hats was declining. Beaver pelts had been a great source of demand during the early nineteenth century. High profit from the rising prices of fur had heightened the competition between the fur companies. As the fashion industry changed, so did many of the fur companies in order to protect their monopoly in the fur trade. "," To Charles the prospect of a common hand was limited. An employees' position in a fur company determined the amount of financial control the company had over the staff. Usually management would use their trappers as consumer based residents on company property. The companies would hire traders and trade them goods and land titles in return for pelts. Fur company employees would often become in debt to the local post manager under the pretense of owing back loans to the A.F.C. Many trappers or traders would become critically in debt and were forced to increase the rate of pelts acquired during a hunt."," The A.F.C. maintained it's dominance in the United States until the late 1840s, when the fur trade came to a decline. As settlers moved to the Missouri Territory and the rate of trapping grew, fur no longer became a high source of income. The beaver almost became extinct; most animals indigenous to the area were severely depleted. Charles's journal entry is an account of the transformation the American Fur Company undertook to adjust to new ownership and to the altering fashion industry during the 1830s; in order to remain a leading competitor in the fur industry. As Charles prepared for his job promotion as clerk he would became a witness to these fundamental changes within the American Fur Company in the next decade."],"display_date":"July 2, 1834","search_date":"1834-07-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4301,"title":"Godeys Ladys Book, More than Fashion","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1898-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Louis A. Godey's enormously successful <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> set the standard for the American magazine and monthlie publishers throughout the mid 19th century.  His ingenious marketing techniques as noted by historian John Tebbel set the standard for magazines by 1850.  The market appeal of <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> contributed to the rising realization that women were a marketable audience and Louis Godey's brainchild spurned the rise of a wave of impersonators such as <em>Peterson's Ladies</em> and <em>Ladies' Wreath</em>.  The magazines greatest contribution was to the evolution of fashion and its careful documentation of the latest styles.  As a result of increased subscriptions, the transformation of the monthlie to the magazine took place in order to sell more copies and increase profit; Godey's Lady's Book was one of the last to convert into a true magazine as Louis Godey preferred his original creation to the new low quality productions.  The method of payment for contributors was also unique to Godey's enterprise at first; Godey would not pay undistinguished writers for their contributions as his magazine would likely launch an unknown into fame.  Godey would then pay well known authors such as Nathaniel Willis a hefty paycheck to write regular entries that readers came to expect.  Another cost cutting revolution that Godey exploited was the use of advertisements which served two purposes; the initial being that he had a subsidized product, and his readers had a seemingly \"larger\" magazine to read.  As one of the first magazines to use advertisements, Godey risked making his publishment appear to be cheap; but by not lowering the price it made the magazine keep its' glamorous appeal.  The <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> employed the same strategy as well for several years prior to the Civil War.","                Not only did the structure of the modern magazine gain inspiration from Godey but so too did the content matter.  The most important subject piece that historian look to now for insight into the period are the hand tinted fashion plates that accompanied each issue of the magazine.  Carefully detailed and researched, these plates were to provide an image to the reader of how she should look in the latest fashionable dress.  Godey claimed in 1850 that he had 150 women working out of their homes to paint by hand these fashion plates, and the color was often left to the artists' decision.  This played off well for Godey by explaining that then readers should compare each others' fashion plates and decide then what color would be best for the clothing.  By comparing the fashion plates over the years, the evolution of women's dress can be traced throughout the 18th century from <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em>.  Additionally the fashion plates became more expansive through the decades, indicating more interest in fashion due to cheaper and more readily available clothing to buy.  ","The subjects contained in Godey's Lady's Book were also revolutionary in its inclusion of fiction in the form of short stories.  Authors such as Edgar Allen Poe got early starts in their early careers by writing short pieces for Godey's Lady's Book and reached a large audience.  Louis Godey realized as well that a magazine was not just a literary journal and as such should provide the reader a diverse array of subject material.  As a result women across the country were provided the latest monthly updates on music, dance, politics, and art; each copy complete with engravings, paintings, and eventually photos.  The use of artwork and pictures to compliment the literature was a transformative concept that became the norm for magazines by 1850.  Such techniques caused Godey's Lady's Book to become so successful that Godey copyrighted the magazine in 1845 in an attempt to prevent duplications.  ","                The Civil War marked the decline of the magazine market for several years simply due to the loss of consumers; the South made up the majority of Godey's customers.  By the time of Godey's death in 1878, his namesake was nearly in the same condition.  Even copying other magazines \"ten cent\" strategy in 1893 worked to no avail and the magazine finally ceased to exist in 1898.  <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> impact on the magazine industry helped to transform pleasure reading in 19th century America by establishing the standard format for magazines."],"display_date":"January 1, 1830 - January 30, 1898","search_date":"1864-01-16","locations":[{"id":11227,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4306,"title":"Railroad Matters\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-10-13","end_date":"1873-10-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["1Thomas Scott was about to be one step closer to his ultimate dream. The President of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, Scott had an ambition to build a second transcontinental railroad, and even though he would never achieve this dream on Oct.  30 1873 talks began on a deal that would hand over the rights of the California and Texas Railway Company to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. For 10 days now rumors had been swarming about a merger but they were not confirmed by officials until yesterday.  They hope to come to an agreement that will benefit both parties equally. 2The Pennsylvania Railroad Company was in the height of its prosperity and a new and long awaited investment opportunity to build a second transcontinental railroad had just presented itself.  All of this was part of a railroad boom in the post-Civil War era that would come to be known as the \"age of the railway\" in American History.","            3Scott played an important role in the Civil War leading up to this time. He was appointed Assistant Secretary of War to oversee transportation in 1861.  He would later resign and then serve another term as a colonel for Major-General Hooker's forces in 1863.  Scott was able to lay the foundation for a wartime mobilization scheme that would eventually win the war.   He would later become Vice President of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in 1861 but act as president until he acquired the title in 1870.  Scott presided over the \"greatest period of expansion in the country's history.\"  Under his control the company became a major railroad trust that had many holdings all over the United   States.  These holdings even listed the Southern Security Railway Company which strived to connect Richmond and Atlanta with one continuous line.  This line would eventually create the I-85 corridor, relevant to the 21st century.","            2The growth of the railroads in the 19th century not only furthered American transportation for the time but also helped further the economy by creating tens of thousands of jobs for local and immigrant workers. State funding for railroads would quickly dry up as states demanded more and more control over the railroads that the railroad company's retained.  Regional tensions over where the second trans-continental railroad should be laid caused the dream to die at least for the time.  The railroad provided economic booms for local cities that had been previously unimportant but they also cause economic disasters on a national level.  The railway company's have even been blamed for some economic depressions such as the one in 1873, triggered by the failure of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company.  Also the bankruptcy of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Companies contributed to the Panic of 1893.  \"Regardless the attitudes, railroads became the dominant form of transportation and a major business enterprise.\"  It is clear now in hindsight that due to the work of great industrialists like Thomas Scott the railroad ruled America for over 50 years after the Civil War, and it continues to serve a pivotal role in 21st century America as well."],"display_date":"October 13, 1873","search_date":"1873-10-13","locations":[{"id":11231,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4308,"title":"The Antebellum South: Up in Arms? \n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-11-23","end_date":"1860-11-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    The South was up in arms. On November 23, 1860, the Richmond Daily Dispatch reported an account from the New York Journal of Commerce about the manufacturing and selling of \"Arms to the South.\" Before directly quoting the New York Journal of Commerce, the Richmond editor mentioned that the makers and sellers of arms were perhaps the only ones \"gathering any advantage from the present crisis.\"  According to the New York account, a firm in New York received anywhere from twenty to fifty orders for arms from South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama daily. The writer for the New York Journal of Commerce also mentioned that while those who did not know better might call the South's credit and financial dependability into question, the South actually concludes all business transactions with cash within thirty days. Adding significance to this article, the writer noted that all the orders came from Southern states, but \"but mainly from those in which secession is regarded as the only remedy for Southern grievances.\"","    The author of this article refers to the \"Colt's revolvers and rifles [sold] to Georgia,\" the arms for \"1,800 men…sent to Savannah,\" and the order of one thousand \"death-dealing weapons\" for Alabama. The New York Journal of Commerce ended this article with another seemingly biased statement that, \"the wholesale houses and agencies in the city [New York City] have been hard pressed to supply the orders for every imaginable species of weapons.\" These figures seem slanted towards Unionist and Northern sentiments, but perhaps these astronomical figures and seemingly exaggerated sentiments by Northerners were not as far-fetched as they first appear. ","    At the onset of the Civil War, the South struggled to provide adequate arms for Confederate troops. Records exist, however, of these several thousand modern small arms that were shipped to the Southern states and that were provided by Northern industries pre-Civil War. When these supplies were cut off at the start of the Civil War by orders of the U.S. government, smaller Confederate states began to produce and manufacture small arms, but they never were able to catch up with the production by the Northern states. It was at this point that the Confederacy turned to Caleb House in Europe in 1861 and 1862 for their weaponry and supplies. Despite the constant gaining and losing of arms in various battles during the Civil War, at the end of the war, the Confederacy, provided by Chief of Ordinance Josiah Gorgas, reported that they possessed 1,306 field artillery pieces, 921,441 rounds of artillery ammunition, 323,231 infantry arms, and 72,413,854 small arms cartridges. So, while the North was not the sole provider of the arms for Confederate armies, their early supplying of Confederate weaponry provided the basis for the Southern states to never lack in arms and ammunition, even though the conditions of these Confederacy arms was negotiable.

It depicted four officers leading a miner through a large crowd of women.  In the picture some women held clubs that were raised in threatening positions, while the rest had faces that were contorted with rage.  Joseph Becker sketched this scene in Buchtel, a mining town in Hocking County, Ohio during the Hocking Valley Miners' Strike of 1884. Miners, women and men, from forty-eight mines in Hocking Valley arranged the strike in order to dispute high living costs and decreased wages.  The miners had hoped to expand their rights as a worker by means of peaceful demonstrations with the organized political support of the Knights of Labor.  Nine months later, the striking miners were unable to come to an agreed compromise with the mine operators and returned to the mines. "," The women of the Hocking Valley miners were a familiar image, which grabbed the publics' attention toward the miners' plight during the 1880s. Their struggle for economic balance and the stability of their employment could only be recognized, because of the image of working class mothers and wives engaged in a united front.  Hocking Valley Miners were not only assisted by the image of their fellow workers in <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>, but became connected through the family oriented association of the Knights of Labor.  This association was a national working class group that tried to end \"industrial capitalism\" by incorporating new ways to oppose unjust industrial policies.  The Knights of Labor was the first organized labor group to successfully attempted to change basic working conditions for all workers despite race , gender, position, age, and regardless of their experience. This large union would eventually assist the Hocking Valley mining families through two strikes during the 1880s. "," One of the biggest issues during these strikes was the rivalry of appearing levels in working class. Miners had been hired as individual groups, led by a selected manager. Most of the time family members would form a \"family system of production\". The necessity of many hands versus the few, children and women were part of the company.  This unit method allowed miners to work at an individual pace, but work was limited by the price of coal per ton. With the advancement of technology and the change in safety, job description changed the way workers were viewed as employees.  The emergence of the change between manual labor and skilled labor created a strained working force in the mines.  Wages and restrictions limited workers by age, gender, and skill sets, rather than the longevity of their employment. Job description was not a common term until the Knights of Labor and other Mining groups created the unity of workers.  No longer would miners receive the benefit of selected associates, but an organized layer of employees, based on their skills or experience. "," The sketch of the miners' women in Hocking Valley is an image that fueled the miners' progress toward the creation of a company that would unite under the protection of the United Mine Workers of America in 1890.  The image relays the importance of the labor union to the worker as standardizing the work force.  The uniqueness of the Hocking Valley Miner's Strike is that the workers' struggle was a family action.  Women were used by the newspapers to express the unfair working conditions and the poor pay of the Hocking miners.  Due to the efforts of the mining families in Hocking Valley and publicized notice in newspapers, miners succeeded in obtaining stable wages and equal opportunities, but the creation of the mining unions created a clear definition in skilled workers, manual laborers, and family working units."],"display_date":"October 25, 1884","search_date":"1884-10-25","locations":[{"id":10289,"lat":39.4969744596,"lng":-82.4791535659,"zoom":10,"place":"HOCKING, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4352,"title":"A Morning in the Kitchen\n","course_id":3,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-12-01","end_date":"1886-12-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["     In December of 1886, \"A Morning in the Kitchen\" was published in <em>Rushlight</em>, the magazine of Wheaton Female Seminary in Norton, Massachusetts.

She stated that men's genius was wasted on other scientific endeavors when they could have focused on inventions for domestic aid. She then noted that bread making was a women's science. However, this revelation was interrupted by a peddler who was trying to sell her linens. After inquiring on the size, price, color, and wear she sent the peddler away without purchasing the linens.

This change placed more value on a man's income than a women's domestic role. With these changes housewives learned to adapt by scavenging, shopping wisely, nursing the family, and becoming thrifty in order to stretch family income and improve economic security. However, this role was seen differently by many. With the addition of servants, such as maids and cooks, the women's role was no longer considered economically advantageous, but seen more as a pleasurable activity and a married woman's last attempts to preserve a way of life. This idea was not shared by all, as some women, like our author, saw their work as economically beneficial, as well as a source of pride.

Sherman began his letter by saying that if the quartermasters wanted to be in charge of the money situation with dealing out equipment for the armies, then they need not to be in places such as Louisville, Chicago, or Washington; rather they need to be in locations where it does not cost them a lot for transportation or where communication is not short and not clear.

Although it may seem outlandish, the strength of this local legend about the Lafitte brothers, Pierre and Jean, persists to this day. The National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings, as well as The National Historic Landmarks Program, describe the structure on Bourbon Street as being built by the Lafittes between 1772 and 1791. Both sources claim that the brothers used the building to front a blacksmith shop to cover their reprehensible dealings in pirating and slavery."," The cottage at 941 Bourbon Street is a historical building in itself. It is located at the intersection of Bourbon and Saint Philip Street. This section of New Orleans is known as the French Quarter or Vieux Carre. The streets forming the Vieux Carre, or the old square, are the original streets of the city. William C. Davis explains that the names are \"redolent of [the] French and Spanish History.\" Historians acknowledge that this area prospered during the time of the Lafittes. Furthermore, the structure of the cottage is very emblematic of the French Colonial architectural style of the time period. The cottage is constructed with timbers of cypress, soft brick, and plaster. According to the historian Liliane Crete, the fact that the wood is cypress illustrates that \"the lowland of Louisiana was entirely covered with cypresses.\"","While 941 Bourbon Street is important because of its preservation of a historic style and time period, it is the brothers associated with it that solidify its historical importance and legendary quality. Many stories exist that tell of the Lafitte's blacksmith shop located on Bourbon Street and Saint Philip Street and the affairs, adventures, and trials of the brothers. The Lafitte brothers are very important to the history of New Orleans, particularly the slave trade. Many people in Louisiana wanted slaves, but several situations limited the supply, such as the embargo on importation of Africans into the United States. The Lafittes exploited the situation in order to become wealthy by providing slaves through illicit dealings when no one else could. They also became involved in many scandals and political situations.","Although legends, myths and other sources believe that the Lafittes lived or worked in the building, others argue the association. The author Barbara SoRelle Bacot believes, \"[941 Bourbon Street] is romantically known as Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop, but it has nothing to do with Lafitte or any blacksmith.\"  She attributes the association to the nineteenth century writer George Washington Cable. Although it is difficult to find concrete evidence for either side, whether the Lafitte brothers truly built the structure is not what is important. 941 Bourbon Street is enlivened by the local legends of Pierre and Jean Lafitte and in turn has immortalized their legends in the region."],"display_date":"1810 - 1823","search_date":"1816-12-31","locations":[{"id":5594,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4433,"title":"The Peak of Excellence\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/21","end_date":"12/31/21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["This building serves as a symbol of the innovation that the Cotton Exchange implemented in its field of industry. The exterior of the building appears to be a typical 1921 classically inspired design. The architects, Favrot and Livaudais, who built several of the buildings in the area, designed the eight story steel framed structure. They believed that they created a new style of building because they incorporated old world elements with an innovative and modern design.  This is illustrated by the arched windows and faux columns that surround the building on the second and third floor.  The story behind this building is marked by the rise and fall of Henry G. Hester, the secretary of the New Orleans Cotton Exchange from 1871-1933.  He revolutionized and standardized the cotton trade in New Orleans and built it to rival the cotton exchanges of New York and Liverpool. ","Henry G. Hester was a pioneer as the secretary of the New Orleans Cotton Exchange.  It was through his policies that he standardized and legitimized the cotton market in New Orleans.  The exchange was established to, \"maintain quarters for the Exchange; adjust disputes between members; establishing regulations, uniform usages…\" and it was through Hester that these goals were realized.<a name=\"_ftnref6\"></a>  One of the more remarkable things that Hester did was collect cotton statics in hopes of standardizing the industry.   In addition, he divided Louisiana into districts and sub districts in which men on behalf of the exchange surveyed the crop and asked questions pertaining to the quantity grown, weather conditions, and the progress of the cotton.  By 1880, cotton farmers sought out the book published by Hester in hopes of gaining insight on the conditions and quality of cotton.  ","Simultaneously with the development of the cotton statistics, Hester also began to diversify the resources of the Cotton Exchange.  In 1872 after a myriad of discussions, the New Orleans Cotton Exchange committed to pay the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company 10,000 annually to install and dispatch ten telegraphs to the New York Cotton Exchange.  As a result of this agreement, it established the New Orleans Cotton Exchange as the premier cotton exchange in the south because it \"had facilities that no other southern market could match.\"  As a result of Hester's policies that advanced the Cotton Exchange, the company was able to tear down the smaller and more cramped building and construct the lavish 1921 structure that became a physical representation for what Hester had achieved in innovation.

The factory stood on the corner of Taylor and Clay streets, on the canal.  Mr. Field employed forty men who earned 1.50 to 3.50 dollars per day for their skilled labor.  The company smelted iron for casting tools.

The factories produced mass amounts of goods that exceeded the demand of local markets.  The factory owners concentrated on running the production of goods and relied on merchants to distribute their goods nationally.  Livesay wrote, \"in the antebellum iron industry, mass distribution became the domain of another kind of specialized wholesaler, the iron commission merchant.\"","The iron industry helped develop railroad transportation in America.  According to Livesay, \"the four largest American iron works in 1860 - Trenton Iron, Phoenix Iron, Montour Iron, and Cambria - were all integrated rail mills.\"  These mills produced railroad supplies for Camden & Amboy, Belvidere & Delaware, West Jersey, and new railroads in construction from Camden to Mount Holly, from Hightstown to Pemberton, and from Maine to New Orleans.

The tower rose 156 feet above sea level. The light was a \"fixed\" light that could be seen up to 22 nautical miles during ordinary weather. The light was lit for the first time on November 1, 1859.","According to historian Cheryl Shelton-Roberts, \"the most modern architectural logic of the time went into the design of the Cape Lookout lighthouse.\" It was the first to rest on cross timbers instead of on pilings because pilings could not be driven into the compact sand. \"The lighthouse stood tall enough to reach out over across Lookout Shoals and rise above morning mist and fogs,\" and its light sequence rotated every fifteen seconds. Cape Lookout was one of many lighthouses along the North Carolina coast, located in southwest Carteret County on the 22-mile-long Core Banks. The lighthouse's job was to warn mariners of dangerous shoals that extended eight miles into the ocean. Mariners had to memorize each lighthouse's sequence of how the light blinked to know their location along the coast. Each lighthouse along the coast of the United States had a different light sequence. The Cape Lookout Lighthouse saved many ships that carried important cargo to the mainland from running aground on the shoals that were off the coast.","In the nineteenth century, transatlantic trade was booming. \"Even after the invention of the steamboats,\" notes historian Daniel Howe, \"merchants continued to favor sailing ships for ocean going voyages because they did not have to devote a lot of precious cargo space to carrying fuel for a long voyage.\" It was not until 1840 that Samuel Cunard pioneered the idea of using steamboats for the transatlantic voyage, but instead of using wood they would use coal. Using coal left a lot more room for the cargo, which meant that the merchants could make more money.

It also showed how eventual abolition in the United States would be a failure to both Southern States and Northern States.","Throughout the nineteenth century, the islands of the West Indies abolished slavery, which resulted in catastrophic consequences for their economic structures. Like his anti-abolition peers, Van Evrie believed that the fundamental nature of black people was responsible for the dramatic decay of economies in the West Indies. He maintained that, once freed from their slave ties, \"negroes\" only fell back upon their tendency to idleness, returned to the \"savagism of their African ancestors,\" and converted back to their \"heathen\" way of life. Van Evrie used statistical elements to show that the abolition of slavery in islands such as Jamaica and Haiti resulted in the ruin of their economy and trade, the return to uncultivated wilderness of the lands, and the \"desolation\" of the plantations installed by the colonist countries.  ","For Van Evrie, \"freed negroes,\" as \"inferior human beings,\" would be a burden for American laborers in many ways: they would live on the labor of White people, stop producing goods and therefore generate an increase of price for these goods. They would not be consumers of northern goods any more, and they would increase crime and pauperism in the States.  He therefore encouraged American people to reflect upon these elements before abolishing slavery. Destroying slavery in the West Indies and in the United States would be equivalent to destroying hundreds of farmers, or of laborers.","Van Evrie claimed his tract about \"Free Negroism…\" to be a response to the \"innumerable\" abolitionist tracts published in the early 1860s. He wanted to give an answer to the \"false and pernicious doctrines\" spread by the North for decades, and tried to awaken the consciousness of people of the North about the good of slavery. As part of the anti-abolition movement and of the South, Van Evrie remained concerned about the election of anti-slavery candidate Abraham Lincoln. According to the historian John David Smith, Van Evrie was very representative of the \"anti Negro propaganda\", and was the \"first professional racist in American History.\" In his pamphlet Van Evrie responded to the concerns of the middle classes, looking for social stability in a changing society, giving them arguments against changing the state of things."],"display_date":1862,"search_date":"1862-07-02","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":176,"tag":"trade relations"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4611,"title":"Cilinton Shines in a Public Works Display","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1812-01-01","end_date":"1837-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["One could argue that it was the governor of New York, DeWitt Clinton, who made the United States what they are today. Without him, and his efforts to build the Erie Canal, the United States would have experienced slower economic growth. He linked the Atlantic with the Great Lakes, via the Erie Canal running through New York State, empowering the North. ","DeWitt Clinton saw the opportunity for New York to take on the power of expanding westward, and pushed the New York legislature to provide the funding for the canal project. This funneled money and supplies into New York bolstering their economy. Despite the fact that Clinton grew up in the North, Clinton was raised in a slave owning family and he was not completely opposed to slavery even when he was in politics. Clinton believed that the fight over owning slaves took up too much of the national attention. Ruggles, a Whig that supported the canal system, claims that he believed that public improvements were being put on hold while the North and the South fought over slavery. According to historian Carol Sheriff, Clinton helped make New York the Empire State in 1812, funding the 363 mile canal system from New York, via the Hudson River, through Buffalo and into the Great Lakes waterway system in 1812. As a result western trade then funneled through New York, claiming all of the economic benefits and therefore economic power—keeping it out of the hands of the Boston and Philadelphia, or even the South. ","According to Samuel Ruggles, the canal carried 122,000,000 worth of goods for states other than New York across the Great Lakes. There were claims that the Mississippi brought the Union together, as it was the greatest means of transportation in the entirety of the Union, until the Erie Canal was dug. Ruggles emphasized the importance of the Erie Canal saying, \"[The Erie Canal] does artificially what the Mississippi did naturally. It is a prevalent idea that the Mississippi is the bond that binds the Union together—but as a channel of trade, the Erie Canal equals the Mississippi.\" Clinton had secured success for the northern economy, especially the mid-west economy, which was falling because of the demand of cotton. Cities prospered along the canal, Albany, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo and other small towns and cities along the canal, not to mention the cities that bloomed and became more prosperous along the Great Lakes. ","Clinton seems to be the unsung hero for the North. He is given little credit for his actions during the time of hardships.

Cash crops such as tobacco, cotton, and wheat were cultivated on large plantations that saw tremendous profits. A large amount of cheap labor was essential to producing these profits. This cheap labor came in the form of slavery, and it allowed an immense amount of work to be done without costing too much. Without slavery this rapid economic expansion would not have been possible. There is no doubt that slavery was cruel and evil, but was it a necessary evil?","Initially, when Britain arrived in the Americas a plantation system was utilized. Their mercantilist ideas caused the people in the Americas to produce as much as possible in order to achieve the greatest wealth. This system utilized cheap slave labor to tend the large amount of crops on these plantations. However, this labor was cruel and unusual, and was one of the most debated issues within American society for three centuries. The conditions slaves had to endure were unjustifiable. Slaves lived in shacks, ate small amounts of food, were constantly separated from family members, and were beaten with any act of misconduct. Disease, malnutrition, sickness, injuries, and death were prevalent throughout most of the slave accommodations. There was a constant push for the abolition of slavery because it contradicted the ‘”all men are created equal” idea implemented in American society. “It is most certain that all Men, as they are the Sons of Adam, are; and have equal Right unto Liberty, and all other outward Comforts of Life.”[1] This came from a publication in a Boston journal in 1700. The article expressed the wrongs of the slave trade by referring to the specific selling of a slave named Joseph. “There is no proportion between Twenty Pieces of Silver, and liberty.”<sup>1</sup> The journal expressed this exchange as a lack of humanity towards Joseph. If humans were bought with money then they were not humans at all. The article produces a vivid argument for the contradicting idea of slavery. Americans expressed equal rights for all humans, but treated slaves with little humanity and respect.","Consequently, it is obvious and definite that slavery was cruel, sacrilegious, barbaric, and absolutely unjustifiable. But was it necessary for the progress of the Americas? During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the Americas saw a gigantic increase in production and therefore profitability. This increase in production was only possible because of the immense amount of cheap labor supplied by slavery and the slave trade. “Slavery was overall very beneficial for Southerners. After 1830 cotton was booming and it became extremely profitable for a southerner to have a slave.”[2] The Americas had two established cash crops, cotton and tobacco. Both of these crops were labor intensive and required a great deal of manual work. It is apparent that the most cost effective way to utilize these cash crops would be to somehow implement large groups of cheap laborers. With this in mind; it is obvious the best economical solution would have been to use slavery. For this reason, slavery was necessary for the economic progression America saw in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.","In summation, no matter how necessary slavery was to the economic progression of the Americas it does not justify it in any way. But I can understand the thought process of the people at the time. Utilizing slavery was the best possible solution for cheap labor and directly contributed to the wealthy nation we are today. Slavery was evil, but also the most economically beneficial form of production during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries."," ","[1] Green, Bartholomew . \"The Selling of Joseph .\" Ames. Cas.

The Seminole Hotel was a grand resort in Lake Osceola and it was a vacation destination which attracted many wealthy northerners who were escaping the unpleasant weather from their home towns. While it is evident that white northerners enjoyed the warm weather and the great destination, African Americans who were already in the area were not affluent enough to enjoy the properties of the Seminole Hotel. Instead African Americans were offered a different way to step foot onto the premises, they were the employees that hosted the white wealthy guests.","As mentioned in the Winter Park Historical Association website, the Seminole Hotel boasted <em>“that more millionaires and beauties were gathered on its piazzas than any other space in Florida.”</em> In this regard we easily understand that during 1886 when the Seminole Hotel was built, African Americans were just fortunate enough to be employees of the Seminole Hotel. Across the South during this period, African Americans were denied employment and equal opportunities by whites for various reasons, but were fortunate enough to find some opportunities at the Seminole hotel. As observed in the photos of the Seminole Hotel, Steve Rajatr in the Winter Park Magazine reveals that  “a large portion of their Winter Park staff of porters, bellhops, cooks, and maids were black residents who lived in Hannibal Square and who were neighbors of white families who lived on the east side of town. The hotel was one of the major companies in the area that employed black residents.”","While looking back at the importance of the Seminole Hotel we must recognize that a picture found in the Rollins College Archives with an African American woman boating wealthy white northerners on Lake Osceola depicts both positive and negative interpretations. While I rather see a picture of both African American’s and Whites enjoying the sites of the Seminole Hotel, it is still beneficial that African Americans were hired by one of the only employers that would employee them. “The city’s founding fathers intended Winter Park to be a resort destination for affluent families who wanted to escape harsh winters in the Midwest and Northeast and African American’s were apart of making these wealthy families feel welcomed.” Through the Seminole Hotel the African Americans contributed to the American experience in many ways, some more obvious than others."," "," "],"display_date":1886,"search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4871,"title":"A Tax Outrage","course_id":31,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-02-12","end_date":"1878-02-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["“We have paid an insane tax to the government says the North and East.  We of the West and the South have complained true, but not unreasonably, our burdens are heavier than we can bear, heavier than we ought to bear, or than we will bear.”  The northern and southern parts of the state debated tax policy during an 1878 session of the state legislature in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Both sides did have a consensus of the taxes being too high; however, each felt that one side was not doing enough.  The “About Taxes” article in the Raleigh<em> News and Observer</em> in February 1878 explained this disagreement in detail.  The whole United States was going through the same trial, and this was just a snap shot of what was in store.","This whole misconstrued situation began at the end of the Reconstruction period.  With redemption North Carolina now faced the process of rebuilding its economy after the Civil War, but at its own expense.

After acknowledging an anti-abolition meeting that had taken place in the town just a few days prior, the anonymous author of the front-page article went on to denounce the meeting as foolish and to predict the gradual alienation between the North and South, until the point where the South no longer wanted anything to do with the Union. To this anonymous author the separation between the North and the South seemed almost inevitable; South Carolina had already expressed desire for independence in the Nullification Crisis in 1832 and the South, with the preference for states’ rights over federal ones, was already uncomfortable with the North having so much power. It became clear that the author hoped to garner support for the abolitionist movement in defaming its opposition; the meeting, the author asserted, was a “farce” populated by “third-rate lawyers” who were attempting to fight an impossible battle in Geneva. With no economic connections to the South, residents of Geneva saw no reason to support the anti-abolition movement.","The issue concerning states’ rights and the extent of states’ powers in relation to the Federal government dates as far back as the Articles of Confederation which gave states a great deal of power; a more powerful Federal government was eventually instituted, though the arguments over the rights of the states continued. This issue became a core concept in the discussions of slavery in the South, where intellectuals, politicians, and plantation owners defended its position in the Southern economy. The United States had not yet faced the possibility of adding more slave states to the Union, but the precedent was tested in 1819. Just fifteen years prior to the anti-abolition front’s meeting in Geneva the United States had become embroiled in disagreements over the introduction of new slave states after the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory, which exacerbated the animosity between the North and South. The Missouri Crisis constituted one of the first open clashes concerning slavery and states’ rights: the debate centered around the creation of a new state, Missouri, as a slave state. Prominent Northern politicians such as Rufus King violently opposed this idea and fought against Missouri’s admittance as a broadening of Southern slavery. Eventually a compromise was reached, allowing Missouri to enter the Union as a slave state and Maine as a free one. This compromise only served to delay the eventual confrontation even further, and allowed for problems to continue to surface between the abolitionists in the North and slaveholders in the South."],"display_date":"August 31, 1835","search_date":"1835-08-31","locations":[{"id":8962,"lat":42.8528904967,"lng":-77.2997890257,"zoom":9,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4992,"title":"DeWitt Clinton Explores Possible Canal Route","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1810-08-05","end_date":"1810-08-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1810 a group of government officials were sent out to explore and navigate a route for an artificial canal between Lake Erie and the Hudson River. Among the group commissioned to take this journey was DeWitt Clinton, who was the mayor of New York City for many years prior to this exploration. Along this journey Clinton kept a personal diary in which he documented all aspects of the land that surrounded him, whether it was noting how wide the rivers ran, to how many known birds are in the area he left nothing out. On August 5, 1810, DeWitt Clinton and his crew encountered the city of Buffalo, New York which at the time was better known as Buffalo Village.","Within the boundaries of Buffalo Village Clinton noted that there were thirty to forty houses that complimented several markets and taverns, a post office, and the Niagara County Court House. In other words this village had a decent population. Clinton said it best as he explained in his diary that Buffalo “is a place of great resort. All persons that travel to the Western states and Ohio, from the Eastern states and all that visit the falls of Niagara come this way.” Right away Clinton was able to conclude that this could be a very prosperous village. He observed that the surrounding stream was very deep and navigable for five miles, allowing for easy exploring. Another strong attraction of this village was that upstream was the Seneca Indian saw mill, which was impregnated with oil. Clinton also noted the variety of the fish that occupied this stream such as white, herrings, sheep-head, sturgeon and a variety of bass. Enough fish to provide an ample food supply for a dense population. All of these factors made the Village of Buffalo a good candidate for the canal to run through.","An important aspect of creating artificial water way was making sure that there was a current strong enough to pull boats and other forms of transportations. Clinton questioned Buffalo locals to gain this knowledge. According to Mr. Geddes, a native of the village, the current could range anywhere from six to seven miles an hour. This proved to be very important because the vessels that would transport goods and people along the canal weighed several tons. DeWitt Clinton’s vivid recollection of his exploration during 1810 proved to play a vital role in the construction of the Erie Canal. His personal diary indicated how well Buffalo’s surrounding economy would do after the creation of the canal as he incorporated how accessible natural resources were to those who passed through the area.","After Clinton’s explorations across New York, he and the commissioners were able to reach an agreement that the city of Buffalo would be included as a part of the Erie Canal. Sitting on Lake Erie, Buffalo provided a commercial bond between the east and the west, allowing travelers to enter from the Great Lakes. Upon the canals completion in 1825, Buffalo became a place that offered great prosperity as it quickly became enriched with economic and cultural prosperity that it had not seen before. With the rapid increase of commerce in the area due to the canal, Buffalo was essentially incorporated as a city in 1832."],"display_date":"August 5, 1810","search_date":"1810-08-05","locations":[{"id":8933,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NIAGRA, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":563,"tag":"Erie Canal"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":602,"tag":"Transportation/Migration"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":5039,"title":"<strong>Advancing Culture: Harper’s New Monthly Magazine</strong>","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-06-01","end_date":"1850-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Current issues, events, and ideas were spread and divided among many American journals, newspapers, and periodicals, but in June of 1850 Harper & Brothers of New York sought to “remedy this evil” and provide all of this information in one place for anyone who wished to read it.  The firm introduced Harper’s New Monthly Magazine as the first general interest magazine in America.  They prefaced the issue with a quick word to their readers, explaining the reasoning and need for such a magazine in the United States.  The idea was to “place within the reach of the great mass of the American people the unbounded treasures of the Periodical Literature of the present day.”  They wished to bring the most current works of the most brilliant and innovative minds into the lives of as many as possible, offering their magazine monthly for only three dollars a year.  This was an attempt to keep minds fresh and informed in an age when so many things seemed to be happening and changing so quickly.","Great Britain and France had been in the practice of publishing periodicals for years, with growing popularity.  Harper & Brothers was trying to keep America up to date.  All of the brightest minds and all of their greatest works had been enriching European culture for years and Americans wanted the same for themselves.  Harper’s was a rather liberal arts publication, covering “varied intellectual movements of this most stirring and productive age.”  Scientific discoveries, political activity, and mechanical inventions were to be found among its pages with the fine art and literature, a regular Renaissance magazine. ","Harper & Brothers included the most recent information, not only from America, but from Europe, too.  It was an innovative concept and a way to advance and improve American culture and society.  By catering to “any class of readers…for any kind of reading,” the firm was able to deliver a magazine with a value “so much beyond its price…into the hands or the family circle of every intelligent citizen of the United States.”  Every copy of the issue in June sold and half a year later there were up to 50,000 readers.","Initial issues quickly shifted from the notable European works to the fresh American pieces.  Writers such as Horace Greeley, Horatio Alger, Stephen Douglas, and Mark Twain put forth their ideas for America.  During the 1850s the country was enjoying the access to printed materials that the printing press allowed and the spread of railroads assisted.  Culture was becoming a possible investment, rather than the bare necessities of yesteryears.  Many authors and artists were working to accelerate this process, and Harper’s New Monthly Magazine offered a brilliant and accessible means of doing so."],"display_date":"June 1850","search_date":"1850-06-15","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":707,"tag":"Modernization"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5103,"title":"<strong>Full Steam Ahead;

they are fitted up to carry several hundred emigrants, who are glad to leave Europe, in the hope of improving their condition in the New World, which offers a fair prospect to clever mechanics, agriculturists, and others able to work, who have seldom had cause to repent bidding farewell to Fatherland, especially those having large families to settle in life.”  The scene he describes is a scene of people embarking on a new life.  The accumulation of these lives creating new stories of their own in a New World would change the course of the country they were in search of.  Patton held these immigrants in contempt throughout his encounters with them on the ship, dismissing them as an unwashed mob and holding nothing back in implying their inferiority to himself.  His haughty narration is a good example of the reason why these people were leaving in search of something better.  The story of the changing of America wouldn’t be because of people like Patton, however, it would be the story of that rabble with whom he was traversing the Atlantic on a steamship.","The advent of steamships and the migration which followed produced a cyclical function; the advent of large steam ships in place of sail ships made migration easier, which in turn increased the population of the country.  The immigrants provided cheap labor, which the new, growing American industries needed to produce massive amounts of steel, etc.  So, the immigrants who showed up to work in American factories produced more volumes and better additions to the transportation industry, which fostered the ability for more immigrants to pick up from where they lived before and establish new roots in America.","The advent of steam power and the Industrial Revolution which followed on its heels changed the way life was lived in the United States.  These innovations increased the allure and therefore the power of cities, which could provide a large number of people in a concentrated area for a workforce in the industrial factories which arose during the Industrial Revolution.  Before the massive immigration to American shores and the advent of steam power in ships and trains, the United States was a largely agrarian country, with farm communities linked to each other by muddy roads which were travelled mainly on foot or by horse.  As the train lines expanded across the country over the course of the century, and immigrants poured into cities, creating new opportunities to chase the American dream in a new economy, the balance of what we would consider an average American life shifted to something that looked much more urban than it had in the past.  “Wherever it occurred, the Industrial Revolution shook people loose from traditional ways of life. It made factory workers out of artisans and, even more dramatically, turned millions of rural farmers into urban wage-laborers. Most of those migrants from countryside to city, from agriculture to industry…”","If it weren’t for the steamships like those which Edmund Patton travelled on across the vast Atlantic Ocean, the United States may have become a different, less diverse place.  The Industrial Revolution that followed made the country into an economic power, and it connected the country in a way that it hadn’t been in the past.  Shorter transport times meant more fluidity of movement throughout the country.  If it was for leisure or for the search of a better life, the steamship and the Industrial Revolution that followed allowed people to pursue their free will of travel in a country that was established on the belief that people are entitled to that kind of freedom."],"display_date":"June 22, 1852 - July 29, 1852","search_date":"1852-07-10","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5156,"title":"<strong>Letter from John Jacob Astor to his merchant, Peter Smith, </strong><strong>regarding the fur trade.</strong>","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1790-11-02","end_date":"1790-11-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John Jacob Astor was America’s first multimillionaire. Mr. Astor, German born, moved to the United States in 1784. Shortly after, he began his commercial career in fur trafficking. Mr. Astor, a keen businessman, recognized early on the possibilities of immense fortune in both furs and peltries. The rich peltries of the North had been pursued by the early traders. The Indians had little knowledge of the relative wealth of furs at first and bartered foreign trinkets and cheap commodities for them. The early traders realized immense profits and found furs as a source of wealth. The earliest and richest crop of Central and West New York consisted of furs through which John Jacob’s Agency, aided by Peter Smith and others, found their way into both the New York and London markets.","In 1790, Mr. Astor wrote a letter to his merchant Peter Smith on the Mohawk River. He expressed the value of furs and their worth. In the business deal, he advised Peter to deliver as much furs as possible between spring and June 1<sup>st</sup>. He requested Peter to only buy furs if the price was very low and advised him that he would loan him cash if need be.","In 1790, the price and inventory that Astor was willing to pay included the following: Otter Skins: 40s, Bear 40s, Red Fox (good condition) 9s and 6p, Mink: 4s and 3p, Wolfs: 6s and 6p, Wildcat: 6s and 6p, Muskrat 1s and 5p, and Beaver 12s.","Astor had major plans in establishing trading posts all across the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific and to send these furs to China. In 1811, Mr. Astor acquired the Mackina Company, which covered the entire south, and named it “The American Fur Company”. This was entitled the South-West in contradiction to the North-West Company which was a competing fur company based in Canada. Mr. Astor’s goal was to possess and monopolize the whole fur trade of North America. From the sixteenth to the late nineteenth century, fur trading was an important economic and political motive in the exploration and colonization of our continent.

In the early twentieth century, the United States was still developing. At that time, many industries were still in their early stage  -- the car industry and aviation industry, for example. Because these new technologies required a large amount of raw material, the development and competition of the steel industry was the greatest at that time. Since states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, and New Jersey had a rich availability of coal and iron ore, the steel industry in these states had become a critical industry because of the high profit. One of the most vigorous competitions in the steel industry was the competition between Pittsburgh and Chicago. Chicago itself did not have much iron or coal resources, but it could still introduce the steel industry into the city because of its geographical location, which is located next to Lake Michigan. Because of easy transportation, Chicago developed its steel industry so successfully that many cities like Pittsburgh aimed at it as a competitor. A conversation between the two magnates in Chicago and Pittsburgh can effectively represent the tit for tat industry competition that was occuring between the two cities. \"‘That doesn't matter to us,’ reply the Pittsburgh steel magnates. ‘Chicago has to send for its coal, which we have practically on the spot. The result is the same.’ ‘Not at all,’ say the Chicago men; ‘it costs us less to bring our coal than you have to pay for the freight of your ore, and you have to pay freight for coal too, the only difference being that ours travels farther than yours--a very small matter, as the loading and unloading cost more than the haulage, over a short distance. We have therefore a very considerable advantage over you in not being obliged to convey our ore by rail, and this advantage is bound to give us the upper hand in the long run.’\"  This conversation indicates how intense the competition was and how every city would not like to see other sharing their profitable steel exporting market.","This competition actually forced the cities to invest more into the industry and improve the quality of products. The production of steel was a benefit to all as it greatly increased and gave the foundation for the leadership of the US in the industry.  “From 1870 to 1900, annual U.S. steel production rose from around one million to ten million tons.”  Furthermore, the production rose to twenty four million tons annually by 1910. This data shows that vigorous competition can actually encourage improvements and strengthen the whole industry. This also made the US dominate the export steel market for years until the development of the industry in Asian countries in recent years.  However, the United States is still one of the major steel exporters around the world. Furthermore, the mature fundamental technologies also make steel products made in the US competitive with others, which contributes to both the US and the global economy."],"display_date":1915,"search_date":"1915-07-02","locations":[{"id":17541,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":929,"tag":"Pittsburg"},{"id":827,"tag":"Chicago"},{"id":231,"tag":"Steel and Iron Industry"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5235,"title":"An African American Worker at Sloss Furnace Encounters the Color Line","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/25","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["'\"A nigger can't bid for a white man's job.\" was how Alonzo Gaines described labor divisions among African Americans and whites at the time he was employed at Sloss Furnaces in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1984 Gaines sat down in an interview with the Sloss Furnace Association with the goal of recording his thoughts on his career at Sloss Furnaces, a pig-iron producing blast furnace in Birmingham, Alabama. In the course of his interview he recounted his own personal experiences with this workplace segregation. According to Gaines while he was employed at the concrete plant he had been instructed to operate a machine called the compressor when it usual operator, a man by the name of McDonald, was off work. Eventually the position of compressor operator became open and interested workers began applying for the position, or as they called it, biding on the job. Gaines too applied as he had already been operating the compressor for some time but when he approached the superintendent, a man by the name of Lawson, he was summarily denied the position in favor a white applicant. Superintendent Lawson informed Gaines frankly, “You can run it just as good as McCan, but you ain't gonna get it.\"","The “Color Line” that Gaines had encountered served as a barrier to African American workplace advancement in the south for decades. The south had developed strict delineations between what were considered “white” and “black” positions. According to historian William A. Sundstrom the color line segregated African Americans and whites, “along lines of skill levels, supervisory responsibilities, and manual versus white-collar tasks,” in many industries. It was implicitly understood and, as Gaines testimony shows, sometime explicitly stated that an African American worker would not have a supervisory position over a white worker. This is exactly what happened to Gaines when he applied for the compressor operator position; despite having the necessary skills to operate the machine he was told upfront that he would never get the position. That position was considered a “white job” and Gaines was denied the opportunity simply because of an ingrained prejudice that placed some positions at a higher social status that would then denied to those who were considered lower in social rank, even inspite of their proven capacity to perform the work required of that position."],"display_date":"1925 - 1950","search_date":"1937-12-31","locations":[{"id":20911,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":963,"tag":"Iron and Steel Industry"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5237,"title":"Safety Conditions in the Iron and Steel Industry","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/50","end_date":"12/31/71","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“The foreman would let you know if it was safe. Because he said something was safe didn’t mean it was safe.” This is how Ulysses S. Anderson described the safety conditions at Sloss Furnace, a pig-iron producing blast furnace in Birmingham, Alabama. While being interviewed by the Sloss Furnace Association Anderson spent a great amount of time describing the safety conditions he encountered during his employment at Sloss. As the previous quote demonstrates, the safety standards at Sloss were not always up to par. Anderson describes several incidents wherein he was almost injured or killed. Two of these incidents stand out as examples of the safety conditions at Sloss and the dangers that workers in steel mills routinely faced. In the first incident Anderson accidently stepped into a hole and as he pulled his foot out hole it was badly burned by the hot iron. He described the injury saying that his foot had been burned, “from the arch all the way down.” Anderson had to have skin removed from his leg so that it could be grafted to his foot. In the second incident Anderson was almost killed by poisonous gases escaping from the furnace. According to his testimony he was working on cleaning the coal from the furnace when he suddenly became aware of a severe pain in his head and it was then that he noticed two men lying unconscious on the floor. When a co-worker by the name of Mr. Seabury noticed Anderson and the two unconscious men he immediately set off the alarm and got the three men out of the area. Luckily Anderson and the two other men managed to survive the incident. According to Anderson no one had ever bothered to warn him about the potential hazard of gases escaping from the furnace.","Unfortunately hazards like those faced by Anderson were all too common in the furnaces and mills of the era. According to historian John A. Fitch, “every workingman in an iron or steel mill is in danger because he is working with forces which are, seemingly, always watching for a chance to get beyond human control.” The number of deaths from accidents in furnaces and mills could be simply astounding. According to Fitch’s study of steel mills in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania there were 195 deaths in single year from workplace accidents in iron and steel mills. These sorts of accidents were often caused by lack of safety provisions built into the machines and equipment utilized in the furnace or mill. Fitch provides an account that serves to illustrate this point. In one mill he visited there was heavy machinery with exposed gearing that was, “absolutely unguarded, although it was common knowledge that workmen had been caught in just such places and badly injured.”","Despite the fact that simple safety precautions and common sense could have lessened the danger workers faced, they were placed in extremely dangerous situations could that result in dire consequences. If an accident did occur it was likely that those involved would die horrible and painful deaths, and even if they survived they were often permanently scarred and kept from working. This is exactly what happened to Anderson when his foot was badly burned; he was forced to endure a skin graft and then spend six to eight weeks off the job while he recuperated."],"display_date":"1950 - 1971","search_date":"1960-12-31","locations":[{"id":28563,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":963,"tag":"Iron and Steel Industry"},{"id":964,"tag":"Industrial Safety Conditi"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5270,"title":"Levitt &amp; Sons Advertises New Housing Design","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/49","end_date":"12/31/49","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["After receiving much criticism on his first mass-produced, low-cost housing design, the influential post-World War II real estate developer, William Levitt, introduced a new design in 1949.  As advertisements for the new Rancher sprang up across Pennsylvania, many citizens, including veterans who would receive significant discounts, flocked to the Exhibit Center in the Levittown suburbs.  The innovative, mass-produced Rancher, with its “special introductory price” of $8,990, appealed to eager Americans who dreamed of home-ownership.  In an attempt to generate a sense of urgency among potential buyers, the advertisement warned that the initial price was “subject to increase at any time. Those who make application will be protected against any raise.”  With this in mind, Americans hurried to Levittown to secure reasonably priced housing for their families.","The Levittown guarantee of decent, affordable housing lured many eager, young couples to participate in the suburbanization of postwar America.  As historian Joshua Ruff noted, “Patience had been killed by 15 years of economic depression, war and an epidemic housing shortage. People wanted the full package—the affordable house, the new appliances, the suburban lifestyle—and they wanted it right away.”  Levitt & Sons promised this kind of lifestyle to potential customers, deeming Levittown, Pennsylvania as “the most perfectly planned community in America.”  The alluring advertisement also confidently announced, “There is nothing to compare with it anywhere.”  Levittown included the whole package that Americans desired—a sturdy, affordable house equipped with all the necessary amenities to live comfortably while raising a family.  By promoting Levittown as a kid-friendly community, Levitt & Sons urged families to consider the benefits of living in such a peaceful neighborhood.  For no extra charge, as the advertisement clearly acknowledged, Levittown residents could freely access the many recreational areas in the community.  Homebuyers would get all of this at one low cost.  Finally, the American dream of home-ownership had become broadly accessible.","Earlier on, critics had attacked Levitt’s first housing model, the Cape Cod, as a depressingly small and unimpressive structure.  As acknowledged by suburban historians Rosalyn Baxandall and Elizabeth Ewen, “Levitt took the criticisms seriously and spent between $50,000 and $100,000 to study new housing designs.”  Levitt’s commitment proved essential in improving the earlier design.  Historian Alexander O. Boulton attests to this accomplishment: the new Ranchers “were two feet longer than the earlier models, and they offered as standard features built-in appliances that were only just coming into general use.”  The April 1950 issue of <em>Architectural Forum</em> also addressed the influential and innovative Rancher design.  As quoted in <em>Picture Windows</em>, “‘Never before in the history of U.S. building has one house type made such an impact on the industry in so short a time…builders by the dozens junked their Cape Coddled programs, switched instead to the new Levitt type.’”  It was this innovation, convenience, and affordability of the new Rancher that constituted the major selling points for Levittown in 1949.  The Rancher encompassed all of these elements, thus attracting anxious Americans to the suburbs."],"display_date":1949,"search_date":"1949-07-02","locations":[{"id":26230,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1010,"tag":"Housing"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5276,"title":"Cordless Tools spread in the Building Industry","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/80","end_date":"12/31/80","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1961, Black and Decker invented cordless power tools. Brian Hoy, who worked as a general contractor for over 30 years, found the convenience of these tools to be among the best technological changes in the industry especially for small jobs. He stated “cordless tools are one of the greatest tools to have come to the trade because of their eases of use.” One reason is because contractors do not have to waste time finding an outlet and make sure the cord is long enough to complete the job.  Cordless tools reduced the amount of time that contractor would have had to spend on a job because they can just grab to power tool and screw, drill, or cut within a few seconds. With the reduced about of time on jobs means that the builder can move onto the next job and might be able to do more work in a year than before.","As early as 1985 <em>Popular Science</em> talked about the changes that were made over the past twenty years. Over that span the volt size of the batteries, range of tools that are cordless, and weight. Popular Science also recognized how a contractor used cordless power tools to reduce time on jobs and increase the number of jobs per years. The size of the batteries that were used in the drills and the first ones were 4.8 volts in the 1960s, 9.6 volts in 1980s and 18 volts in 2000s. That is because of the different technologies has had advanced in the battery making and the ability to recharge the batteries in a shorter amount of time also. The article shows the different tools that were cordless in the 1980s and if you walked into any home improvement store that sold cordless tools in the early 2000s there would be more tools available for people to buy. Ed Doran discussed the different changes to the cordless tool industry with a new battery technology and how it will help take workers being more productive with less charging time. The weight of the cordless power tools have decline over the years because of technology in manufacturing and the materials used in the power tools. In the early 2000s, it was hard to visit a job site where there was not a cordless power tool somewhere."],"display_date":1980,"search_date":"1980-07-01","locations":[{"id":39142,"lat":40.3672040655,"lng":-76.457697135,"zoom":9,"place":"Lebanon, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":831,"tag":"construction"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5277,"title":"Air Nailer spreads though Building Industry","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/85","end_date":"12/31/85","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Brian Hoy, a life-long building contractor appreciated many new tools that entered into wide usage in the trade but he stated that “the air gun is one [tool] that helped increase production.” He adapted the air guns in the middle of the 1980s. The air nailers were around earlier, but were not widely used because they were not proven. Once the large companies started to make the nailers, and builders heard that the nailers saved time and money that the builders started to buy them.","In 1959, the air nailer was not seen as a device that people needed on the job. It was not until the late 1970s early 1980s that air nailers became widespread on the job site. This was because of the amount of time that was saved and the cost that were saved. From an article in <em>Popular Science</em>, the nailers were able to put 100 nails per minute, which is considerable higher than a human can nail in. With the air nailer it required less people to be on the jobsite than before because the nailers were quicker and only required one hand to use. The cost that was saved from the builder in the article was about 400 dollar in labor. Had this come to the building industry when it was invented might have changed the industry before Brian Hoy was in the trade.

The crush of pedestrian traffic that gathered on the bridge's promenade deck was anxious to experience what was described as the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\", and no doubt contained shoppers. In the lower left-hand corner of the cover page of this booklet, the figure of a young woman draped in Romanesque robes stands on a pedestal inscribed with the words \"Excelsior\" (meaning <em>ever higher</em>). The commemorative laurel wreath she holds in her left hand is pointed toward the bridge while her right hand holds an unfurled American flag with staff. The young woman appears to cast her gaze out over the harbor where a view of the bridge's expanse can clearly be seen. Engineering genius, workmanship, and size are suggested by the artists' renditions on the front cover of the souvenir booklet and in the fifteen sketches contained inside the official book and program chronicling the <em>Opening Ceremonies of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge</em>. On its cover page are portrait insets of both John A. Roebling (1806-1869), the original engineer (upper left-hand corner) and his son, Washington (1837-1926), the current Chief Engineer for the project (lower right-hand corner). The front-cover acknowledgement of their role in the achievement is heralded by a cherub that playfully frolics between their portraiture in the shadow of the bridge's massive span.","While the booklet and book/ program were produced to commemorate the bridge's official opening, cumulatively these artists' renditions appropriately exalt American know-how, excellence, and spirit of determination in the dawning decades of the Second Industrial Revolution. The economic promise of this 17-year engineering marvel was touted by a litany of regional political and religious dignitaries as throngs of promenade onlookers followed the 41 pages of proceedings and drawings. However, the general public deferred their judgment and celebration. Quite possibly, because thousands watched the fireworks after the proceedings that day from within less than a mile of the multimillion-dollar bridge. They watched from decaying slums where New York's immigrants lived in abject poverty. When viewed from the center promenade area of the bridge, the slums may have taken on the ambience of the peaceful horizon; however, one would beg a closer look.","Under the bridge expanse, a busy harbor gorged with sailing vessels can be seen. Many, no doubt, are on their way to New York City's busy piers and waiting stevedores, their cargo holds brimming with building supplies, produce, dry goods, and other merchandise. Soon, efficient access to the bridge would accommodate their cargo via its freight rails ? fueling consumerism. The advent of increased commerce would add momentum to the rate of growth of merchandising and other business activities in New York and across the nation. Like Loeser, business owners had stakes in the new bridge. It is indeed suitable that a female portrayed the figure on the souvenir booklet, since she typified the nation's primary consumer. The official book/program provides insight into the pomp and circumstance of the event, which was heralded by a full complement of fireworks, music, and speeches. A popular pastime from opening day, a stroll on the promenade deck of the bridge was such an attraction that one week after its opening, confusion within an exceptionally large crowd ended with the deaths of twelve people. After a formal inquiry, modifications were made expediently to the narrow stairwells leading to the promenade entrances and egress. The booklet and book/program, in tandum with the opening of the bridge, served to herald the creativity and competitive spirit of American business at the dawn of the Second Industrial Revolution."],"display_date":"May 24, 1883","search_date":"1883-05-24","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":72,"school_id":43}},{"id":5341,"title":"The <em>Freedmen’s Record </em>Reports on the Prosperity of Freedmen","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-10-01","end_date":"1865-10-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["According to the <em>Freedmen’s Record</em> report, many southerners perceived freedmen as “a hopelessly lazy, sensual creature who, if he has enough to satisfy the lowest animal wants, will be content.” They feared that freedmen would resort to theft instead of working to fulfill their needs.  The<em> Record</em> attempted to change these perceptions by exposing the tremendous success of freed African Americans in the North.  This is observed when the <em>Record </em>stated, “the amount of crime committed by this class of persons is much less than that committed by white men.”","The <em>Freedmen’s Record </em>was a monthly publication by the New England Freedman’s Aid Society, which worked to point out the hard work and success of many freedmen.  In the October 1865 issue, the statistical research of Dr. J. McCune Smith received considerate attention.  Smith,the first African American to receive a medical degree, found through his research that African Americans invested over eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars in New York, Brooklyn, and Williamsburg combined.  In New York City and Brooklyn alone, African Americans were said to have nearly five million dollars in property, while in Detroit, they had three hundred thousand dollars and “are excluded from the best public schools, which they, in common with their white fellow-citizens, are taxed to support.”  The same could be said for Washington, D.C., whereas in Philadelphia, nearly four hundred and fifty African American children attended public schools and fifty were students at universities in Albany or Oberlin.","The <em>Record </em>also detailed the hardships of freedmen,contributing the lack of success to:  the limited opportunities in certain areas, little to no schooling, and that some businesses would simply not hire blacks.  Even with such disadvantages, “The proportion of Irish paupers in Massachusetts, a year or two ago, to the whole Irish population, was one in one hundred and thirty-one,” while the ratio for African Americans was only “one in one hundred and twenty-five or one hundred and twenty-six.”  Even though the African Americans should have been at a much greater disadvantage than the white Irish population, they had similar proportions for a poor population.","The financial success of northern African Americans proved their ability to adapt to a freed lifestyle and obtain more than basic necessities.  In many cities, they contributed thousands of dollars to their schools and churches.  The <em>Freedmen’s Record</em> attempted to brush away fears of an inability to adapt in hopes that “they are admitted to all the privileges of freedmen!”"],"display_date":"October 1865","search_date":"1865-10-16","locations":[{"id":6210,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5354,"title":"Grant Issues Order No. 11","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-18","end_date":"1863-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In January of 1863 Union General Ulysses S.

Having arrived there on April 12, 1841 Nathaniel Hawthorne was a founding member, both in person and purse, of the Brook Farm experiment, but the author spent only six months with the community (having physically departed in late October, 1841) and eventually filed a lawsuit against the founder of Brook Farm, Unitarian minister George Ripley, on September 6, 1845 for $585.70.","Brenda Wineapple suspects that Hawthorne was initially attracted to Brook Farm since Hawthorne was \"[i]n need of a home, an income, and a place to write, Hawthorne gladly gambled on Ripley's arcadia. The union of thinker and worker was irresistible to a man whose conscience still cared about idleness and still considered writing a frivolous pastime, no matter how much he wanted to do it\" (147). As such, the intentions of Hawthorne were fair enough, wishing to engage in small bits of manual labor in order to become closer to the transcendental, ideal state, and, of course, to write in his leisure time, which he anticipated as being great in quantity. These notions of Hawthornes couldn’t have been further from the outcome, though.","Hawthorne was not keen on the work nor lifestyle that Brook Farm demanded of its community. Brook Farm, being an agricultural community required a great deal of fertilizer, which, for Brook Farm, was manure--that is animal feces. Hawthorne’s designated job was to shovel piles and piles of this manure and transport them daily. The seemingly endless mounds of manure were disheartening to Hawthorne. He would confide to his fiancée in a letter that he \"never suspected that farming was so hard,\" and wished to be rescued from it \"before [his] soul is utterly buried in a dungheap.\"","Hawthorne also little time for writing. The hard labor, new surroundings, and level of social activity required as a member of a socialist community prevented him from beginning any literary projects larger than a personal letter or occasional journal entry. The social aspect of Brook Farm is what had the greatest effect on Hawthorne’s writing habits. James T Fields, a publisher with whom Hawthorne worked with, noted \"He was a man who had, so to speak, a physical affinity with solitude.\"","With the burden of work yoking Hawthorne, and without the time for writing’s recuperative effect, as well as being many miles away from his fiancée, Hawthorne was in a decidedly abject state while at Brook Farm. In fact, one of Hawthorne’s fellow associates of Brook Farm, Georgiana Kirby wrote of Hawthorne’s awkward state while a part the community:","\"Hawthorne, after spending a year at the Community, had now left. No one could have been more out of place than he in a mixed company.... He was morbidly shy and reserved, needing to be shielded from his fellows...\"","And so, eventually, the lifestyle of Brook Farm became too much to bear for Hawthorne. Upon his departure Hawthorne demanded his initial investment from founder George Ripley. They battled back and forth for several years after Hawthorne’s departure (since, unbeknownst to Hawthorne, Ripley nor Brook Farm had the money to pay him back) until Hawthorn eventually filed a lawsuit by the end of 1845. The outcome of this lawsuit or whether Hawthorne received back his initial investment is unknown.<br /><br />"],"display_date":"October 1, 1841 - October 17, 1842","search_date":"1842-04-09","locations":[{"id":6208,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":522,"tag":"Massachusetts"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1652,"tag":"Hawthorne"},{"id":1653,"tag":"Nathaniel"}],"course":{"name":"Pamphlets &amp; Pirates: Popular Print Culture in Antebellum America","school":"Northeastern University","course_id":99,"school_id":56}},{"id":6283,"title":"The Great Depression and Household Management Columns","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"10/1/29","end_date":"1/31/36","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Following the stock market crash of October and the resulting American economic collapse, Maryland families were left haphazardly arrayed on a financial spectrum starting with “making do” and ending with scrounging. Wives and mothers often managed the day to day expenditures within families and those in the newly reduced middle class adapted and reframed the economic decisions that they made. Women living in towns and cities dealt with their new money problems and simultaneously struggled with the stigma attached to talking about financial problems and the need to keep up appearances. Since personal help and advice on how to save money remained somewhat taboo, women found help in the Women’s sections and household maintenance columns in local newspapers. Through these columns women managed to build a wide reaching but anonymous support network.","These columns ran before the depression but after the economic crash they too adapted and reflected the economic needs of women during the Great Depression. The women’s section of newspapers usually covered roughly two pages and offered a myriad of advice and help to women trying to cut costs. The Daily Mail of Hagerstown, Maryland, ran a weekly Food Market Advice column for women. Information in the column included the rise and fall of prices for local produce and meats and predicted patterns for future prices providing women with needed information for weekly shopping and encouragement to take advantage of local markets. The column also provided meal ideas and menus for the cheapest options. Other articles gave advice about meal plans and offered set prices that they believed could be followed, touting $1.50 or $2.00 plans that could feed large families. Often the advice became extremely detailed. A column titled Sister Mary's Kitchen ran in the Fredrick, Maryland, News. The writer advised women about which cuts of meat cooked the quickest so they might save money on electricity. She noted that the money saved by cooking quickly could be set aside to pay for heating bills. Some columns offered direct tips on how to discretely cut costs so that women could maintain their middle class appearance. These tips ranged from cooking advice --telling women to mix butter and margarine to stretch it farther and hide the taste-- to sewing --advising that dresses could be let down and that ribbon or rickrack could hide the old seams and creases.","Usually these columns were also conscious of the social conventions of the time period and refrained from using terms like “cheap” or “thrifty.” Economical became the standard term used to describe the advice and alert women reading it that they could find advice there. The columns that offered advice also obeyed social conventions by giving women in need of help and advice the anonymity needed to ask.

One of the articles in the collection, “How Good Roads Developed: Polk County, Florida”, references not only the development of roads in Polk County but also outlines the economy of Polk County in terms of the principle commodities and statistics like the per capita wealth and realty values. The book was published in 1922 and thus gives insight to the communities it references as they were at that time.","            In terms of general context, the 1920s were a dichotomous time for African Americans. On the one hand, this was the time of the Harlem Renaissance, which celebrated African American culture and, to an extent, empowered African Americans. Additionally, in some cases, segregation had strengthened the African American community through adversity. On the other hand, the early 20<sup>th</sup> century saw some of the most violent racism and discrimination against African Americans since the end of the Civil War. The Supreme Court case Plessy v. Ferguson instituted legalized discrimination with its decision of “separate but equal”, a series of legal decisions had disfranchised almost all African Americans in the South, and lynching mobs were a constant threat to southern African Americans. Furthermore, as a result of the premature end to reconstruction, a pattern of exploitation of black laborers by white landowners was established. Movements like the Harlem Renaissance, however, indicate a sense of pride in African Americans and a celebration of a developing culture that was influenced heavily by the adversity facing African Americans. From primary and secondary sources referencing Polk County Florida in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, an example of this flourishing of culture in the face of socioeconomic hardship can be seen.","            The primary source directly reveals the economic conditions in Polk County, Florida. Additionally, when combined with information from the secondary sources, the primary source indirectly reveals the issue of socioeconomic status of African Americans and the culture and community this status cultivated in Polk County Florida. According to the document, in 1922, “Polk County [was] an agricultural county”[1]. Additionally, “in Polk County the finest Florida oranges and grapefruit are produced to the extent of 3,500,000 grates a year…[and] in Polk County, too, one-fifth of the world’s phosphate is mined”[2]. In total these “phosphate mines in Polk County…are valued at $19,000,000”[3], in 1922. The immensity of these raw commodities present in Polk County Florida indicates that a large labor force would have been needed to extract the raw goods and ready them for production. Furthermore, the poorer residents of the County, which most definitely included the African American community, would probably have provided this labor. Kevin Boyle echoes this description of Polk County, in his book <em>Arc of Justice: A saga of Race, Civil Rights, and Murder in the Jazz Age</em>.","            By Boyles’ account, “there was white Bartow, the solid respectable center of Polk County. And there was black Bartow, a cache of sun-baked homes separated from the center of town by the railroad tracks and the massive wall of segregation”[4]. According to Boyle, Bartow attracted many African Americans despite the Jim Crow conditions because of the availability of “ample work on the railroad, on the land, or in the mines”[5]. Although the industries in Bartow provided paying work for African Americans, the conditions resemble slavery more than anything else. White mine owners hired desperate black men who would work for a dollar a day because “few white men would take the brutally hard work—breaking stones with pick and ax, sunup to sundown…seven days a week”[6]. Despite the exploitation, racism, and segregation facing the African American community of Bartow, Boyle points out that “the workers also built a world for themselves”[7]. East Bartow, the black part of the town, became a bustling community. Black businesses including general stores, barbershops, real estate agencies, and restaurants opened[8]. Black social clubs and churches were also built, which served to bring the community together[9]. Boyle’s account reveals the underlying message in the primary source document, which is, Polk County consisted of an economy based on economic exploitation of African American labor. Additionally, Boyle’s account indicates that the segregation and racism faced by African American residents of Polk County played a significant role in shaping and influencing the community and culture that developed there.","            These aspects of the African American communities in Polk County are also mentioned in David Nicholls’ article <em>Migrant Labor, Folklore, and Resistance in Hurston’s Polk County: Reframing Mules and Men</em>. In his article, Nicholls’ analyzes Zora Neale Hurston’s experience in a Polk County lumber camp as recounted in her novel <em>Mules and Men</em>.Nicholls’ aim is to demonstrate how African Americans resisted white exploitation of black labor through folk tales[10]. Nicholls states that a study done in 1931 “notes that black workers usually held the least attractive positions”[11]. Nicholls’ provides a quote from the study that claims the exploitation of African American workers in the turpentine camps of Florida and Georgia was notorious[12]. According to Nicholls’, Hurston was drawn to these camps as a subject of her writing because “[the camps] brought together strands of folklore from different sources”[13]. By using examples from Hurston’s book that demonstrate how African American workers used folk stories as an act of resistance, Nicholls’ demonstrates that Hurston’s “text displays folklore’s function as an everyday form of resistance in the Jim Crow South[14]. Ultimately, Nicholl’s argument not only demonstrates the exploitative labor conditions for African Americans in Polk County, but also indicates how Africa American culture developed in these conditions and how it was used to resist white oppression.","            Finally an encyclopedia entry from the <em>Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History</em> titled “The Blues in African-American Culture” gives a short overview of Zora Neale Hurston’s time in the lumber camps of Polk County. It was this trip to the lumber camps of Polk County, the entry claims, that was “Hurston’s most important contribution to our understanding of African-American blues culture”[15]. Additionally, the entry reveals the significance of the culture Hurston encountered in the Polk County Lumber Camp: “the sort of rough-and-ready backwoods blues that Zora Neale Hurston encountered in Polk County, Florida, remains a surprisingly vital presence among a working-class black clientele in parts of the Deep South”[16]. This entry indicates the significance of the African American culture that developed in Polk County as a result of exploitative labor conditions for African Americans.","            Revisiting the primary source document, a municipal record of counties and their maintenance needs, it describes Polk County in 1922 as a thriving community that “ranks very high in per capita wealth and in realty values”[17]. However, as the research suggests, this applies only to the white community of Polk County. Furthermore, the economic prosperity this document portrays as existing in white Polk County and the conditions of African Americans that the secondary sources portray indicates the continuation of an economic system based on slavery. Additionally, as the document completely ignores the African American community of Bartow, this indicates that for the most part, Southern Governments, especially that of Polk County, disregarded and ignored the plight of African Americans in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. Ultimately, these conditions significantly impacted the culture of African Americans that developed in the Deep South."," ","[1] \"Water and Sewage Works,\" Google Books, 171.

Five years prior, John R. Phillips set out to purchase a house and lot owned by one Mrs. Hooker. Working through an agent for Mrs. Hooker, Amos Harvey, Phillips purchased the homestead for $2500 in cash. Everything was written out in a contract notarized by L. H. Alredge. A simple, yet legally sound deed transferred the property from Mrs. Hooker to John Phillips. The only problem was, it was paid for in Confederate bank notes. This seemed perfectly fine in 1862 with the war being waged and the Confederate States holding their own against the Union forces. In 1867, after the defeat of the Confederacy and the official labeling of the CSA as treason, Confederate bank notes thought to be ‘illegal tender’. As a result, Mrs. Hooker tried to take her land back on the grounds that the contract was invalid and she had not been paid in acceptable currency. Phillips disputed this and the two found themselves before the Supreme Court of North Carolina.","            The question the Court had to discuss was the validity of the transaction using rebel currency. Did the rebel bank notes hold real value or were they worthless prints from a defunct government? In a way, they were both. The bank notes, at their height, could exchange a dollar of gold for under two dollars. By putting the Confederate bank note to the gold standard, it allowed for quick exchange and transaction, while also backing the notes in a currency useable in any part of the world (provided the bank in question actually had the gold to back it up). With the defeat of the Confederate States of America, the “Confederate” banks no longer existed so the notes became relatively worthless.<em> Became</em> being the operative word. From 1861 until the end of the war, the Confederate bank note was legal tender in any of the Confederate States and could be used for taxes and other exchanges within the Confederacy. After that, the United States had to take stock on the Confederate bank notes and allowed exchanges for Union greenbacks in certain situations, like in New Orleans, after the war had ended. That said, the Confederate notes themselves were never actually declared illegal; rather, they were lumped together with the legislation nullifying contracts that attempted to aid the rebellion. This legal condition appeared in the Supreme Court’s decision: “The Convention was prompt to declare that the rebellion and everything in aid of it was illegal. And it declared void all contracts which were in aid of it; but it did not declare void all contracts, the consideration of which were Confederate treasury notes.” As Phillips’s exchange with Mrs. Hooker did not aid the Rebellion’s cause and was just a land transfer, it remained in effect. The Court ruled in favor of Phillips."],"display_date":"December 13, 1862 - November 1, 1867","search_date":"1865-05-23","locations":[{"id":52803,"lat":35.7795897,"lng":-78.6381787,"zoom":8,"place":"Raleigh, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1584,"tag":"courts"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}}]}
