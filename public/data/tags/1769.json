The children and parents,were awe inspired when viewing the planes flying over their heads. Children dreamt of one day flying a plane and traveling to different parts of the world. As World War II began Americans all over the nation enlisted as pilots. Most often,\"pilot\" was associated with men, but as World War II erupted this term would become associated with women as well. [1]","Many of the girls that had grown up with planes flying over their homes decided to enlist in the army as pilots. People were not content with the idea of female pilots; they believed that a woman’s place was at home with the children. Because of this thought, the military was against having women enlist as aviators. The military branches that involved combat rejected women. The aviation branch said no to women pilots until 1942. As war broke out the american government was in need of more able-bodied people and thus allowed women (and other minorities) to enlist into the army.[2]","Jackie Cochran first brought the idea of WASP- Women Aviation Service Pilots- to Eleanor Roosevelt the first lady at the time.  Though the idea was at first rejected ,Cochran was eventually called back and asked to lead the division.Cochran was chosen to lead the devision because of her exceptional skills as an aviator.At first the military was skeptical, but as they began to see women fulfilling expectations they became more accepting of there new roles. The women of the WASP division proved to society that women were capable of serving the country in combat and not only just at home. They flew in military missions but were never deployed into combat.[3]","When the WASP division was disbanded in 1944, the military hid the records of the women pilots that fought in World War II. They gave no honors to the women that fought for their country. The battle for their recognition would continue through out the 20<sup>th</sup> century.

She dreamt of flying like the birds that she often saw flying around the cotton fields.[1]","With her dream as her driving force Bessie Coleman began to read articles on aviation and women. Reading about the Baranoss Raymonde de la Roche, the first women aviator and Harriet Quimby, the first American women to earn an aviation license inspired her. These remarkable women were a constant reminder that although she was a minority her dream could be achieved. Even though she was discriminated because of her race, librarians were so surprised that an African American girl was requesting the books they let her read them. The stories contained in each book served as constant fuel for her dream to one-day fly like the Baranoss Raymonde de la Roche and Harriet Quimby. [2]","Bessie Coleman knew she would not have the opportunity to learn how to fly a plane in America because of the sexism and racism. When she approached American flying schools she would constantly get the door slammed in her face, but she did not let this keep her from perusing her dream. She found that Europe had no restrains for aviation through her research, and after a year of saving her money from waitressing, and learning French, Bessie Coleman left America to seek an aviation title in France.[3]","Bessie received her aviation license from the Federation Aeronautique Interenationale and upon her return to America she became known as the first black women aviator. She often performed in aviation shows where she executed complicated aerial tricks that earned her a reputation as a daredevil in the sky. [4]","Bessie Coleman is an inspiration to women all over the world. She was told that she couldn’t fly because of her race and gender, but she ignored this, not stopping until she was a certified aviator."," "," "," "," "," ","[1]Julianne Malveaux, ”Black Issues in Higher Education”, Matthews & Associates, Vol. 16 (2000): 34","[2] Ron Edwards, “Aviation History”, Cowles Enthusiast Mediam, No 2 (1998). 3","[3] <em>Encyclopedia Britannica Online</em>, s. v. \"Bessie Coleman,\" accessed November 11, 2013.","[4] Laurel Graeber, “ Finding the Path To Freedom”, New York Times, Weekend FINE ARTS LEISURE, Feb 13, 1998."," "],"display_date":"1911 - 1926","search_date":"1918-12-31","locations":[{"id":16047,"lat":34.9649271052,"lng":-101.357407374,"zoom":9,"place":"Armstrong, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1769,"tag":"Aviation"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}}]}
