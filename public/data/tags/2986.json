The target of the Union campaign was Shreveport, headquarters of a large Confederate force and capital of Confederate Louisicana. Union troops were commanded by Major General Nathaniel Banks, who was also a prominent Republican figure and a former speaker for the House of Representatives. However, despite Banks' political reputation, his battlefield tactices left much to be desired. Despite commanding a force of Union troops that heavily outnumbered the Confederates, the Union suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat. While the outcome of the Civil War appeared to be decided in favor of the union, this was the last decisive Confederate victory.","The failure of the Red River campaign was the last in which Banks had significant military command. Lincoln pushed to have Banks removed of his command and was eager to learn of his removal, sending a telegram on April 22, 1864 to General Mason Brayman in Louisiana that asked \"What day did General Corse part with Gen Banks?\". Shortly after being removed from his military duties, Banks was placed on leave in Washington D.C., where he proved to be an asset to Lincoln in the political arena, lobbying Congress to support the President's plans for reconstruction in Louisiana.","Even though Banks may have been over his head in terms of his military assignments, Lincoln did not hesistate to exercise his duties as Commander in Chief, and in some way, \"micromanage\" the assignments and leadership on the battlefields. The previous telegram illustrates how important this issue was to Lincoln, as he was eager in following up his interest in removing Banks from his command. The telegraph granted Lincoln powers that had never been used by a previous President. However, this instant form of communication and his authoratative style of managing his resources revolutionized the methods in which war is organized and executed by field generals and their commanders. "],"display_date":"April 9, 1864 - April 22, 1864","search_date":"1864-04-15","locations":[{"id":52917,"lat":32.0842949,"lng":-93.3792057,"zoom":8,"place":"Red River LA"},{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":2987,"tag":"Washington"},{"id":2986,"tag":"Louisiana"},{"id":2985,"tag":"Banks"},{"id":2984,"tag":"General"},{"id":2983,"tag":"Red Rivers"},{"id":2982,"tag":"Mansfield"},{"id":701,"tag":"Lincoln"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6709,"title":"In the Case of Alexina Morrison? Could Slaves Become White? And Could White People Become Slaves?","course_id":171,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-01","end_date":"1863-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In January of 1857, a slave trader purchased an “enslaved” woman named Jane Morrison who was “of fair complexion, blue eyes, and flaxen hair.” After her escape, the next time he’d see her was in a Jefferson Parish courtoom where Alexina Morrison had filed suit against him. The suit declared that Alexina –not Jane— was white, mistakenly identified and mistakenly enslaved. In her petition, Alexina asked that she be declared legally white and awarded $10,000 ($270,000.00 in today’s money) for the wrong that John White had done by holding her as a slave. The following case, heard by three juries and two Supreme Courts, confronted interpretations of race in relation to slavery.","Both parties, Morrison and White, made claims about Morrison's ancestry but could offer no hard evidence besides judgments of Morrison’s outward appearance. In her testimony, Morrison said she had been born to and kidnapped from two white parents. In response, White provided the bill of sale from Morrison’s purchase, but it was deemed “illegal” due to its origin in Arkansas. Therefore, both parties were left to prove Morrison’s origin through her appearance and the “speculative” opinions of physicians and others.  In his attempt to prove Morrison's \"blackness,\" White pointed to facial features like her high cheekbones. This logic, as Morrison’s lawyers pointed out, made even the white men in the room seem like they had “black” features. ","The jury was left to decide the difference between being white and performing whiteness:  Is whiteness inherent through nature or acquired through circumstance? Merely the thought of this logic had the power to shatter several existing power dynamics of the antebellum South. Whiteness could no longer be the exclusive sphere of superiority for white people if black slaves could efficiently perform it. If whiteness could be easily attained –a skill rather than a birthright, the permeable barrier would fail to protect any non-slaveholder from slavery. Whiteness, synonymous to protection from slavery, was perpetuated by the outward appearance of white people –mainly their pale skin. Therefore, a threat to Morrison’s protection was a threat to the nonslaveholders’ whiteness and their own security. <em>Morrison v White</em> raised a question central to the race-based economy of the South: how much longer would pale skin protect nonslaveholders from being enslaved? By complicating perceived notions of race in this way, Morrison unraveled a history of categorization by race and finessed her way to freedom. Ultimately, the case of Alexina Morrison showed how in some instances one of the foundations of American slavery—race—was unstable enough to derail enslavement."," ","."," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1857 - January 1, 1863","search_date":"1860-01-01","locations":[{"id":53072,"lat":29.6498691,"lng":-90.1120696,"zoom":8,"place":"Jefferson Parish, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":744,"tag":"court case"},{"id":29,"tag":"New Orleans"},{"id":2986,"tag":"Louisiana"},{"id":629,"tag":"race"},{"id":889,"tag":"Racism"},{"id":3333,"tag":"Jefferson Parish"},{"id":3334,"tag":"whiteness"},{"id":3335,"tag":"appearance"},{"id":3336,"tag":"free woman of color"},{"id":3337,"tag":"enslaved woman"},{"id":3338,"tag":"John White"},{"id":3339,"tag":"Jane Morrison"},{"id":3340,"tag":"Alexina Morrison"},{"id":3341,"tag":"white slave"},{"id":3342,"tag":"blue-eyed slave"},{"id":3343,"tag":"mulatto"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":171,"school_id":11}}]}
