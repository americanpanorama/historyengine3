As a result, they were captivated by its spread.  Each individual country hoped it would be spared and that distance from the initial outbreak would suffice as protection.  Americans watched as the disease originated in India and quickly spread to Egypt.  From there, the disease alarmingly spread to the Mediterranean, beginning European infection with Italy and eventually France. By September, 1865 newspapers viewed the disease’s spread to England to be inevitable.  This left the Atlantic as the United States’ only defense.  However, distance only prolonged American’s fears. It did not protect cities such as Washington D.C. from cholera’s inevitable arrival.  As the Daily National Republican stated, “We feel sure, however, that if the cholera comes this way, no quarantine, no dententions, no fumigation, no lines of demarcations will keep it out.”  The one bastion of American hope remained very similar to that experienced in previous outbreaks.  The reports dispersing from Cairo claimed cholera only affected “those who live in close, confined quarters” with “no drainage” and most importantly “general bad living”.  Those who drank, were prone to excess, and morally depraved were viewed as the only ones susceptible.","With these signs abroad Americans personified cholera as a malign evil and sought preemptive preparation as the cure to this disease.  In a poem from 1831 republished in an edition of the Daily National Republican, the disease was named a “pale white horse” spreading misery and death throughout the land.  Strategies included cleaning of both physical and moral garbage.  The main sources of information in 1865 were reports coming from afflicted nations and Europe.  United States papers took these claims as truth and reprinted them for their readers.  Overall, 1865 marked a tenuous time for Washington D.C. residents and other Americans as they were forced to watch cholera spread without halt, inevitably heading towards their shores."],"display_date":"September 1985","search_date":"1985-09-15","locations":[{"id":40259,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":1316,"tag":"washington d.c."},{"id":1315,"tag":"cholera"}],"course":{"name":"Nineteenth Century Urban Epidemics","school":"Furman University","course_id":82,"school_id":4}},{"id":5445,"title":"Success against Cholera: Washington D.C.

In this climate, government was not a solution.  Instead, it was a class of elite doctors that were portrayed by the media as answering the call in the fight against disease in the nineteenth century.  Physicians such as Robert Koch and John Snow pursued their study of disease as private practicing individuals, not as agents of the state. Dr. George Johnson was among the ranks of premiere private doctor.  His theories laid the foundations that led the residents of Washington D.C. to believe a critical blow against cholera had been presented in the summer of 1866.  His work was advertised and praised on May 6, 1866 in the article “The First Blow against Cholera” in a Washington D.C. newspaper, <em>The Daily National Republican</em>.","Dr. Johnson’s published work, Notes on Cholera was described by critics in the <em>Daily National Republican </em>as “the first true and complete explanation of the disease.” It was believed that the “first blow” had been struck against cholera in the discovery of what it really was.  Dr. Johnson’s purpose in writing it was “to sweep away an erroneous theory with regard to the nature of cholera.” In this quest he explained the disease in simplistic terms and provided the roots of cholera in a short one hundred pages.  This made the source of cholera visible for the larger public.  By creating progress in knowledge, Americans received hope based upon factual grounds for the first time in 1866.  This was is in contrast to the naïve hopes of past outbreaks.  Previously, cholera was believed to only affect the poor and immoral.  This belief left the average American immune.  This was based on a theological approach to the disease, deeming it a plague from god.  However, the advertising of Johnson’s work in a newspaper shows a significant advance towards a more scientific perception of disease.  This was one of the most significant transitions of the nineteenth century."],"display_date":"May 1866","search_date":"1866-05-16","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1316,"tag":"washington d.c."},{"id":1315,"tag":"cholera"}],"course":{"name":"Nineteenth Century Urban Epidemics","school":"Furman University","course_id":82,"school_id":4}}]}
