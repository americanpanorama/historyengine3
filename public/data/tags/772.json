Here the four presidential candidates dance with members of their supposed respective constituencies.”  This political cartoon, along with many others, shows the main differences between the four major candidates and what the main issues of the time were. In the end, Abraham Lincoln proved to be victorious.  The <em>Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association</em> says that Lincoln was able to win by \"fusing anti-slavery nationalism to the interest of free society.\"  Thus, his views on slavery helped win him the election."],"display_date":1860,"search_date":"1860-07-01","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":683,"tag":"Abraham Lincoln"},{"id":682,"tag":"1860 Election"},{"id":680,"tag":"Harper's Weekly"},{"id":772,"tag":"\"The Political Quadrille\""}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}}]}
