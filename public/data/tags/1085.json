The black and white or sepia pictures display dirty children, tired mothers or men hard at work. Every one was broke and tired. This era, known as The Great Depression, lasted from 1929 through the advent of the Second World War. This was a time of struggle for people from all walks of life. Even people from white-collar fields, such as lawyers, librarians and teachers were unable to provide for their families. The New Deal program <em>The U.S Works Projects Administration</em> (WPA)felt that there was a more productive way to use the unique skill set that these people brought with them than put them to work on the construction crews created across the nation. The resulting effort was <em>The U.S Works Projects Administration Federal Writers’ Project and Historical Records Survey.</em>","This project was the result of several meetings that took place in 1934 between Jacob Baker, the assistant to the chief of the Civil Works Administration and his assistant, Katherine Kellock. The <em>Works Project Administration </em>ultimately created four appendages to protect and sustain the arts: the <em>Federal Writers' Project</em>, <em>the Art Project</em>, the <em>Theater Project</em>, and the <em>Music Project</em>.","By 1935, <em>The Federal Writers Project </em>was up and running. The main goal of this project was to create a series of guidebooks and local histories. Championed by Kellock, The <em>American Guide Series</em> and “<em>America Eats</em>”were a result of this project. Other collections include the narratives of former slaves as well as celebrations of local culture and art. Even though these projects collected invaluable history, one of the many issues the faced was the collection and intake process. In addition, there were many bureaucratic hurdles that could not be resolved.","Many in Congress felt that the money used to fund the many WPA writers and art programs could be used elsewhere. With the impending threat of war, many Congressmen were intent on diverting those funds to the defense budget. Before the program was terminated in 1939,<em> The Federal</em> <em>Writers Project </em>compiled an impressive collection of pamphlets, books radio scripts and transcripts. These histories are stored in many places on the Internet such as The American Memory Collection."],"display_date":"1934 - 1939","search_date":"1936-12-31","locations":[{"id":22390,"lat":40.7455449451,"lng":-84.936600608,"zoom":10,"place":"Adams, Indiana"},{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1220,"tag":"Federal Writers' Project"},{"id":1084,"tag":"The New Deal"},{"id":620,"tag":"Franklin D.

Roosevelt instituted the New Deal for Americans.  Unfortunately, it was allocated inconsistently by local officials and resulted in the underrepresentation of Mexican-Americans.  Zaragosa Vargas, a Mexican-American historian, notes that since they held no political influence, like African-Americans, they received less benefits than whites under programs such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act,  the National Recovery Administration, the Workers Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps.","According to Vargas, San Antonio’s Westside held almost two-thirds of the Mexican-American’s total population estimated to be one hundred thousand.  The Westside slum was a breeding ground for tuberculosis, diphtheria and other communicable diseases.  It became a place of “considerable human suffering” with no alleviation in sight.","Yet, in 1932, living amidst the terrible suffering in San Antonio’s slums, Emma Tenayuca became actively involved in bringing an end to disenfranchisement, poverty and the oppression of the Mexican-American people.  In 1933, she participated and was arrested in the strike against the Finck Cigar Company.  Undaunted, she assisted and organized the garment worker’s strike against the Dorothy Frock’s Company a year later.  Her unrelenting determination led her to take important positions as leader of the Unemployed Council in 1935.  More notably, Tenyauca was recognized in 1937, when “she was elected to the National executive Committee of the Worker’s Alliance of America” as the first Mexican-American woman to ever hold that office in any national organization.","Determined, Emma Tenayuca continued to organize the Mexican-American people, hold “street meetings, [organize] mass demonstrations, [picket] relief offices, and [petition] relief offices to raise WPA work relief pay of Tejanos equal to that of Anglos.”  Vargas believed that “her fiery eloquence attracted large crowds to the open-air meetings” and made her the most successful public speaker of the time.  Due primarily to her efforts, San Antonio’s River Walk provided work under the WPA for Mexican-American workers, as they created the pedestrian walkway and diverted the San Antonio River through the middle of the city.","Although only a young woman, Emma Tenayuca was very aware of the living conditions, misery and poverty of San Antonio’s Mexican-American people.  Fearing more the effects of oppression and discrimination, she battled and spoke out against city leaders and police.  Her legacy lives among a people who’s future was transforming in front of their very eyes.  The Great Depression was a trying time for Americans.  Yet, it also produced leaders, like Tenayuca, who dedicated their lives to holding America and the American people accountable in “Order to form a more perfect union.”"],"display_date":"1932 - 1947","search_date":"1939-12-31","locations":[{"id":23160,"lat":29.4490384361,"lng":-98.519907109,"zoom":9,"place":"Bexar, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1042,"tag":"Mexican-American"},{"id":1080,"tag":"Emma Tenayuca"},{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1082,"tag":"San Antonio, Texas"},{"id":1083,"tag":"San Antonio River Walk"},{"id":1084,"tag":"The New Deal"},{"id":1085,"tag":"WPA"},{"id":1086,"tag":"CCC"},{"id":1087,"tag":"AAA"},{"id":1088,"tag":"Worker's Alliance"},{"id":1089,"tag":"Unemployed Council"},{"id":1090,"tag":"strikes"},{"id":1091,"tag":"Dorothy Frock's Company"},{"id":1092,"tag":"Finck Cigar Company"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}},{"id":5431,"title":"Jazz Boom!","course_id":79,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/29","end_date":"1/1/29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The American country was in turmoil. People were starving for work and relief from the Depression. Franklin D. Roosevelt was struggling to regain control of the plummeting economy and the people were worn. Any distraction offered to these hard working masses was widely accepted. Music, for many, was seen as brief respite from the difficulties of their daily life. Along with FDR’s fireside chats, music was being aired into an increasing number of homes on a regular basis.","As part of Roosevelt’s New Deal programs, <em>Works Projects Administration</em> (WPA) began collecting art and music and exposed the nation to an evolving style of music, jazz. Evoking an emotional response from the audience, jazz music, reminiscent of African American spirituals, had become popular in many urban areas allowing the music industry to endure during the years when so many industries struggled to stay afloat. Changes  in musical style occurred around 1935 in conjunction with technological advances in for both film and audio technology. In addition, the New Deal program, <em>Works Projects Administration</em> (WPA) began collecting art and music and exposed the nation to the ever-evolving style of music.","Many of the WPA’s contributing artists gained fame during this era leaving a lasting influence on the nation’s music industry. The impact these people made on the cultural history of The United States and its music[btm1]  is enduring. For example, Billy Holiday, known as Lady Day, came to the forefront of the music scene in 1935, when she became vocalist for major orchestras such as Count Basie and His Barons of Rhythm. Count Basie had worked with other such greats as Louis Armstrong, another influential jazz musician. Armstrong, also known as Satchmo, a shortened version of Satchel Mouth, began playing cornet as a young man elevating himself in the industry  becoming a great trumpet player and singer. Often in demand during the Depression, Armstrong made his first trip to Europe in 1932.","The recording and film technologies as well as that of jazz music itself progressed during this period. Benny Goodman was a well-established radio and studio musician who combined forces with other musicians to focus on a purely jazz sound rather than popular tunes. Securing a contract to perform on the radio show “Let’s Dance” catapulted his sound to stardom with the crowning achievement being the first-ever jazz concert at New York’s prestigious Carnegie Hall.","Following Goodman’s successes with Swing Jazz bandleaders began to feature more jazz arrangements, styles and solos ushering in a new genre of music that is still evolving today."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1929","search_date":"1929-01-01","locations":[{"id":19406,"lat":39.9878097372,"lng":-91.1885648416,"zoom":9,"place":"Adams, Illinois"},{"id":20995,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"Orleans, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1290,"tag":"Satchmo"},{"id":1289,"tag":"Louis Armstrong"},{"id":471,"tag":"music"},{"id":1291,"tag":"Swing Jazz"},{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1085,"tag":"WPA"},{"id":997,"tag":"Billie Holiday"},{"id":959,"tag":"Jazz"}],"course":{"name":"The Great Depression","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":79,"school_id":49}}]}
