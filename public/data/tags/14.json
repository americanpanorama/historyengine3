Besides encouraging this and other black churches, townsmen even permitted blacks to attend white churches.  Although the Black Code in Baton Rouge seemed to impress a harsh code of conduct, the authorities rarely enforced these statutes.  Instead, there was more trust in this community, leading to a more peaceful region.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One example of the different attitude Baton Rouge and Louisiana held toward slavery is found in newspapers.  Consistently, the New Orleans Times-Picayune presented favorable articles about blacks and slaves.  For instance, in covering the funeral of a former Savannah mayor, it reported more on the heartwarming response of slaves to his death than on the white response, or even the funeral itself.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historians recognize that this unique system was due to a variety of factors.  The multiracial Creole society and the strong Catholic influences in Louisiana explain part of it.  However, Baton Rouge also had a different sort of community.  Because it was not a plantation area, slaves were more likely to belong in small numbers to individual families than to reside in large numbers.  Maybe due to this, unlike many Southern areas, the white leaders of Baton Rouge did not fear the spread of antislavery sentiments through black churches, perhaps considering their own influence to be stronger."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":5503,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"EAST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":46,"title":"Maryland Holds a State Temperance Convention\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-05-07","end_date":"1873-05-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A State Temperance Convention assembled in Baltimore, Maryland with the purpose of forming an auxiliary to the National Temperance Convention in New York. A large presence of over three hundred delegates attended the convention, a number of which were African-Americans occupying seats in common with white delegates. The delegates, in general, were composed of a variety of distinguished figures representing the pulpit, the legal bar, the merchant business, the agricultural farm, and other interests. There were also women present claiming to be members of the Equal Rights Association. For the most part, the attendants of the convention retained a strong Christian enthusiasm as well as aroused a great hope for the future of the state. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desiring to pursue temperance rather than politics, a strong theme throughout the convention surrounded the idea that the presence of misery and crime within society was directly caused by the consumption of alcohol. Thus, the delegates claimed the duty to promote moral reform of temperance in order to battle the social problem of drinking. Many hoped that pursuing temperance would not only lessen societal crime rates, but would also hopefully unite the racially divided population. Including the remarks of a colored minister who was invited to speak at the Convention, the Sun reported his statements that ;Maryland was the first State in the Union where colored Sons and Daughters of Temperance were welcomed with their white brethren.' &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the second day of the convention, an association formed calling itself the Maryland State Temperance Alliance.' The body also adopted a Constitution, where the object of the alliance was the prohibition by law of the traffic of alcoholic drinks, and the education of public sentiment to that end. Thus, the alliance hoped to provide and employ ministers and others of the like to preach and lecture, so that all religious, moral and temperance societies may be united in the work of enactment and enforcement of prohibitory legislation. In the end, alliances and active reformers, like those in Maryland, served to further the growing national crusade towards Prohibition."],"display_date":"May 7, 1873 - May 8, 1873","search_date":"1873-05-07","locations":[{"id":5933,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":102,"title":"Influential Use of the Phrase &#147;Manifest Destiny&#39;\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-02-27","end_date":"1845-02-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The phrase manifest destiny originated in 1844 with a journalist in New York named John O'Sullivan in his magazine called the <em>Democratic Review</em>, in reference to the annexation of Texas.  Manifest destiny is the idea that it was God's will that the United States expand throughout the whole of the continent (though not by force) to spread liberty and democracy.  O'Sullivan's second use of the term, in the <em>New York Morning News</em> on February 27, 1845, was extremely influential.  With this use, he discussed what he believed was the right of the United States instead of the British to claim Oregon Country.  With the expansion of American territory inevitably came the disagreements as to whether or not expansion should include the institution of slavery, and where: after early 1846, Democrats enthusiastically adopted the phrase for their use.  The idea of manifest destiny was also used in many instances to justify displacement of the American Indians throughout the continent.The use of the term manifest destiny in propaganda and publications promoting westward expansion had long-term, lasting effects on the United States.  Manifest destiny was a major rationale behind the Mexican War of 1846-1848, after which Americans gained Alta California and Nuevo Mexico.  New industrial empires sprung up in the West, especially with the gold rush in the newly acquired California in 1849.  Once the U.S. had control of Oregon Country from the British, it was found to be as rich and fertile as imagined.  After the Civil War, the philosophy of manifest destiny helped to promote the westward movement of the population after the emancipation of slaves.  In some situations, manifest destiny is even discussed today, for some Canadians believe that the United States may still have the somewhat hidden goal of annexing Canadian land."],"display_date":"February 27, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-27","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":109,"title":"Southern Baptist Convention Formed by 293 Representatives of Churches in the Southeastern U.S.\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-05-08","end_date":"1845-05-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1845, a group of Southern Baptists broke away from the Triennial Convention and the American Baptist Home Mission Society (ABHMS) due to differences on the slavery issue.  This particular group of Southern Baptists did not oppose slavery, as the Triennial Convention and the ABHMS had begun to do.  The Baptist Board, situated in Boston, in November of 1844, adopted certain resolutions, one of which stated that if, however, any one should offer himself as a missionary, having slaves, and insist on retaining them as his property, we could not appoint him.  One thing is certain, we can never be a party to any arrangement which would imply approbation of slavery.'&lt;br /&gt;293 delegates from local churches, state conventions, educational institutions, and missionary societies met in Augusta, Georgia, and formed the Southern Baptist Convention, which was led by W. B. Johnson, a pastor from South Carolina.  Although the Northern Baptists (ABHMS) recognized the right of the Southern branch to break away, they described it as a hugely important and momentous act: They have severed, with one blow, the union which has so long existed.  They had united with the North for no prescribed or certain period.  The union was to last during pleasure, and during pleasure only.  The South, therefore, had a right for any cause, or for no cause, to separate from the North.  Still, to sever ties by which the parties had been so long bound together, to draw a dividing line between North and South, was a solemn and momentous act.  It was a deed not to be rashly or hastily done.  No man can calculate the extent of the influence which this single act may exert, not only upon the great work of imparting Christianity to the heathen, but upon the interests, or even the existence, of our common country.'  Geographically restricted to states that would eventually become the Confederacy, the SBC began in 1845 with a total membership of 351,951 in 4,126 local Baptist churches.  The SBC version of the Baptist Church was shaped by early westward migration and life on the trans-Appalachian frontier, an agrarian mode of life, was mainly linked to the common people' and ideas of individualism, and held a strong commitment to missions."],"display_date":"May 8, 1845 - May 12, 1845","search_date":"1845-05-10","locations":[{"id":2189,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":131,"title":"Death of Stonewall Jackson\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-05-10","end_date":"1863-05-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Thomas Jefferson Stonewall' Jackson, shot just above his left elbow by his own soldiers who, on May 2, did not recognize him at the Battle of Chancellorsville, died from pneumonia that he caught as a complication of his wound. Immediately following the incident, one newspaper reported, his condition is very favorable,' while others lamented that his wounds are so bad.' As a result of the shot, doctors were forced to amputate his arm at the shoulder. He spent the next few days traveling to Richmond, but his condition worsened, and on May 10 at quarter past three o'clock in the afternoon, Jackson died.&lt;br /&gt;Jackson was a native of Virginia, and quickly rose through the ranks of the army. Although he had resigned his commission, the secession of Virginia brought him back into service to lead a regiment. He rose to prominence during the Civil War at the Battle of Manassas, and was a shrewd commander and brilliant tactician. A highly outnumbered Confederate army was prepared to retreat, but Jackson encouraged his comrade Gen. Bee to give [the Union army] the bayonet.' Bee then gave Jackson his nickname, telling his troops, There is Jackson, standing like a stone wall.'&lt;br /&gt;His death a serious blow to Confederate morale, and the entire Confederate force felt saddened by his look. However, his influence reached farther than his troops and the entirety of the Confederate States of America was saddened. A soldier in South Carolina wrote, Virginia, we weep with thee. Thou hadst no nobler son,' commenting that Jackson was on his way to share immortal bliss on high, near God's eternal Throne.' The New Orleans Daily Picayune recognized that Jackson was more than a general: Nor was he great only as a Soldier he was a Christian, a man of kindly feelings;his private character was beyond the reach even of reproach.' In Charleston, he was lauded as a Christian warrior and hero,' a venerated and distinguished friend,' and a veteran patriot and hero.' Throughout the South, Jackson was a beloved general, and his death cast a large shadow for many. Jackson's death was so important that it halted life in Richmond the day that his body arrived.&lt;br /&gt;Lee was among the most saddened at Jackson's death, regarding him as his ablest assistant. Announcing the death to his troops, Lee opined that Jackson's spirit still lives, and will inspire the whole army.' Harper's Weekly called Jackson the ablest officer in the rebel army.' Generals on both sides considered it a huge boost to the Union's war effort. Charleston newspapers recognized his death as an overwhelming calamity.' He reportedly ended his life saying, Let us cross over the river and rest under the shade of tress.'"],"display_date":"May 10, 1863","search_date":"1863-05-10","locations":[{"id":14293,"lat":38.1882210605,"lng":-77.65248979,"zoom":9,"place":"SPOTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":147,"title":"Revivals occurring in black churches throughout Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-04-01","end_date":"1878-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In Richmond during April 1878, many black churches in Richmond, Virginia began having revivals.

Throughout the week groups met to pray, sing hymns and discuss ways to spread their missionary work throughout Richmond. The occasion will long be remembered as a most interesting and profitable one and will add an additional lustrous page to the annals of Virginia Methodism'. &lt;br /&gt;          The papers of James Andrew Riddick, a Methodist minister, catalog his workings as a minister in Virginia during the mid-nineteenth century. He was later taken ill and confined to his home. But, his obituary in the Petersburg Daily tells us much about the spirit of religion during his lifetime. The writer claims that Riddick lived his life in consistent communion with God' and that he exemplified the Lord in everything that he did. He goes on to state the following: How different the death of the agnostic and the man of God. The former trembles on the brink and then takes the leap into the great unknown. The latter was as conscious of God and heaven as he was of his earthly existence. His last days were spent not in petitions for heavenly blessings- these he had- but in praise and thanksgiving'. &lt;br /&gt;This injection of personal religious devotion into a newspaper article about a man's death demonstrates how pervasive Christian beliefs were in the South at this time. To see such a thing in a newspaper today would be unthinkable. But, at the time, no one would have questioned this. Newspapers routinely published sermons given in local churches on Sundays. Citizens of the South clung strongly to their Christian devotion and looked to God and heaven to provide meaning for their daily lives."],"display_date":"April 23, 1899 - April 28, 1899","search_date":"1899-04-25","locations":[{"id":13920,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":182,"title":"Ninth International Sunday School Association Meets in Atlanta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-04-27","end_date":"1899-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["This religious meeting held in Atlanta brought together some of the most prominent leaders in the entire Christian world', according to the Atlanta Constitution.

However, black representatives were not quelled by this gesture. J.L.

At the time of the epidemic, little was known about the transmission, prevention, nature, and treatment of the disease. Among physicians as well as among the general population, there was much debate and confusion regarding yellow fever. In an effort to prevent the epidemic from having adverse economic effect upon Louisiana, especially the city of New Orleans, publications of the region all avoided or deliberately minimized reportage on the spread of the fever. A New York Tribune correspondent in New Orleans wrote, Our city have, as usual, kept silent as to the extent of the ravages of the Fever; and funeral notices which have been handed in to one paper as advertisements stating the death, time of funeral and the disease which caused the death, the words Yellow Fever have been struck out before publication.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abided by the general puzzlement over the true nature of yellow fever, elements of racism, sectionalism, and religion all appeared in doctrines that professed to explain yellow fever.

The paper compared this new development much to the progress or rapid improvement' being made in the field of science.  This paper was to be in the spirit of the foreign theological journals and review' of Europe.  Most of the articles would be taken from places like Great Britain and other Protestant areas of Europe.  This was seen as an extensive and liberal plan suited to all Orthodox sects of the Protestant church'.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one hand, there are many positives from this movement.  It shows an emphasis on religion in the daily lives of American citizens.  This magazine movement was during the latter stages of the Second Great Awakening, where new denominations like Methodists and Baptists were springing up.  This magazine could be seen as a counter to these new religions and events by the Protestants to instill their time tested methods.  It gave ministers (as the Telegraph said) knowledge and zeal' in which to preach.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movement also demonstrates the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant nature still present throughout America.  Catholicism was never talked about in these magazines; Catholics from Ireland were faced with severe persecution from their new American brethren when they emigrated.  These hostilities were deeply engrained with the political culture of the time.  The Masons were a secret society of many elites and politicians whose closed meetings and rituals angered many.  The Anti-Masons started as a movement against the secrecy and supposed superiority of the Masons but also boasted a strong anti-Catholic rhetoric as well.  These playing on people's fears of otherness' started in New England where many of these immigrants first arrived but eventually spread into places farther South.  Therefore, one can see the paradoxical nature of religion in America during this time period.

Wiley became an important institution in the twentieth century, enrolling major players in the Civil Rights movement in Texas.

In many Eastern states, negro' colleges were established with taxpayer-funded state support as part of the emphasis Southern legislators placed on establishing a public educational system which followed the separate-but-equal' philosophy that Plessy v.

The Annual Report of the United States Commissioner of Public Education published in August 1873 identified Texas as the last of the Southern states to act' legislatively to provide for the education of colored children' and young adults.

Bobo's church was located slightly south of Spartanburg, and his followers came from nearly every local plantation to hear him preach.  Toward the end of July, Bobo's significant congregation had gathered for a kind of revival' which by August 5th had culminated in one of the greatest religious demonstrations ever seen in this country.'  Whites thought the preacher's passionate exhortations, urging his flock to sell all their belongings and follow him at the appointed time, were the ravings of a madman; black churchgoers thought he was the new prophet high in favor' who would lead the children of Zion' to the Promised Land, which he claimed was just 160 miles to the east. &lt;br /&gt;During the first week of August, Bobo announced that the command to march had been received,' and as soon as the oldest member of the group was sacrificed, they would leave Spartanburg.  With a show of violence, local whites managed to save the elderly black woman (who was not opposed to the idea) selected as the group's martyr, foiling one part of Bobo's rather bizarre plan.  Undeterred, his followers immediately sold off the majority of their possessions, packed up their children and food in a single wagon, and began their march.  Witnesses interviewed by the News and Courier reported that, On the march several attempts were made to dissuade them from their folly, but without turning to the right or left, with eyes upturned they went on without making any answers. The last heard of them they were crossing the mountains in the direction of Tennessee.'  &lt;br /&gt;Although Bobo's revival and march were not intended to shed white blood, as Turner's did, several elements in this rather peculiar event merit comparison with Nat Turner's 1831 uprising.  Turner's religiously-inspired prophesies and declarations were dubbed insane by whites, who fearing any show of black independence and leadership, did everything they could to discredit him.  Forty-two years later, the same thing happened in South Carolina to Bobo; the paper dubbed him a Negro of gross ignorance; of very loose morals' whose followers were poor deluded creatures.'  Again, white Carolinians seem to have missed the importance of Bobo's flight: he was leading freedmen out of the land of their enslavement, away from their former masters, toward a new life of possibility.  The Biblical analogy of a prophet leading the Israelites away from Egypt signifies the importance of religion to the black community, much as Turner proclaimed himself a prophet in 1831.  It is, of course, entirely possible that the black mystic named Bobo who led sixty fellow freedmen away from Spartanburg was completely insane; regardless, the event is an important indicator of the continuity of the role of religion in Southern black communities and the mistrust which unexpected black action inspired in the white population."],"display_date":"August 5, 1873 - August 8, 1873","search_date":"1873-08-06","locations":[{"id":11648,"lat":34.9591922676,"lng":-81.9357757115,"zoom":9,"place":"SPARTANBURG, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":374,"title":"Saint Augustine&#39;s College founded\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-10-14","end_date":"1867-10-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 14, 1867, Saint Augustine's College was founded in Raleigh, North Carolina.

Also important to note is that many of those involved with moral issues such as temperance were also involved with other moral issues of the time (such as colonization). For example, Philip Lindsley was the president of the Tennessee Colonization society (Tennessee, A Short History).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temperance societies were not at all limited to big cities or where vice was rampant. The small town of Kingsport, Tennessee founded a temperance group later in 1829. Many members of this small community banded together and pledged themselves to temperance. Among their pledges they pledged to not vote for supporters of liquor or employ anyone who drank at work. In the Kingsport society, the citizens took their stand against alcohol further than in Nashville; they were not content with personal temperance, but also required their employees to do the same (at least at work) (Tennessee, A Short History).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, Temperance societies were not limited to the United States.

There were four hundred delegates present, including 260 from the city of Baltimore, approximately fifty women, and at least fifty blacks.  There were also several Reverends who spoke at the convention.  A resolution was proposed to aid the women's temperance crusade and request women from the state to support the Temperance Alliance to combat the evils of drunkenness.'  It was also proposed that coffee houses be established where men could find amusement without alcohol.  They planned to seek pledges and signatures from citizens who promised not to drink intoxicating substances.  One informal gesture of the convention was a proposition to send congratulations to a body in Iowa also having a temperance convention.  The movement was widespread throughout the state of Maryland and the country.

First Presbyterian Church had remained with the Southern General Assembly while the Second Presbyterian Church was associated with the Northern General Assembly.  The meetings started humbly but became so large that the participants filled First Presbyterian Church and had to move some of them to Staub's Opera House.  The Opera, which could accommodate 1,500 people, was soon filled to overflowing.  The two Presbyterian pastors were joined by others of all denominations including Methodist, Baptist, Lutheran, and Episcopal.  Hundreds were reported to have been converted, including Mr. McGuire, the correspondent for The Atlanta Constitution.  &lt;br /&gt;The Presbyterian Churches in Knoxville are not unique in their split after the Civil War.  The Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America (PCCSA) was the parent denomination, but when the PCCSA supported slavery and the confederacy, some members broke apart to establish the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) in 1861.  The Presbyterian Church remained divided until 122 years later, when in 1983 the merger was approved to create the denomination the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA)."],"display_date":"March 12, 1874","search_date":"1874-03-12","locations":[{"id":12157,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":494,"title":"Prohibition Bill Defeated\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-09-04","end_date":"1881-09-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The North Carolina prohibitionists were clearly defeated in Wilmington, Charlotte, and Raleigh in elections on August 4th, 1881.

Therefore, the anti-Prohibitionists triumphed overall. &lt;br /&gt;In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, church discpline became increasingly lax.  Much of this can be attributed to the transfer of energy from the religious realm to the societal realm.  Also, the period witnessed an increase in the number and types of churches.  With this differentiation of churches and increase of church mobility, church members experienced a loss of accountability.  Individual members could simply switch churches if other members of the congregation did not support their actions.  In spite of the leniency (and likely because of it), the Protestant church became more active than ever in enforcing church discipline in the public realm, and much controversy arose in the political sphere over the question of prohibiting the sale of alcohol.  Many women, especially those in the Bible Belt' South, joined in the efforts to enforce Prohibition in order to impose strong moral values at a time of blatant public immorality.         &lt;br /&gt;Despite the defeat of Prohibition in North Carolina, Prohibition remained a pressing issue.

He, along with Lewis Tappan and others formed the Liberty Party in April of 1840.  The founders chose James Birney and Thomas Earle to run for president and vie-president, hoping that the 1840 campaign would be an exercise in Bible politics' in such a way that politics would become the vehicle for an evangelical moral revolution.''  The party and the platform, a single statement pledging to oppose slavery to the full extent of legislative power under the Constitution,' secured just one out of every 300 votes.  It had very little appeal in the South, and was the precursor of the Free Soil and Republican Parties, also sectional parties concerned largely with slavery.  The Republicans would have much more electoral success.&lt;br /&gt;The formation of the Liberty Party variously pleased, angered, and confused pro-slavery southerners.  Though anti-slavery agitation was always an offense to the South as a whole, in this election year, any split of the vote for the other party was an advantage for one's own.  The Whigs saw this as a blow to the Democratic hopes for the presidency, wondering, What is the matter with Mr. Van Buren?  Is he growing too faint in his devotion to the abolitionists when they are sheering off from him at this rate?'  If Van Buren was not extreme enough for the abolition party, they must be harder to please than expected.'  The fervency of abolitionist political sentiment, though proven relatively unpopular in the nation's election was becoming a more obvious and organized part of American politics.&lt;br /&gt;Democratic commentators also had mixed opinions about the new party.  The Kentucky Gazette asserted that, though they had nominated a candidate for president, they Liberty Party partisans would not actually campaign.  According to the editors, the Liberty Party would have a great enough effect on national policy simply by throwing it support behind Harrison.  If the Party backed the Whigs and they succeeded, they could then have an influence on Whig governing policy toward slavery.  If the Whigs won and did not concede anything to the abolitionists, the party might split.  Democrats who viewed the Whigs as the more abolitionist of the two major parties turned the foundation of the Liberty Party into a boon for Democrats, since it would likely draw votes from the Whigs.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, abolitionists themselves had varying opinions about the Liberty Party's purpose and usefulness.  Some obviously desired the Party itself to be successful and gain political influence.  Others, such as abolitionist lecturer J. Blanchard of Ohio, believed that voting for a third (Abolition) party, or withholding our votes, is only to draw off Whig voters, that Van Buren may succeed.

They hoped that by re-colonizing them in Africa, they would be able to convert more people on that continent from their gross and abject superstitions' to Christianity.  Other groups had similar ideas.  The American Society for the Return of Negroes to Africa was founded in Richmond in 1817, with a stated mission that was nearly the same. ","Congress examined the proposal thoroughly.  They decided that any proposed colony would have to be far away from American soil to have the intended effect of separating free blacks from the enslaved blacks, and from the free whites, with whom they can never be equal.  The point of this separation was to diffuse any conflicts that might erupt should the free blacks get frustrated with the injustice and turn to violence.  So if the land must be far away, where would it be, and how would the government obtain it?  Great Britain already had a colony for free blacks in Sierra Leone.  The Congress discussed sending free American blacks to that colony, as well as creating a new colony just for American freedmen.  A new colony would require a rather large monetary contribution from the United States government for the land on which to build the colony, and food until they were able to establish their own farms, as well as military protection for a long time before they could set up their own stable government. Once they did set up a stable government, would the new nation wage war against the oppressors of their brothers, still enslaved in the United States?  If there were an American free blacks colony near a British free blacks colony, how would this affect America's relations with Great Britain?  The Congress posed many questions in their joint resolution, and came to conclusive answers on only a few.

They moved to Philadelphia to join the Quaker Society of Friends and took up the abolitionist cause in the mid-1830s, eventually joining the American Anti-Slavery Society.  In 1836, the women moved to New York to become public advocates of abolitionism.  In September of that year, Angelina published an Appeal to the Christian Women of the South, reasoning that an essay addressed to women would reach the whole community, not just the men. The Appeal relied heavily on religious teachings.  Slavery was a sin, she said, because it caused human beings to be treated as objects.  It stripped them of all their God-given rights.  But even more compelling than her abolitionist arguments were her recommendations to the women of the South.  She encouraged them not only to pray over the matter, but to speak and act out against slavery.  The women of the South can overthrow this horrible system of oppression and cruelty, licentiousness and wrong.  Women could petition their state legislatures with the assurance that their opinions would be heard, for there is something in the heart of man which will bend under moral suasion.  She vehemently denied the accusations that abolitionists sought to provoke violence in the South, but prophetically proclaimed, There is no doubt there will be a most terrible overturning at the South in a few years, such cruelty and wrong, must be visited with Divine vengeance soon.  "," Angelina hoped that her status as a devout Christian woman and Charleston native would lead Southerners to listen to her as they had never before listened to abolitionists. She was sorely mistaken.  Immediately following its publication, Charleston's postmaster gave the Appeal the same treatment he gave all abolitionist literature: he ordered it publicly burned.  Southern hatred of abolitionists was more intense than ever at this time; Southern legislators had nearly succeeded in passing a universal ban on the circulation of incendiary literature in the South.  Angelina's mother was notified by Charleston police that if her daughter ever returned to the city for a visit, she would be arrested, imprisoned, and sent North on the first available ship.  Friends wrote to Angelina to warn her of the mob violence she would surely encounter if she came back.  The indignant response was natural; it was strictly taboo for Southern women to venture into the public sphere, much less to speak out against slavery.  Angelina Grimke challenged both forms of oppression.  The Grimke sisters' outspoken abolitionist views would eventually help to spawn the movement for women's rights."],"display_date":"October 1, 1836 - October 30, 1836","search_date":"1836-10-15","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1036,"title":"Temperance Convention in Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-05-04","end_date":"1853-05-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Temperance Convention in Jackson, Mississippi of 1853 denounced alcohol as the root, the fountain, the parent of every other evil, vice, crime, or disease.'

At the demonstration three prominent, secular leaders, including a colonel and a judge spoke to the crowd about prohibition of the sale of alcohol, while a pledge was circulated in support of temperance.  Governor Colquitt provided implicit support for the demonstration, when, as the December 13th issue of The Daily Constitution of Atlanta noted, A squad of the Governors Guards in full uniform marched to the platform and signed the pledge.' The religious ties of the demonstrations were confirmed the next night when a follow up meeting was held at the First Methodist Church.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important aspect of the temperance movement was the significant impact which it had on Southern politics in the last quarter of the 19th century.  Indeed, the temperance movement made prohibition an important issue in Southern politics and even led to the creation of the political party focused almost entirely around the issue Prohibition Party in 1869.  The zenith of the movement's political influence would come in the early 20th century as numerous Southern states passed prohibition laws including Georgia's on July 30, 1907.  Later on the passage of the 18th amendment in 1919 would prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages nationwide.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the movement itself had an important impact on alcohol laws during this period, it would have a longer term impact on Southern society through its affect on the early developments of American feminism.  Indeed, with the success of  the Women's Christian Temperance Union in the years following its founding in 1874, the temperance movement became not only one of the first mass women's movement in America, but also a signal of greater assertiveness of women in the political arena.  Moreover, by officially adopting resolution on women's suffrage in 1879 the W.C.T.U. also aided in the diffusion of ideas surrounding women's suffrage.   Despite its eventual impact, at first the W.C.T.U. was not successful in its initial attempts to establish chapters in the South.  However the beginning of the 1880's saw the establishment of the first W.C.T.U. chapters in the South.

In 1865, when Missouri was forming their new constitution, a very popular state leader by the name of Drake passed what was called the Iron-Clad Oath. The Iron-Clad Oath was a severe and searching' pledge of loyalty to the Union that was required of voters, officers, attorneys, jurors, priests and clergymen. A state-wide system of registration was provided and local officials were given the power to decide who could and could not vote. Disqualification from being able to vote was fairly common considering the stringent nature of the system. In the Daily National Intelligencer from January 2, 1866, Mr. McCullough, the Secretary of the Treasury, reported that, In most of the Southern States nearly every man fit for a revenue officer was some time either engaged in hostilities against the Government of the United States or holding State or confederate office, either willingly or unwillingly.' One could not vote if he had been loyal to the confederacy or if he had expressed sympathy with the views of a secessionist.&lt;br /&gt;To officially be allowed to vote, a man had to deny under oath participation in eighty-six different acts. In September, 1865 Reverend Cummings, a Roman Catholic priest, was convicted by the Circuit Court of Pike County of preaching and serving as minister to his parish without having taken the Oath required by the state of Missouri. Reverend Cummings was forced to pay a fine of five hundred dollars and to go to jail until his fine was paid. He appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Missouri and then the Supreme Court of the United States. In the opinion, Justice Field asserted that under the Constitution of this country, it was unjust and unconstitutional for a state to deprive a citizen of their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; even if this deprivation was seen merely as a means of punishment. The court asserted every citizen's right to our unalienable rights, but it also cited the fact that the oath was a violation of the right to dissent. The decision made by the Supreme Court in favor of Reverend Cummings and against the Iron-Clad Oath, was an important assertion of the fundamental rights of every citizen, especially, the right to dissent."],"display_date":"March 15, 1866","search_date":"1866-03-15","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1137,"title":"Ending of Freedmen&#39;s Bureau Operations\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-03-03","end_date":"1868-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands, popularly known as the Freedmen's Bureau, was chartered by the United States Government in 1865 but was only fully operational for 3 years.

He did not receive word of this decision until July 10, when he read the news in a letter from Reverend Henry Hughes.  England was asked to accept the position and travel to America as soon as possible, becoming the first bishop in a diocese consisting of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, with a Catholic population of about 5,000.  England described the process of arranging for his appointment and his holy consecration, on September 21st, in his diurnal, or personal notebook.  &lt;br /&gt;Reverend England became bishop during a time of significant growth in the American Catholic Church, though persecution of this minority group certainly existed.

Often, churches went on the offensive, trying to reform what they saw as the greatest threats to their moral standards.' In the New South, women had an increasingly important role on church committees, and thousands of younger women in the South joined women's clubs and reform organizations. The Women's Christian Temperance Union was the nation's largest anti-alcohol association. &lt;br /&gt;The first national convention of the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) took place in Cleveland, Ohio in November 1874. Returning home from the convention, Elizabeth Fisher Johnson organized a local chapter. On October 23, 1882, several women met in Nashville to officially establish the Tennessee WCTU, and Johnson was named the first president. By 1900, although they were not able to gain statewide prohibition, the WCTU was the most powerful women's lobbying organization in Tennessee.&lt;br /&gt;The Declaration of Principles (Light House) declared that the purpose of the WCTU was to educate the young, to increase public knowledge, and to reform as far as possible, by religious, ethical, and scientific means, the drinking classes.' Not only were these women using their morals they inherited from their religion, but they also combined to their ideas scientific means' to push the South into a civilized and modern world. Furthermore, these women were against all people who drank, but they were mostly against the immigrants, particularly the Irish Catholics. Margaret Bendroth explains in her article that often Protestants combined temperance with anti-Catholicism, for many were prepared to believe the worst about Irish Catholics.' WCTU members were largely responsible for laws raising the sexual age of consent from ten to eighteen, establishing a state reform school for juvenile offenders, and funding the Reformatory Work Home for Women. The motto, as provided in the Light House, was: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I herby solemnly promise, God helping me, to abstain from all distilled, fermented and malt liquors, including wine, beer and cider, and to employ all proper means to discourage the use of and traffic in the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minutes of another WCTU local chapter in Richmond, Virginia, show that President opened the meeting by reading from the Psalms, a prayer, and the group joined together to sing a hymn.

As part of this growing commitment to Internal Improvement in America, Randolph Macon helped set the example for smaller, local colleges that spread education to the masses rather than the elite."],"display_date":"February 3, 1830","search_date":"1830-02-03","locations":[{"id":14045,"lat":36.6803544566,"lng":-78.3627609641,"zoom":9,"place":"MECKLENBURG, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1641,"title":"Meeting of the United Daughters of the Confederacy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-11-01","end_date":"1899-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The United Daughters of the Confederacy was founded in 1895 in Atlanta, Georgia.

Later in the 19th century the church weakened its position on slavery, although clergy were still expected not to own slaves. It was only when a southern bishop marries a woman who owned slaves, thus becoming a slave owner himself, that conflict arouse. During a general conference in 1844, the church voted to defrock the bishop unless he freed his slaves. This decision instigated debate as to the authority of the General Conference to discipline bishops. This dispute initiated the Southern Methodists to break off and form a separate denomination, the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to 1844, several Methodist annual conferences were restricted by abolitionists. Although this control was not sufficient for the abolitionist leaders it scared enough of the proslavery clergy within three of the major denominations, Presbyterianism, Methodism and Baptism. This fear was instrumental in the schisms within all three denominations. In 1844 the Southern Churches of Methodism initiated a division within the denomination. The denomination's split between abolitionists and proslavery segments led to the formation of Wesleyan Methodist Connection of America (North) and the Methodist Episcopal Church South.  &lt;br /&gt;Although the Methodist Episcopal Church South is memorable for its reluctance to oppose slavery and it lack of hospitability towards the blacks, it was responsible for the founding of three of the South's top divinity schools, Vanderbilt University Divinity School, Duke University Divinity School, and Candler Divinity School at Emory University.

The city became a locus of immigrant activity, both religious and cultural. However, negative changes often accompanied positive ones with the large influx of immigrants. The greater influence of Catholicism, the dominant immigrant religion, affected the already strained religious and political tensions between the South's religious mixes: Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians. As the St. Louis Observer stated, although southerners recognized the Founding Fathers' guarantees to every individual in our land, the free exercise of his religion, political Nativists feared that the Papacy as both a religious and political power would interfere with American government."," In their letter to the Observer, a Nativist wrote that Catholicism was not just a religion but a political organization that recruited members to draw funds from the American people to aid them in universalizing. In this manner, many whites in St. Louis and throughout the South felt Catholicism endangered the white Southern religious sects. Nativists felt that Catholicism in the form of millions of immigrants was a forewarning of an American St. Bartholomew's Day-the foreign seed will, like dragon's teeth which Cadmus sowed in a field, produce an assembly of armed men. Xenophobia of Catholic immigrants was not limited to the South, however. In places such as New York and Chicago where large immigrant groups flocked, whites felt the need to push for control over those alien to their existing and dominant role in the social order. Whites faced a population of black Africans and few laws in place for immigrant migration regulation. Although whites as a collective group still held control of government and other public institutes nationwide, immigrants placed an increasing social and economic demand on the United States.

Pleasant, Tennessee. A Philadelphian man gave an in depth account of the church?s first service in a letter he wrote to the editor of The Guardian. As a northerner, he acted as an outside observer in this small southern town. He elaborately described the architecture, location, congregation, and leaders of the newly built church. "," Reverend Bishop Polk built the church on a lot adjacent to his plantation in Ashwood. He and his three brothers chiefly financed the church's construction. The location of St. John's was ideal for both the Bishop and the Episcopal families that lived in the surrounding area. Although not many Episcopal families lived in Ashwood, the Bishop and other founders intended the church to serve as a place of worship for the slaves of these few families. On the day of the first service, the church welcomed these slaves into the congregation. The anonymous Philadelphian described at length the four and half hour services that transpired that day. Reverend Bishop Otey, Reverend Bishop Polk, Reverend Smith, and W.F. Leacock of Williamsport consecrated the church. Following the consecration, Reverend Otey presented candidates for baptism and Reverend Polk performed two confirmations. The proceedings of the service that day impressed the Philadelphian. Nothing could compare, however, to the sheer composition of the congregation. The number of slaves in attendance came as a shock to the Philadelphian. And a more happy group I have seldom seen, he enthusiastically observed. He recalled the Bishop's invitation for blacks to come forward at the same time as whites to receive communion. Ah, could some of our friends have witnessed that scene, how would it have silenced the suspicion that the slaveholder values not the soul of his slaves, the northerner exclaimed."," In the South, African Americans and their masters often shared in the church-going ritual. Historian Bobby Lovett confirms the importance of the church services and the socializing that took place afterwards. These services consumed a great portion of the day and thus it was most convenient for the owners to take the slaves belonging to the family to church with them rather than leave them unattended for extended periods of time. But unlike the scene in Ashwood, Tennessee, churches in other regions of Tennessee or the South often participated in greater discrimination. African Americans usually took communion last, they sat in the rear of the church in all black pews, and the church prohibited them from becoming officers within the church government.

He held fast to his beliefs in spite of outside pressures that urged him to do otherwise.  Buckner refused to give his son, Horace, any extra funds besides those that were sufficient to cover his boarding expenses while he was teaching.  In letters that Horace wrote in 1875 and 1876, he made a desperate plea to his father to send money.  Horace asked his father, Do you mistrust me so much as not to be able to trust me at all?  Horace confessed that his gambling and drinking had contributed to his previous problems in money management but swore that he no longer engaged in either activity.  Yet, a year after Horace claimed he was abstaining from liquor, he wrote his father an additional letter.  In this letter Horace recounted his participation in a fracas, in which his hand was bitten through.Horace's description of the event was notably brief and void of detail; Horace left it up to his father to decide whether his son and the aggressor were intoxicated the night that the fracas occurred.  Buckner refused to provide Horace with funds to be used at his discretion.  Central Virginians like Buckner realized the necessity of action at all levels of society, including the family, in order to further Prohibition in Central Virginia.","Community leaders in Central Virginia other than Buckner took action in their region to enforce growing sentiments regarding the impropriety of liquor consumption, in response to the spread of Prohibition across the South in the second half of the nineteenth century.  In 1883, a group of seven men from Fluvanna County signed a petition and sent it to three fellow townsmen, in an effort to entice locals to pledge that they would help to end the sale and distribution of liquor in the county.  In the January 27, 1885 publication of Fredericksburg's local paper, the <em>Free Lance</em>, the editor posted the names of the officers along with the meeting times of several local groups of prohibitionists.  Two of these coalitions, the United Lodge Sons of Sobriety and the Stonewall Lodge Sons of Sobriety, were exclusive to men.  The other temperance groups the paper advertised had religious affiliations, such as the Grand United Order of True Reformers, Christian Star Lodge, No. 29.  The paper specified that the members of this group were colored, and the paper listed both men and women as the officers of the Order.                  ","Groups of impassioned local citizens with the same determination as Buckner joined forces in order to attack the problem at the state level by forming a larger contingency of social reformers in Virginia, according to Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hoftstra in <em>Virginia Reconsidered</em>.  In 1883, eight local chapters of the Women's Christian Temperance Union merged in order to form a version of the WCTU that serviced the entire state of Virginia.  According to The Encyclopedia of Religion in the South, the beliefs of Christians across the South concerning the accountability of the individual for his or her sins and improprieties gave impetus to the formation and activity of both the WCTU and other local prohibitionist groups.  Groups of African American Christians, like the Fredericksburg Grand United Order of True Reformers, played an integral role in the spread of Prohibition in Virginia and other southern states, as well.  ","Although there is a wealth of information regarding the success of the groups that coalesced in an effort to further Prohibition, less is known about the actions of individuals, such as Horace Buckner's father.  Yet these individuals' actions were equally essential to the success of the movement.  Because women made great strides in the Prohibition movement as a result of their activism, historians have focused mainly on women's efforts.  Thus, the correspondence between Buckner and his father is a relatively rare chronicle of the manner in which a man labored to establish abstinence in his family.  Prohibition was personal.  Although Prohibition was a political issue, it was a topic that commanded the attention of individuals, like Dr. Buckner, throughout the nation who had personally witnessed the damage and destruction that resulted from the use of alcohol."],"display_date":"May 13, 1875 - February 9, 1876","search_date":"1875-09-26","locations":[{"id":14013,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2027,"title":"Reverend Jackson Proscribes Church Code for Moral Conduct\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-04-27","end_date":"1869-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Reverend J. Edward Jackson woke up tired on the morning of April 27, 1869. He had been traveling the country for eight years preaching in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and South Carolina. Evangelicalism stressed the importance in traveling from place to place to spread the good news of the Bible. That morning he gave a sermon on heavenly mindedness at the Church of the Holy Communion in St. Louis, Missouri. In this sermon, Reverend Jackson urged listeners to live a moral life and remain in the good grace of God. Jackson spoke of bowels of mercy, where people should willingly give to the poor and needy. In such acts of kindness, he continued, one should be clothed with humility. Jackson also spoke directly to the women in attendance, and suggested they adorn themselves in modest apparel and sobriety, not with broidered hair or gold or pearls or costly array. Good works, he argued, should be used as a [substitute] for the vanity of outward ornaments. Jackson finished his sermon by reflecting on those who spoke out against missionaries. Those people could tolerate zeal in business, learning, and the arts and sciences, but not in religion. Only if the preachers were moderate and [kept] it to themselves did they have no objection.","Reverend Jackson was one of the hundreds of preachers who traveled across the nation following the Second Great Awakening. Historian William Lee Miller argues one of the great results of the Second Great Awakening was reaching out to the newly settled West, where those 'unchurched' folk were available to be 'churched', or at least 'saved.' While Missouri was not a newly settled territory in 1869, it still had many towns and cities that lacked a Christian presence. Historian Perry McCandless explains that traveling preachers were pivotal in the religious life in areas like Missouri because of the state's sparse and scattered population. By traveling and converting new areas of the state to evangelicalism, new churches developed throughout the state. Data collected in <em>A History of Missouri: Vol. II</em> shows nearly a two-fold increase from 880 churches in 1850 to almost 1,600 churches in 1860."," In his sermon, Reverend Jackson supported the idea of perfectionism, where society was capable of infinite improvement. McCandless points out, Ministers and other intensely religious-minded people viewed Missouri's early society as being overrun with drunkenness, gambling, fighting, general disorder... Jackson believed he could help shape the morals and code of conduct in Missouri and other states through his sermons. While Reverend Jackson stressed universal sin and the importance of meekness, mercy, piety, and good works, he said that he does not ask these questions to discourage, but to provoke [them] to good works. He challenged his listeners to avoid the worldly activities that led to sin. Rather, he argued they should remain meek, humble, and look to serve mankind to the best of their ability. "," The church worked to regulate the moral conduct of Missourians. Reverend Jackson pointed out however, that some people did not appreciate the church's attempt to impose their moral code on the public. Despite such opposition, evangelicals continued to play a large role in religion throughout the South. Jackson continued to preach to areas throughout the nation until 1894."],"display_date":"April 27, 1869","search_date":"1869-04-27","locations":[{"id":7918,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2052,"title":"The New Teacher&#39;s Institute\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-10-21","end_date":"1886-10-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In Warsaw, Superintendent Robert Hall called a meeting for the new teachers of the Northern Neck Peninsula. The teachers needed to talk about the best way to educate the hundreds of students entering the new public school system. Reverend A. B. Kinsolving opened the session by leading prayers. Mr. Hall began the discussion by encouraging the teachers to express their candid views on each topic covered over the course of the day. The first topic was whether teachers should allow whispering and talking during class. One young woman delivered an emphatic speech about the dangers of tolerating this behavior. Since everyone unanimously agreed on this issue, the group proceeded to the next topic: corporal punishment. There was a lively and animated debate. Since no consensus was reached, the teachers decided to postpone this discussion. They next talked about the best ways to teach reading, writing, arithmetic, and other subjects. The body reached an agreement much more quickly on these issues, finishing just in time for lunch.","Few people were familiar with public schools in the 1880s, especially in rural regions like Virginia's Eastern Shore. If they could afford it, parents sent their children to expensive private schools at remote distances. However, nearby Accomack County had opened eight local public schools by 1886, and Richmond County wanted to close the gap. Taxpayers provided 1.126 per child for schools in the Northern Neck, inequitably distributed between white and black schools. Many people wanted to increase this funding for religious reasons. While the teachers disagreed about corporal punishment, everyone at the Institute understood the important role Christian principles would have in the budding school system. Accordingly, the Institute opened its session with a prayer led by the local Reverend.

Christmas was a time to spend with family, both close and distant. Mary Fitzhugh had moved to Richmond almost two months ago, and it was too great a distance for her to make the trip. In a letter, Lizzie Fitzhugh wrote to her sister: So many young cousins are assembling to-getther, at first one house and then the other. Most visitors stayed for many days, since family gatherings happened only a few times each year. Saturday was Christmas, and the celebration began with a visit to the huge Christmas tree outside the Fitzhughs' home. While the adults laughed and talked, the children rushed to the presents underneath the tree. Willie, Oscar, and Edward, Lizzie's brothers, received Roam candles, candy, and nuts. Bessie and Fannie, Lizzie's younger sisters, combed the hair on their new dollbabies. Brother Frank received a little wagon and horse.","Everyone knew that Christmas was truly a celebration of the birth of Jesus. On Sunday night, all of the family listened to Mr. Boggs preach at the church down the street. On Tuesday night, Lizzie went to a dance at the Mr. Moyer's house. She writes, there was such a crowd of strangers that all of us got two of the fiddlers and went in the dining room, where we had a very nice time. The parlor was crowded. But there was a young man who caught her eye, Lizzie tells her sister. She danced with Tom that night, even though she dared not sit with him on the sofa in the parlor.","Christmas was an opportunity for the Fitzhughs to meet and socialize with family and friends who were ordinarily separated by the difficulties of traveling. The distances between family members were not long by modern standards. However, traveling by horse made even these trips impractical unless it was a special occasion. Even though Richmond was less than 70 miles away from the Fitzhugh home, Mary still could not attend the celebrations. Railroads greatly accelerated the speed of travel, but rural areas such as Virginia's Eastern Shore had to depend on horses or private sailing vessels. In fact, the first railroad to reach the Eastern Shore only opened in 1884, running to Cape Charles. For most of the rest of the year, family members could only communicate through letters like those Lizzie wrote to her sister."],"display_date":"December 24, 1888","search_date":"1888-12-24","locations":[{"id":13919,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2058,"title":"Hitting Shore With a Vengeance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Haynie Bradshaw thanked God every time he arrived back on shore. Oystermen were reputed to be daring and unscrupulous men, who regard[ed] neither the laws of God nor the laws of man, but Bradshaw was a devout Methodist who sometimes led services on Sunday. As an oysterman, Bradshaw dredged the Chesapeake Bay aboard one of the infamous bugeye boats. It was a terrible living. Crews received one third of the gross income, with the other two thirds going to boat maintenance and to the captain. Bradshaw helped push a windlass that scraped the bottom of the bay. According to those in the trade, it was like pulling in anchor while the boat was sailing. His shabby clothes froze to his body out in the frigid ocean surf. Bradshaw knew men who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. Others were plagued with oyster hand, an infection that developed if one cut one one's hands while culling oysters.","Crisfield was an oysterman town, and to the town the oystermen bought prosperity as well as debauchery. All the buildings had holes in the floors to toss away emptied shells. The entire town smelled of dead oysters. Girls on the street corner outside Blizzard's were hardly discreet about their employment. The town's residents used guns to disperse the rowdy drunks prowling the streets after dark. While Bradshaw's religious faith was dear to him, the dangers and tension of the oyster season caused him to lapse into drinking. Bradshaw chose Burgess's Saloon, which featured a boxing ring for the customers' enjoyment. Bradshaw wasn't planning on fighting, but then he saw a Virginia waterman who had insulted him earlier, saying, Hey, ain't you one o' them dumb Smith Islanders? In a second they were in the ring. Bradshaw clocked him and the drunken crowd cheered raucously. When the Virginian's friends came to his aid, Bradshaw bloodied them too, one after the other. The saloon in Crisfield was a far cry from his Methodist Church back home.","While the slavery system ended years earlier, the free labor system for both blacks and whites could be awful as well. In each, the living conditions could be atrocious, with poor clothing, poor quarters, and poor food. In each, the work could only be done by forced labor provided by traders. For the oyster industry, the crimps in Baltimore were responsible for delivering the men to the captains, who paid them off for their services and then kept the men at sea for as long as they could. Slaves were usually not paid for their work, and oystermen were sometimes only paid off with the boom: knocked overboard into the freezing waters by the captain at the end of a voyage. Many laborers, such as Bradshaw, looked to alcohol to cope with the dangers. Tough labor conditions were found throughout the South and in many other forms than those in the oyster industry. Both blacks and whites were often exploited by the system of sharecropping, where a farmer worked another man's land in return for a small portion of the crops. Life could be difficult for a working man in the South, even if he was free."],"display_date":1875,"search_date":"1875-07-02","locations":[{"id":6062,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"SOMERSET, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2060,"title":"Testimonies at the Turlington Camp\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-08-07","end_date":"1881-08-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Wagons loaded with fried chicken, vegetables, figs, fruits, grapes, cantaloupes, and watermelon crept towards the sea of tents. People also packed carpets, mattresses, plates, bowls, bed linens, lamps, rocking chairs, and even clocks. The annual, week-long, Turlington camp meeting had finally arrived. The big bell tolled, beckoning everyone to the benches. It was quite a congregation: almost 8000 people would attend some portion of the meetings. James Cannon, Jr. from Salisbury, Maryland, sat with this father and listened: the substance of the preaching was the same as ... [his] church back home. There was somewhat more pressure brought to bear upon the church members to bestir themselves to hunt the sinners, and stronger more impassioned appeals to the sinner to forsake their ways and return to God. People jumped and shouted Hallelujah, especially the older white men and blacks who sat in the front of the wooden tabernacle.","The next morning, James rose promptly at 7 a.m. as the big bell clanged. After breakfast, there was a time of prayer. In the two hours of free time that followed, James took the opportunity to meet different families from Virginia's Eastern Shore. At 10, the lovefeast began, with the preacher incessantly calling for another testimony, another testimony James attended religious services at 3 and 7:30. After the little children were tucked in their tents, there was one more evening service. Organ and piano led stirring hymns like Blessed Assurance and What a Friend We Have in Jesus. Despite all the preaching, the camp meetings were a mix of the secular and spiritual. At night, women traded recipes, and young children spent their allowance at the candy stand. Young men and women joined nightly promenades around the grounds. One night, James heard giggling in a girl's tent as he walked by. He entered and found the girls laughing at an old lady in a rocking chair nearby, smoking a pipe. Each time she rocked, her shadow expanded and contracted on the wall of the tent. James wasn't as amused: he explained to the girls that smoking was an evil habit. This was a lecture the girls would not forget for many years.","The original idea of the Turlington Camp Meeting was for Methodists, rich and poor, black and white, to leave the comforts of their normal lives for a time of rededication to Jesus Christ. Early on, there was dramatic revival at the annual meeting. Each year, the meetings grew more and more popular (in 1889, nearly 1,500 people showed up each night). They also became grander, finer, and more institutionalized. In 1876, the church added a wooden tabernacle. In 1891, they added a choir loft. The dresses of the ladies became fancier and fancier, and the expected time for testimonies became shorter and shorter. For the Turlington Camp Methodists, religion became more secular with each passing year. While Christianity declined in spiritual significance for many southerners in the late nineteenth century, other regions of the South still resisted secular influences. In the early years, northern Methodists from Maryland shared in the fellowship at Turlington. While newspapers reported the friendly and brotherly feeling between these groups during the Methodist Centennial Conference in 1884, the situation soured quickly. In 1885, the northern Methodists split from the Turlington Camp, fearing that the original purpose of the meeting had been lost."],"display_date":"August 7, 1881 - August 15, 1881","search_date":"1881-08-11","locations":[{"id":13591,"lat":37.9436744077,"lng":-75.3696408508,"zoom":9,"place":"ACCOMACK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2076,"title":"Charity for a Minister\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-01-27","end_date":"1885-01-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a crisp evening in January of 1885, Mrs. John H. Barney, a minister's wife, expected to have a quiet night socializing with a few close friends. However, she was pleasantly surprised to find that what was expected to be a few friends turned into a large number of congregants from the Timber Ridge Christian Church of Hampshire County. However, the one person missing from this engagement was her husband, John Barney, because he had been conducting a series of meetings in the neighboring town of Edinburg, Virginia and also was unaware of the party. But even with one of the guests of honor missing, the night was still filled with love and goodwill accompanied by music, food and social conversation. Each person brought with them a substantial token of their friendship, which by the end of the night totaled between forty and fifty dollars worth of necessities. ","Mrs. John H. Barney was so touched by the thoughtful occasion that she wrote a thank-you note in the <em>Herald of Gospel Liberty</em> a few days later for all her guests to see. She found the evening to give her the pleasant memories and dreams that would fill the lonely hours of a minister's wife. Overall, Mr. and Mrs. Barney were touched by the friendship, support and charity provided by the members of the Timber Ridge Church."," One interpretation of the events taking place in Mrs. Barney's home is that this was a pseudo-revival meeting for the Baptist congregants. During this time in the Appalachian region, the organization of the church itself was loose and uncertain. Records of members were usually not kept, neither was money given to the church. The only systematic activities that occurred within the church were occasional revival meetings, annual meetings of the disciples, and funeral meetings. When these events did occur, people would travel from many miles to attend, which would explain why the members of a church in Hampshire County would come to visit a minister in Hook's Mills, Virginia. It was during these meetings that the monotonous daily routines were replaced by a renewed sense of faith, courage and good-will among neighbors and families, thus playing an important role in these church members' lives.

The members of the Buncombe Sons of Temperance consisted of men who were in favor of the moderation of alcohol consumption. The opponents of this order acted out against the Sons in spurts of violence. A Knoxville, Tennessee newspaper picked up this story and claimed that the violence witnessed in Buncombe was even more severe than the violence against temperance proponents in nearby Tennessee counties. The paper was unsure of the cause of this outburst of violence, but conjectured that the goal of the opposition was to bring the Sons of Temperance down to their own drunken level.","The Sons of Temperance also faced opposition from local churches. The Order in Buncombe County had been denied of the use of a church for its meetings on the grounds of bringing reproach to the Church. On March 5, 1851, a vehement public discussion took place in the Flat Creek area of Buncombe, where members of both sides of the issue took a stand. Reverend Hicks of the Asheville District sided with the Order and explained its principles, while Reverend Pickens, in opposition to the Order, argued that it was irreverent for members of a secret lodge to hold meetings inside of a church.","The American temperance movement of the 1850's was undeniably more intense in the North than in the South. However, groups like the Buncombe County Sons of Temperance sprung up in many parts of the South. The prominence of the Sons in the Buncombe community and their strong moral cause leave it unclear as to why they faced such heated opposition from both the Church and other members of the community. Ian Tyrrell argues in his essay on temperance in the Antebellum South, that the movement did not catch on in the South with the same fervor as in the North largely due to the fact that the South was extremely conservative in regards to social reform. He explains that these sentiments were largely expressed due to the fact that, in the minds of Southerners, any type of social reform during this era was immediately associated with abolition. As a result, many Southerners rejected the movement solely based on the basis of this association. This reasoning could explain why the Order of the Sons of Temperance, even with its moralistic virtues, was faced with such stiff opposition in Buncombe, North Carolina.

In fact, education was sometimes frowned upon, particularly on the frontier where ministers rode around preaching to small communities. These ministers, called circuit riders, led a particularly dangerous life traveling through undeveloped areas. Because of the lifestyle of circuit riders, they were expected not to settle down in one location or marry. However, in 1839 a Methodist circuit rider founded a college in Brandon, Mississippi. ","Reverend Benjamin Drake was a Methodist minister and a circuit rider. In the 1830s, a time when Mississippi began to fall behind the rest of the nation in terms of education, Drake was planning to start a college. He received a letter from his friend C. K. Marshall addressing the issue of the location of the school. Drake had originally planned on establishing the college in Clinton. Marshall's letter swayed him to look at another location. Marshal described the striking beauty of Brandon Mineral Springs at length, calling it the most enchanting and lovely place [he] ever saw. The property consisted of 54 buildings on 1005 acres of land. Marshall admitted that Brandon was difficult to reach, but railroads would make it more accessible. The manor was also inexpensive - ten or twenty thousand dollars for the estate including furniture. Money may have been an issue, because circuit riders were very poorly paid. The location was perfect for Drake's institution. "," Thus Centenary College was founded by Drake in 1839 in Brandon Springs, Mississippi. Though the Methodist religion in Mississippi traditionally did not place a high value on education, this preacher still established a school. Drake's precise motives in founding the school are unidentified, but it is known that Methodists at this time were concerned with changing the society around them and making the world a better place. Because only the elite could afford to send their children to college, the school probably would have affected the sons of the wealthier plantation owners in the area. The founding of Centenary College shows that while the Methodist church did not place high value on the education of its clergy, it encouraged the creation of educational institutions for other members of the population."],"display_date":1837,"search_date":"1837-07-02","locations":[{"id":7336,"lat":31.1610416216,"lng":-91.3109144316,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKINSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2177,"title":"Death of the Respectable Adam Grove\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-02-24","end_date":"1842-02-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shermariah Church, the Presbyterian Church of Augusta County, Virginia lost a valuable member of their congregation when Mr. Adam Grove died suddenly and unexpectedly on February 24, 1842. Mr. Grove's spirituality transcended Shermariah into the educational realm in that he served as a professor of religion for 20 years. His religious beliefs manifested themselves in his charitable nature. He donated a significant portion of the land on which Shermariah Chuch was constructed and also donated funds to help build the Shermariah Academy. Unlike many of the deaths that occurred in Augusta County in the antebellum South, Mr. Grove's was unique in that he died free of debt. His lack of debt can also be attributed to his religious beliefs. Grove was very familiar with the scriptures and lived by them. One such scriptural saying was, owe no man anything.","It was said that Mr. Grove's farm reflected many of his admirable characteristics such as his good management and industrious habits. Though he possessed only a small piece of land, it was lucrative due to its high state of cultivation. At the time of Mr. Grove's death, the land was worth two to three times more than if he had bought two to three additional pieces of farmland. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Mr. Grove's death, however, is the fact that one of his servant women died about 15 minutes after he did. She was also a member of Shermariah Church and it was believed by the citizens of Augusta County that they had both gone to the same blessed reward. ","The dichotomy of this obituary lies in the fact that during life of earth, slaveholders of Augusta County treated African Americans not only as their inferiors, but as their property; meanwhile, they sat through church services in the same sanctuary. They worshipped the same god and believed that they experienced the same afterlife. The role churches played in race relations of the antebellum South is a major theme in Melvin Patrick Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>. Ely portrays a culture similar to that of this obituary, where blacks and whites attended the same churches. These churches nurtured the moral similarities of people of both races. Furthermore, according to Ely, churches leveled the playing field between whites and blacks by acknowledging the spiritual gifts of each, and by identifying their equal ability to sin. During the 1840s and 1850s, white evangelicals felt it was their duty to bring black members into their churches. Spending on ministries to slaves increased dramatically. In the Methodist Church in particular, it increased from 167,258.87 in 1829 to 1,706,207.70 by 1864.

In this segment readers found many lighthearted topics including a sequence of imaginary situations reflecting both the political and social atmosphere of the era.  In addition to jokes about the fancies of women, the life of the theater, and medical issues, in 1830 a series of these verbal caricatures depicted trite Irish figures. While the jokes of <em>The Virginia Advocate</em> did not overtly display strong nativist doctrine, their obvious use of stereotypes portrayed the Irish in a very discriminatory manner.  ","Some jokes attempted to discredit the Irish as simply stupid and absurd while others furtively attacked their character, principles, and culture. The Irishman's War, published on March 12, 1830, subtly ridiculed an Irishman for his discourse and ignorance of geography.  From his rough, uncultured speech and lack of basic knowledge, this joke depicted the Irishman at an everyday laborers' task - a low-paying, unskilled job for an unskilled laborer. Another joke from April 16, 1830 crafted a crude, nonsensical analogy into an Irish priest's sermon in order to ridicule the Roman Catholic Church.  Through the absurdity of this sermon, the joke attempted to discredit the parish priest and the Roman Catholic Church, which endorsed such men in its pulpits. While the message was subtle in both of these jokes, the Virginian audience would have recognized the subliminal messages in both situations.  ","The Price of a Milkmaid in Ireland, published on February 12, 1830, stealthily commented on the moral nature of the Irish people.  The joke read: A young gentleman of Kilkenny, meeting a handsome milk maid, near the parade, said, 'What will you take for yourself and your milk, my dear'  The girl instantly replied, 'Yourself and a gold ring sir.'  While not obviously discriminatory, this joke implied an inherent impropriety within Irish culture, the predatory nature of Irish men, and finally, the easy, indiscrete manner of wooing Irish women. A joke published the following week took greater pains to criticize the Irish more overtly: An Irishman walking along perceived a receipt book fall out a gentleman's pocket just before him. Paddy picked it up, and observing a note sticking between the leaves, he took it to himself, and then called very honestly after the owner, 'Now, halt a bit, man See, here's your book that ye dropped on the pavement - but somebody has stolen a fifty dollar bill out of it'  This joke attempted to undermine the moral values of the Irish by insinuating that Irishmen could not be trusted.  The word Paddy, a common term for all Irishmen, also reflected the racial culture of the South; in using this word, the joke attributed dishonesty to the nature of all Irishmen.","In all, the Irish unnerved the South because they were unfamiliar incomers. Ironically, southerners discriminated against the Irish - fellow white men - and subjected them to harsh, public stereotypes while, as Melvin Ely notes, they were able to live with blacks. The massive wave of Irish immigrants around this time heightened the nerves of some southerners who resented the increasing numbers of foreigners usurping jobs and opportunities; thus, by 1830, the Irish had become a controversial ethnic group in society, inciting strong nativism and discrimination that eventually culminated in the bloody riots of 1844 in Philadelphia and Baltimore.  David Gleeson maintains the controversial opinion that while the South still maintained its usual social obstacles, in comparison to the North it did not show such intense resentment and hostility toward the Irish because they constituted such a small percent of the population and were appreciated as another source of labor.  Yet, even if his analysis is correct, as a border state Virginia was much more exposed to the fierce nativism growing in the North and would have thus been more susceptible to internal discrimination against the Irish than perhaps other states of the deeper South. Furthermore, the jokes of <em>The Virginia Advocate </em>suggest that in Albemarle County a lingering uneasiness toward the incomers persisted, making southerners uncomfortable enough to try to discredit them in jocular situations."],"display_date":"February 12, 1830 - April 16, 1830","search_date":"1830-03-15","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2182,"title":"Albemarle Women Hold a Fair for Colonization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-05-14","end_date":"1830-06-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 14, 1830, after months of anticipation, <em>The Virginia Advocate</em> celebrated the triumph of a grand fair held in aid of the American Colonization Society by the Female Association of Albemarle County.  The newspaper proudly proclaimed that it went off with a success, which we believe has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations of its friends.  Despite the heat of the day the decorated hall attracted great crowds with its cool refreshments and informative exhibits about colonization. Although the paper did not report the total amount of money raised, it praised the women's philanthropic motives to help black colonists overcome the disease, famine, and...hostility...[that] threaten [a new colony's] feeble and precarious existence.","This altruistic effort by women was not unusual in the antebellum South; women commonly managed associations for the sick and poor, but it was their desire to assist free blacks that distinguished these women from later women of Virginia.  The women of the Female Association of Albemarle County were largely upper class women who lived in a slave-based society and yet, because of their fear of violence and desire for missionary activity, they staunchly supported colonization when they might have considered themselves above such a concern.","The recent slave rebellions led by Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Denmark Vesey in 1822, and Nat Turner in 1831 were only too recent in the minds of southerners and had generated great social fear, particularly for Virginians.  In these revolts, slaves had revolted against the rule of their white masters and free blacks had violated the privilege of their freedom, labeling themselves as a threatening group of people who endangered the property of the South. The violence of these revolts particularly endangered white women and children who had been among some of the blacks' first victims.  As an act of self-defense therefore, Albemarle County's women joined in the intensified protests on behalf of African colonization to reduce the unnecessary and dangerous amount of blacks in the South.","Other Virginian women hoped that colonization would spread Christianity in Africa. The women of Albemarle specifically praised the American Colonization Society for its desire to plant a germ of christianity and civilization, which will spring up to bless Africa, whose fruit will sustain the principles of Liberty in unborn generations.  As Robert Johnson, Jr. discusses, these women, along with many other southerners, credited slavery as the institution that had introduced Christianity to blacks; for this reason, they hoped that the free blacks who emerged from the system of slavery as Christian, civilized beings could spread these virtues to all of Africa.","On June 1, 1830, only a few weeks later, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>published a brief letter addressed to The Reverend Mr. Gurley of the American Colonization Society concerning the funds raised from the Albemarle County fair.  The Female Association offered the Reverend a gift of 500 dollars to aid the Colonization Society and requested that a lien be retained on the funds contributed by this association, by which, at any future period, any free people of color from this county, who may wish to go to Liberia, shall have the precedence of all others in any embarkation, at least to the full amount of the funds contributed by this association.  The <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported this news because the state of Virginia had one of the largest networks of colonization chapters in the United States and many would have been encouraged by their efforts.","Other states would have also been interested because during this era similar support for colonization was prevalent throughout the South.  Johnson contends that while some in the South displayed a genuine humanitarian concern for the well-being of blacks, the majority of southerners advocated colonization on account of their fear of black rebellion, the uncertainty concerning the future of free blacks, and the lagging economy. In Johnson's view the South believed colonization would protect the value of the slave property and remove those Africans who were an economic drain upon the plantation system. Thus, the American Colonization Society became a popular cause in the South but for a variety of different motives."],"display_date":"May 14, 1830 - June 1, 1830","search_date":"1830-05-23","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2188,"title":"Eugene Davis&#39; Appeal for Temperance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-10-23","end_date":"1842-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On October 23, 1842, Eugene Davis wrote a draft of a speech advocating temperance in Albemarle County.  While in the North many cities had embraced the temperance movement, in the South, country counties like Albemarle led the way for social and moral reform.  Evangelical congregations and women in particular expected the temperance movement to solve common social vices and fashion a society rooted in a moral tradition. Davis, truly believing in the positive results of temperance, called upon the people of Albemarle County to promote the common good [,]... to reduce an enemy whose ravages tell fearfully upon our national prosperity [,]...to rescue our national character... [, and] to redeem our national honor from the tarnish of taking rank with the...most drunken people in the world.","Many historians have defined the temperance movement as a reaction against the threat alcohol posed to the family and the evangelical church movement.  Alcohol not only wasted money that could have been used to support the family but it encouraged unacceptable habits and behavior that threatened the morality of the family.  Moreover, prominent leaders of the Second Great Awakening supported the temperance movement as part of the moral and spiritual reformation continuing among the rural South during this period. As historian Ted Ownby observes, this newfound evangelical fervor often found itself at odds with an essential part of southern culture - male honor and recreation.  Drinking and debauchery were present in almost every male activity: sporting events, social engagements, and even in the workplace.  Because of the pervasiveness of alcohol, temperance advocates worried that drinking among men encouraged a loss of self-control and restraint - two essential standards of the evangelical church and southern culture in general.  In Ownby's opinion southern men neither wanted to live outside of the all-encompassing evangelical community nor to abandon the alcohol and belligerence that defined their male identity. Their desire for compromise however proved impossible because the regional revival meetings of the evangelical church encouraged local populations to uphold an ideal of upright behavior and remain unyielding to forms of social excess.  In Ownby's words this demonstrated ever more clearly the ever-present tension between evangelical self-control and the aggressiveness of the masculine world. ","        To combat the threats posed by a culture submerged in alcohol, Davis encouraged the citizens of Albemarle County to set an example by taking a two-part abstinence pledge in which members vowed they would first themselves abstain from the use of all intoxicating liquors and second, that they would discourage the use of them by others.  By this oath, Davis believed that their community would exorcise the demon of intemperance [,] allay the devouring thirst and still the raging passions which had hitherto defied control.  He assured people that an oath of temperance would transform filthy rags into decent clothing and instill Christian morality within their society.  ","Southerners believed that this type of moral transformation would in turn positively reform all sinful areas of the southern male culture.  Prostitution and gambling were almost inherently linked with alcohol and by ending or limiting the occasion to drink temperance advocates hoped the South would be cleansed of these other vile institutions.  Bertram Wyatt-Brown notes that eventually, the temperance movement's public appeal for moderation hardened into Victorian repressiveness that struck many southerners as too severe. This extremist view irked some southerners and an opposition movement arose in the South proclaiming that temperance infringed upon individual liberties.  They resented the religious doctrines the temperance movement used to further its arguments and the subtle ways in which it attempted to force its views upon the South.  Thus, while Eugene Davis' speech rang of a genuine belief that temperance was the only way to revive the moral traditions of the South, Albemarle County would have been divided in its reaction because of the controversial social implications of his message."],"display_date":"October 23, 1842 - December 31, 1842","search_date":"1842-11-26","locations":[{"id":13596,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2193,"title":"War Orphans\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-11-13","end_date":"1872-11-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The Civil War was completely devastating to the citizens of the United States of America. Two percent of the entire population was killed as a direct result of the war. With over 500,000 people dead, the casualties far out number those of Americans in any other war. Americans were killing Americans, and the ruin that came about tore apart families and left many in complete bewilderment. "," C.M. Gordon wrote an article in the Natchez Weekly Democrat on November 13, 1872, which described an orphanage in Lauderdale, Mississippi. It was specifically set up in 1863 for children who were orphaned when their fathers died fighting in the Civil War. The Baptists who headed the orphanage believed that there was a debt of gratitude due those who had fallen in our defense, and that it could not be paid in a better way than providing for their children. The majority of the men who had died had been extremely poor and had left nothing for their children, so something had to be done for their offspring who were left behind. "," The orphanage intended to give the children an English education as well as to teach them a skill or trade so that when they were of age, they would be able to support themselves. They would accept children of any religious belief, and desired to give them the benefits of their benevolence. While the orphanage was mostly supported financially by the state of Mississippi, there was an ever increasing need for charitable donations because of a lack of basic living amenities. Gordon pleaded with the paper's readers to donate any sort of article of clothing because the 200 plus children were in dire need of them as winter approached. He reminds the public at large that it was their duty to care for these children through his statement, In our poverty and oppression, let us remember the offspring of those who lost their all for our rights. "," The Civil War left the United States absolutely torn, and everyone, even small children, was affected in some way, great or small, by the carnage it created. National morale was at an all-time low because everyone knew someone who had died. It was extremely difficult to get the bodies of loved ones back home, creating a sense that those who gave their lives were unable to rest in peace because of a lack of a proper burial. There was a lack of closure with the deceased, and communities, like the one in Lauderdale, rallied around the families of the dead, doing things such as taking care of orphaned children. The fact that there were so many dead Americans intensified people's desire to help those who remained for many years after the war had ended, and it was this sense of community that helped start to rebuild the shattered nation."],"display_date":"November 13, 1872","search_date":"1872-11-13","locations":[{"id":6975,"lat":33.5037112943,"lng":-89.3502052693,"zoom":9,"place":"CHOCTAW, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2199,"title":"Savannah Reverend Addresses Religious Conditions of Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-05-01","end_date":"1846-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Dexter Clapp of Savannah, Georgia got word of a question put forth in a newspaper, presumably by a Northerner, about the religious condition of slaves in the South. Clapp felt compelled to write a letter to the editor discussing his opinion on the matter. He stated that much of what he had to say was probably not known in the North, but was common knowledge in the South, or at least in his region of Georgia. He spoke of the enormous religious capacity of Southern slaves and the wonderful ways they took to Christian morals, even while in the lowest sphere of society. He also commended white Christians of the South who made it their duty to spread the Gospel to slaves, and said that the care of the spiritual wants of slaves were being given more and more attention by whites. He said that while in cities like Charleston, slaves and masters were often in the same churches and he found that encouraging, in Savannah blacks usually had their own churches. He stated that this was not a bad thing, and that slaves had their own black leaders and clergymen and had independence in their religious worship. Also, he mentioned that the majority of slaves went to church; the largest black church in Savannah having over fifteen hundred members. He also referenced a free black preacher who was not only was the highest paid preacher in the entire city, but who also was immensely successful in preaching to illiterate slaves, and making the Gospel applicable to their everyday lives. He commented that these slaves were as good of Christians as their educated masters. He also claimed that the black preacher seemed to be a defender of slavery, while that may be questioned by many historians. In general, Clapp described Christian slaves as good believers who seemed to have a kind and affectionate nature, a great capacity for love, and a docile and imitative manner, which made them accept the religious ideas presented to them. His letter made clear that he wanted people in the North to know that slaves' religious needs were not only cared for, but that most slaves were exceptional Christians who exhibited many of the best Christian virtues. He made sure to include that white Southerners were perfectly capable and concerned with bettering and supporting the spread of the Gospel to their enslaved people.","Much of what Dexter Clapp had to say on the state of slave Christianity was true, although he described some of it in a very condescending and insulting way, which was indicative of the feelings many white Southerners had towards slaves. He was right in saying that there were many people, missionaries and ordinary folk alike, who saw the importance of sharing the Gospel with slaves. With the rise of Protestantism and the Great Revival in the 1830's, many missionaries made it their work to preach to slaves. Many slaves did respond to message for several reasons, though not as Clapp said: because they had an imitative manner that would make them accept anything presented to them. Although many white Southern Christians claimed dominance over their slaves, slaves could feel equal before God. It also strengthened their families and communities, which was vital to keep their society together during the terrible conditions of slavery. Also, the idea of an equal Heaven was central to the hope that maintained many slaves throughout their lives. Christianity gave slaves freedom to participate in white churches or in their own churches, where they had the freedom to hear their own preachers and socialize with fellow enslaved Christians. Even white men who heard black preachers, said they could not find more enthusiastic ministers or more emotional and genuine church members anywhere. However, some slaveholders feared that religion would cause slaves to rebel, and these whites used the Bible to justify slavery. However, other masters may have truly cared about the salvation of their bondsmen and encouraged them to be Christians. The patronizing way Clapp spoke of the imitative slaves in Georgia was indicative of the opinion many whites had about white supremacy and supposed black infantile nature, but they could not have been more wrong. Although Clapp spoke condescendingly of the docile and imitative nature of the slave, he did not know that slaves often met in secret for their own prayer groups and sermons, where they strongly addressed issues other than obedience to their masters. They discussed freedom and prayed for it, and they sang and danced, and gave way to the feeling of the Spirit. While whites may have seen slaves as docile and meek people who whites actively converted, slaves used their religion and its spread, to create new hope and a stronger culture than ever for African Americans across the South."],"display_date":"May 1, 1846 - May 30, 1846","search_date":"1846-05-15","locations":[{"id":1630,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2205,"title":"Youthful Misconduct in Celebration of Christmas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-12-24","end_date":"1879-01-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The members of the City Council of Staunton, Virginia voted against the suspension over the Christmas holiday of an ordinance that forbad the use of pop-crackers in the streets.

He was not authorized to perform the rites of baptism and confirmation without prior approval, which would have been given by Reverend J. B. Haskell. Tellingly Reverend Haskell, the prosecutor in the court case, and Reverend Miller, though both of the Central Evangelical Lutheran Church of Staunton, just did not get along. Reverend Miller was also charged with intentional negligence in his failure to admit the newly baptized adults into Church membership and his failure to require the confirmation of baptismal vows. He explained to the Synod that the young ladies he baptized were members of the Staunton Female Seminary and the baptism occurred without the knowledge of their non-Lutheran parents. They desired to publicly profess their faith in Jesus Christ, but had to become regular members of their home church due to the expectations of their parents. The Synod excused Reverend Miller though he had been guilty of this charge, stating that many other members of the Synod were guilty of the same act as the justification for their decision. Further charges against Reverend Miller describe his misconduct toward Reverend Haskell and the dissatisfaction he provoked in the congregation."," The Synod's Constitution holds its members amenable to its authority for a violation of doctrines, morals, and practices. Though Reverend Miller's actions were against the rules described in the Constitution, the Synod accepted Miller's explanations as satisfactory. The council and congregation of the Lutheran Church of Staunton were appalled by the decisions of the Synod, which in their opinion stemmed from the failure of the Synod to observe its own rules of procedure, to decide the grave questions involved according to the evidence. So upset were they by this ruling, the council and congregation decided to dissolve their connection with the Virginia Synod on the sixth of June, 1880 with a vote of 59 to 30."," Historian Donald Mathews argues that early believers in Evangelicalism perceived their religion as liberating thousands by raising them from their low positions to the higher planes of sophistication and enlightenment. This same notion of liberty dictated the actions of the Staunton Lutheran Church, reflecting Mathews's argument. Like the American Revolution that promoted independence from governing by an outside party, the southern states at the time of the Civil War encouraged the autonomy of state government from the greater nation. The division of governments that resulted from these quests for greater liberty demonstrated why the Staunton church separated from the state Synod. The disagreements between the two reverends was raised by their congregation to a question of state versus local power when they decided to criticize the decisions of their governing body. The belief that the congregation was the true unit of Lutheran church placed the power in the hands of the worshippers so that their beliefs took precedence over those of the Synod. The shift from state to local control paralleled the shift that occurred when the southern states demanded their right of succession."],"display_date":"March 24, 1878 - June 6, 1880","search_date":"1879-04-30","locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2211,"title":"Preaching on the Steps of the Courthouse\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-11-20","end_date":"1873-11-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["   A stranger preaching on the steps of their courthouse interrupted the daily chores of the citizens of Staunton on Thursday. Andrew Jackson Kearney, supposedly of Loudon County, had been drifting from city to city, traveling from Harrisonburg to Staunton to spread his religious fervor. A curious crowd gathered to hear the sermon that followed his public singing and praying, eloquently speaking to answer the question, Why is a man better than a sheep?.","   The following week, Kearney appeared in Charlottesville where he was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. Upon an accusation of being an imposter, Kearney pulled out a pistol and threatened to fire into the group of onlookers gathered in front of him. It seemed that Andrew Kearney had previously been imprisoned in Maryland for seven years. The Staunton Spectator suggested, in the spirit of his sermon in Staunton, that Kearney should feel sheepish for his deceit of the public regarding his criminal record.","   In the South, preaching has been preferable to other forms of religious expression because it focuses on the style of faith most applicable to the region's enthusiastic character. The preacher is one of few figures in the South able to overcome racial and religious boundaries due to his centrality to religious life. One of the roles played by the preacher is that of sage, placing him in a role of mediation between political and religious life. James M. Dabbs argues that Southerners have a propensity to substitute religion with politics, politics with religion, and to unite the two under morality. The combination of politics, religion, and morality presided over by a preacher is the same grouping of elements which Andrew Jackson Kearney tried to appropriate, thus supporting Dabbs's claim. His decision to preach on the steps of the courthouse in Staunton showed both his desire to make his message public and to unite religious thought with the law. He asserted that his doctrine was lawful with his position, following the traditional Southern pattern of enforcing religion as an official system of belief. Kearney's violent reaction to the questioning of his authority showed the power inherent in the position of preacher. He believed himself to be a religious leader, and as such, beyond public criticism. The newspaper's mockery, however, revealed that those witnessing his sermon refused to grant such an important role in the community.

The incident arose outside the church because three men, Seth Lowe, Will Phillips, and John Howard all loved a local Arkansas girl, Miss Irene Pruitt. They attended the same prayer meeting that evening. Miss Pruitt arrived at the location with Phillips, and soon thereafter met Lowe and Howard just outside the church. When Miss Pruitt went inside, the men began to quarrel over her, escalating from argument to physical brawl when Howard and Lowe both jumped on Phillips. Phillips then reportedly shot Howard, through the body with a pistol he had on his person. In quick succession, Lowe fired at Phillips with his gun, hitting him in his lower back. Once Phillips had fallen to the ground due to the impact of the bullet, he managed to aim accurately enough at Lowe to fatally wound him in the shoulder. The New York Times reported that the scene concluded with a panic in [the] church and stated finally that, All three men are fatally injured."," Many Southern men carried guns, and of those who did, it seems they did not hesitate to use them. Historians Charles Wilson and William Ferris hint to one of the causes for these public, and almost casual, acts of aggression, Southerners have a much more positive attitude towards gun ownership. Because more southern men had loaded weapons on them, they were more likely to shoot someone on a day to day basis. During the late 1800s, a journalist named Horace Victor Eugene Redfield conducted a diligent study on homicide rates entitled, Homicide, North and South. In this study, he compared the homicide rates of states in both the North and South, traveling all over the county to collect his data. Results of his research showed that criminal homicides in a given state were much higher in the South in comparison to the North. In 1964 Arkansas had a 3.7 percent homicide rate for every population of 100,000 while New York only had 1.7 percent."," Redfield found patterns of southern homicide in his research. He emphasized that homicide was promoted by gun policy in the South: He saw the most general cause of southern violence as a lack of regard for human life...as did the unnecessary carrying of weapons, particularly concealed weapons. Lowe, Phillips, and Howard were southern men with concealed weapons. Redfield also noted in his findings that white homicide in the south at this time was more prominent than black; all three men in the shooting of December 1, 1897 were white males. "," Nineteenth-century southern violence, according to Charles Wilson and William Ferris, had a common catalyst: insult to honor, or personal ego. Words often escalated quickly to violence which is demonstrated by the incident over Miss Pruitt at Little Rock. Correlations were found between a southern emphasis on honor related values and homicide rates in the1800s. The post Civil War era tradition of a duel, commonly associated with honor, was replaced by a more abrupt and free-form style of violence according to Wilson and Ferris: fighting, shooting, stabbing, feuding, and shotgun weddings were considered legitimate and inevitable results of honor confronting honor."," Ironically, this particular incident took place outside a church door when, honor, necessarily a secular system of values, clashed with the ideals of Christian virtue.

Moore described many elements of her day-to-day life. She includes information on her family, including the recent death of her mother, and other incidents in her community. Additionally, she wrote of trips into Washington and the sites that greeted her eyes on her excursions. Basically, she discussed affairs that you would expect a young woman to relate to her friend. However, the author discussed one incident of peculiar interest involving a church meeting, as she states, I was at a big meeting at the Dunkard Church two weeks ago and I heard the best sermon preached by a woman I ever heard. This episode is of interest for its reference to the Dunkers, an evangelical Christian denomination, and its mention of a female preacher. The Dunkers, or the Church of the Brethren, was a movement that came to the United States, specifically Pennsylvania, in search of religious freedom. Related to the Mennonites, Methodists and Dunkers, the followers emphasized simplicity in their adherence to religion and utilized such practices as adult baptism, lay ministry, non-violence and non-swearing of oaths. Dunkers lived in very close knit communities and, while not uncommon in the South, distinguished themselves from the rest of society through distinctly plain dress."," Additionally, as pointed out by Stephen Longenecker, the Dunkers also differentiated themselves in the South because of their stance on slavery. While they opposed bondage, many evangelical groups justified slavery among their members by requiring that slaveholders keep their slaves only until the value of their purchase had been earned back. Eventually though, in most denominations, slavery, while opposed by the leaders and doctrine, became accepted among the average follower."],"display_date":"October 30, 1859","search_date":"1859-10-30","locations":[{"id":13796,"lat":38.8383886986,"lng":-77.2747207757,"zoom":9,"place":"FAIRFAX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2235,"title":"Episcopal Church Election Controversy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-12-01","end_date":"1897-12-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Arkansas Church Election, held on December 1, 1897, met in order to determine the election of Coadjutor Bishop of Little Rock. The New York Times reported on Friday, December 3, 1897 that the candidates for the position were Reverend John Gass of Little Rock, and William Montgomery Brown of Cleveland. The Diocesan Convention of the Episcopal Church of Arkansas met and elected Archdeacon William Montgomery Brown to work alongside the current Bishop Henry N. Pierce as Coadjutor Bishop. Bishop Pierce was already relocated to Little Rock, Arkansas in march of 1870 after his election to the position on January 25, 1870, where Brown joined him from Cleveland. His election, however, was not met with much approval from the Little Rock Episcopalian community. The New York Times stated bluntly that, The election of Archdeacon Brown has resulted in great dissatisfaction. "," The frustration that the public felt at Brown's election seems to have stemmed mainly from his economic standing and its potential effect on his clerical policies. On December 2, Governor Jones of Little Rock, a supporter of Reverend John Gass, accused Mr. Brown told the press that he felt Brown was unsuited for the job, saying that, an overwhelming majority of Arkansas Episcopalians belong to the low church, and Mr. Brown's chief qualification is his wealth. Jones also said that he believed that the economic difference, separates him from the people he is expected to bring to the church. If Mr. Brown is a true Christian at heart and desires to advance the cause of the church he will not accept this position."," This strong sentiment by the governor of Little Rock was reinforced by other accusations against Brown and his wealth. Col. Willaim G. Whipple, another active politician at the time, suggested to New York Times reporters that Brown won his position through intimidation by the high officials of the church. He was quoted as saying, his supporters seem to have relied chiefly upon his reputed wealth or that of some relative by marriage. This seems a poor qualification for a Bishop. Despite the initial reaction portrayed by the New York Times in 1897, Willaim M. Brown went on to succeed Bishop Pierce only three years later on September 5, 1900, becoming head of the region's diocese. And looking back, historian Dallas T. Herndon observed in 1922 that, under the ministrations of these several bishops [Brown included] the Episcopal Church has had a satisfactory growth in the state."," The Episcopal Church of the South in the nineteenth century was considered less prominent and had fewer followers than Methodist and Baptist institutions. Historian Samuel S. Hill attributes this smaller following, in Arkansas particularly, to the fact that Episcopalians tended to be of higher economic standing than most, putting them in a smaller demographic. Hill also suggests that, From Reconstruction to World War I the Episcopal Church in the South was concerned with two primary issues: recognizing and reorganizing and rebuilding after the war and continued growth with the creation of new dioceses. This validates the attentiveness given to the election of Archdeacon Brown, as the Episcopalian church was trying to re-establish its foundation in the South."],"display_date":"December 1, 1897 - December 3, 1897","search_date":"1897-12-02","locations":[{"id":752,"lat":34.7798418653,"lng":-92.3166533878,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2236,"title":"Fight for an Arkansas Girl\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-12-01","end_date":"1897-12-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A county church in Huntsville, Madison County was the setting for a triangle homicide on December 1, 1897. The incident arose outside the church because three men, Seth Lowe, Will Phillips, and John Howard all loved a local Arkansas girl, Miss Irene Pruitt. They attended the same prayer meeting that evening. Miss Pruitt arrived at the location with Phillips, and soon thereafter met Lowe and Howard just outside the church. When Miss Pruitt went inside, the men began to quarrel over her, escalating from argument to physical brawl when Howard and Lowe both jumped on Phillips. Phillips then reportedly shot Howard, through the body with a pistol he had on his person. In quick succession, Lowe fired at Phillips with his gun, hitting him in his lower back. Once Phillips had fallen to the ground due to the impact of the bullet, he managed to aim accurately enough at Lowe to fatally wound him in the shoulder. The New York Times reported that the scene concluded with a panic in [the] church and stated finally that, All three men are fatally injured."," Many Southern men carried guns, and of those who did, it seems they did not hesitate to use them. Historians Charles Wilson and William Ferris hint to one of the causes for these public, and almost casual, acts of aggression, Southerners have a much more positive attitude towards gun ownership. Because more southern men had loaded weapons on them, they were more likely to shoot someone on a day to day basis. During the late 1800s, a journalist named Horace Victor Eugene Redfield conducted a diligent study on homicide rates entitled, Homicide, North and South. In this study, he compared the homicide rates of states in both the North and South, traveling all over the county to collect his data. Results of his research showed that criminal homicides in a given state were much higher in the South in comparison to the North. In 1964 Arkansas had a 3.7 percent homicide rate for every population of 100,000 while New York only had 1.7 percent."," Redfield found patterns of southern homicide in his research. He emphasized that homicide was promoted by gun policy in the South: He saw the most general cause of southern violence as a lack of regard for human life...as did the unnecessary carrying of weapons, particularly concealed weapons. Lowe, Phillips, and Howard were southern men with concealed weapons. Redfield also noted in his findings that white homicide in the south at this time was more prominent than black; all three men in the shooting of December 1, 1897 were white males. "," Nineteenth-century southern violence, according to Charles Wilson and William Ferris, had a common catalyst: insult to honor, or personal ego. Words often escalated quickly to violence which is demonstrated by the incident over Miss Pruitt at Little Rock. Correlations were found between a southern emphasis on honor related values and homicide rates in the1800s. The post Civil War era tradition of a duel, commonly associated with honor, was replaced by a more abrupt and free-form style of violence according to Wilson and Ferris: fighting, shooting, stabbing, feuding, and shotgun weddings were considered legitimate and inevitable results of honor confronting honor."," Ironically, this particular incident took place outside a church door when, honor, necessarily a secular system of values, clashed with the ideals of Christian virtue. In the same day, The New York Times also printed a story detailing the Protestant Episcopal Church's outrage at the sense of danger which threatens the character of our people, in light of recent murders.

They believed they had found it in the Old Testament with the Curse of Ham in Genesis 9:25-27. Cursed be Canaan The lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers...Blessed be the Lord, the God of Shem May Canaan be the slave of Shem. These southerners believed that Canaan had settled in Africa, and that his descendants had become black. Thus, slavery was the natural order of life, and because of this belief, many people were alarmed at the growing number of new religions preaching equality among the races. In the mid 1800s, Evangelicalism began in small groups and then began to gain its foothold in the South where it eventually formed several denominations (Methodists, Baptists, and Presbyterian). The Methodists emerged out of these groups as staunch believers that slavery was wrong, and this ideal held well into the nineteenth century. "," Methodism was founded by John Wesley of New England, and was based on a premise that there was a method of coming to God. It quickly spread throughout the entire new world, particularly the South, where classes were conducted where people shared their innermost feelings with each other. In these classes, traditional boundaries of class, race, and sex were bridged. The Methodist preachers (along with the other Evangelical religions' preachers) began to travel throughout the South exclaiming the word of God. The Methodists, as well as other Evangelicals, became the enemy of the southern slave owners because of their anti-slavery stance, as well as their belief that women and African Americans were equal to white men. Slave owners felt that if the slaves internalized these ideals of freedom and equality, there would be a greater risk of slave revolts and general discontent within the system of bondage."," Leading up to and during the Civil War, many Methodists used their religious beliefs as justification for desiring to beat the Confederacy. When the Union won the war, and the slaves were emancipated, religious newspapers exclaimed about the Christianization of African Americans across the country. In a letter dated November 13, 1865, from Reverend W.H. Watkins in Washington, Mississippi, to the Philadelphia newspaper The Christian Recorder, Watkins told of the desire of the Methodist Church to educate African Americans in the teachings of Christ. He stated, It is the purpose of the Church, to whom the colored people are mainly indebted for all they know of Christianity, to supply the missions as formerly, where our ministry is desired, and where the people show a willingness to support it...We have shown ourselves friend of the Negro, and the Church will not abate any of its efforts to teach him the way of salvation...The Mississippi Conference resolves to promote the education of the rising generation. "," Methodists like Reverend Watkins still desired to promote Christ in the lives of African Americans throughout the South after the Civil War. They felt it was necessary to keep promoting the ideals of equality among all Americans, especially after emancipation. Because the nation had lived with such an unjust institution for so long, they knew these feelings of social inequality would not disappear overnight, and therefore resolved to try to dissolve them."],"display_date":"November 13, 1865","search_date":"1865-11-13","locations":[{"id":7319,"lat":33.2603630837,"lng":-90.841504364,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2260,"title":"Raleigh Baptist Answers the Call of the Holy Spirit\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-03-05","end_date":"1876-03-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Baptists of Raleigh overflowed in the street outside the meeting house where Elder F.M.

Mrs. Hufman, a fellow Baptist, relayed the Holy Spirit's message to Allen, telling him of her dream that he built a new meeting house in just one day.  Upon hearing this news, Allen, a building contractor, stated that he could not build a meeting house in one day-but with the help of his Brothers, could build one in one week.","Allen began his work right away, gathering members from the First Baptist Church of Raleigh to help him both furnish and build the new meeting house.

Gordon wrote an article in the Natchez Weekly Democrat on November 13, 1872, which described an orphanage in Lauderdale, Mississippi. It was specifically set up in 1863 for children who were orphaned when their fathers died fighting in the Civil War. The Baptists who headed the orphanage believed that there was a debt of gratitude due those who had fallen in our defense, and that it could not be paid in a better way than providing for their children. The majority of the men who had died had been extremely poor and had left nothing for their children, so something had to be done for their offspring who were left behind. "," The orphanage intended to give the children an English education as well as to teach them a skill or trade so that when they were of age, they would be able to support themselves. They would accept children of any religious belief, and desired to give them the benefits of their benevolence. While the orphanage was mostly supported financially by the state of Mississippi, there was an ever increasing need for charitable donations because of a lack of basic living amenities. Gordon pleaded with the paper's readers to donate any sort of article of clothing because the 200 plus children were in dire need of them as winter approached. He reminds the public at large that it was their duty to care for these children through his statement, In our poverty and oppression, let us remember the offspring of those who lost their all for our rights. "," The Civil War left the United States absolutely torn, and everyone, even small children, was affected in some way, great or small, by the carnage it created. National morale was at an all-time low because everyone knew someone who had died. It was extremely difficult to get the bodies of loved ones back home, creating a sense that those who gave their lives were unable to rest in peace because of a lack of a proper burial. There was a lack of closure with the deceased, and communities, like the one in Lauderdale, rallied around the families of the dead, doing things such as taking care of orphaned children. The fact that there were so many dead Americans intensified people's desire to help those who remained for many years after the war had ended, and it was this sense of community that helped start to rebuild the shattered nation."],"display_date":"November 13, 1872","search_date":"1872-11-13","locations":[{"id":7124,"lat":32.4042572998,"lng":-88.6625666857,"zoom":9,"place":"LAUDERDALE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2265,"title":"Educational Improvements in North Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-03-08","end_date":"1876-03-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mary Graves never imagined that she would be offered a teaching position in Caswell County when she visited as a guest preacher to local Presbyterian congregations from her Leesburg, Virginia home in 1876.Yet, Mary was offered a teaching position, and to her own surprise, left her home in Leesburg and moved to Caswell County to begin her teaching career.

M. Hawley entitled Southern Methodism and the Age, calling for the Methodist Church to reform itself in order to be a success in the modern age. Hawley called the present age a great period for both the Church and the country. The Church, he said, must embrace the age and modernize along with it; all Christians should ask themselves how to accomplish this task. Specifically, he asked how the Baltimore Conference could be prosperous.","Reverend Hawley named three things in his article that make up what the Church should focus on: great enterprises, an aggressive spirit, and great liberality. In explanation of the first, he wrote that new churches should be built to expand the congregation and community and that all should lend support to this cause. He said in order to do this, the members need an aggressive spirit, to push forward through all obstacles. And finally, the liberality he spoke of, is in reference to money, and how it should be spent to do the work of God. The Reverend called on Methodists to follow the progressive trend of the times and modernize themselves to increase their influence and scope in the Baltimore community.","Historian John B. Boles explains that, after the Civil War, the popularity of the more mainstream religions declined while more people began converting to Methodism. People wanted to focus on perfecting their spirituality and concern themselves less on the world around them. Historian C. Vann Woodward, however, states that in the 1880s, Southern Methodists called for rejecting Northern ideals like progress; they had been noticing people abandoning morals for money. The article by Reverend Hawley partially goes against these views. He fixes the problem of money and morals by saying they can go together; money can and definitely should be used in the service of God. Perhaps his call for progress has to do with the fact that Maryland is not located in the Deep South and prone to Northern influence. Also, perhaps Hawley's article is a backlash to this concept; as Maryland Methodists look forward to the 1890s, they are looking to combine progress with religious values so that Methodism would continue to flourish into the twentieth century."],"display_date":"April 24, 1889","search_date":"1889-04-24","locations":[{"id":5934,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2303,"title":"Mary Evans Thanks Brian Philpot, Her Former Master, for His Sending Money","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-05-01","end_date":"1889-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Mary Evans, living in Knoxville in Frederick County, Maryland, in May 1889, wrote her former master, Brian Philpot, to thank him for his gift of five dollars.

Melvin Ely conveys this sentiment when he states that whites felt blacks could only live in a civilized society if they were watched over and guided by the moral superiority of whites. Therefore, it was up to the white citizens of Culpeper County to curtail the economic activity that encouraged the disorderly conduct and upsetting the balance that so delicately permeated life in slave holding society.

Additionally, the petition revealed that whites were participating in the moral debauchery as well. In fact, they apparently facilitated it.

First, Alexander thought that slavery allowed a greater number of talented individuals to devote their time to studying and spreading their knowledge through all ranks of society, benefiting all. Without slavery, white young scholars could not attend colleges and academies, which are of infinite advantage to any country. At this point in his essay, Alexander refuted the objection that slavery denied blacks from these opportunities by stating that the slaves were allocated to their proper position in society, seeing that they are entirely incapable of self-government. He felt that slaves were able to perform the drudgery and duties that white people could certainly not do. Furthermore, Alexander argued that, judging from the ignorance and incapability of the wild Africans, blacks benefited from being in subjugation to whites. Slavery taught these barbarians how to be civilized and humane because masters lovingly took their slaves with them to church. Lastly, slavery also helped the country as a whole, amassing wealth and the capability for defense.","On the other hand, Alexander acknowledged disadvantages to the institution of slavery simply because advantages were always accompanied by disadvantages. He explained that slavery mars the peace and tranquility of the overseer by their natural waywardness and stupidity. Furthermore, the number of enslaved occupants of the country diminished the number of free white citizens that could inhabit the country. Last but not least, slavery set an example of autocracy, reputing the republican principles that the Constitution stood for.","These views were common to southerners in Franklin County, Alabama, and across the entire South. Southerners everywhere had to build a body of ideologies and answers in order to classify slavery as advantageous. It is not clear where Alexander retained his opinions. However, the fact that this essay was an assignment in the schooling of a southern youth legitimizes this ideological notion that white southerners had to talk themselves into the morality and rightful authority of enslaving millions of people. The slave South used the concept of paternalism-governing or ruling over a group of people in a fatherly manner out of necessity-as the official defense to slavery, believing that it was beneficial to both master and slave. The fragile contradictions of slavery required southerners to believe that the blacks could not take care of themselves, making it necessary and right that the superior group care for them. In order to prolong society and culture as they knew it, the southerners who were instructing Alexander Allen and his generation imposed these concepts into their basic education."],"display_date":"1830 - 1849","search_date":"1840-01-01","locations":[{"id":162,"lat":34.5339170174,"lng":-87.6962673407,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2345,"title":"Sam Forwood&#39;s Definition of the Southern Family\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-05-07","end_date":"1840-05-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 7, 1840, Sam Forwood, in Clark County, Alabama, wrote to his son William on the health of his family. Numerous family letters focused on health. In this correspondence, the first paragraph tended to discuss the health of all members of the family and the history of any sicknesses since the last letter. The Forwood family was generally in sufficient health, despite a fever here and there. However, in this letter, Sam chose to include the conditions of his slaves. He wrote, My family is in good health except one negro woman and a little negro boy over two years old. The black woman had been plagued by a slight fever, and the young slave boy had broken a bone rough-housing with some of the other slave children. Following this mention, Sam continued his letter with the normal discussion of his cotton crop and other business around Clark County.","This is not an exception in the history of southern slavery. Slave owners often included slaves as a part of their household. As Edward Ayers points out, in most instances, masters and slaves mutually cared for one another, and masters would grieve for slaves as a member for the family. Because the idea of family was so important in the southern Christian culture, masters frequently included their slaves in their notion of their family unit. The inclusion would, in theory, civilize the slaves with Christian influences because slaves who respected their masters-as children who respect their fathers-would never seek to harm them. Furthermore, the slaves' own family units, like those of their masters, kept a degree of humanity and happiness instilled in the plantation dynamics.","Moreover, slaves were the livelihood of southern plantation owners, and thus owners were necessarily concerned about the health of their slaves. According to William Roger, slavery was an indispensable component of the cotton kingdom, and so, the success of an Alabama plantation and the success of its owner rested upon the slaves. Surely, a slave with a broken bone or a fever was of no use. Therefore, Sam Forwood had no choice but to care about the well-being of their slaves."],"display_date":"May 7, 1840","search_date":"1840-05-07","locations":[{"id":78,"lat":31.6767353507,"lng":-87.8307270777,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2381,"title":"Prominent Mobile Couple Married\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-02-18","end_date":"1880-02-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of February 18, 1880, a prominent young man from Mobile anxiously awaited the clock striking seven, upon which he would walk down the aisle to be joined in matrimony. The groom, Mister Richard P. Deshon, was marrying Miss Mary E. Herndon, the daughter of Hon. Thomas Herndon M.C., an Alabama Representative in Congress. They held their wedding in the parlors of the Representative's home in Mobile, address  515 Thirteenth Street Northwest. The ceremony was done simply considering the two parties getting married; the bride wore a modest white toilette, with satin and lace trimmings, and her veil was decorated with orange blossoms. The couple had opted for a traditional Presbyterian ceremony, and they chose the chaplain of the Senate, Dr. J.J. Bullock, to marry them. The guest list was limited to the Alabama Congressional Representatives and a few close family friends. Mr. Herndon's co-representatives in the House, Samford, Herbert, Williams, Shelley, Forney, and Lewis all came with their families, as did Alabama Senators Morgan and Prior. A few other Representatives, all close friends of Mr. Herndon, were also in attendance with their families. The bride was overwhelmed with the generosity of her guests, and was especially surprised by the beautiful embossed silver service that was hidden inside a magnificent casket-a gift from the Alabama delegation. The elated couple, following a simple reception, left for an extended Eastern bridal tour later that evening.","This marriage is not typical of an Alabama family of the Herndon's social stature. First of all, the simplicity of their wedding does not seem fitting to the public nature of the family's life. Secondly, the service itself, a Presbyterian marriage, was uncommon in the Mobile area. Presbyterians were somewhat of a minority, and were much stronger in the black belt of Alabama than they were in the Gulf Coast region.","However, soon after this ceremony, Presbyterianism would experience a rise in the state. In 1883 the Presbytery of Northern Alabama was made a part of the Synod of Alabama, thus consolidating the faith within the state. This was known as Alabamian Presbyterianism's golden age. The traditional ceremony of marriage between Richard Deshon and Mary Herndon was a prime example of the modest values Presbyterians would try to promote in the years to come."],"display_date":"February 18, 1880","search_date":"1880-02-18","locations":[{"id":287,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2391,"title":"A Bride Preaches Before Her Wedding\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-11-01","end_date":"1870-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" The Williamson Journal of Franklin, Tennessee announced the local marriage of Mary A Stinebaugh and Rev. Henry J. Bradford in late 1870. The outspoken Mary Stinebaugh graduated from Oberlin College and became a Methodist preacher before her marriage. Right before her wedding ceremony she preached before the entire conference in session. Afterwards she promptly stepped down to the altar to get married. "," At the end of the report, the Williamson Journal exclaimed what a fix the reverend bride would be in if the conference should appoint her to a church distant from her husband. Though the writer did not Stinebaugh's progress as a woman, he found the occurrence of two preachers getting married strange and rare. In his confusion he ambiguously described Mary's position in society as one who has lately become somewhat noted as a Methodist Preacher, not knowing how to put it in words. "," Though women preachers in 1870 were rare, Methodist women in the South were hungry for leadership opportunities and used their churches as an outlet to contribute to society. Edward Ayers, describes the Methodists as those who challenged dominant gender relationships, valuing faith over domestic loyalty and giving women a more prominent place. The Methodists were one of the Christian denominations more accepting of leadership among women though they usually prohibited women from gaining official denominational positions. "," Through the church, women found ways to expand their leadership organizing their own special groups and societies. Tomas Frasier in his essay on Women and Religion described the situation of persevering southern female Methodists. As Methodist women began to seek and be denied positions of leadership in the denomination, they developed progressive societies to address the evils in the culture around them. They organized social settlements and a variety of services leaders which was most easily found through. Some created charities, or clubs that were based on women's skills, like sewing clothes for the poor, so that men could not take it over.

The Reverend John Witherspoon Pettigrew McKenzie founded the school and was also its headmaster. Malcolm H. Addison attended McKenzie College and like most college students both past and present, he received letters from his parents. For Addison, the subject of these letters inevitably turned to a questioning of the status of his soul. For months Addison dashed his parent's hopes saying that he had not found religion. It was not until March 4, 1849 that Addison officially proclaimed his life changing experience to his parents. He told his parents of a great revival at his school and the conversion of two of his roommates. He then confessed that he too had found religion was surprised at how easily it had come to him. ","Education and religion were closely linked in this period. As the need for institutions of learning increased, churches rose to challenge by establishing schools. Many saw it as one of the duties of the church to provide a Christian education for young people. To ensure this, most teachers hired in schools throughout Texas were pastors. Rupert N. Richardson also points out that even schools not under church control generally maintained religious environments. At McKenzie college religion was incorporated into the academic curriculum and daily life. The students were required to attend chapels and have prayers at 4:00 AM. The school also held revivals, and this was where Addison was converted. ","The insistency of Addison's parents in inquiring about his spiritual life shows how great a concern religion was. When Protestantism took root in Texas in the 1830s, many Evangelical Christians began to place emphasis on the role of family religion. It was important for parents to be religious role models and communicate to their children the ways in which God was working in their everyday lives. Donald G. Mathews summarizes the purpose of family religion as, nurturing children so that when they came to adulthood they would be susceptible to conversion. For this reason the concern of Addison's parents is understandable. Not only did they want their son to go to heaven, but they also wanted to make sure they had not failed in their duties as Christian parents. Addison's series of correspondences is an example of how high a priority religion was in the antebellum South. Religion permeated all aspects of daily life from education to personal correspondence.

Wesleyan Methodist preacher Jesse McBride had stirred too much controversy among whites and slaves in Guilford County.  Intending to run McBride out of the county, about two-hundred men gathered on May 23, 1851 outside of the church where he would preach that morning.  For six hours McBride had been on the road, not finishing the 18 mile journey to his Liberty Hill congregation outside of Greensboro until a few minutes before noon.  Accounts of the exchange between McBride and the disgruntled locals vary according to source.  The mob leader and slave-owner Hoover blocked McBride from entering the church.  McBride appears to have kept a cool head in the confrontation: he drew upon scriptural resources, he induced his congregation to sing hymns in front of the increasingly frustrated mob, and he conducted his congregation in prayers. Without personal violence or abuse according to the local <em>Greensboro Patriot</em>, but with considerable, drunken man-handling according to McBride's personal account in the abolitionist <em>Liberator</em>, the mob shoved McBride into his carriage.  He rode away.  Sometime immediately thereafter, local powers obtained his pledge in writing to depart Guilford County within a week.  McBride returned to Ohio.  The <em>Liberator</em> published his first account on June 20 and then a more elaborate version on August 15.  The <em>Greensboro Patriot </em>expressed relief and anticipated a return to tranquility in its brief account of the incident.  ","The creed of Wesleyan Methodists involved an antislavery stance, and for this reason many whites no longer tolerated McBride's growing influence among the Christian circles of Guilford and Stokes Counties.  On May 18, Reverend Hines of the Methodist Episcopal Church had stated the deleterious effects of McBride's sermons in a meeting.  Local officials held another meeting in Greensboro on May 20 for the purpose of suppressing abolition agitation.  During the meeting, McBride was implicated directly for interfering with the property rights of local slave-owners.  He had created enemies among nervous slave-holders and among vexed preachers whose congregations were splintering over slavery.","Beginning with zeal in 1831, when William Lloyd Garrison began publishing the <em>Liberator</em>, and gaining controversial attention in the wake of Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion, the Abolition crusade began making its presence felt among slave-holders.  Because Southern churches' policies accommodated slavery, the Methodist Church split in 1844, and supporters of slavery established the Methodist Episcopal Church.  This episode in McBride's career strengthens Donald Matthews' description of the brave extension of the Evangelical ethos beyond the internal life of the believer and into social relationships. McBride's<em> Wesleyan</em> sect of Methodism, which threatened excommunication to those who would not emancipate their slaves within two years, scared slaveholders with its judgmental views.  McBride's brave efforts to nurture an anti-slavery parish illustrate both the active efforts of anti-slavery ideology and the physical resistance these efforts met from pro-slavery interests."],"display_date":"May 18, 1851 - August 15, 1851","search_date":"1851-07-01","locations":[{"id":9489,"lat":36.0793885003,"lng":-79.7889995015,"zoom":9,"place":"GUILFORD, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2423,"title":"Digging up the Past\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-02-23","end_date":"1854-02-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Susan Sillers Darden, a white woman living in the Mississippi Delta region during the mid-nineteenth century, left behind a lengthy diary that covers many of the day-to-day occurrences and various happenings of her neighborhood. In an 1854 entry, Darden recounted a particularly unusual event: the exhumation of two corpses. Darden wrote that the remains of Rodney King and Mrs. Ogle were unearthed on February 23, 1854. She described the two as brother and sister, but gave no other details as to either their backgrounds or their personalities. The bodies were transported from the original gravesites in Tenesas Parish, Louisiana to Old Salem. How this was accomplished remained unstated, but Darden specifically mentioned that the two were reburied amongst their already-deceased relatives, including both their parents and brother. "," Southern burials and funerals have long been part of an evolving process, heavily influenced by the changing social conditions of the United States. According to scholar Charles Reagan Wilson, before the Civil War they shared many common characteristics with funerals in the North. Writes Wilson, southerners and northerners alike saw funerals as, a recognized time to overcome the separation [of a loved one]. In both the North and South funerals were cathartic ceremonies that allowed grieving friends and family the gift of closure. However, as the Civil War approached southerners began to isolate themselves within their own affinity group, and funerals became, true ceremonies of southern identity. Symbols of Dixie were prominently displayed, while eulogies explained the contribution of the deceased to the South as a region, Wilson writes. As it became more and more important for Southerners to maintain and uphold their distinctive 'southernness, it became equally as important for this identity to be displayed in all aspects of life, including death. "," The fact that the bodies Darden described were exhumed and moved to another burial site stresses the significance placed on burials in the South. Because southerners believed burial to be both an expression of southern pride and a means of closure, it was instrumentally important that the dead be given appropriate burial. Darden was vague about who ordered the corpses moved, but the person(s) clearly felt that King and Ogle's previous graves were unsuitable, possibly because mourners had not buried them among their family members. It is not surprising that if these two bodies had not been shown proper respect in death, those that loved them most would order them moved.

According to the Greensboro Patriot, the sister women's college, Edgeworth, founded by Governor Morehead, was also producing successful alumnae who were taking their social stand in many circles.  North Carolina produced white female graduates who could bring scholastic knowledge to the affairs pertaining to wives and mothers in 1847. ","      The article attested to the paradoxical nature of antebellum female education inasmuch as it professed to develop and cultivate the intellect and give dignity to the mind while at the same time prescribing limited roles for women in society.  The examinations of Spring 1847 occurred in the midst of an Intellectual Awakening which had begun in 1839 with the spread of free common schools for white children.  From the age of ten onwards, however, white men and women received different educations.  Women were encouraged in domestic skills and were less eligible for college education.  Greensboro Female College itself was only established through the patronage of the Methodist Church, and could not have been sustained by the State.  ","Anya Jabour, in her work with the family letters of the southern slaveholding U.S. Attorney General William Wirt, exposes more of the paradoxes to female education.  While Wirt encouraged his many daughters to rigorous standards in academia, he wrote to one daughter in 1820 that an intelligent Woman may be admired but she will never be beloved. Jabour's work correlates with the notion that a female education was considered valuable only in so much as it catered to femininity rather than intellect.  In so much as women were encouraged to develop their intellect, Jabour suggests it is to the extent that doing so improved their marriage options.  Thus the efforts to elevate the female intellect seem in large part efforts to improve their capabilities as domestic entities."],"display_date":"June 4, 1847","search_date":"1847-06-04","locations":[{"id":9488,"lat":36.0793885003,"lng":-79.7889995015,"zoom":9,"place":"GUILFORD, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2455,"title":"QUIET AT THE PLAINS: Race Relations, Violence and the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-07-11","end_date":"1870-07-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The morning of July 11, 1870, was much like any other in Patona, Alabama: quiet. The city's two main roads were still, the farms and fields hot with the summer sun; the rural environment uninterrupted. The only sound for miles was that of a train barreling down the Rome and Dalton railroad.","The events both inside and outside of the train did not reflect the peace and quiet that lent itself to Patona. Earlier that morning, a fight had erupted inside the train between a white boy and a black man. The assault escalated when the train came to a stop at Patona/Cross Plains and others joined in on the fray. It was not until later in the evening that Green Little, a former slave mustered up a small army of men to continue the day's events at Cross Plains. William Luke, an Irishman, an immigrant and a Methodist minister did his best to persuade Little not to settle the score. The pistol-touting Little refused to listen and continued on as the night grew dark and sticky with the evening heat. ","Hearing the news of an imminent attack, members of the local Methodist Church began to flee. Commotion ensued, bullets whipped the wind and gunfire could be heard for miles. For 48-hours Cross Plains was in distress. Women and children sought safety while their men combated neighbors in the streets. The chaos was quieted by Major Bailey, a confederate veteran and a current administrator at the local school house. Bailey took measures to turn the prisoners over to the sheriff and the men involved in the conflict were then escorted down the tree-lined streets of Cross Plains. They were quarantined and questioned in the schoolhouse. The instigator, Green Little was no where to be found. ","The local sheriff started his questioning about the incident with William Luke who immediately admitted his role. Luke had sold the pistols to the black men of Patona, making him liable for the incident. Witnesses gathered and a disorganized trial commenced. The evening grew dark and the hour late, accordingly the trial ceased and was scheduled to resume the next day. It was at this late hour, when bystanders had returned to their homes, that local members of the Klu Klux Klan executed a vicious plan. The Klan, known for their racial hatred and violence, hid armed in the shadows as the prisoners settled in for what would be, unbeknownst to them, the last night of their lives. ","The Klansmen attacked the prisoners, hitting and dragging them down the street and well across the railroad tracks. The mob stopped upon reaching the edge of town at Prior's Station. Torches lit, ropes in hand, the Klansmen prepared to exterminate Luke and his black counterparts. Three blacks hanged first, followed by two more. Luke was allowed enough time to write his wife. In his letter, he claimed he his death was deserved and God would certainly forgive him. The executioners had been quick to kill the black men, but one of their own, Luke, white male, took consideration. Luke was hanged in a different fashion and even in death received better treatment than the black men around him. On the morning of July 12, 1870, the day following the attacks, all was reported as quiet at the Plains. ","The incident at Cross Plains exemplified the deep-seeded hatred that continued to plague certain sections of southern states. Calhoun County, Alabama was no exception. Factions of the Klu Klux Klan could be found in every former confederate state. Similar incidents, like that of Cross Plains, occurred with regularity in other areas. The Civil War may have ended in 1865, but battles continued to rage in tension filled regions of former confederate strong holds.

Prior to the Civil War, women were keepers of the home. The average, middle-class women raised the children, kept the home and prepared the meals. Both before and after the Civil War, women were subservient to men and their marriages were entirely patriarchal.","Of course, there are exceptions to every rule - George Fulgham's wife was one of them. In October of 1871, a verdict was handed down in the Fulgham vs. the State of Alabama. In this case George Fulgham's privileges and rights as a husband were in question despite his race and status. ","It was early 1871 when George Fulgham, an emancipated slave, was discovered beating his children. The discovery was made by his wife, another emancipated slave. The wife interrupted midway through the flogging. When she voiced her distress over the excessive punishment, Fulgham turned the whip on his wife, striking her twice on the back. Fulgham's wife bravely reported the incident and once in court lawyers for both the complainant, Mrs. Fulgham and the accused, Mr. Fulgham, argued a number of different points. The case focused primarily on the right of chastisement. The right of chastisement refers to a man's limited ability to discipline his wife and family. Prior to Fulgham, a husband not only had the ability to physically reprimand his spouse but he also acquired the rights to his wife's person, the value of both her paid and unpaid labor, and as well as any property that accompanied their nuptials. ","Sex and class equality certainly served as social landmarks for what was acceptable and unacceptable behavior. However, incidents in the home blurred the line between private behavior and public record. Accordingly, justices hearing the case were asked to take into account what qualified as appropriate both in and outside the home. What could be questioned about the closed-door occurrences in private quarters? The significance of class was also questioned. Citizens of lower classes, who simply did not know better, could possibly be exempt from the law due to mere ignorance. Fulgham not only recognized class and gender but race as well. Justices in the case were asked to consider whether or not black relationships were inherently different from white relationships.","The case was on appeal in the Alabama Supreme Court when it reached its final verdict as to the validity of the right of chastisement. The verdict came down on October 6, 1871, essentially in favor of the woman, Mrs. Fulgham. The court claimed that the rule of love superseded the rule of force by denying the privilege of brutality against women.","The Fulgham case, while significant for its time, proved to serve as precedent for later and similar cases at the turn of the century. The verdict provided precedent for gender equality in male and female marital relationship cases to come. Furthermore, the verdict defined the role of women in Alabama and the South on a greater scale. Through Fulgham women were endowed with the assertiveness to defend themselves against the wrong doings of not only their husbands, but society on the whole.

In October of 1879, Dr. Bryce, the superintendent, expanded his report, by including particular conditions and patient numbers, among other details. Averaging 400 patients, the hospital treated anything from pneumonia to cerebral softening to utter, indefinable insanity. The Hospital was neither gender nor racially divided. Of the 394 patients present in October of 1879, 208 were men, 186 women; 65 blacks and 329 whites. The Hospital received considerable amounts of state funding, nearly eighty-five thousand dollars in total. The funds were unrestricted and therefore used for anything from building improvements to employment benefits like free medication and services. The state not only offered funding but went so far as to appoint a special committee to examine causes of insanity, collect all pertinent information about practical ways to reform insane asylums and to ascertain details, expenses, etc. The committee's findings were positive. Officials called the care a labor of love for mankind. The committee also focused on defining particular deficiencies, namely, intemperance. Intemperance, deemed a disease by a panel of Alabama doctors, was said to have been acquired through multiple sources. Intemperance was most often contracted through habit and as the result of temptation put before the weak. The state of Alabama refused to take responsibility for those afflicted with intemperance. However, the committee returned suggesting that perhaps those infected with intemperance in the state of Alabama be secluded in a specific facility. The suggested facility would provide a place guarded from temptation and protected from danger. It would provide an environment to treat, cure and restore victims of intemperance to society. Interesting is that the symptoms of intemperance were never clearly outlined by the committee. Not to mention, the disease itself is found in no medical journals of the time. However, it is obvious through language analysis that intemperance is a condition of corruption which religious factions in Alabama sought to squash.  The question of intemperance is not nearly as alarming as the mention of the Insane Hospital in the first place. The disabled and disfigured were disregarded during the nineteenth century. People sequestered citizens with disabilities in insane asylums to distance themselves. That said, these asylums were rarely mentioned. The mere acknowledgment in the Montgomery Advertiser was a testament to the progressive nature of Alabama's social politics."],"display_date":"October 1, 1879","search_date":"1879-10-01","locations":[{"id":204,"lat":33.5726362717,"lng":-86.9006076776,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2463,"title":"Thanksgiving Day\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-11-06","end_date":"1886-11-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The November 6, 1886, edition of the <em>Goodson Gazette</em> of the Virginia Institute for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind ran the announcement by President Grover Cleveland who declared Thursday, November 25 as a day of thanksgiving and prayer.

Members of the Methodist and Baptist Churches, divided over their church's stance on the issue of slavery, quarreled over whether they should support the South's crucial institution. Agreements could not be reached, and, in 1844 and 1845, the Methodist and Baptist Churches split along sectional borders. Despite the divisions, these churches remained strong in the South. In 1850, 37.4 percent of Southerners were members of the Methodist domination. 34.6 percent attended Southern Baptist churches. Church attendance in the North, which had never been extremely high, remained below the South's. However, a religious revival occurred throughout the nation that would have effects on both regions.","During the year 1858, in the town of Portsmouth, Virginia, George Neville excitedly wrote to his cousin Nellie Newman, a resident of the nearby Isle of Wight County, regarding the current state of his town's religious community. A member of the Dinwiddie Street Methodist Episcopal Church, George Neville believed that appearances indicate that we are on the verge of a very powerful revival of religion in our city. Prayer meetings were being held four or five times daily at the Dinwiddie Church, and close to ten townspeople were converted just the night before. Furthermore, this newfound religious fervor was not limited to just Neville's congregation. Down the street at the Wesley Chapel, there were six converts and 15 penitents at last night's services, which lasted until 11 o'clock at night. Neville felt that the spirit of the Lord descended in great power upon the congregations, and that the people of Portsmouth were on their way to salvation.","This revival had wide effects around the nation as religion became more public, commercialized, and dynamic. The epicenter of the revival was New York City, as it was the nation's media hub at the time. Furthermore, church attendance was much lower in the North, causing the renewed religious interest to be more dramatic than in the South. While the revival was more active in the North, it still affected the South. Southerners believed the revival was more diversifying than unifying. The revival led people to scrutinize the principles of each denomination. As people began asking the same religious questions over slavery that had divided the Methodist and Baptist churches, the moral differences between the North and South were reinforced. With the nation aflame over slavery expansion in the West, this religious revival further agitated the nation's sectional conflict. Though George Neville's letter appears to be positive, the religious revival continued to rouse the emotions and to highlight the differences between the North and South, effects that increased sectional tension within the Union."],"display_date":"April 9, 1858 - December 31, 1860","search_date":"1859-08-20","locations":[{"id":14408,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2480,"title":"Catholicism and other denominations in the South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-08-19","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["According to Edward Ayers, religion was a Southerner's way of life and they ","often justified or condemned something based on religion.

Pickney, impressed by a Methodist overseer of slaves in Georgia, asked Reverend William Capers to acquire a Methodist exhorter to oversee his negroes in 1828.  Instead, Mr. Capers proposed that Pickney apply to the Bishop and Missionary Board for a minister to be sent as a missionary and devote his time exclusively to the religious instruction and welfare of his slaves.  Mr. Pickney agreed and soon his peers, Colonel Lewis Morris and Mr. Charles Baring, followed suit.  This system of religious instruction extended all over the state, and as a result, white Americans and African Americans often worshiped together.  Missions to the slaves developed formally in Southern religious denominations in the late 1820s and early 1830s.  Slave masters employed white missionaries to reach out to enslaved blacks throughout the South and ensured blacks minimal rights to religious worship, including the ability to worship jointly with their masters.  Even though these missionary efforts sometimes led to communal worship, the religious interests of white Americans and African Americans varied greatly.  Charles Joyner observed that slaves didn't adapt to the selective Christianity evangelized to them by their masters as much as they adapted Christianity to themselves.  In other words, whites and blacks heard different messages from Christianity.  For one, African Americans embraced the elements of Christianity that were most African such as its communal and expressive, and components.  Additionally, whereas whites believed that God divinely ordained blacks to be inferior, slaves held onto the conviction enslavement was a in total conflict with the universal love and equality that Christianity preached.Mr. Pickney's, Colonel Morris's, and Mr. Baring's eagerness to acquire a Methodist missionary for the education of their slaves supports Joyner's observation.  Educating their slaves served as a tool of domination.  The missionaries taught the slaves an interpretation of Christianity that justified the practice of slavery while giving the slaves limited rights to worship and indirectly allowing them to come up with their own interpretations of Christianity.  Slavery and Christianity were compatible in that their coexistence was of mutual benefit to both slave and master.

For the first time in ten years the hopeless invalid, Peter Smith regained mobility and began to enjoy life once more.  Cancer-free after years battling the disease, Mrs. Henry Synder experienced a full recovery.  On May 1, 1885, the <em>New York Times </em>detailed the mysterious faith cures in Birmingham with the stories of Mrs. Phillips, Mr. Smith, and Mrs. Synder.  According to the New York Times, faith healing comprised a new religion in Birmingham. While the followers drew from all Christian denominations, the majority came from the Methodist Episcopal Church.  Although religious in foundation, faith healing took on a systematic, not spiritual approach in curing various diseases.  J.E. Brierley, a local merchant, and spokesman for the Birmingham faith healers stressed to the <em>New York Times </em>that the practice involved a precise methodology.  Additionally, Brierley noted, medicines have no place in the scheme of faith healers in Birmingham.  Drugs only retard recovery from a disease and were in no cases to be used.  "," The Birmingham faith healers were an example of a growing religious movement in the South.  The Holiness movement appeared in the South during the last two decades of the nineteenth century and grew largely, though not exclusively from the Methodist church.  According to Richard T. Hughes, the Holiness church appealed to poor and disinherited southerners and emphasized physical healing.  Despite Birmingham's unrivaled iron industry and overall economic prosperity, many citizens struggled to make ends meet.  The Holiness movement spoke to these residents and found a band of faithful followers in Birmingham.  ","With an emphasis on faith healing, the Holiness movement flourished in the 1880s and into the 1890s. Many southern evangelists preached the doctrine of healing and printed accompanying testimonies.  Two southern ministers of the Methodist Episcopal Church, R.C. Oliver and L.M. Pike, compiled one such publication, The Way of Faith.  Additionally, leaders of various Christian movements traveled throughout the South at the end of the nineteenth century preaching faith healing to large audiences.  As leader of the New Testament Church of Christ, Mary Lee Wasson Harris Cagle traveled throughout the South preaching from north Alabama to Texas.  Maria Woodworth-Etter toured the South in the 1890s as well, attributing the miraculous cures of healers to the powers God.

Upon returning home to his plantation, Pitts entered in his diary, Thursday Holy day among the Jews - All places of business closed among them this day...and this is new year with them... While it remains unclear whether Pitts referred to the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, or Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish days, his observance of this Jewish tradition positively identified a Jewish population living and working in Perry County, Alabama in 1882. Pitts concluded his diary entry by listing the various goods he purchased including a brass handle and a monkey wrench. ","Jewish immigration into the South was divided into four phases from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century. Jewish immigration to Alabama began in the late nineteenth century during the third wave of Jewish settlement in the South. Abraham Mordecai was the first European Jew to travel further west of the early centers of Jewish life in Savannah and Charleston. While the exact date of his arrival is unknown, he settled in what would become Montgomery, Alabama in 1880, pushing the Jewish population further into the South. ","As Jewish immigrants continued to settle in the South, they progressively gained economic influence in society. According to social historian Ralph Melnick, the collapse of the rural plantation system transferred economic and political power to southern cities and townships. With this economic shift, the Jewish population began to earn clout working as professionals, businessmen, mill operators, commodity brokers, and farm owners. In these roles Jewish workers increased their economic status in times of relative instability throughout the South. Reconstruction and the depression of the 1890s further increased Jewish wealth as they continually offered incentives over gentile competition. Jewish business transactions were strictly cash-only, eliminating the vicious cycle of debt for the consumer and decreasing the merchants' risk of financial loss. The economic prosperity enjoyed by these southern working Jews unfortunately led to an increase of anti-Semitism and resentment across the South. ","  Between 1848 and 1980 Alabama lost half its Jewish population to bigotry and hate crimes. In 1868, the Ku Klux Klan was founded in Memphis, Tennessee and formally began its reign of terror throughout the South. In 1871, the KKK publicly murdered a Jewish shopkeeper in Memphis and established the Jewish population as a target of the organization. Though many Jews fled both Alabama and the South others remained. Despite anti-Semitic sentiments in the South, many Jewish families lingered in the region of their American roots.

No matter what denomination, he enjoyed and agreed sermons with sermons that  stressed the predetermined order of society because it confirmed his class status.  Bills wrote,  Rev. Mully preaches a full eighty minutes that God elected from all eternity certain persons to be saved a large majority to be lost. Bills expressed his belief in John Calvin's doctrine when he hoped Rev Brown of the Presbyterian Church would preach about God's chosen few. ","Rising Evangelical Christian beliefs threatened planters like John Bills who were at the top of the social hierarchy in the South.  The conflict between the two denominations began before the Civil War when evangelicals preached religious equality to women and slaves in the South.  Nat Turner's rebellion in 1831 showed that biblical inspiration could cause slaves to massacre their masters.   In the aftermath, paranoid slave owners either closely supervised their slaves religious experience or kept away from them entirely.  While lower class whites adopted the uplifting message of social mobility, large planters resented any challenge to the natural order of society.  ","Southerners adopted religion that appealed to their class-consciousness.  Unlike middle class evangelicals who were dissatisfied with elitist and hierarchical churches, Bills strongly believed that God chose certain people to succeed and a great majority to fail. Since Bills was a large slave owner before the war, his experience on the plantation revolved around divisions in race and class.   In the postwar years, the inability of his poor white and black tenant farmers to elevate their class status confirmed his belief that God ordained a natural class order.  New scientific innovation since the Enlightenment that studied the biological structures in nature validated the religious claim made by John Bills.  After the Civil War, large planters like John Bills lived in a new unstable social order caused by the declining commodity prices.  The belief that anybody could connect with God during a revival was deeply offensive to the Calvinist belief that God was outside of the human experience.  Bills and his fellow businessman adopted Calvinistic tendencies to seek validation from the church for their financial success.   Average Baptists, Presbyterians and Evangelicals, however, preached social mobility and free-will doctrines that appealed to the middle-class.

The Richmond Daily Examiner reported that the city council of Richmond now required that Hotel-keepers, restaurant owners, beer saloons, or any place that sells spirits, beer, or cider must close every day at ten o'clock at night and may not open at all on Sundays. Violators of this ordinance were subject to fines of twenty dollars a day. "," In the absence of copious amounts of potable water, Americans consumed alcohol in large quantities during the nineteenth century, becoming a strong target for social reform. Alcoholism continued to become more and more common - husbands abusing or raping their wives, drinking away all of their pay, leaving their children with nothing to eat... and eventually women had had enough. "," Women held an important role in the beginning of the temperance movement. They increasingly became discontented with their place in society. They formed prayer groups and rallied against saloons, preaching that temperance meant purity, marital stability, economic improvement and prosperity, and religious salvation. Women wanted to resettle their lives and rid society of the substance that caused such economic disparity. "," Petitioning continued. Newspapers often ran stories of bar fights, domestic violence, and street scrambles caused by alcohol. Political cartoons published in magazines such as HarpWeek, featured wives with their young children, minus their drunkard father who never returned to provide for his family, leaving them in the cold. Temperance reformers insisted on total abstinence from alcohol and demanded legal prohibition. Many brewers and liquor producers organized public campaigns against women's rights because they knew that once women had a vote, prohibition would not be far behind. "," Temperance became a fight for peace on the home front. Many women felt that their lives had been disrupted by the repercussions of alcoholism. Some Christians believed drinking was sinful against God. Families were falling apart. Something had to change. "," Richmond passed the no sale of alcohol on Sunday's law to appease those who favored prohibition. Limiting the sale of spirits was at least a step in the right direction for reducing the stresses alcohol caused. Many were angered by the passage of the bill. It decreased profits for restaurants and bar owners. Most viewed this act as the precursor to nation-wide prohibition."," Temperance began by encouraging moderate use of hard liquor, but the movement turned quickly into complete elimination. Prohibition by law became a hot topic in every political campaign at every level of government. The Prohibition Party was created to support a candidate for the prohibition efforts. Religions divided between wets and dries. Strong Methodists, Baptists, and Quakers were strongly in support of temperance, while the wets including Episcopalians and Catholics, did not believe that the government should have the power to define morality. "," The war temporarily interrupted the movement simply because everyone was preoccupied with a larger struggle. Nevertheless, after the war, the Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded in 1874 forming one of the largest woman's organizations in the world. Due-paying membership exceeded 200,000 in the late 1800s. Its message was education, if it could 'get to the children' it could create a 'dry' sentiment leading to prohibition."," Temperance was a nationwide issue after the war. Virginia was not alone in restricting the purchases of alcohol. The numbers of women who joined temperance was overwhelming, proving their rising concerns. Women slowly started to gain a voice in government and not long after in 1919, nationwide prohibition came into effect with the passage of the eighteenth amendment.

Johns requested the presence of John Ambler and his family to their Tuesday morning wedding in the area of Louisa and Hanover counties. The bride's family sent out the invitation and they requested that the Ambler family attend the wedding. The ceremony was scheduled for Tuesday morning at nine am. "," Weddings traditionally took place within the community and then the couple stayed within the community after their marriage as well. Localism and pride were major components in this society as a result of the way of life in the antebellum South. People of the antebellum South rarely knew anyone but their neighbors and stayed within their community for their entire life, even after marriage. This action brought about local pride and a close-knit community. ","Because farms and plantations were spread out, people oftentimes had to come to common areas to run errands, go to church, and just be in contact with other people. Community members were often on a first name basis with other community members because of constant interaction with each other within different aspects of the community, from seeing others at the market to arranging marriages between their families. "," Feeling a strong sense of community, people wanted to share their ceremonies and celebrations, such as the wedding invitation in the Ambler Papers, with their entire community. Many counties in the early nineteenth-century South, including Louisa and Hanover counties, did not have a regional newspaper, so many community members were invited through personalized invitations. The family of the bride used invitations as a way of announcing the celebration since they could not put an advertisement in the newspaper."," Connecting families within a county was a major theme in early nineteenth century marriages and many people strove to do this as often as possible to pull their assets together to create more land, more enslaved people and ultimately more profit. The marriage between Helen Lane and Arthur Johns was a community event in which many people would have shared the event with them; they were also combining their resources. British law transplanted itself into antebellum southern society in terms of marriage. Once a woman got married, she gave over all of her property rights to her new husband and he could then earn income off of her land as well as his. The parents of the bride literally gave their daughter away. She is transferred from being inferior in one family to being inferior in another, except with the responsibility of running a household. "," This marriage between the Johns and Lane family demonstrates a way of life within the planter class of the Antebellum South. The ceremony would have brought the community together to celebrate the uniting of two community families. The wedding would have been the place to be because most people in the small community would have been invited and there would have been nothing else for the community members to do.

They sent flowers down to the representatives who were supportive of temperance and prayed together that it would pass. After the bill passed, the women made sure that they were on record saying that the Women's Christian Temperance Union [was] bitterly opposed to the wine and cider clause and really was aiming for complete prohibition. Thus, the women in this group were successful in getting temperance put in place but did not achieve total prohibition.","Evangelism had an important impact on society in Georgia during this time period. Christian women had joined together to form the Women's Christian Temperance Union to try to promote temperance in society. As Cooper and Terill noted in their book, <em>The American South: A History</em>, Southern women formed groups within their religious organizations and used them as a means for protest and actions against a whole range of social ills. The Christian women in Georgia began their social protest against alcohol. Jeannie Whayne writes in her chapter that the historian Anne Firor Scott thought that the formation of women's groups allowed them more power and the ability to influence movements in the Progressive Era. Thus, women were beginning to play a larger role in society and were beginning to impact their government. Instead of allowing men to make all of their legal decisions for them and staying within the realm of the household, women were joining groups together and influencing legislation. According to Whayne's chapter, the historian Jean Friedman feels that the evangelical nature of society initially hindered women in their pursuit for more gender equality since, for example, women had to give all fundraising revenue to the men in the church. It is significant that Southern women were able to overcome the patriarchal practices of the South in order to form women's groups that could influence the government. Women were forced to take a more active role in their households after their communities were destroyed in the war. This activity carried out of their households and into the community and even politics.

It is also undetermined if the church members were free people."," The church notes documenting the business of the Guilfield Baptist church began in the 1820s.  This was a time when the United States was undergoing a religious revival, called the Great Awakening.  This movement made protestant religions, such as Methodist and Baptist, very popular among whites as well as African Americans.  Prior to this period religious dialogue between whites and African Americans was for slaves to obey their masters as the bible instructed.  In many areas African Americans became active in integrated services and became morally or spiritually equal to whites, who believed that all men were sinners.   African Americans may have taken ownership of these protestant religions for many reasons beyond a growing acceptance in some congregations.  The revivalist trend in the Great Awakening was similar to the African religious ceremonies which frequently had highly emotional praise, congregational responses, as well as sprinkling or dipping with water for initiation. Due to the Great Awakening, some congregations embraced African Americans in a more equal capacity, however most Southern congregations did not.  In the later congregations African Americans who gained confidence through religion proved to be a threat to whites.  In the first half of the nineteenth century, several slave rebellions in the South were divinely inspired.  Two famous religious conspiracies were lead by Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner.

Farmers are so crippled that they cannot buy as much as usual of the fertilizers made of the phosphate 'rock,' which is one of the chief products of South Carolina . . . War, fire, cyclones and earthquake have terribly tried the birthplace of the Rebellion.

There were 267 marriages in that year alone, the most occurring in December with 63 marriages. April was the most unpopular month taking only 11 marriages. In 1891 a girl married at the age of 13, which showed that the year 1891 was starting off at a fast pace and that marriage rates did not seem to be declining. "," Marriage rates were increasing not only in Virginia but all over the South as well. According to Margaret Farley, marriage functioned to determine relationships between families, establish inheritance lines, create and reinforce gender roles, circumcise sexual activity, determine rights and duties in sexual relations, and provide for the legitimacy and rearing of children. Marriage had long since changed from being for meeting the needs of families and kinship groups-economic, political, and social needs to the need for love and affection. Marriage for convenience and for other reasons, such as land acquirement and the joining of families, still occurred, but the primary purpose shifted. "," Marriage became very important after the war and it became closely tied with religion. Marriage rates increased as Accomack showed in 1890. Many men chastised themselves for having impure thoughts of women and thought that the Holy Spirit should be directing all their thoughts. The thought at this time was that God would provide everything you needed, and one should long for anything but be comforted that God is always there.

Vernon Association of the Union had traveled to hear this discourse in honor of Christianity, and how George Washington had been an example of this. At the home church of George Washington, Mr. Slaughter spoke of the greatness of the Christianity in the life of George Washington and how he was brought up with this faith that led him to lead the country so well and as such a beloved leader. As a Christian, His first wish...is to see the whole world at peace and its inhabitants one band of brothers..."," This speech inspired the ladies of the church to remember how important their faith was to the success of the United States, even one hundred years after its founding. They were reminded once again it was important for them to continue to teach their faith to their family and children as well as to other family members. Not only were all these women convinced to teach their faith to those close to them such as their families, but speeches like this also inspired them to be evangelistic in their communities and to set standards of respectability for all those who observed their actions."," One of the parts of southern society was to identify what social status a person belonged to. Donald G. Mathew writes that in order to define their social status, people would participate in things such as religious gatherings. The church in this time period was a place of worship as well as a place to display the status of your family. This type of meeting was important for women, who were the majority of church members then, not only because it showed their status and wealth in society but also because they were provided an opportunity for education.

McConnell, 647 black men chose to enlist in the First Arkansas Infantry and their Union patriotism is evident in this song.Black soldiers fought in the same war, and they deserved the same respect.The Song of the First Arkansas recognizes their patriotism, bravery, and desire to end slavery in order to attain rights and equality in their nation."," The enslaved people were eager to end slavery, recognizing that the myth of the patriarchy of slaveholders was false.The song illustrates how incorrect the pro-slavery argument that slaves benefited the most from slavery.The lyrics show white slaveholders' oppression of black emancipation, describing When we heard de proclamation, massa hush it as he will.Yet, these black soldiers took the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 literally and wanted to fight to emancipate the slaves of all the southern slaveholding states.According to McConnell, songs in the Civil War evoked enthusiasm and motivated soldiers to fight.The black soldiers remembered the oppression of their fellow blacks and had even more reason to stand up for the abolitionist cause.According to John O. Allen and Clayton E.

Delivered by Benjamin Morgan Palmer of the First Presbyterian Church, this sermon advocated southern secession in defense of its providential trust to perpetuate slavery. Palmer believed that slaves were by nature incapable of self government and dependent upon their masters for protection. Dr. Palmer's reasoning is sound, sensible, and Christian to Wadley who yearned for the South's fighting for the patriarchal cause of slavery. Dr. Palmer justified slavery through the patriarchy of a white slaveholder who protected the dependent slave. Wadley's opinions were typical of the Lower South during the days after Abraham Lincoln's presidential election, and sectionalism grew quickly and passionately, even in women's minds. According to Samuel S. Hill and Charles H. Lippy, Palmer's sermons on slavery, namely this famous oration, led to his position as the elected moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States of America. Wadley listened to Palmer with attentiveness and respect; she, like many other white southerners, believed in the doctrine of slavery as a divine right from God granted to the South. Wadley relates another sermon from a Dr. Lord, which summarizes the mistaken piety of abolitionists in their attempts to emancipate enslaved people from southern masters. Dr. Lord derived his preaching from Isaiah, and he condemned those who setting up their own judgement and their own code of morals instead of religion, and the scriptures, condemn that which has been sanctioned both by the bible, and by ancient usage. This sermon reflects the religious doctrine of southern clergymen prior to and possibly during the Civil War.

In 1881, Talladega  County proposed a vote on the outlaw of alcohol consumption and the African American population allegedly voted in a bloc against the prohibition. The article blamed the African American population for the failure of passing prohibition in the county.  As the surrounding counties of Clay, Calhoun, St. Clair, and Shelby had previously outlawed the sale of alcohol, the Christians of Talladega County feared their county would be overrun with the scum and scuff of the other counties if they did not enact the same prohibition.  The Baptists of Talladega County greatly feared the community would become a cesspool of drinking and crime, as the only county in the area to permit alcohol sale and consumption.  Thus, the Baptists of Talladega County beseeched the community to protect their region from alcohol consumption and its consequences by outlawing alcohol trafficking in the county.","The <em>Christian Index</em> emphasized the depraved nature of drunkenness and the tendency for indulgence in spirits to encourage crime and lewd behavior, suggesting that those who consumed alcohol were depraved criminals and delinquents.  Thus, the article's accusation that the African American community voted in a bloc against the prohibition measure suggested that African Americans were depraved for their desire to drink alcohol or protect the right to do so.  As they vehemently condemned alcohol consumption, the <em>Christian Index </em>rebuked the African Americans in Talladega County for their part in the prohibition's failure.","The Baptists' fear of Talladega County's inevitable degeneration through alcohol consumption supports historian Robert Handy's argument that nineteenth-century Baptists believed that drunkenness was the cardinal sin of the land.  According to Handy, total prohibition was the primary and ultimate Southern Baptist position by the 1880's.  Historian Edward Ayers also argues that whites believed blacks were swing voters on the issue of prohibition, but black voters did not actually vote consistently against prohibition. The article portrays whites' view of African Americans as swing voters, as the writer condemned the African Americans for altering the outcome of the election.  Ayers argues that whites gave black voters a great deal of credit when dry forces won because of their perception of blacks as swing voters.  Nevertheless, the black voters were also held responsible when the dry forces lost.

Sharp concealed her pregnancy until the birth, attempting to protect her reputation for as long as possible. When her father discovered her secret, he erupted in anger and demanded vengeance upon the man who impregnated her. She initially refused to reveal the name of her child's father, but eventually revealed that her impregnator was Thomas Nation, a Mormon convert who was her sister's husband. Mr. Sharp rushed to Nation's house, threatening to kill his son-in-law and then himself. Upon arriving at Nation's residence, Sharp discovered the dead body of his other daughter, as she had perished that same day in the delivery of her own child. Meanwhile, Nation realized his adultery had been discovered, and he fled from his home and his wife's corpse. After the funeral of his daughter, Mr. Sharp offered a 100 reward for Nation's arrest and the entire community joined in the hunt for the villain. Nation was eventually discovered with two other Mormons on a train going to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The sheriff of Catoosa County sent a deputy to pursue Nation, and they arrested him as he stepped off the train in Chattanooga on August 13, 1880.","It is impossible to determine whether Martha Sharp's intercourse with Thomas Nation was forced or consensual. Nonetheless, Sharp possessed much shame about her pregnancy. Her father's reaction to the incident reveals the severity that nineteenth-century southern society bestowed upon such a scandal. The fact that Mr. Sharp was willing to kill his son-in-law and then end his own life, suggests that Sharp lost all desire to live because of his family's disgrace. However, the community blamed Nation's membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as the reason for the scandal, accusing Nation's religious associations as the cause for the Sharp family's problems.","The <em>National Police Gazette'</em>s article on the scandal supports historian Sarah Barringer Gordon's claim that most Americans of the nineteenth century believed the Latter Day Saints were an uncivilized and barbaric religious group. According to Gordon, anti-Mormon and anti-polygamy Americans argued that no civilized group could disagree about the fundamental question of domestic relations, declaring the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to be an inhumane, undemocratic, and un-American church. The article supports Gordon's argument, as the story castigated Nation more for his Mormon affiliation than for his adultery. Nation was, in fact, practicing adultery with his wife's sister and was not practicing polygamy. However, the article and community emphasized Nation's crime as a Mormon polygamy problem, rather than a problem of morality in general. The article's attack on the Latter Day Saints displays the Protestant community's desire to frame the incident as an isolated Mormon problem, rather than a moral problem that breeched religious divides.

Before his move to Alabama, Walton aided African Americans in Southern Missouri and hoped to soon retire from his missionary work.  However, Walton attended the Quaker Illinois Yearly Meeting, which inspired him to resume his responsibilities as a teacher of underprivileged African American children.  Walton stated that he heard both the African Americans and his Heavenly Father calling him to assist the destitute.  Walton organized two First-Day Schools in Stevenson without public school funds.  He repaired the schoolhouse, provided new books for the pupils, and personally paid for many of the students' tuition fees.  Walton temporarily refused a salary in order to lighten the financial burden of the African American families.  Walton personally financed the education of orphans and the children of indigent parents who were unable to work because of sickness.  On November 17, Walton wrote a letter to the Quaker journal, the <em>Friends' Intelligencer</em>, requesting aid for his school, asking for donations of Bibles or Testaments, juvenile reading books, First-Day school books, tracts, and papers.  ","Walton emphasized the religious aspect of his work with African Americans, underscoring the belief that God called him to help the mentally, religiously, and financially impoverished children of Stevenson.  In his letter to the<em> Friends' Intelligencer,</em> Walton wrote that his work often caused him mental and physical hardship, arguing that hardship was necessary for fostering spiritual growth.  Walton also implored the <em>Friends' Intelligencer</em> readership to sacrifice for the sake of others, saying that religious work should not be confined to those with great ministerial gifts, but should be employed by all Christians.","Walton's sacrifice for the African American community in Stevenson, Alabama supports historian Edward Ayers' argument that those who took Christianity seriously recognized equality among believers and often developed a feeling of fellowship and tolerance towards others.  As Ayers argues that some people within churches tried to reach across racial divides, Walton broke through those divides by teaching the needy children of Alabama. Walton felt great tolerance and even love for his schoolchildren, as he perceived his work as a call from God to help the children plagued by injustice.  In addition, Walton's experience fulfills what historian Robert Handy calls the most significant development in evangelical volunteerism in the post-Civil War era: the growth of Sunday school work lead by lay teachers.  Walton's principal distinction was his expansion of this pattern of Sunday school teaching to African American children in Alabama.

McIvers then commented on various aspects of the institution, writing about how pleased he was with the multiple economic demographics represented in the first class. He also explained his philosophies on discipline and administration, believing that the female students should be treated as a self-governing body and made responsible for maintaining and upholding various rules such as curfew and study hours. He believed it had been working very well, and was delighted with the outcome. McIvers then discussed the role of religion in the institution, and mentioned that several women have organized a Young Women's Christian Association, and others attend a Bible class once a week.

In 1891, McIver and his supporters joined forces with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), and a smaller group called the King's Daughters to crusade for a vocational school for white women. It was a success, and the State Normal and Industrial School was built in 1892.

Additionally, the Assembly introduced a new test of membership, influenced by the social pressures of the public. The test severed the strong ties of the Presbyterian Brotherhood by supporting someone whom many Southerners regarded as the ruthless tyrant in the North.

The Southern assembly observed that slavery ?is one difference which so radically distinguishes the North and the South that it is becoming more apparent everyday that the religious, as well as the secular, interests of both will be more effectively promoted by a complete and lasting separation.?","After the Civil War, many Southerners could not accept the fundamental terms of the Presbyterian Church of the United States of America. The Northern and Southern branches conflicted over the role of women and the church in politics, and over the race question.

The Presbyterian Clergyman was wounded but was expected to recover.  In Athens, the Southern Banner reported this incident stating that though they did not know the details, they feel fully justified in saying that no provocation whatever, was given by [Mr. Davis], to cause this outrage.","Travelers through the antebellum South faced many dangers. Among the most frightening to white travelers was the possibility of coming into contact with Indians. In the 1830?s, the threat of Indian attacks was heightened as a result of President Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act and the treaties that followed.  During this period, Jackson used treaties to try to force Indians of the five nations that resided in the southeastern United States - the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chicasaw and Seminole - to migrate west. While some Indians agreed to move, others resisted Jackson's efforts and chose to stay. Most of the population of both the Creeks and the Cherokees would have remained in Georgia and Alabama in 1835 when Davis was traveling. Without protection against land hungry white settlers, though, the Indians that stayed often lost their land and were left destitute. Frustrated with their situation and angry with Jackson and their white neighbors for trying to force them off of their land, Indians were known to steal from and attack white neighbors and passers-by. ","In its report of this incident, the Athens' <em>Southern Banner </em>implied that the Indian attacker was unprovoked in the outrage he or she committed. The article did not consider the probable outrage the Indian felt at the marginalization and poverty he or she faced. In hindsight, the title of the article, Indian Outrage, might be read as an outraged Indian taking out his frustration over the actions of President Jackson. As this article's perspective shows, white southerners at this time lacked such sympathy for the Indians. The same lack of sympathy was visible in the incident of the Trail of Tears, when Indian nations were forced to migrate and walk across the South to new homes. ","The aggression that existed between white southerners and the Indians was both a result of and a contributor to the theories of rationalizing the forced migration.  President Jackson argued that the Indians would be better off in the Western lands where they would not have to face attacks from white southerners.  This theory that it would be better for the Indians if they moved, created even less sympathy in white southerners towards those who chose to stay."],"display_date":"January 15, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-15","locations":[{"id":1654,"lat":33.8831653504,"lng":-83.4095667489,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2796,"title":"The Church and the Irreconcilable Differences between Protestants and Catholics\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-10-05","end_date":"1879-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" October 5, 1879 was a Sunday, and the weather was beautiful and bright as the many religious people of Danville, VA, walked to church to attend the hour-long service that morning. Later that night, at the Main Street Methodist Church in downtown Danville, Rev. P.A. Peterson delivered a speech called The Primacy of St. Peter, according to the Catholic Church. To a packed audience which was deeply interested in the subject, he highlighted the irreconcilable differences between the Catholic Church and the Protestant church. Rev. Peterson explained how the Catholic Church's attitude towards Peter was that Christ had made him the supreme authority on earth as the rock of the church. Since Catholics believed in the uninterrupted secession from Peter to the Popes of today, the Catholic Church owed the popes its allegiance. In response to this view, Rev. Peterson argued that while Peter was pre-eminent and of supreme personal character, there was no divine designation of Peter as the supreme authority of the church. Therefore, according to Peterson, the Catholic Church and the Protestant church are irreconcilable, since Protestant claims make Catholic Church structure void and superstitious. While Catholics saw authority in the Pope, Protestants saw the only authority as Christ. In Peterson's mind, these two beliefs were irreconcilable. Peterson compared the two churches to separate empires, presided over by different rulers and laws. "," It is clear that religion and attending church were extremely important to the people of Danville. Citizens took pride in their church buildings and especially in the number of young people who attended church. The fact that so many people in Danville were interested in the conflict between Protestants and Catholics shows the serious implications that their faith had on their lives. Southerners in general took pride in their religion. Southern religion was largely Protestant, and many Southerners strove to keep their religion pure and away from perversions such as Catholicism and Judaism, which in Southerners' minds had influenced the North. Religious division had been a constant part of American life through political parties and economic opportunity. Religious division also reflected ethnic division, since most of the new immigrants coming to the United States in this time period were Roman Catholics. Immigrants were often competing with other whites for jobs, especially in the industrial sector. These immigrants were regarded with suspicion and unease, and two different faiths did nothing to ease the tension. In the North, Catholics were a socially marginalized majority who were gaining influence. The South did not want the same. This sermon's reminder of the inherent differences between Catholicism and Protestantism cemented beliefs that many southerners already had about their brothers in Christ. Catholics were obviously not at the same level of exclusion as blacks or even Jews, but there was a distinct difference between the two faiths.

Brookes wrote a letter to his father, Iveson Brookes, from his school in Penfield, Georgia in 1839.  Walker was most likely a student of the relatively new Baptist institution, Mercer University. In his letter, he told his father of the large number of baptisms that had taken place recently. He reported that 13 boys at Mercer and 24 girls at the Penfield Female Academy, which was organized by the Mercer administration, had been baptized. Walker's reason to write this letter, though, was not to report these events but to ask his father for permission to be baptized himself. Iveson Brookes was a Baptist minister so Walker probably had little doubt that his father would approve of his baptism. Yet he still felt it was his duty, as he says, to formally consult with his father beforehand. Walker told his father when he wrote, I gave in my experience before the Church and they say that they were altogether satisfied with it. He was ready to go through with this religious ritual as soon as he got the approval of his father.  ","Mercer University was part of a wave of denominational colleges founded in the South during the nineteenth century. Founded in 1833 with the name Mercer Institute, by the Georgia Baptist Convention, the college, like most Baptist colleges of the period, was located in a rural area of Georgia.  The founding of the college also marked the founding of Penfield, the newly formed town where it was located.  Denominational colleges like Mercer were founded by Baptists, Presbyterians and Methodists throughout the South and by the 1850's dominated higher education in the region.","Though looking back these colleges are often looked down upon as being conservative and overly traditional, at the time they were pushing the boundaries of education.  When compared to contemporary state universities, the curricula of denominational colleges differed greatly and in many ways more closely resembled modern liberal arts curricula.  State colleges in the mid- nineteenth century were focusing on practical education to improve technology and science. The schools founded by evangelicals, on the other hand, studied a greater amount of classical languages, literature, and religion in addition to participating in useful activities like farming.  The religious organizations began to found these educational institutions both because of an ideological belief in education, and for the practical reason of increasing clergy and training future religious leaders. Despite their strong sectarian foundations, the students of these institutions were often more diverse because they would pull from the local community regardless of religion. Relative to state universities, the denominational colleges were inexpensive and less elitist, often drawing students from the middle classes. ","Along with providing a less aristocratic and expensive college choice, denominational colleges appealed to parents by presenting themselves as providing strong morals for their students. In this letter, though, we can see that the family still held the most power in moral and religious decisions.  Even if the school or the school community encouraged students to be baptized, the family was the final decision maker."],"display_date":"May 1, 1839 - May 30, 1839","search_date":"1839-05-15","locations":[{"id":1850,"lat":33.5789538766,"lng":-83.1662400397,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2812,"title":"Zillah&#39;s Sacrifice\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-09","end_date":"1863-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Zillah Haynie Brandon, wife of a plantation owner in Sumter, Alabama, relied on her devout Christian beliefs to see her through life's trials and tragedies. As the proud mother of two Confederate soldiers, James and Hines, Zillah found strength in her Bible. In her diary, Zillah wrote of her fear for her sons' safety and her pride in their dedication to the Confederate struggle for independence, but always found comfort in God's words. When both James and Hines were killed in service in late 1862, Zillah's worst fears were realized. On January 9, 1863, she wrote in her diary that the remains of our dear sons...reached home last Monday 5th of January 1863. Zillah's unwavering Christian faith consoled her and she explained that although I wept sore and do weep yet I know that in our heavenly Father's house are many mansions. It was a comfort to Zillah to know that her sons shared her religious devotion. Reverend S.S. Russell, a soldier who fought along side of James and Hines, reassured Zillah that he could testify that they had been living demonstrations that men by the grace of God could live Christians under any circumstances.","Religion was of great importance to southerners like Zillah. According to the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</em>, evangelical denominations provided education to women prior to the Civil War. Because religion was so closely tied to knowledge, women were especially religious in the South. After the Great Awakening of the nineteenth century (religious revivals in the South), evangelical Christianity became a bedrock of southern culture. The impact was felt even stronger by women because religion was family oriented. Women like Zillah raised their children according to their religious beliefs, and in Zillah's case, those beliefs were devout. Religion was also somewhat of an equalizer; women and men were equal in God's eyes in terms of sin. Women were free to ask for forgiveness of their sins just as men were.","To Zillah Brandon and women like her, religion was not just a matter of church on Sunday.

Her parents had thrown her out of their house when they discovered she was pregnant, and while she had tried to seek refuge at several other houses, she was repeatedly refused, and the barn was her only option for shelter as she gave birth. The child, however, did not survive, and died shortly after its delivery. The young mother picked up her baby's body and tried to walk to a nearby house, but fainted on the way over, and was found by the family who owned the barn. They called in Dr. Martin, but he could not save the mother who suffered from hypothermia and an excessive loss of blood. She died the following day. Davie Times, a resident of the town where Graves died, heard this sad story and wrote the Salisbury Truth in order to comment on what he believed was the family's and neighbors' terrible and inhuman behavior. He was shocked that an event like this could take place in a Christian community. "," Whether or not the people Times considered responsible for Graves' death were apprehended and punished is unknown. What is known, however, is that Graves' premarital pregnancy reflected an issue in the South that provoked much controversy, particularly in the late 19th century. Patriarchal society was firmly entrenched at this time as well as the notion that all Southern women were pious, gentle, and modest daughters, wives, and mothers. North Carolinian law reinforced this concept, making a woman legally bound to reveal the name of her illegitimate baby's father. The local government would then force him to provide money for child support if need be, ensuring that neither the mother nor child would not become a ward of the state. The mother's punishment usually varied from a monetary fine to a damaged reputation, a simple notion with heavy penalties in a society that placed emphasis on the purity and innocence of respectable women. "," By the end of the 19th century, premarital pregnancy was steadily decreasing as the structure and sexual repression of the Victorian era began tightened. According to historians Daniel Scott and Michael Hindus, an upsurge in religious activity also lowered the number of premarital pregnancies at this time, especially in the South where the evangelical movement of the Social Gospel was strongest. A woman who was guilty of fornication and bastardy would have sullied not only her reputation but her family's as well, claims historian Victoria Bynum, and therefore it was not uncommon for people like the Graves to refuse to accommodate their daughter during a premarital pregnancy since they were regarded as social pariahs and outsiders. However, while a stronger religious presence in the South led to more stringent moral policies and a reduction in pregnancy out of wedlock, it also defined Christian morals and values more clearly. This new and strengthened Christian community made the Graves and their neighbors' actions look like sins as they failed to forgive the young woman and treat her with compassion that the Bible extols. The parallels between her story and the Biblical story of the birth of Jesus (Mary and Joseph being rejected from several inns, only to find shelter in a manger where she gave birth to the baby Jesus) only reinforced this notion. However, while Times' reaction to this event was supported by countless other people, many Southern communities continued to spurn and reject those young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.

Augusta was near the plantation Iveson was managing for his son in Jasper and Jones counties.  We can tell from the letter that Iveson and P.B. were not particularly involved in each others' lives because P.B. took much of the letter to update Iveson about events in his family over the past few years. Despite this relatively weak relationship between the cousins, P.B. asked Iveson, would you act the part of a Father in watching over his morals. To P.B. extended family would be an important source of security for his son if he chose to move far away from his parents. ","This instance in the life of the Brookes shows that the family, and more specifically male patriarchs, was responsible for inculcating moral values. In addition, for Iveson to play the part of the father he would make sure that his nephew was kept in line and disciplined.  At other times and places different people and institutions held the important responsibility of keeping watch over the discipline and moral education. At this moment in the South, this responsibility was undergoing a shift from the church back toward the family.  Church records reflect that over the course of the 1830's churches were beginning to give up power to the family. They shifted pew organization from gender-segregated to family-friendly and reduced the amount that they disciplined their members.","In their book Paternalism in a Southern City, Edward Cashin and Glenn Eskew show how patriarchal power relates to and results from the plantation system and the Great Awakening. They argued that even outside of plantations themselves, southern society was based on the plantation system.  In this system it was the patriarch who was in control.  The plantation system allowed the man to stay at the house as a controlling figure. During this period in the North women were often left to manage the house while their husbands were at work.

Instead of waiting to have a beautiful, quaint wedding in her hometown, she eloped to Bristol with her fiance John Christian. John Christian was the son of Mr. Camilus Christian, a prominent banker in Lynchburg. Neither family was excited about the match. The primary reason for their delay of the wedding was because of how young the couple was. However there was also rumored to be tensions between the two families, for unknown reasons. So, instead of waiting for the blessing from her family, Miss Lizzie Hutter and her fiance fled by rail to Brisol, Virginia, and then went on a honeymoon touring the southern states. This scandal made it into the local paper, primarily because of the shock of such a perfect girl doing something so inappropriate. "," In Southern society, the ideal Southern woman was a young lady who was submissive, weak, modest, beautiful, innocent and self-denying. She supported her family and her husband and sacrificed everything for their sakes. This ideal also upheld the white male duty to protect white ladies from harm (especially from black men). By all accounts, Lizzie Hutter was the epitome of that woman. Hutter's elopement was newsworthy because of her status in society. She had all the training and all the experience and was no outcast; everyone loved her. Yet she chose to elope and break the rules of her society, which is completely uncharacteristic of a southern belle. Even in the midst of her elopement however, there was sympathy towards her decision. The quarrels between the families were petty. Her elopement probably did not completely estrange her from her family entirely, but she definitely took a risk since she was being disobedient.

The Michigan fields are being heavily drawn upon, while the crop in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin is eminently encouraging, thus relieving fears of an ice shortage. This was especially good news for Mr. Beasly of Crystal Springs, Mississippi, who ten years earlier had build an ice-house in his town in order to supply his neighbors with ice. Beasly had recognized that the ice trade was not only extremely important to warmer climate areas, such as Mississippi and much of the South, but also could be very profitable.","By the 1800s, of ice harvesting had been around for centuries. According to world-renown ice-historian Mariana Gosnell, the so-called ice craze really started in Boston, when a man named Frederick Tudor, in the manner of a drug pusher, set out [in 1805] to create a taste for cold that would get customers hooked. Over the next few decades, Tudor and his foreman Nathaniel Wyeth succeeded in refining the mass cultivation and shipping processes of ice. Harvesting the ice from the fields, which were, in fact, very, very much more than frozen over lakes and ponds, became an intricate and precisely designed process. According to Gosnell, once a thick layer of ice formed over a field, it would be scraped clean, shined, and then carved into a checker pattern of large ice blocks with a single bladed plow. Using saws the blocks were cut free and then, using large pike poles, floated through a carved out channel to a collection area. Although one might think this process would eventually dry out the lake or pond being used, the process apparently removed from a 400-square-foot ice field...each year [an amount of water that is] less than the total amount of water that evaporates from the surface of the very same lake during a single hot summer day. Much less. ","Thus, despite the ice machine's invention as early as 1850 and emergence of ice plants, neither of which were in widespread usage (religious skepticism being one of the reasons against), Tudor and others that had caught on began to sell ice in massive quantities literally all over the world. In fact, according to Gosnell, for years [in the nineteenth century] ice was America's second-biggest crop by weight to be transported by trains and ships, with the first being cotton. Much of that weight undoubtedly went through the South, not only for the preservation of foods, but also because no self respecting Southerner would drink his bourbon warm or her Dom Perignon above the temperature of 38 degrees Farenheit, excepting, perhaps, Jill Masterson.","Upon receiving a shipment of ice, a southern city or town would store it in pits, caves, or trenches underground; in cavities mostly underground but with roofs, or entry structures above ground; or entirely above ground, in insulated houses. Judging by the blurb in the Crystal Springs Monitor, Mr. Beasly's construction was most likely the latter, and was probably painted white to reflect sunlight and to make it look more like an igloo. Between its outer and inner walls there would be some type of insulation, be it tanners, bark, charcoal, sawdust, hay, straw, [or] shavings. With the proper construction, Beasly would be able to maintain approximately 70-90 percent of his stored ice, sometimes for many years. Nevertheless, as the 1890 Clarion Ledger blurb referred to a possible ice famine in the summer, Beasly and the area his business supplied were most likely in want of a fresh shipment."],"display_date":"March 13, 1890 - December 31, 1890","search_date":"1890-08-06","locations":[{"id":7008,"lat":31.8692302776,"lng":-90.4488242966,"zoom":9,"place":"COPIAH, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2855,"title":"Views on the Coming of War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-06-01","end_date":"1861-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1861, the Civil War began in the United States. Susan Brardford Eppes was a teenager in the deep South and responded to this event with intense sorrow. She knew that war had arrived, and she knew war would change everything. In her initial response, Susan discussed the burden now facing the southern people. Everyone in the South had to be a part of the fight. Her support and sadness for the South then moved toward anger with the North. She said that the North brought the war to the South; southerners did not want to fight. However, when the North chose war, the South could not turn away. Susan then took comfort in her knowledge that the Christian God, the God of Battles, would help the people of the South. ","As sectional tendencies developed throughout the 1850s, southerners became increasingly proud of who they were. It became an honor to be southern, and some southerners even worked to create elaborate legacies. When the issue of secession came into play upon the election of Lincoln, leaders used rhetoric encouraging the men of the South to protect their honor. Men could not stand by idly when the North attacked the southern way of life. Susan commented on the importance of honor by saying that no southerner would back away from a fight. Susan also strongly believed that the North was at fault. In her mind and those of many others, the North antagonized the South. The North refused to accept the South and its use of slavery. This continual attack on southern culture made it impossible for southern men of honor to turn their backs to the growing conflict. ","People of the Confederacy believed very strongly that God was on their side. They believed this because their cause was just, and they were true, honorable Christians. Religion and scripture not only justified the cause but also preserved it. For example, General Stonewall Jackson and General Robert E. Lee continually prayed with their men and reminded them to hold true to their beliefs. Susan believed fervently that God was on her side and the side of the South. This was the case because the North forced the South into an unnecessary war to defend southern honor. Though she was young at the time, Susan's interpretation of the war around her was demonstrative of the overall atmosphere and set of beliefs contagious throughout the South.

According to the Clarion Ledger Jackson had been selected as the site of the Mary Holmes school for the colored people, despite protests of many newspapers and citizens. They did not, however, formally attempt to stop the project, as it was, according to Samuel Rogal's account of Holmes' educational ministry, a only seminary founded by a white woman working with a white staff and a white faculty to educate young Black girls in the domestic arts. Thus, a service to consecrate the twenty acres of ground acquired for the seminary occurred at Jackson, Mississippi, on 24 December 1891 with no protest from the locals. The school officially opened on September 28, 1892, and was dedicated to Mary Emilie Holmes's mother on October 12 of that same year.","At first glance, establishing such a school seems to be an incredible achievement. Mary Holmes, who was trained first at Rockford Female Seminary and later at the University of Michigan and was the first woman to receive a doctorate in the earth sciences, had succeeded in establishing a school for black young women in the heart of the Deep South. After benefiting Swift Memorial College in Rogersville, Tennessee and Monticello Academy in southeastern Arkansas, despite resistance from white communities in the areas (especially in Tennessee), Holmes's commitment and mission to the education of black children, principally females, which she saw fit to channel through the missionary arms and agencies of the Presbyterian Church, had paid off for a third time. Not only that, but within only twenty-six months, Holmes and her father had enlisted the direct assistance of the Board of Missions for Freedmen of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.; of local Home Missionary societies; of the Woman's Board of Home Missions in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, and New York; of the Balck communities of Jackson; and of individual families in Rockford. It is no small wonder that whites in Jackson were not outraged at such an institution.","The reason for this, however, is that perhaps Mary Holmes's school was not such an achievement after all, as the curriculum emphasized courses of instruction in sewing, mending, cooking, laundry, and general housekeeping, almost [guaranteeing] that her charges would never rise beyond the various states of domestic service. Furthermore, it seems that Mary Emily [sic] Holmes...simply avoids the issue of racial segregation in the Deep South. She accepts it (although perhaps not agreeing with it) as a fact of life and goes about her business. Therefore, because she was not directly challenging the status quo, the whites of Jackson (and later West Point after the original establishment burned down in 1895) tolerated the existence of a school educating young black women.","Yet, Mary Holmes was indeed a pioneer and did in a way challenge the status quo. Mary Emily [sic] Holmes... stood above (or at least beyond) her generation of American educators by promoting the notion that education would certainly prove beneficial to every American Youngster, no matter what his or her social, economic, or racial classification. With this motivation, she attempted to teach young women something, no matter how seemingly inconsequential, that would lift them from the moral, mental, physical, and spiritual degradation which had been the background of the race for 250 years; through her Presbyterian missions and schools, she gave black women a reason to hope for something beyond the racial boundaries set for them by society, which was especially important in Mississippi. In this way, she attempted to fulfill in them her motto and her educational-evangelical mission: Not to seem, but to be."],"display_date":"November - December 1891","search_date":"1891-11-30","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2900,"title":"Military and Social Subordination\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-11-23","end_date":"1853-11-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Richard Yeadon was a man who rarely minced words. In speaking to the Calliopean and Polytechnic Societies at the Citadel Academy in Charleston in 1853, Yeadon took the opportunity to address the audience on what would happen if higher institutions in South Carolina did not maintain strict discipline among their pupils.","Stemming from God, Order is the great law of nature, whereas Insubordination or rebellion was the primal sin, which drove [man] from Paradise. In the United States, Yeadon noted, order takes the place of the sword of power, pervading, ruling, and harmonizing our political system, which leads to the people of the United States literally reveling in the enjoyment of a political Eden, a national Paradise. But he cautioned, without order, we would be torn by civil dissensions, beyond all other nations, as the necessary result of our division into separate States...and we would soon behold our great and glorious Union, now covering a continent with its nationality and with the ample folds of our starry banner, broken into warring fragments, unable to command peace at home or respect abroad, and a derision and a by-word among nations. ","Yeadon's was a timely lesson. In 1853, only 11 students graduated from the College of Columbia, and nary a soul from the Citadel. It is manifest that a spirit of insubordination among our youth is not only at the bottom of these deplorable results, Yeadon concluded, but that it has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished. ","There are several reasons he gave for why this spirit of insubordination ought to be diminished, but the last was the most telling: The nature of our institution of domestic slavery, and its exposure of us to hostile machinations, both at home and abroad, render it doubly incumbent on us, and on our whole sisterhood of Southern States, to cherish a military spirit and diffuse military science among our people.... Thus prepared and harnessed for conflict...the South, the united South, self-sustained and self-defended, and thrice armed, as having her quarrel just, may defy the world in arms. ","One can almost hear his voice rising to a crescendo on these last words. Yet it was November 23, 1853. War would not break out between the states for over seven more years. But one would think from listening to Richard Yeadon's speech that the armies were marching to Charleston that instant. And the main reason for preserving order in the South's colleges: the threat of external attack on the South's peculiar institution. ","This episode supports historian Arthur Cole and others who believe there existed in South Carolina in the 1850s the danger of a rupture of the Union and of civil war ten years before the firing of the first gun on Fort Sumter when even sober-minded southerners...began to calculate the value of the Union.

His speech, directed at the educators, addressed the need for a unified body of teachers in the county which would guide the next generation of Americans. It included discussions on nine different disciplines intended to foster learning in the broadest and most holistic sense. At the conclusion of the speech, Russell presented to the assembled body a constitution for their approval. ","Russell's speech was representative of the early republican ideals of America; the continued vitality of the republic was dependant upon an educated populace that yearned to cultivate knowledge, nurture patriotism, and foster virtue. The establishment of this organization represents an emphasis on a networking system between and among schools, uniformity. This network put them in relationship with each other and with the state. The association with the state in the form of a public school system was consonant with a larger popular movement during the early republic.","Delivered at the tail end of the Second Great Awakening, this speech lacks any mention to religion. While in other parts of the country, there was so much heated contention over how the Bible should be taught in public schools that there were violent riots (Philadelphia 1844), Russell's discussions of the different disciplines did not include any form of biblical study. A possible explanation for this is the Deism movement that held influence in American intellectual life and affected many secular movements of the day. The body assembled in 1830 was most interested in the continuation of American patriotism and self-governance. In his closing remarks, Russell warned his audience: Education is going on ceaselessly, in the family and abroad as well as in school. Example is ever moulding the susceptible mind of the child.

Over and over again, he painfully tried to recite the Lord's Prayer, but each time he failed. First, he could not remember how it began. After a hint from his grandmother, he ran into trouble with the latter parts. After many long, frustrating hours, his grandmother, with a pained expression on her face, tied Robert up by his hands and whipped his small back, all the while praying that her grandson would be able to memorize his prayer. "," Years later, Anderson recalled this event when writing his memoir. His account demonstrates the high premium some slaves placed on religion, because of the hope it offered. Anderson's grandmother clearly valued her grandson's learning the Lord's Prayer, if she was willing to whip him over it. "," Christianity offered enslaved people hope. The promise of a better life after this helped slaves defend themselves against the psychological horrors of being property. Anderson's grandmother obviously saw the necessity of this hope and was therefore to do whatever it took to give her grandson access to this hope.

After buying his freedom from his master, Anderson became a renowned and respected pastor, so this incident clearly shaped his life. "," This memorization was, in fact, quite disconcerting for slaveholders. Though most slaves in the South could not read, they did know several significant passages from the Bible, including the Lord's Prayer as well as other, not so innocuous (at least in the slaveholders' eyes), verses about freedom, equality, and the poor. By memorizing these verses, enslaved people combined the oral tradition of their African culture with the Christian religion they had been exposed to in America.

The Travis family was the first of many families to meet an untimely end on the night leading into the morning of August 22, 1831.

Rix of Raleigh, NC, eighteen of his slaves were freed from bondage on the condition that they boarded a ship sailing from Norfolk, VA to the west coast of Africa. One of the eighteen took a stand against these terms, and was resold into slavery. The idea for the resettlement of blacks in Africa began as a way for whites to rid themselves of African American presence to counterbalance ever increasing numbers of free blacks living on American soil. The public image that organizations such as the American Colonization Society presented was one of compassion and of Christian values. Soon it became clear that although there were pockets of blacks who looked positively on the idea of colonization, there were a great many others who questioned the professed philanthropy of its [white] promoters. Blacks who did support the movement often did so only when they decided whites would never allow them to claim full and equal citizenship. Many states, including Virginia, had instituted laws forcing freed slaves to exit the state; Furthermore, Georgia had created a system set on deterring blacks from immigrating to their state by giving free blacks the option of a 500 entrance fee or sale into slavery. ","It quickly became clear that Christian benevolence toward a debased and oppressed race was not the driving force for the movement, but rather a deep-seeded White fear of the growing free black population. John Rix's terms of manumission were not unique. The Colored American, a New York City-based African American newspaper, reported seven other conditionally freed slaves that were to join these seventeen on the ship Saluda, bound for Africa. The Norfolk Harbor was a microcosm of a nationally growing trend at this time. From 1820-1830, 1430 blacks boarded ships such as the Saluda bound for Liberia. In 1832 alone, that number rose to 1037-247 of which were manumitted under the condition of emigration. In this Land of the Free, the free people of color across the country were being pressured to leave their native soil.

On December 6, 1850, William H. Barnwell, rector of St. Peter's Church, took the pulpit to expand upon the great political question which is agitating our country. The occasion? A Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer, as designated by the South Carolina legislature. The great political question? Slavery, especially in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, a compromise most South Carolinians viewed as an absolute defeat for the South. ","Barnwell was very clear on his stance: The purpose of the North is to use the whole power of the Government for its own aggrandizement, and the destruction of an institution which we believe to be of vital importance to our welfare. The institution for Barnwell, though, was not just important for South Carolina's welfare-it was ordained by God and a gift to the African race. His ultimate conclusion, though (the morality of slavery aside) remained political: Whatever speculative notions any one may have as to the moral influence of slavery, that it is a fundamental institution of the Southern States, and that no Government on earth has the slightest right to meddle with it, either directly or indirectly.","Turn to November 21, 1860. This time, South Carolina Governor William Gist had proclaimed another Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer. This time, it was Reverend Thomas Smyth lecturing at Second Presbyterian Church on The Sin and the Curse. This time, it was the election of Abraham Lincoln and a growing secession movement that prompted the occasion. It was all a foregone conclusion in Smyth's mind: This is only the result,-the consummation of a tragedy which has been long progressing to its last act,-when the curtain fell upon the dismembered body of the Union. He goes on to blame Northern Christians for this situation; they pervert truth, justice, honor, and good faith by forgetting that the condition of slavery has been and is recognized and regulated by God, who first ordained that it should come to pass as a penal infliction upon a guilty race, for the mitigation of greater evils, and for the good of all... that under the fostering care of these Southern States, and of this legally bounded institution, these people have multiplied in a ratio greater than their masters; that they are healthier and happier than any other laboring class on the face of the earth. ","This episode is important in showing the fusion of religion and politics in 1850s South Carolina. The views of these two pastors also aligned with those in the rest of the South. As Charles Iron of Elon University notes, By the 1830s, Southern whites insisted in their formulation of a regional, evangelical orthodoxy that God had ordained slavery and that slaveholders could confidently hold their property in persons so long as they were attentive to the spiritual condition of their slaves. Though these two sermons were ten years apart, the themes they espouse and the justifications for slavery they promulgate remained the same."],"display_date":"December 5, 1850 - November 21, 1860","search_date":"1855-11-28","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2931,"title":"Colonization Movement\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-12-19","end_date":"1836-12-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 19, 1836, Philo, an anonymous member of the Norfolk community, tried to spur popular support for the resettlement of blacks in Africa.

This plan, he said, was consistent with individual rights and the peace, happiness, and prosperity, of the free coloured race ...

As more and more slaves became citizens, whites increasingly took note. Successful free blacks posed a threat to the social hierarchy, specifically the institution of slavery. Much of White America, Philo included, took a paternalistic approach, using rhetoric of compassion in their approach to resettlement. Others fall in line with George Custis, who spouted, What right have the children of Africa to an homestead in the white man's country? ... Let the Atlantic billow heave its high and everlasting barrier between their country and ours. Let this fair land, which the white man won by his chivalry, which he has adorned by the arts and elegancies of polished life be kept sacred for his descendants untarnished by the footprint of him who hath ever been a slave.... ","Philip Slaughter described black people as fortunate to have encountered the white man, who had borne him along with him in his upward career, protecting his weakness and providing for his wants... In the meantime, the black man has been trained in the habits, manners and arts of civilized life, been taught the Christian religion, and been gradually rising in the intellectual and moral order, until he is far above his race in their native seats. This sort of attitude affected the African Americans' views of themselves in relation to the native Africans with whom they were to cohabitate. The repercussions of this forced emigration and assimilation into Liberia have stretched across the last two hundred years and are still present today in the civil wars that plague that nation. When the American black population left for Africa, they brought the prejudices of their American homeland with them."],"display_date":"December 19, 1836","search_date":"1836-12-19","locations":[{"id":14406,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2934,"title":"Reverand Glennie Baptizes in Litchfield\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-02-06","end_date":"1857-02-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 6, 1857, Reverend Alexander Glennie visited a plantation in Litchfield, South Carolina.

The act of baptism is a vital part of Christianity, and was highly regarded as an important event in one's life during this time. To Christians in South Carolina, and in the general region, to be baptized as an adult was the only legitimate manner that was recognized by the Bible, never as an infant or child. A person, they argued, must be able to consciously make the decision to become a part of the faith of Jesus Christ, and to do this, he or she must be of a mature age.

The developing division between the South and the North carried into its inhabitants' religious attitudes. Evangelicalism was popular during this time, and as the historian Matthew Donald claims, it was very common for Southern Evangelicals to think that the South was more Christian than the North. One of the major sects of Christianity was the Episcopalian Church.  Up through the time of the Civil War, the Evangelical Church was in its National Period, which was characterized by missionary expansion.  ","Part of this Episcopalian mission included various preachers stationed through out the South that would spread the good word to plantations and small towns. One of these men, as evidenced in his reports of services in Litchfield, was Reverend Glennie Parish. He was a rector of the All Saints Episcopal Church in Georgetown South Carolina. Part of his responsibilities as an Episcopalian reverend in the South was to make calls to plantation chapels, such as the one in which he performed the baptisms, to bring the message to as many people as possible.

They prescribed all sorts of medicines: Castor oil salts, elixirs, chocolates, chicken broth, snake root, and creamor tartar.  She took magnesia, took Emitics, took cathartics.

For them, God was an integral factor that offered life guidance in religious terms. Thus, if one failed to adhere to the principles upheld by their religion, they were condemned in religious and social regards. In 1893, Reverend W. Walker Jubb gave a sermon describing the good intentions yet incompetent act to initiate social equality programs in society. Prior to conversing about the subject of Rev. Jubb's sermons, some background is needed. Rev. Jubb of Fall River, Massachusetts preached to a congregation in Baltimore on Dec, 12, 1893. He began preaching in England, before coming to the states and advocating the differences in men are God's works which should not be overturned. In his sermon, he stated, Every man has his own allotted place in society...each class has an intimate relation to some other class, and all, according to the divine plan, are intended to work out the wise and beneficent purpose of the almighty.","This quote exemplifies the attitudes of conservative white southerners throughout the South during this time. For them, they believed that true religion did not allow the restructuring of society which was of divine order and that through a literal, fundamental interpretation of the Bible, allowed social institutions like slavery to exist and persist for centuries. Rev. Jubb, and members of his congregation, recognized that the religious ideas that have shaped their lives should be applied to political issues. Religion provides a measure of law and reform.","Many have recognized the influence that religion has had on political and social attitudes maintained throughout their institutions. Little reform to alleviate poverty and illiteracy among African-American communities were initiated in the south because of the public's contentment with inequality between whites and blacks. Rev. Jubb iterates, Education can give habits of mind, information, memory, power of attention. But can education give the instinctive eagle glance of genius. For many in the South, the answer to this would be an instantaneous, and probably, emphatic no. ","Moreover, this example of a cross between politics and religion, illustrates the importance of the church and religious leaders. The Church was able to serve social and political purposes. Individuals were unable to tackle these dilemmas single-handedly, therefore, the Church would convene to determine an appropriate solution. Morality suddenly fell within the grasps of the Church, and the individual thus lost the ability to rationalize by oneself. The Church had true power in the South, for whatever they ordained was subsequently followed. Charles Wilson made the statement, that even if the preachers were speaking about something meaningless or trivial, the people listened. The yielded mass support, with very little burden. Wilson also stated that they had the ability to become demigods if they fully supported the idea. The religious leaders were also important aspects following Reconstruction. When racial tensions were elevated, the public turned to these specific individuals to fight for their cause. Just like with Rev. Jubb, he defended the institutions presently at work within the South as being consistent with God's plans. He was a regional spokesman, however I believe that the ideals possessed by Rev. Jubb shows how the word of God can be deliberately altered to fit a political purpose. Christianity places extreme emphasis on equality and the fair treatment of one's fellow man. To be antagonistic towards blacks, disobeys the Word, thus is not Christian. A great writer at the time, William Faulkner, explicitly observes the South's attempt to alter religion during this time; I think that the trouble with Christianity is that we've never tried it yet. For if they did, would effortlessly determine that the rhetoric of people like Rev. Jubb as overtly wrong."],"display_date":"December 11, 1893","search_date":"1893-12-11","locations":[{"id":6098,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"BALTIMORE CITY, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3011,"title":"The Spread of Prohibition\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-01-02","end_date":"1897-10-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Anti-Saloon League began with a modest following in 1893 to becoming a major political force in lobbying for a Constitutional amendment.

Grounded in moral and religious ideals, the movement was able to spread information via pamphlets, newspapers, and the spoken word. Originating in Ohio, the American temperance organization was able to flow southward, slowly encompassing a nation. ","An article written in the Washington Post in 1897 exemplifies the efforts made by the organization to illustrate their cause and purpose throughout society. The realized the need to come together as a cohesive unit in the area. The Washington D.C. area, with 15 temperance organizations, convened with the Montgomery, Maryland County League seeking greater cooperation. The article made it seem relatively easy. However, the J.C. Jackson understood that the league struggled at first due to organizational and financial difficulties. Besides discussing organizational problems, the meeting conferred about the actions taken by members to badger grocers who profited from alcohol-related sales. The President was then authorized to appoint a committee whose purpose was to prepare a list of all grocers who recently received a liquor license. This was essential to the cause of the Anti-Saloon League. They wanted sales to cease, thus patronizing liquor salesperson was one of many necessary tactics incorporated. Such agitation meetings were usually held on Sunday with official leaders present. In 1908, there were at least 15,000 meetings. This number, however, fails to take into account the numerous meetings regarding prohibition, political good-citizenship, and law enforcement that the league had either a direct or an indirect relationship with.","Such meetings of prohibition in the country were essential to the South. Prohibitionist began making headway beginning with the execution of a new, more powerful liquor law was put into place. It exemplifies the coming of the Progressive movement that was extensive throughout the early years of the 20th century South. Church and political leaders believed that a large portion of societal problems, such as poverty, sickness, and crime were heavily due to alcohol. Due to the help of the evangelicals, Protestants, and Republican party, prohibition laws were able to be ratified. The Anti-Saloon League as well as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, were able to gain local and state wide option laws in most states; finally culminating in 1919 with the passage of the 18th Amendment. Prohibition dealt with humanizing institutions to adhere to newfound prized values and traditions. The southern ethos of the 20th century hurt the liquor industry doing the prohibition era. This resulted in the rise of moonshining.

Parks, the trial judge who passed the prison sentence on the men decided that they should be pardoned and released from jail. Reverend W. G Colcord, M. A. Sturdevant, W. S. Buarchard, D. C.

These men, a minister, a school teacher, and school assistant, were reputable citizens of Rhea County, respected by their neighbors and friends in the colony. ","At this time, the Seventh-Day Adventists were a relatively new group. They focused their efforts on evangelizing through printed materials. The significance of this episode lies in how it illustrates the isolated character of the sect, the parameters of their interactions, and their conflicts with the established order and the community?s reactions. The Adventists in the south at this time focused their efforts in creating rural and self-sufficient communities in east Tennessee. One of the tenets of the Adventists is that they do not engage in evangelical efforts with members of other religious organizations. And, it was not uncommon for Adventists to run into trouble with the law because, unlike other common religious groups, they worshipped on Saturday and needed to pursue their work on Sunday. Despite the fact that the people of Rhea County most likely did not have much contact-social or religious- with the members of the Adventist community, the jailed men were treated well. The reason for clemency in the situation was probably related to the tie of Evangelical Christianity between the Adventists and those people inflicting judgment and punishment on them.

Gautier proudly wrote to the Georgia Statesman on September 26, 1826, proclaiming the establishment of auxiliaries of the American Bible Society throughout the counties that surrounded Monticello, Georgia. The Society sought to circulate the Bible without note or comment to the community. Gautier explained that the Society was simply answering the demands of the people of the area who deserved access to the Holy Scripture at reduced prices. As the letter ran in the newspaper, the Society was creating a depository in the area that would sell half-price Bibles to all the destitute and down-trodden who desired to read it but could not afford one at full price. In this way, the Society sought to send the word of Eternal Life to the remote regions of the Earth. The Society wrote the newspaper in order to find out, with the help of the Georgia Statesman, how many local citizens wanted Bibles and how many members of the community faced such a harsh poverty that they could not purchase their own Bible. The Society hoped that the newspaper would help identify those in the Monticello community that could not even afford half-price Bibles so that the Society could furnish them gratuitously and without cost. ","The Society finished their letter by asking the community's assistance in establishing an additional auxiliary in Jasper County. They firmly believed that every Christian has a duty to spread Christ's word, which remained the only sure and unerring guide which God has given to man. As Christianity spread across the world in the nineteenth century, this auxiliary sought to spread their religion within the Black Belt of Georgia.","Bible societies had recently flourished in other states, but in Georgia spreading the Bible to the poor had become a forgotten cause. The Society believed that all men and women had the right and ability to follow Christ?s teachings as given in the Bible and that Georgians especially deserved their attention. Hundreds of thousands of Americans remained entirely destitute of any portion of the word of God and the path to Heaven through Jesus Christ. The Society sought to right this wrong through a proliferation of the Bible to all households, regardless of socio-economic status. The expansion of the American Bible Society occurred at the same time that Alexander Campbell began leading the Restoration Movement that focused on the unity of Christendom through the guidance of the Bible's teachings. The faction of this movement that included the American Bible Society shared a desire to distribute God?s Word without footnote or commentary and thus unaltered from its original translated state. Rather than focusing on the commentaries of secondary sources, the American Bible Society believed that it was the job of the reader to decipher precisely what God?s word meant rather than to rely on the potentially misguided work of another.","The American Bible Society was one of many societies dedicated to spreading Christianity and the Gospel in the American South. Early in the nineteenth century, a benevolent empire of national societies spread across the nation in the hopes of transforming the United States into a nation of the kingdom of God on earth. These societies put special emphasis on the South because they viewed the South as a culturally and morally backwards region that needed a religious purpose and direction to save it from the depravity of slavery and its morally bankrupt frontier conditions.

The content of the letter, as authorized by the Eatonton Academy Board of Directors, asked Brookes to move from his estate in Bibb County, Georgia, to Jasper County, Georgia, in order to serve as the Rector of the Academy. Secretary Williams' letter began by outlining precisely why Brookes should move to Jasper to become the Rector of the Academy. Williams regretfully explained that Brookes' salary would be 800 half-yearly because of a lack of funds at the Academy that revealed a sign of the times. The Panic of 1819 and its depressing economic effects that lasted into 1821 continued to plague Black Belt Georgia and the Academy itself, so the Board could not possibly offer Brookes a higher salary. ","Secretary Williams then turns to the necessity of a prompt reply. He explains to Brookes that a returned letter of acceptance would be considered by the Board as a binding contract that would guarantee Brookes' presence at the Academy before the beginning of the next term. The Board's expectations for Brookes are clearly defined. He would serve as an ally of the classical kind for the Board and lead the community under the high expectations of the Academy. The Academy met from 8 AM - 12 PM and from 2 PM - 5PM from March 22 to September 22 and from 9 AM - 12 PM and 1:30 PM - 4 PM from September 22 to March 22. The schedule, Williams explains, adjusts according to the farming season. Students and faculty at the Academy celebrated two vacations of three weeks each after their examinations. Brookes would be asked to serve the Academy outside of the academic institution as well. Three local churches in Jasper County lay in despair. Intelligent and respectable elderly members of historic and proven congregations needed a man young in the ministry to guide their religious walk. These local Baptist churches faced financial constraints, a lack of leadership, and a spiritual void that the Board believed only Brookes could fill. Mr. Jefferson, a minister in one of the floundering churches, would help maintain the historical integrity of the churches, but the Board needed Brooke to breathe new life into the religious community. Williams' letter ended in the hope that Brookes would make his way to Eatonton Academy a few weeks before the first Monday in January in order to become acquainted with the Academy, the church, and the community before beginning his duties as Rector. As a later letter shows, Brookes would in fact move to Jasper County and take the position. ","By 1800, Baptists grew to become the largest denomination in the United States. Like today, the Baptist Church drew many of its congregations from the South. Churches sprung up throughout Milledgeville and nearby Macon County, and Christian academies for young men placed advertisements throughout the newspapers of the state. In a time when southerners prided themselves in their education and religious sentiment, Christian academies like Eatonton could be easily found throughout the South. The growth of many of these religious academies followed a focused movement of the Baptist Church to expand its Southern Enterprise through evangelism, missionary work, and the establishment of religious educational academies like Eatonton. The Baptist Church recognized the power of large national religious movements that swept the country in the 1820s and 1830s and heeded the call of evangelism. As a larger movement of organized benevolence swept the South in the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, the Baptists followed suit."],"display_date":"October 21, 1821","search_date":"1821-10-21","locations":[{"id":1943,"lat":33.3252749518,"lng":-83.690146578,"zoom":10,"place":"JASPER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3043,"title":"Blacks in South Carolina: Education and Christianization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-01-01","end_date":"1834-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Several members of South Carolina's Chester County delivered a petition to the state assembly in response to an 1834 act outlawing teaching reading to slaves.

The petitioners denounced the legislation as ridiculous because slave owners would not be able to prevent their slaves from reading and learning to read, much in the same way that they couldn't prevent their slaves from learning to write, a skill many slaves taught themselves despite the watchful eyes of their owners.","    The petition continued to question the logic of the assembly in enacting such legislation and questioned their assumption that intelligence is more likely to produce insurrections among slaves than ignorance. They argued that general ignorance within the slave population is more of a threat because it would make slaves much more susceptible to the influences of any Nat Turner type character that might pass through the region. The petition ended with the scornful question does chivalrous South Carolina quail before gangs of cowardly Africans with a Bible in their hands?","    Despite the moral and Christian basis of this petition, this appeal and many others like it were continually rejected by the state legislators. According to historian Walter Edgar, South Carolina was known across the antebellum South as the most stringent state with regards to teaching blacks, both free and enslaved. However, many individual slave owners did break these laws, mostly in the hopes of educating their slaves about Christianity, knowing that the laws, though strict, were hardly enforced. In reality, it is estimated that around 5 percent of South Carolina's black population had some grasp of reading or writing. The state assembly insisted on enacting such laws because of leaders' beliefs that literate blacks, whether free or enslaved, presented a major threat to the system that the South relied upon so heavily. Additionally, the reference to Nat Turner's rebellion 3 years earlier in southern Virginia gives a sense of the uneasiness that rippled throughout the South as slave owners saw the delicate balance of the system their entire lifestyles depended upon. This episode is an excellent illustration of the different pressures felt by white Southerners throughout the antebellum period: recognizing slaves as human souls entitled to the same rights as whites versus slaves as commodities upholding the economic and cultural basis of Southern culture."],"display_date":1834,"search_date":"1834-07-02","locations":[{"id":11463,"lat":34.6920570183,"lng":-81.1595343266,"zoom":10,"place":"CHESTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3047,"title":"Religion Spawns Murder in South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-03-01","end_date":"1897-03-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the last day of February 1897, according to <em>The State</em>, John Yochum was shot and killed by a coworker from the Richland mill, Bryce McComb. When McComb, a young man not yet of age, approached Yochum, a man of 53, to reprimand him for his treatment of another worker, Owens, the elder retaliated with violence. Owens had approached a group of his coworkers asking them if they would have liked to accompany him to Tabernacle services. According to witnesses, Yochum had called Owens a false Christian who was just as ready as Yochum to have improper intimacy with loose women. McComb told Yochum to respect Owens for his age; however, Yochum used this as a platform to attack the young man. McComb pulled out his pistol in retaliation and in the struggle pulled the trigger; the bullet pierced Yochum?s hat. Yochum then hit McComb over the head with his gun and the latter fired; the second bullet pierced the old man?s neck and followed a downward course to its final resting spot between the fifth and sixth ribs. McComb willingly turned himself in; also, a partly used flask of corn whiskey was found on Yochum?s body, and it is most likely he had been drinking throughout his work day."," While the South experienced a cultural, social, and political reconstruction after the Civil War, religion also became an even more dynamic yet concrete part of the southern lifestyle. In the Yochum murder situation, religion became the motivating factor of the argument as Owens? spirituality caused the negative reaction of Yochum which inspired the fatal argument between the coworkers. Even though personal religious debates may not have been every day occurrences in South Carolina, religious fervor as a whole was a staple of southern life. According to Edward Ayers, religious fervor was a staple across the South after the Civil War in both private lives and political orations. With South Carolina as a mainly Protestant area, the different denominations still inspired strife between religious factions. Furthermore, ?great variability in church membership marked the South.? With some people holding strong onto new religious convictions, their incredibly devout beliefs often times conflicted with the more lackadaisical lifestyles of their neighbors. "," Though the Yochum murder exemplifies a specific conflict in Upcountry South Carolina, it also relates to the widespread, incredibly intense sermons of the time period. For example, while preaching, Sam Jones criticized all of his audience members and disregarded race, gender, and spirituality. Jones touched every hidden aspect of southern life in his sermons. As the Protestant religions scrambled to match the standards of churches that had not lost vital development time in the Civil War and Reconstruction, national preachers, like Sam Jones, inspired a reawakening of religious fervor across the South."],"display_date":"March 1, 1897","search_date":"1897-03-01","locations":[{"id":11641,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3056,"title":"Reconciling the Peculiar Institution\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-12-26","end_date":"1845-12-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In December of 1845, Reverend T.M. Wilkes wrote a letter to Reverend Iveson Lewis Brookes proposing that funds be raised to secure a new Baptist missionary to preach in Jones County, Georgia. Brookes was asked to continue paying 100 to sustain the preaching activities at his Jasper County plantation and to give an additional 100 to secure the second missionary. Wilkes, also a reverend, assured Brookes that another 300 would be provided by the Marion Board and general fundraising. Brookes was very active in Baptist affairs, and also owned hundreds of slaves and at least three plantations, including one in Jones County. He wrote a pamphlet arguing that the Bible served as justification for slavery, and presumably had a previous interest in procuring a preacher for his plantations. The money raised would be enough to procure the services of John H. Clark, an ordained minister living in the field, zealous, persevering, and energetic, whom Wilkes enthusiastically endorsed as the best candidate for the plantation job.","Preaching Christianity to slaves was a problematic endeavor. Although planters wanted their slaves to be Christian and to have eternal salvation from their sins, slavery was not easily reconciled with Christian notions of equality, and many feared that their slaves would become rebellious if they heard these messages. Reverend Brookes was, however, not alone in believing that slavery and religion could be reconciled. According to many slaveholders, Christianity not only supported the institution, but also strengthened it by teaching slaves the ideals of obedience and honesty, reducing the threat of rebellion. Southern missionaries also found themselves torn between their religious beliefs and condoning this peculiar institution. Many believed that slavery was wrong and ungodly and educated slaves when they could. Methodist and Baptist ministers also comprised a significant part of the southern abolitionist movement. Others argued that emancipation was insignificant compared to the need to preach salvation, and they thought that the anti-slavery approach had to be abandoned. Their primary goal was compromised when plantation owners banned missionary activities as a result of their abolitionist efforts. ","Tensions during the Southern Baptist Convention of 1845-seven months before Wilkes' letter was written-resulted in a split between the Northern and abolitionist missionaries and those who supported slavery or were at least willing to meet slave-owners' pro-slavery demands in order to gain access to the plantations. Methodist and Presbyterian organizations experienced a similar division. One result of this schism in the Baptist Church was the creation of a board for Domestic Missions in Marion, Alabama, which is probably the 'Marion Board' mentioned by Wilkes in his letter. A prominent figure in national Baptist politics, Reverend Brookes might have been one of the pro-slavery voices during the Convention meetings, but if not, he certainly supported their view. He saw these efforts realized when Baptist organizations began bringing missionaries to his own plantations in Georgia."],"display_date":"December 26, 1845","search_date":"1845-12-26","locations":[{"id":1967,"lat":33.0230529305,"lng":-83.5603964858,"zoom":9,"place":"JONES, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3075,"title":"A Confederate Monument is Dedicated\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-08-20","end_date":"1891-08-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In August of 1891, the people of Charleston, South Carolina turned out to dedicate an Obelisk to the memory of the Washington Light Infantry Regiment, which fought in the defense of the Rebellion.

He asserts that despite the fact that the Confederacy lost the war, the souls of those who died fighting for it were redeemed by their devotion to their principles.

Recently, historians such as C. Vann Woodward have described a trend amongst former Confederates to explain the war as a Lost Cause, a noble fight that the South was doomed to lose from the beginning. This idea of the Lost Cause allowed Southerners to believe that they had been the superior men, and that their military prowess had allowed them fight on for four years when the Union's overwhelming advantages should have subdued them much more quickly. While this view became prevalent across the South in the late-nineteenth century, it failed to take into account that the Confederacy had several advantages, such as: they did not have to win but only draw, they were more familiar with the terrain they were fighting on, they had shorter supply lines, and public opinion about the war in the Union was divided.

Revival meetings such as this one became common as preachers sought to extend their messages beyond the walls of their churches in efforts truly to evangelize the population. Historians tell us that a great many church members were women, so it is safe to say that the women of Rogersville and its environs probably attended this series of revival meetings. Indeed, they most likely brought others with them to hear the messages of sin, repentance, and rebirth being preached by the variety of ministers.

John Crease's daughter received a letter from her grandmother expressing her condolences. The grandmother had written the letter on December 15, 1872, when she had received a telegram notifying her of Crease's death. The grandmother assured Crease's daughter that her father would be missed. She also assured her that her father had gone on to a better place, and continues to use religion to try and comfort her granddaughter. In her letter the grandmother also addressed happier topics such as the news of some of the family's children and their education. The grandmother talked about one of the younger girls wanting to go to school, and how the grandmother thought that it would be a good influence on her.","The religious language, such as you dear fatherless ones God has promised to be a father to you, a Shepherd, that the grandmother used to comfort Crease's daughter indicates that the grandmother, and probably the granddaughter as well, were on some level religious and likely belonged to a church. Religion in the South after the Civil War was complicated and varied. Methodism and many other new sects evolved from the frustration many Southerners felt about their new life. Church membership ranged from merely 10 percent in some counties to 60 percent in others. Overall, however, every southern state had a growth in the church population, with women constituting two-thirds of that population. Like African Americans, women were able to find leadership positions in the church that were unavailable to them elsewhere. African American churches during the era focused on the common interest and solidarity that linked the freedmen, and white women focused on these traits within the church as well. The fact that a southern woman like the grandmother used religious language to try and comfort her granddaughter shows how southern women were able to find strength in the church.","The grandmother also talked about the positive influence schooling had on the family's children, which was an aspect of southern education that would not be seen only five years later after the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The children probably attended a public school because there were only two parochial schools in all of Arkansas by 1877.

While women in the higher, slaveholding class held more power and control over their day to day activities than lower class women, they were still in need of outside organizations to occupy them and solidify their say in society. Southern society discouraged involvement in these groups that were not connected to the church, for the most part, southern women did their charitable work individually, selectively, and close to home, if not with in their own households. The Soldiers Aid Society that Mrs. Kimball was a part of is a rare example of southern women stepping out of the male dominated worlds of their homes and churches and gathering to help their newly formed country. With so many southern plantation owners helping in the war effort societies and organizations were more likely to be formed. The men that for the most part governed the activities of women were now busy elsewhere and the women were left with time and freedom on their hands.

The night's favorite performance came in the form of nine year old Mamie, whose solos left the audience shackled by their laughter. The enthusiasm for the temperance celebration surprised even the event's organizers; as the anniversary resulted in complete success. Despite no boring pleas for money, donations covered all the expenses. Sunday, April 24, celebrated by all the local churches as Temperance Day, witnessed mass meetings at several churches, with gripping sermons that kept people in their pews long past when the doxology and benediction normally concluded services. "," Protestant churches in the South regarded the coming of a New, commercial South in the late nineteenth century as a threat to the Old South culture, so deeply rooted in Christianity. Thus, local organizations, often supported by churches, emerged to improve and perfect an increasingly chaotic society. Movements towards Prohibition grew out of these efforts, which more often than not had a strong female presence. Such a seemingly Puritanical movement generated resistance from those who felt the church had overstepped its bounds. Nonetheless, some isolated communities, like Chincoteague Island, were able to construct their own local temperance options, though areas with a larger lower class typically encountered more resistance. "," On a national level, a prohibition party could never succeed due to the differences between temperance supporters in the North and South. Most Northern prohibitionists were Republicans and former abolitionists, anathema to self-respecting Southern elites. Within Virginia, however, the Prohibition Party increased by 1887 to ten times its support in 1884. These followers tended to see bars and saloons as the basis for the wrongs of Southern culture, fostering lewdness and incessant swearing. Oftentimes, the prohibitionists would reach out to blacks for several reasons. First, they were seen as important swing voters who could counteract the usually dominant Democratic Party. Also, there existed religious and class based reasons that white professionals could associate and share the same values with their black counterparts. This sort of mutual respect appears in a statement made by a white, pro-temperance preacher, Let us make a great pile of all the unreasonable race prejudices, all political animosities, all sectional bitterness, all partisan hate.... The most successful nation-wide coalition in the nineteenth century; however, came with the creation of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the first group formed by solely women to act politically. Nevertheless, no state encompassing prohibition laws emerged until later on in the 1900's. Yet, by 1887, Chincoteague rejoiced in finding what they considered a more perfect society.

At the cost of 1,000, the local Baptist church had purchased a vacant lot from William Phelps in front of the residence of Wm. Terry Jr. on Boyd Avenue and Church Street. The Dispatch notes that although the church is small in numbers, its members have both the ?energy and push? to enhance the ?style and beauty? of their town with the new church.","Religion was essential to life as a southerner. Church was where children were schooled, families went to pray, and town meetings were held. Along with Methodism, the Baptist faith dominated early Virginia. For every Presbyterian or Episcopalian, there were four Methodists or Baptists.

Though greatly appreciative of the 15 years he spent in Washington, Georgia, the congregation of St. Patrick's deeply regretted the transfer of Reverend J. M. O'Brien to his new parish in Augusta County. Thankfully, his former congregation will not be devoid of his influence despite his physical absence. The fruits of his work - evident in the boy's orphanage and the Academy of St. Joseph - stand as testaments to his good deeds while in Washington. To demonstrate their appreciation for O'Brien and his tremendous work and religious guidance, his congregation presented him with a very handsome watch one Wednesday evening. Furthermore, Reverend Bishop Becker, formerly of Savannah, the man who was assuming O'Brien's position at St. Patrick's, blessed and dedicated the new church bell in O'Brien's honor.","While at St. Patrick's, O'Brien was tireless in his efforts to raise the standard of devotion and outreach in the county. Almost immediately after his arrival in 1874, O'Brien assumed control over the recently relocated boy's orphanage. Furthermore and perhaps more importantly, his religious zeal and moral uprightness rejuvenated the conditions of Catholic faith in the county from its original dire depths. Apparently, O'Brien arrived at a time when Catholicity was at a low ebb and prejudice strong. Unfortunately, the bell dedicated in Father O'Brien's name no longer rings. Its station atop St. Patrick's has long ceased to exist. However, his efforts to raise moral and religious zeal among the Catholic population in Washington as well as his contributions to social outreach at the time remain greatly influential."," The reputation of the South as the Bible Belt, the strong hold of American evangelical Christianity, may have some merit. Though Father O'Brien attempted and, to some extent, succeeded in rejuvenating the Catholic population in Washington, the Protestant and evangelical Christian denominations were the salient religious hegemons in the region. How was this the case given the two and a half million Catholics who arrived in the States between 1880-1900? Where did they all go? The answer is certainly not to be found in the South. The mass influx of Catholic immigrants from Eastern Europe and Ireland and the subsequent nativist discrimination which accompanied the new citizens was one of many factors which explain the relatively small Catholic population in the South. Another possible explanation exists in southern Protestant culture which dominated the region and sanctified dominant political and social hierarchies. In spite of the simmering religious tensions just below the surface of Southern society, unprecedented community outreach and social awareness accompanied the growing importance of religion in the South.

In this year, the First African Church of New Orleans, which had been officially founded in October of 1826, received two new Baptist pastors after the death of its founding pastor. These Brethren Sanders and Satterfield breathed new life into the church with their worship leadership, and membership flourished once more. In 1837, Elder Peter W. Robert returned the now-Baptist organization to its original form by renaming it the First African Church. Pastors Sanders and Satterfield were ordained in First African Church and carried on preaching the gospel. The church was held in a schoolhouse, but as the church grew, so did weekly collections and therefore finances. By the year 1842 First African had enough money and members to move out of their schoolhouse building and into their own newly constructed church on the corner of Howard and Cypress. "," New Orleans was a city more focused on making money and socializing than worrying about its collective soul. Religious services in white churches were not highly attended. These slave owners kept a lose reign on their slaves in that regard, allowing them to go to church at their own leisure. Because of this bit of freedom, blacks in the area could converge, creating their own churches and organizational hierarchies as illustrated by Elder Peter W. Robert's success. This freedom was most strikingly illustrated by the fact that the First African Church was able to construct itself a new building out of its own money. Those funds had to come from somewhere, and they were probably not being donated by white benefactors. William Craft narrated the story of him and his wife's escape from bondage and included information about earning wages even as a slave. When he asked for a few days off work, his employer granted them, but the cabinet-maker with whom [he] worked ... said that he needed [his] services very much, and wished [him] to return as soon as the time granted was up. Some slaves, then, were able to perform extra labor for their masters or other entrepreneurs and earn a bit of money to call their own. Whites tended to grant slaves days of rest on weekends. The fact that slaves were willing to donate what little they had to churches like the First African Church is a testament to the strong backing and community feel that these religious organizations provided to their members. In a life filled with uncertainties - there was no telling when slave families may be separated - religion became a support system on which to depend."],"display_date":"1826 - 1842","search_date":"1834-07-02","locations":[{"id":5596,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3168,"title":"Jewish Presence in Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-09-14","end_date":"1882-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the morning of September 14, 1882, Philip Henry Pitts ran various errands around town. He needed to make a few purchases, namely tools and home goods. While in town Pitts noticed a few stores had closed signs in the window. Upon returning home to his plantation, Pitts entered in his diary, Thursday Holy day among the Jews - All places of business closed among them this day...and this is new year with them... While it remains unclear whether Pitts referred to the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, or Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish days, his observance of this Jewish tradition positively identified a Jewish population living and working in Perry County, Alabama in 1882. Pitts concluded his diary entry by listing the various goods he purchased including a brass handle and a monkey wrench. ","Jewish immigration into the South was divided into four phases from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century. Jewish immigration to Alabama began in the late nineteenth century during the third wave of Jewish settlement in the South. Abraham Mordecai was the first European Jew to travel further west of the early centers of Jewish life in Savannah and Charleston. While the exact date of his arrival is unknown, he settled in what would become Montgomery, Alabama in 1880, pushing the Jewish population further into the South. ","As Jewish immigrants continued to settle in the South, they progressively gained economic influence in society. According to social historian Ralph Melnick, the collapse of the rural plantation system transferred economic and political power to southern cities and townships. With this economic shift, the Jewish population began to earn clout working as professionals, businessmen, mill operators, commodity brokers, and farm owners. In these roles Jewish workers increased their economic status in times of relative instability throughout the South. Reconstruction and the depression of the 1890s further increased Jewish wealth as they continually offered incentives over gentile competition. Jewish business transactions were strictly cash-only, eliminating the vicious cycle of debt for the consumer and decreasing the merchants' risk of financial loss. The economic prosperity enjoyed by these southern working Jews unfortunately led to an increase of anti-Semitism and resentment across the South. ","Between 1848 and 1980 Alabama lost half its Jewish population to bigotry and hate crimes. In 1868, the Ku Klux Klan was founded in Memphis, Tennessee and formally began its reign of terror throughout the South. In 1871, the KKK publicly murdered a Jewish shopkeeper in Memphis and established the Jewish population as a target of the organization. Though many Jews fled both Alabama and the South others remained. Despite anti-Semitic sentiments in the South, many Jewish families lingered in the region of their American roots.

Hundreds of thousands of Southerners followed the flourishing Christian principals, and Iveson L. Brookes was no different. He encountered the tenants of the Baptist tradition and became a devout follower. Brookes completed his coursework from the University of North Carolina in 1819 and spread the Baptist gospel throughout the South for numerous years thereafter. In October 1821, William Williams, an administrator at Eatonton Academy, requested that Brookes become the school's rector. Williams's letter to Brookes detailed the amount the Board of Trustees planned to pay him, the daily schedule of the school throughout the year, the meeting times of the surrounding Baptist churches, and Brookes' responsibility as a teacher, preacher, and rector of the school.","Because of the intensification of the importance of religion in the South, southern schools searched for dedicated and religious men as additions to their teaching staff. As Williams wrote to Brookes, he described the surrounding area as boasting four or five churches within 7 miles of Eatonton Academy. Baptist missionary fervor and unremitting evangelicalism had greatly expanded since the Baptists widened their outreach in the late eighteenth Century. Additionally, the religion developed because of its national view, appeal throughout all socioeconomic classes, and advocacy for the separation of church and state and religious freedom. Moreover, Baptist leaders spread religion and culture throughout the nation, and they knew that education was the most direct route. They created Baptist colleges and urged actions like that of Mr. Williams. Many Baptists, like Brookes, developed a missionary zeal and spread the word of God throughout the region. He committed himself to the Baptist theology, and Eatonton Academy wanted his services.","Educational standards had also reached a critical point in the Georgia Piedmont. Private, secondary school education developed a regimented, organized structure. The board of trustees stood at the top echelon of the composition, and it designated teachers' salaries and recommended faculty and administrative appointments.

Commissioned by the Missionary Society of Connecticut in 1815 to preach Christianity to the masses of emigrants moving west, Flint was no stranger to such exploration. He ministered in the Ohio Valley, St. Louis and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as taking an opportunity to travel through the new Arkansas Territory in 1819. Due to ill health, he was often traveling between Louisiana and New England, seeking escape from the sweltering heat of summer and the freezing cold of winter. "," After traveling several days east along the Red River in 1835, he finally came to its junction with the Ouachita River, which could take him north through the Arkansas Territory, should he choose. Flint found, even at this remote place, small cabins dotting the landscape where just a few years before there had been no one. He employed the services of one such settler, a Hollander dressed in a shabby and crude Robinson Crusoe costume, to ferry him closer to the Ouachita. Flint was so amused by his new friend that he requested to see where this Dutchman lived. The Dutchman obliged, presenting Flint with a small two room cabin surrounded by cultivated peach and plum trees and a small garden, miles from any other habitation. His home was dug into the side of an Indian mound, which he shared with his animals. Like his clothing, all his tools, eating utensils, and dishes were crude and hand-made. The ferryman took the opportunity to express his opinion on religion as well, pushing a book of Astrology on the Reverend. Flint graciously declined, lamenting a lack of familiarity with the Dutch language. "," Whatever entertainment Timothy Flint gained from such a man, he still expressed regret that so great a proportion of the emigrants are of the class of poor, vagrant, and worthless foreigners, the scum of despotic governments. Many who emigrated to the frontier owned very few slaves or none at all and appear in the tax records as not owning property, much like the Dutch ferryman. These men and their families eked out a small living, and required, as many church officials from the East believed, a revived understanding of the Christian faith due to their removal from civilized society. ","In the same year that the Missionary Society of Connecticut sent Reverend Flint west, a New York paper, <em>The Patrol</em>, reprinted a progress report from the Louisiana Bible Society, expressing concern that the want of Bibles in Louisiana has been extreme. The Presbyterian Church in the East was greatly concerned with increasing the educational and moral principles of society at large, but particularly on the frontier, where they believed lower class migrants, like the Dutchman, were in danger of leading secular lives and forgetting God in the wilds of the west."],"display_date":1835,"search_date":"1835-07-02","locations":[{"id":5632,"lat":31.2441474516,"lng":-92.6921619821,"zoom":8,"place":"RAPIDES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3195,"title":"A Divinely Righteous Cause\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-25","end_date":"1861-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In April of 1861 the Fall of Fort Sumter gripped the United States. After this dramatic turning point, both the North and South began to take offensive and defensive measures. Suddenly, the nation stood at the threshold of war. Only approximately two weeks after Beauregard's Confederate troops had stormed the national fort, a large group of clergymen from across the state of Mississippi gathered within the walls of a quaint Church on Randolph Street in Holly Springs for the state's Thirty-fifth Annual Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Over the course of three days these men discussed, among other things, the state of the nation and their role as the church within a country at odds. "," For the Bishop's Journal and Address, the Rev. W.M. Green spoke to the gathered assembly. A great deal had occurred in the political realm since they had last met: Their state had joined the Confederacy in January 1861 and troops were being assembled for both the Union and Confederacy. An eventful year has passed over us since we last took counsel together, remarked Green. The revolution which has been forced upon us, has been effected in a manner no less wonderful than grateful to every heart. What may yet be in reserve for us, we cannot tell. In the hands of the wise and merciful God of Nations, we must leave our country, with the earnest supplications of Christian hearts, and the firm resolves of patriots trusting in the righteousness of their cause. "," During the Civil War, faith and morale were closely linked. The Confederacy believed their cause to be righteous in the eyes of God, a belief that served as a patriotic rallying point for the South. God is on our side was the cry of many. Southern citizens and soldiers saw military men such as Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee to be divinely inspired leaders in whom they could trust and depend upon. With each Confederate victory on the battlefield God's preference was confirmed. The church played a large part in continuing to foster this faith in the Confederate war effort by continually deeming it a divinely righteous cause. The Protestant Episcopal Church, as well as other southern protestant denominations, formed a core of stability that fueled the people's fiery spirits of nationalism."],"display_date":"April 25, 1861 - April 27, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-26","locations":[{"id":7173,"lat":34.7662259669,"lng":-89.4795664639,"zoom":9,"place":"MARSHALL, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3211,"title":"A Spiritual Occurrence in the Household\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1827-06-01","end_date":"1827-06-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Maria Bryan returned from a prayer meeting to find her close friend, Carlisle, in a very emotional state.

Suddenly, without any forewarning, the preacher himself seemed to lose his mind as he stomped around the room, sat for a minute or two, jumped up, and started walking around again.

Due to the influx in the belief of religion throughout the South, many Southerners heeded events such as these with an extremely serious tone. Waves of evangelism swept across the Old South from 1796 through the proceeding decades. The early nineteenth century in the South was characterized by continuous spiritual inspection, the development of missions, Sunday schools, and the growth of the sheer quantity of churches and religious academies.

On the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth of December, a serenade of horns and pop-crackers outside their doors interrupted the holiday jubilations of those City Council members who voted in favor of the ordinance. The boys of the city celebrated Christmas as usual with the sharp bang of the small pop-crackers and the deeper boom of a cannon-cracker, but the spirit of the noise had changed from religious merriment to civic disobedience.","  The council members accepted the protests in good spirits at first and all in the city enjoyed the Christmas festivities.

Fifteen hundred people attended the evening church service to hear the sermon given by Love. Love noted that the outrageous acts of lynching would not stop any time soon. Love professed that the best way to decrease occurrences of rape was to depend on the laws set forth in this country. He promoted the idea that all blacks should follow the law in order to dispel any preconceived notions that whites had concerning black people. Love believed his position on blacks obeying the law was the stance that all black Americans should take. At the end of the meeting the church as a whole took a vote and concluded that they endorsed Love's position as the overall position of the church. ","The threat of being hung from a noose scared many southern African Americans after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. Black southerners were hanged for any reason that whites determined to be a necessary cause such as the supposed killing of a white person or the raping of a white woman. Yet the hanging of a black person was not the only form of mob violence African Americans experienced. In 1899 in Palmetto, Georgia two thousand white men, women and children gathered to watch the lynching of Sam Hose who allegedly raped a white woman. The innocent black man was burned alive and his body parts were divided and sold as souvenirs. This tragic episode and many others occurred frequently throughout the South. The horrors associated with lynching and mob violence were at the center of Love's sermon. ","As the population of the United States increased at a rapid rate, whites and blacks began to live in close vicinity to one another in urban and rural areas. One result of the living situation in the rapidly growing United States included a fairly high frequency of lynching. The horrors of lynching became a topic of concern for both whites and blacks. The sermon given by Love denoted the importance of the issue of lynching throughout the South. The large amount of people that attended the sermon showed that many people had a great deal of interest in the subject.

I recommend that you solemnly and firmly declare that Mississippi will be true to her plighted faith to her sister Confederates, and will conquer or perish with them....rather than abandon our cherished and Christian institution of domestic slavery, we will send our servants with our sons to the battlefield, to fight for our right to protect and guard them against their worst enemies. "," It is the institution of slavery that so strongly strikes a chord with Clark and the citizens of the South. Economic and social circumstances of the day and age encouraged the view that the institution of slavery was perfectly acceptable and necessary for the established structure of southern society. Southerners believed slavery to be a perfectly righteous and Godly institution, in which they acted as the paternal master over their misguided slaves. It economically benefited the white man while allowing blacks to be cared for and introduced to the Gospel. The Confederacy felt it better to fight until the death rather than to allow their benevolent way of life to be stripped away from them.

Roland left New York on the steam-packet <em>Home</em> bound for Charleston. His trip quickly took a turn for the worst. By Monday morning, the ship encountered a violent hurricane in the waters around Cape Hatteras and was taking on water. All hands were at the pumps, women included, bailing out water, but the leak continued to increase. After water reached the engine, Captain Carleton White decided to beach the vessel in order to save the passengers and crew on board. At around ten o'clock in the evening, the Home struck the outer breakers a quarter mile from the shore. Roland reported, In an instant after the strike, all was utter confusion and alarm. Men, women and children screamed in the most agonizing manner, fearful of the almost certain death that lay before them. Amid all the chaos, Mr. Roland shed all his clothes except for his shirt and pantaloons and dived into the turbulent waters. Somehow, he managed to escape death and made it to the shore - though the current had swept him a mile and a half to the south. ","Roland recalled how the scene the next morning was too horrid to describe. The engine and the boiler being the only unbroken relics of what was the beautiful packet <em>Home</em>. The shore was lined with bodies constantly coming up. All hands were engaged in collecting them together. In a letter to the owners of the <em>Home</em>, Captain White estimated the death toll at around 80 souls. After the catastrophe, Roland returned to New York and told his story. ","Steam vessels like the <em>Home</em> always passed through the sea lanes off the Outer Banks. It was not uncommon for vacationers there to see as many as half a dozen vessels off the shore. The navigation of these sea routes enabled better access to local and national markets, fueling the economic development of North Carolina in the 1840s and 1850s. But how did the South respond to the maritime disaster of the Home? First, questions were raised about the safety of these steam-packets that were designed for luxury more than performance, in order to compete with railroad travel. Southerners looked to the steam vessels of Britain for engineering standards. A more illuminating response was the consideration of religion. One Reverend, clinging to a piece of luggage, was heard to utter these words in the frigid waters of the Outer Banks: He that trusts in Jesus is safe, even in the perils of the sea. If there was one thing common to Southern society, it was that most people found ultimate solace in religion. After the shipwreck, it was the only way to make sense of the destruction. Accordingly, Reverends throughout the area consoled their congregations, reminding them of God's divine plan even in the face of such a catastrophe."],"display_date":"October 10, 1847 - December 31, 1847","search_date":"1847-11-19","locations":[{"id":9397,"lat":35.8842931253,"lng":-75.6026917115,"zoom":8,"place":"CURRITUCK, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3278,"title":"A Change of Churches\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-08-17","end_date":"1890-08-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" For this reason I left you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are lacking, and appoint elders in every city as I commanded you. (Titus 1:5). Reverend William Troy, of Richmond, preached a powerful sermon, centered on this biblical passage, as he installed the Rev. E C Thomson as the new pastor of the Mangohick Baptist Church in King William County. Thomson, who had attended the Richmond Theological Seminary and had formerly been ordained as pastor of the Jericho Baptist Church in Caroline County, faced a new congregation eager to accept him into their ranks. Not only were the members of the church hopeful that Thomson would bring growth, but the Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, also had great aspirations for him. The Planet called Thomson a good preacher and [he] belongs to the forward rank of those who are working for the improvement of our race. Perhaps nervous facing such a new opportunity coupled with such responsibility, he nonetheless delivered his first heartwarming message, leaving the congregation optimistic that he would, indeed, encourage progress. "," Travelers to the South described it as the most simply and sincerely religious country, where religion is a very large factor in life, and God is very real and personal; this reputation seems to have stuck throughout its history. Religious fervor would very prominently emerge in the 1880's as a wave of evangelicalism swept the South, increasing the numbers of converts and regular revival meetings. Baptists and Methodists were the most successful Protestant denominations in the postwar South, gaining large amounts of new members and building new churches. Thus, the appearance of local church news in a major newspaper remained not uncommon, as communities truly cared about such issues. Still, circumstances were not always favorable towards ministers. Due to ever-present troubles like finances and latent apathy, running a church became a hard task. Especially in rural churches like Mangohick Baptist, pastoral turnover could be high. "," Blacks, especially, flocked to new congregations after emancipation, though usually they sought out all-black churches, with white churches more than willing to let allow this voluntary segregation. Most often attracted to the Baptist denomination, black Christians regarded their church as a central institution in their lives and their minister as, a community leader. This development distinguished black pastors from their white counterparts, and also laid on them the extra challenge of being political and negotiating the desire of their congregations for autonomy...the demands of young assertive blacks and the caution of more conservative blacks. Evident in the Planet's portrayal of Thomson's new role, lies the idea that he must be a leader in helping blacks ameliorate their lives in a society aimed at filtering out their presence. How the new pastor would handle such pressure remained to be seen, but clearly he encountered obligations that a white congregation would not necessarily expect.

M. Todd came to his new district, he heard threats that the white men in the area had a way of getting rid of men who came from the North to preach to the colored people. Todd may or may not have taken the threat seriously. Regardless, he worked with his superior Reverend I. G. Pollard to organize services that were open to mixed congregations. It was after such a service on March 26, 1879 that Todd and Pollard found themselves being held at gunpoint by the marshal and another man. The marshal had begun to direct the two into a back billiard room when Todd, overcome with panic, broke away and ran. The marshal reportedly shot him at least three times, before turning his attention to Pollard. The marshal stripped and searched Pollard in the back room, though he claimed that his main objective was Todd. Once Todd turned himself in later that night and had undergone a similar search, the marshal released the two preachers. Pollard took Todd to a doctor who saw to his wounds, however, the paper in which this story appeared never specified how serious these injuries were. The paper did relate that after that night Pollard took Todd into the country, probably to be kept out of harm's way. Todd, however, decided to send his brother to Little Rock, and weeks later he accompanied him to Brinkley. Todd and his brother were waiting in Brinkley for the train to Little Rock, when they saw multiple masked faces waiting outside of their hotel. Todd was able to escape on foot to a train station nine miles from Brinkley but he died from his wounds upon reaching Little Rock on April 23.","This episode reveals the increased racist sentiment in the South after Reconstruction. Racism became more and more evident as segregation began to spread into many different areas of everyday life. Churches had been biracial before the Civil War but some had become segregated before the Civil War, and racist sentiments obviously flared at Todd's attempt to intermingle the two races, even though they already shared a common faith. These strong and violent racial beliefs would result in even more attacks and cases of lynching as segregation continued to escalate. Todd's death showed this problem on a national level when the story was published in a New York newspaper, and yet the situation remained unchanged until the Civil Rights Movement. ","Todd's work with African Americans in the church draws attention to the increased involvement of African Americans in the church in the postbellum period, as well as the growth of the Methodist Church. Many African Americans turned to the church because they were able to fulfill leadership positions that were unavailable to them outside of it. The church became a way for African Americans to celebrate their new freedom that was being curtailed in many other areas of their lives. Southerners turned to the Methodist Church in general because it broke away from the mainstream denominations with which Southerners became increasingly disillusioned."],"display_date":"March 26, 1879 - April 23, 1879","search_date":"1879-04-09","locations":[{"id":750,"lat":34.8116378829,"lng":-92.2224128621,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3322,"title":"Tempering the Temperance Movement\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-02-19","end_date":"1842-02-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The<em> Newbern Spectator</em> published several articles about the new temperance movements starting up in New York, in Ireland, and in the Newbern area. It was a crusade for self-improvement and the industrial work ethic. One man from nearby Washington, N.C., only identified as 'A Free Drinker,' felt he had to speak up. In a letter to the editor, the writer reminded the reading public that there were two sides to the issue, and the logic of the temperance movement was flawed on many accounts. Not all those who drank were sordid drunks, as the temperance societies believed. These societies opposed the drinking of all liquor, never mind how good the quality or how small the quantity. Drinking was not an idle habit, but rather a stimulating social activity. Jovial parties and pleasant games went well with a glass of the best. The temperance societies would use the money from alcohol on things like clothing and education for the children, but the writer noted that dressing up children only corrupts them and makes them arrogant. He went on, And as to giving children an education, I am inclined to think the policy of it rather doubtful... You have no doubt heard, sir, of the great number of forgeries that have been made of late years on banks and merchants. Now if these guilty persons had never learned to read and write, could they have committed these forgeries? The rhetoric of sarcasm veiled his disregard for these moral reformers. He went on to reveal that his wife nearly forced him to join one of these temperance societies, but a friend informed him that pledging to join was a sin - and he could not commit a known sin As if to perfectly demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the temperance societies in east North Carolina, the same friend quipped, There was a great deal of liquor in town that had to be drank by somebody.","Temperance societies emerged around the same time in the North and the South, in the 1830s. Yet the issue did not seem to resonate with many Southerners, especially the wealthy population of the Carolina coast. Many historians believe the movement lagged behind in the South because its citizens feared that the cause of temperance was tied to the cause of abolitionism. The temperance unions that did form in the South always made their proslavery opinions publicly known. Yet, as Ian Tyrell notes, this notion does not explain the whole issue. Many southern slaveholders joined the temperance reformers, voicing concerns about the public drunkenness of slaves and free blacks. In fact, what the South lacked that the North possessed was a growing immigrant population and a social environment of urbanization. The people that supported the temperance movements in the South were not the farmers and planters: they were the artisans and merchants, the laboring middle class. These urban occupations were not as socially prominent in South. For the majority, the drunkards being discussed in the <em>Newbern Spectator</em> were more like fictional characters than everyday reality. Without an economic transformation, the South maintained much of its pre-industrial character that deterred modern social reforms from gaining a momentum."],"display_date":"February 19, 1842","search_date":"1842-02-19","locations":[{"id":9860,"lat":35.9347277088,"lng":-76.3834640216,"zoom":10,"place":"WASHINGTON, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3331,"title":"African American Religious Services\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-09-18","end_date":"1868-09-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In one edition of the <em>Page Valley Courier Newspaper</em> a reader asserts that The African Baptist Church is larger than any other Baptist church other than on in England.

The mass movements toward churches that occurred during and after the Second Great Awakening surprised white people. The churches that white people usually attended did not shout or sing loudly during sermons so the appearance of such large churches and groups of followers was very interesting.

Alcohol consumption was generally acceptable in the Western states and territories. Movements against it would not occur until a decade later. By 1831, there were temperance groups in every state except for Louisiana, but the movement would only have small levels of support and more in the eastern seaboard states than in the West. More striking was an old woman's participation in business, although slaveholding mistresses often took on a significant part in managing plantations. But to help a husband was one thing; for a woman to run her own business was quite another. While it was true that living on the frontier encouraged women to be just as creative and resourceful as men, the subordination of women had a strong foundation in the law. Anything a woman owned in most states passed to her husband when she married, but upon her husband's death, some women chose to run their businesses or plantations on their own. Perhaps this aged gentlewoman was one such case.","Traditionally in Southern society, as in much of the Western world in the nineteenth century, women were held subordinate to men, and it was not terribly different on the frontier. This ideology was especially useful in the Southern defense of slavery: just like a woman was subordinate to her father or husband, a slave was subordinate to his master. There was order in life, everyone had their place, and white men enjoyed equality as free men and masters over their families. So this napping old woman seemed an oddity in this natural hierarchy; she ran a business and trafficked in alcohol.

He was formerly enslaved in Virginia (his mother was still there) and worked for the Petersburg Intelligencer. He was known for his skill at the printing press. ","The owner believed that Tom had left Charleston by ship and perhaps had forged his own free papers. The owner thought he may have been pretending to need passage to a Camp Meeting. Camp Meetings were the religious craze of the era and were connected most with the Methodist Church. There was a camp meeting being held at a local creek, and it would have considered un-Christian to refuse passage of a black man to a religious service. Many whites justified slavery as a way to spread Christianity to people who would otherwise live without it. ","There were rewards for the return of Tom to the owner (B.S. Thomas) that increased depending on the effort involved in Tom's return. His description is given as 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, of a bright yellow complexion. Tom was not black (at least not fully), nor was he a stereotypical enslaved person. He was literate and worked in a trade for a major company. Clearly, he had some advantages afforded to him that many plantation field hands lacked and which put him in the perfect position to run away.","Charleston differed from many Southern towns and counties in its freedoms given to enslaved people. Slaves often took care of their own living arrangements and food, and made some (though very small) income. Charleston did not have the large plantations and thus it did not have the high demand for manual labor. Most owners hired out their slaves (most of whom were domestics or skilled in a trade) to other individuals to use. The owners were paid in return and were able to make profit off their slaves' work. Many slaves were allowed to retain some of the payment, and thus allowed some minor freedoms. This autonomy, and the ability of many Charleston slaves to read and write, made a lot of Charlestonians fear rebellion and runaways. Black people had to wear specific badges to identify them as free blacks or hired out slaves. The lack of a badge would indicate runaway status. Badges were often traded among slaves and free blacks, or counterfeited. Tom perhaps obtained a badge or other paperwork to certify he was free. Considering his education and connections, Tom would have been able to get away with a lot of things without being questioned. ","The belief that Tom escaped via ship was reflected in a general fear of runaway slaves through the port that had led to legislation in 1822.

E. Edwards preached at length to a great crowd at the Granby Street Methodist Church, concerning the proper role of women. He claimed Eve's involvement in the first human sin left her with certain characteristics that trickled down to even the women seated there before him. In all women, Edwards claimed one found a frailty, a mental nature of modesty and affection, and a subjection to man. By no means did such tendencies position a woman to a role inferior to men; on the contrary, the two genders must work together, albeit in different realms of society. As man must participate in worldly affairs, women, more delicate in bodily frame, and more sensitive in mental endowments, instinctively demean a quieter and secluded life. Having succeeded in capturing the attention of the men and women seated before him, Edwards delegated specific duties to women, like rearing children and looking after the morals of society in general. The reverend culminated the ablest sermon on such matters, by exhorting all women, who wish to fulfill their roles, to feel the waters of baptism and embrace Christ, as that would be their only means to affect proper influence."," Edward's message illustrates a great social dilemma that faced the country, especially in the postwar South, as many different views of proper women had emerged. White, Southern females, often belied the stereotypes of languid Southern womanhood, while at the same time, as a result of war, females had carved out a greater measure of independence. When men left to fight, women found themselves running the economic situation at home, and if husbands never returned from the fighting, they became the head of the household. Still devoted to traditional values of quiet resolve and working their good influence within the church and home, women, nonetheless, seemed to crave more. Common with the era, women set about forming all sorts of civic and religious organizations aimed at improving society, yet also this trend reflected a desire for greater influence and authority."," In the North, females became much more apt to move towards achieving political freedoms, most specifically the right to vote. Suffragists combined their cause with the Radical Republicans, during Reconstruction, who sought to enfranchise former slaves. Eventually, they found themselves humiliated and betrayed by those they had supported, when the 15 Amendment gave only black men the right to vote. These developments certainly scared Southern gentlemen, so used to thinking of their women a particular way, and they became forced to confront, possibly, a new role for women. Their response, evidenced by Reverend Edward's paternalistic argument, became to try to use women's proper influence to reassert the Southern values of the past. Women were to be preservers of tradition and perpetuate antebellum values, but women themselves would answer the same dilemma in different ways over time. Though, by 1876, in Norfolk at least, they seemed content to abide in accordance with their preacher's biblical rationalization.

In his sermon, Elliot compared the plight of Southern citizens to that of the biblical figure Ezra who is thought to have led 5,000 Israelite exiles living in Babylon to Jerusalem in 459 B.C. As quoted from Elliot?s sermon, ?We find ourselves in a condition which calls for a wisdom superior to our own, for a power greater than we can control. A day of darkness and of gloominess has unexpectedly settled down upon us, and without being able to perceive any natural causes sufficient to account for it, we are conscious that ?our hands hang down and that our knees are feeble,? and that we are in peril of our cause.?"," Southerners assumed God was fighting on their side during the Civil War. But even believing this, many white citizens of the South still needed to be reassured from time to time. In the spring of 1863 the Confederacy had started to turn the tide on the war against the Union with military triumphs in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville while Southern forces moved north into the underbelly of Pennsylvania. But following a crushing defeat at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in early July and a hasty retreat back across the Mason-Dixon Line, Southern spirits in late August of 1863 were low. "," Perhaps sensing this, Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America, issued a proclamation that declared Friday August 21, 1863 ?a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer.? Davis asked that all ?people who believeth that the Lord reigneth and that his overruling Providence ordereth all things--to unite in prayer and humble submission under his chastening hand, and to beseech his favor on our suffering country.? "," Elliot?s sermon was delivered in accordance with Davis? proclamation but it was not the first time that the Confederate war effort was aided through the involvement of religious denominations. In Georgia, church congregations collected goods and supplies and distributed them amongst Confederate soldiers. Preachers, like Elliot, who was elected the first Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Georgia in 1840, often propagated intense biblical ideologies, tying the Confederate struggle against the Northern oppressors to that of a Holy crusade. Religious revivals were also frequently held as a means to boost morale. "," Citizens in the South took heavy solace in the belief that God, a higher power, was watching over their struggle. In times of vulnerability, it was not uncommon for citizens of any stature to turn to the Lord in search of comfort and vindication of their religious convictions."],"display_date":"August 21, 1863","search_date":"1863-08-21","locations":[{"id":1632,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3415,"title":"A Good Christian\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-01-01","end_date":"1851-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As a sociable southerner, one expected certain attributes from you: manners, dress that suited your means, Christianity.

Shipley. In order to construct the building, the church had to rely on generous donations. The end result of the project was very successful. The building was constructed in a gothic style, with cathedral glass windows. Unlike most churches, however, the pews were semicircular.

In the wake of the Civil War, many Southerners faced serious cultural and religious crises. Charles Wilson points out that southerners needed a force to bind their local communities together after Southern culture was shattered by the war. Organized religion answered this need. Furthermore, religion provided comfort to those suffering from poverty. After the devastation of the war, Southerners were left to grapple with difficult religious issues, such as the nature of evil and the reason for suffering. Out of the post Civil War period came a religious orientation distinctly Southern and supported by local churches. Southerners placed emphasis on moral virtue and order rather than democracy. They believed that God tests those He loves most and that a great destiny might await them. In addition, Southerners established a link between religious values and their Confederate history. Some church windows, for example, were adorned with Confederate images. Confederate artifacts also seemed to develop religious ties. According to Wilson, the Daughters of the Confederacy, for example, felt the bible that Jefferson Davis was sworn in on had particular spiritual value. Churches also created hymns recalling episodes from the Civil War. The ability to find comfort in religion and to use it to come to terms with their defeat played an important role in helping the South to heal and rebuild.

Upon Kosciusko's death in 1817, he had left the fund to his longtime acquaintance and fellow son of liberty, Thomas Jefferson. In September 1825, B.L. Lear wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson Randolph, grandson of Jefferson and apparent heir to his estate, regarding a specific plan for the education of free blacks. The core of Lear's plan was to purchase young slaves and for them Education in plain literature & mechanical arts, and at a proper age transport them to the Colony in Africa to be as useful there as they may. Lear's letter also related to Randolph the following information about Jefferson's attitude toward the fund he approved very heartily the plan I then proposed to adopt, tho' he declined to give any advice or express any opinion in the matter, considering himself - now without authority."," Lear wrote this letter shortly after meeting with northern groups dedicated to the education of free blacks. The African School in New Jersey had been established in 1817 by the Presbyterian Synod of New York. New York Protestants created the school for the specific the goal of instructing blacks as preachers and teachers. Once free black people received such an education, they could be sent to Liberia or Haiti to help establish stable societies. This plan accorded with the vision of the American Colonization Society, a national initiative established in 1818, which channeled white efforts to cautiously deal with the slavery question. Whites Americans who supported plans in which education and colonization for blacks went hand in hand tended not to address a related question: If, as they believed, free blacks could become good citizens of an overseas colony through education, why could they not do so in America? Most free blacks roundly opposed colonization; they preferred to remain in the only country their family had known for generations, and work there for the freedom of black Americans still in slavery. Only about 15,000 free American blacks moved to Liberia over three decades time. Of those who did colonize, many professed a desire to spread Christianity by missionary work.","Despite the ideological support groups of white Americans sometimes afforded plans to educate blacks, and widespread backing among African Americans themselves, the support often took inadequate financial form. The African School of New Jersey ran out of money within a few years after its establishment. As it turns out, Kosciusko's fund could not be used to support it as Lear and Randolph had hoped.

The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one.

Five northern students were dismissed for trying to introduce their Abolitionism into the college, into its literary societies, and into the church, according to the college president and founder, famed Restoration minister Alexander Campbell. On October 12th the A.L. Institute, a college literary society, was holding a debate on the topic of The Right of Christians to Engage in War when a student, Mr. Everest of Ohio, remarked that 'the arguments from the Bible to sustain war, polygamy, and slavery belong in the same category.' The following Sunday night, another young student from Ohio, Mr. Way, again pressed the issue when speaking of Satan's misquoting and misapplying the scriptures when he tempted our Savior - he remarked that 'Satan's emissaries often misquote and misapply Scripture to sustain intemperance, spiritualism, and slavery.' On this night, the challenge was not ignored by the southern students present but called forth many threats and expressions of indignation. These two students, along with three of their classmates, were promptly expelled.","Little is known of what happened to these young abolitionists, though there is evidence that they returned north and told their story to several newspapers in the upper Midwest. But it is the use of Biblical scripture to argue against slavery that stands out in this narrative. The radical Christian reform movement was reaching its zenith around the 1850s with the rise of the religious abolitionist movement, as well as the temperance and pacifist movements.","Highlighted in the student's arguments, however, is one of the tensions inherent in antebellum religious reasoning against slavery. The Christian anti-slavery movement faced a difficult problem in refuting the southern slaveholder's claims that a literal interpretation of the Bible supported slavery. Thus, the question for the abolitionists became how to repudiate slavery in the Bible without refuting all scripture. Everest and Way addressed this problem by linking the Bible's support of slavery to its support of other practices widely acknowledged as socially unacceptable, like polygamy. They also linked slavery to the other major reform movements of the time by mentioning intemperance and war. But their argument also raises the issue of where to draw the line on literal biblical interpretation. This issue became a theological quagmire for many Christian abolitionists at the time, difficult to escape, and one that limited effective use of the Bible in the argument against the South's peculiar institution.","This story is indicative of the high tensions and conflicts that prevailed among all levels of American society at this time, North and South, abolitionist and slave-owner, theologian and educator, especially over the issue of slavery. The Bible would soon be interpreted in a very different way, as both the North and the South would use passages to support their separate causes in the Civil War.

If it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord. Choose ye this day whom you will serve. Mr. Spriggs, the young Methodist minister who delivered this message in Lewisburg in 1830, awed Whitehead with his forceful words to the point that he attended church twice that day. Whitehead knew that one day the young gentleman would be a religious personality to be reckoned with in that West Virginia town. Whitehead also noted how Spriggs effectively used a passage in one of the Books of the Corinthians to urge the congregation to faith, to test its members on their faith, and to force these churchgoers to examine their lives in light of the powerful words of scripture."," Whitehead had ended up in Lewisburg for the day by accident, but made full use of his time by exploring the town and its Presbyterian and Methodist churches. While his stagecoach took a rest day, he attended church and wrote in detail about it. Whitehead's rich description of such religious experiences indicates that they were important to him. "," Evangelical Protestantism appealed to southerners like Whitehead in a number of ways. Offering them salvation, a language for understanding their world, and a religious community, it comforted them. While still critical of aristocratic values, nineteenth-century evangelicalism also carried with it a more refined social code of moral responsibility and self-control focused on the state of the soul. Southerners happily used this code to polish their rough society. The evangelicals' focus on social stability also appealed to many southerners because it regulated socially unacceptable behavior."," With the Second Great Awakening also just coming to an end, it is no wonder that religion played an important role in Whitehead's life. This new religiosity was emotional and inspired Christians across America to commit more deeply to a new kind of spirituality. It was a challenge to Calvinism and older Christian denominations because it was led by compelling leaders who felt duty-bound to fix American morality. Baptists, Presbyterians, and Methodists dominated this new era because they gave people a choice: come with us and be saved or wallow in iniquity with the other damned. They drew converts in great numbers because they convinced people of their deep sin, tortured them with the knowledge of their righteous condemnation from God, and freed them with the promise of salvation through Christ. "," In the South, campmeeting revivals littered the landscape and yanked the populace out of its religious complacency.

A Methodist preacher had been teaching the colored people out of catechism No. 1 - teaching them at the plantations, when a Baptist minister heard of his efforts and raised the alarm. The Baptist quickly called a meeting and began to denounce the practice of preaching to the slaves through the catechism. Not all in the audience were convinced by the harangue, however, and one member of the Methodist church declared that her mind was not changed at all; the missionaries would still teach her servants out of the catechism if they would. Eventually, the Baptist minister retired and gave up the idea of convincing the Methodists of the evils of the catechism. ","During the religious awakenings of the nineteenth century, the practice of converting large numbers of slaves to Christianity became more acceptable. Prior to that, slave Christianity was a problematic issue because of the ethics of one Christian holding another in bondage. In the late eighteenth century, Methodists in particular took a strong anti-slavery stand, but were overruled by the laity in the southern states. With the advent of evangelicalism and a new emphasis on personal salvation, however, Christianity came to be seen as a way to control and pacify slaves, and most white preachers emphasized the idea of obedience to those in bondage. Many sermons centered on the idea of obeying an earthly master as one was required to obey a heavenly one. Therefore, the idea of a white minister teaching scripture to slaves was not only accepted, but often encouraged. ","Problems arose, however, when reading became a part of the equation. Knowledge for a slave in the antebellum South was power, and the ability to read and write allowed slaves to forge passes and freedom papers to help them escape. While few southern states actually had laws preventing slave literacy, it was generally discouraged by the whites in power. Therefore, the use of a catechism to preach to slaves was socially contentious, and in some places, illegal. Even the possibility that blacks might learn to read made whites nervous, and so the catechism became a front page issue in slaveholding states like Virginia. ","For many slaves, both church and the Bible became important tools in the quest for literacy. Often slaves would memorize passages during church services and then look them up in secret. In this way, slaves taught themselves to spell and then later, to read. The same problem arose with the catechism. If slaves could memorize passages from the book and then find them later, the book could become another way to learn to recognize words. The narrative also reflects the competition for converts between the different denominations of the Protestant church. In the early years of the Great Revival, Baptists and Methodists in particular fought for control of different populations, as seen in the Baptist minister's determination to address the Methodist missionaries' congregation.

While this would be of note in itself, of special interest is that in his will, according to the <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, General Blackburn liberated his forty slaves on the condition that they would immigrate to Liberia. Their trip was paid by his estate. No mention is made if the slaves reached Liberia, or if his wife, who survived him by five years, liberated the enslaved peoples immediately following his death. The <em>Annals </em>do stress his evangelical Christianity, including an excerpt of his will in which General Blackburn writes,  I die, as I trust, a Christian, believing as I must in the doctrine for the atonement by the death, the suffering and mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ..."," General Blackburn was not alone in Augusta County in his desire to send enslaved peoples to Africa. In December of 1831, a petition with the signatures of 28 Augusta men was sent to the Virginia Legislature asking for their support of United States Constitutional amendment which would give the United States Congress the ability to raise and appropriate money to transport free persons of color to the coast of Africa, and also, the power to purchase slaves then transport them likewise."," A belief in slavery was anything but static in the white South. Rather, opinions on thepeculiar institution varied widely. Melvin Ely's <em>Israel on the Appamattox</em>, recounts how slaves from Prince Edward County, Virginia, are set free, given land, and co-exist relatively peacefully with their white neighbors for over forty years. Yet Ely also notes that Blackburn's response, Colonization, was not uncommon among whites with qualms about slavery, although informal surveys taken just after Nat Turner's revolt seemed to show that much of Virginia's enslaved black population had little desire to move from their birthplace to Africa.

Because of the nature of the gale that had blown ashore that blustery Charleston day, all five were presumed dead. The slaves were: Jefferson and George, property of Mr. J. Jeannerett, Ned of Mr. Mellichamp, William of Mrs. C. Macbeth, and a slave boy, Issac, of Mrs. Hughes. Although other had occupied a boat a short distance ahead of them, it, too, was in a dangerous situation and could not come to the rescue of the slaves' vessel. The storm that took place that windy August day caused many additional losses. Because the tide rose to an unprecedented height, most of the Charleston's wharves were covered in water. In addition, many streets were submerged on the Western side of the city. Some residents had to be rescued from their homes by boat. ","The influence of the weather on the antebellum South was a great one. Many of the city's slave owners chose rice as their main crop. If rice fields, some of which were located in close proximity to the city, became too flooded, then the harvest that year would be abominable. In addition, storms like these sometimes caused some of Charleston's more precious architectural resources to be destroyed. So much of Southern history can be and has been lost in events of Mother Nature. Environmental constraints pressured the inhabitants of a city like Charleston to adapt to different ways of life depending on the natural disaster.","Another important issue brought up by this newspaper clipping, which was clipped from a newspaper and placed in the Journal of Charles Heyward, a Charleston resident, concerns the relative freedom that Charleston slaves possessed. Slaves were permitted to be hired out by their owners to others, allowing bondsmen to diversify their skills. Because they could accept earnings for their services, sometimes they were able to buy their freedom. Slaves were also permitted to attend church services with their master. In addition, they were allowed to participate in other leisurely activities, such as fishing, because many did not live on their master's property. Those who did usually lived in separate quarters, so they could come and go with relative ease. Many Charlestonian masters allowed these activities, especially around this time period, in order to appear like benevolent Christian masters in an effort to suppress the idea that slavery was a cruel institution. However, others felt that allowing slaves this much freedom would cause insubordination and deterioration of the institution of slavery, as shown by historian David R. Goldfield. He also contradicts Bernard E. Power's book, <em>Black Charlestonians</em>, by noting that even though some slaves were able to diversify their skills through this freedom, many had skill levels that remained low, even lower than slaves on working rice and cotton plantations. This newspaper article shows that, although the situation of slave freedom ended perilously for the poor men in a boat, slaves in the greater Charleston city area enjoyed many more opportunities than those in other areas."],"display_date":"August 1, 1842","search_date":"1842-08-01","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3531,"title":"The Great Fire of Charleston and its Cultural Awakening\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-04-27","end_date":"1838-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 27, 1838, an enormous fire broke out in Charleston, South Carolina, around 9:00 pm. It raged until noon the next day, damaging over 1,000 buildings. It ruined many businesses, a new hotel, several churches, a new theater, and the entire market except for the fish section. Many houses were burnt to the ground. In efforts to put the fire out, all the water in the city pumps was used. In addition, several people died in the flames. Most famously, Charleston's Trinity Church was burned. Another important building that fell victim was the new hotel that had been recently built. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. The fire rendered penniless many who were wealthy. The total monetary loss amounted to about 3,000,000, a sum even more significant in nineteenth century Charleston than today. ","A newspaper article mentioned that several slaves died in the fire, but declined to name them, unlike the many white victims who were named. This reflected the social hierarchy. A long obituary was even given for Colonel Charles John Steedman, a Naval Officer stationed in Charleston, on account of his exemplary citizenship both before and during the fire. Additionally, several prominent store owners are listed as having died attempting to save their stores. Ironically, the fire did not cause Charleston's demise. Rather, it caused a great cultural awakening as many homes and business were rebuilt or repaired. ","The Great Fire of 1838 had a far-reaching impact on the city of Charleston. In many ways, it helped to put Charleston on the map as a great cultural and architectural center. Although previous to the fire only a few homes were styled in the Greek Revival, many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued and made Charleston one of the foremost places to view Greek Revival architecture. The Gothic Revival also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion. This may have also represented an effort to portray the slaveholders who were attending these churches are benevolent, Christian men and women. Gothic was not used for state buildings, however, as James Patrick confirms in his article Ecclesiological Gothic in the Antebellum South. In addition to being used for religious buildings in Charleston, the use of the Gothic, according to Patrick, reflected an attempt to portray Southern locales such as Charleston in the most romantic light possible. Southerners were fighting to keep their culture alive, especially in state like South Carolina, where there was constantly talk of nullification and states rights after the Nullification Crisis. All in all, the art and architecture of Charleston had great implications for a city rebuilt after a horrific fire."],"display_date":"April 27, 1838","search_date":"1838-04-27","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3535,"title":"Christianity as a Justification for Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-09-29","end_date":"1835-09-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Slave owners had many justifications for why holding people in bondage was acceptable. From the idea that African Americans were a lesser race who needed taking care of by white patriarchs to the economic justification, slave owners were always trying to find new ways to dispute those who disagreed with their choice to hold others in captivity. Charleston slave holders were no exception in attempting to find justifications to mask their guilt. Often, religion came into play, on both the slavery and anti-slavery sides of the debate. In 1835, at the end of two long articles about religion and slavery in the Charleston Mercury, it was said that both the Old and New Testament give permission to hold others as slaves. In the Old Testament, God and the Patriarchs approve. As for the New Testament, Jesus and the Apostles show that slavery is permissible. Therefore, slavery, to those who wrote the article, was not an anti-Christian institution. It was just the opposite. Furthermore, they added, it is impious to say slavery is anti-Christian because such a conclusion contradicted God. ","Such extremist beliefs were common in the slavery/antislavery debate. Slaveholders believed that slavery would liberate Africans from their savage-like ways, especially if they were infused with Christianity. As religion ran deep through slavery, white Christian slaveholders argued that slavery was a necessary evil because it would control the sinful, less humane, black race. ","Slave owners, beginning in the 1830s, began to permit black religious gatherings in some forms. In addition, Charleston slaves and free blacks were allowed to attend church with their owners. However, previous slave revolts like Virginia's Nat Turner caused worry that religion would make slaves think they had the right to be free. Turner experienced religious visions that caused him to believe that revolt was divinely ordained. Slaves allowed by their masters to worship were closely monitored thereafter.","Even though the article in <em>The</em> <em>Charleston Mercury</em> claimed that Jesus supported slavery, the Biblical truth is, according to J. Albert Harrill, that Jesus was remarkably silent on the slavery issue. He never outright named it explicitly as a sin. Both sides of the slavery/anti-slavery debate used this ambiguity to their advantage, embellishing the details that supported their case. The slaveholding South stretched the truth and claimed that Jesus permitted slavery. The anti-slavery North claimed that Jesus never said sodomy, blasphemy, and idolatry were sins, even though to Christians, they clearly are. The word of the Lord, to them, did not have to spell out what was right and wrong. Overall, both sides of the debate used religion to their advantage, stretching the truth wherever necessary to help their cause, just as in this article from <em>The Charleston Mercury</em>."],"display_date":"September 29, 1835","search_date":"1835-09-29","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3569,"title":"The Formation of an African American Church\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-01","end_date":"1874-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["For much of the first half of the nineteenth century, most of the churches in Washington with black members were overseen by white pastors and leaders. As a result, many of the black members felt alienated, while many of the white members were eager to disassociate themselves. Thus, it was a major breakthrough for the black citizens of Washington, D.C., at the Civil War's end, when the white pastors of the Little Ebeneezer Methodist Episcopal Church were replaced with black ministers. Within less than ten years, in 1874, the property of the (now-white) church from which it had split, was given to the black Little Ebeneezer Church. This allowed for the church to build up a large congregation and to become one of the leading black churches within the city.","Black churches underwent significant growth in the years following the Civil War and Reconstruction.

Miss Baldwin even noted that there were no deaths that year. She also believed that the school had succeeded in teaching the pupils practical skills for life and a deeper sense of their personal responsibility to God. The school gave awards for many different subjects, including Latin, French, German, Faithful Practice on Piano, and English composition.

According to Janet James, the question of to what extent women should be educated was entertained by everyone and in magazines, novels, plays and books. Three young women received diplomas in Music, but four young women received diplomas in Book-keeping, an economically and domestically practical education. Baldwin had been a pupil at the school and her tenure as principal led to the name change to Mary Baldwin College, also reflecting the more public role of women as leaders in education in the second half of the nineteenth century and fulfilling Beecher's desire.

In the evening, the colored people of the city met and formed a group called the Afro-American League. They wrote a preamble and resolutions against the laws requiring separate railroad cars and waiting rooms for blacks and whites. While demanding change in the law, they also wished to educate the population. Their league's object shall be the creation of a healthy public opinion and they will use the church, the press, meetings, and the court system to appeal the laws. "," Whether this League is a branch of the Afro-American League, founded in 1890, is hard to determine from this one article in the <em>Staunton Spectator</em> and Vindicator, the weekly paper for Augusta County. The paper did not say it is, and only listed the fourth resolution. The members said they were organizing a league to be known as the Afro-American League and not anything about being a branch league. The paper made no comment for this event and ran no other articles that day which had racism, black people, or blacks' rights as the subject. There were not any follow-up articles the next week either."," By 1891, Reconstruction had ended, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments had been passed, and Jim Crow laws regulating railroads were already in effect. Jim Crow had not fully seized the South though, and Booker T. Washington and Tuskegee Institute were working for blacks' rights. C. Vann Woodward has noted that by 1890, the hope that Reconstruction and the Civil War had brought was nearly gone. Edward Ayers, however, has noted the uncertainty and lack of concrete rules and regulations governing the South in the 1880's. He also intimated that newspapers bear some of the blame for inciting tension because of their stories and skewed coverage of blacks. This type of story of a meeting was not uncommon because black people continuously worked to retain their rights and gain new ones. They saw themselves losing the enfranchisement and losing the possibility of gaining political positions in society. Meetings like the one in Staunton were not everyday occurrences but groups such as the Afro-American League were beginning to form and trying to exert some influence in towns and cities. A South Carolina woman wrote in her diary that, The negroes are evidently in an excited state. It is important to note that the black people of Staunton had a plan of action. They did not meet to complain about their situation but to improve it. They had a document that explained their goals and beliefs. They knew they had to act and knew that using the court system and press were the best routes. This minority group in a city with 7,289 inhabitants in 1900 made their presence and wishes known to everyone and to those many other readers in the surrounding counties.

That much was certain as they traveled to Washington D.C. from their rural home with Margaret's sister on Christmas Eve, 1877. What wasn't quite so certain was where in the city they could go to hold the ceremony. When they came upon a group of reporters waiting outside City Hall they anxiously asked how, where, and how fast they could be wed. Luckily, the reporters were just the people to ask.  ","Some of the reporters got them through the door of City Hall and to the Marshal's apartment, while others joined forces with some bailiffs to locate a marriage license and someone to officiate the ceremony. It took hardly any time at all before the two were wed in the Criminal Courtroom by none other then Reverend Byron Sunderland himself, who had come running to perform the marriage. This was the very first marriage in the Criminal Courtroom, which was usually the site of proceedings of a very different nature. That a marriage between two black youths could occur in an unconventional location with the help of all kinds of residents of the city of Washington was symbolic of the progress that the nation was trying to make toward equality for all men. ","However, this example of a spur-of-the-moment public wedding between two young, black individuals is more of an anomaly concerning how the idea of citizenship for freed black Americans actually materialized in real life. As David Herbert Donald points out, despite the fact that racial equality had largely been legislated by the 1870s, not everyone was as accommodating as the folks in Washington were that day.  In many parts of the South, there was no one to enforce the kind of treatment the law demanded. Washington D.C. stands out, at least in this example, as a more progressive part of the South, more in touch with the ideals for which the nation's legislators were striving. The Republicans who were in office had passed many laws requiring equal treatment in public spaces for black and white alike; in the case of this marriage in the courtroom, this idea was taken a step further, and the reporters were thrilled to be catching the first marriage in a criminal court room, a marriage of two black people no less.

After marveling at the flowers and other wares, they decided to attend a nearby women's rights meeting. Jennie was not very impressed, despite being entertained by the goings on. She couldn't understand how women's lives and the state of things would be improved if women were given the right to vote. Not really very bothered, she and Clara finished their day with a trip to the dentist and dinner with family and friends.  ","Despite her nonchalance about the idea of women's suffrage, as viewed in this moment in her life, Jennie was an extremely self-empowered young woman. Her dedication to living a life full of education, religion, and social activities and events of all kinds is evident throughout her diary.

","Jennie's disinterest in the women's suffrage movement may then seem peculiar. However, Jennie was a Southerner, and the South was emerging from the Reconstruction Era in 1888. As the historian Louise M. Young explains, there was bitter resentment engendered in the South by the Reconstruction policies: a resentment that hardened into an emotional block against enfranchising women that was never resolved. Jennie enjoyed her life tremendously, from what she wrote in her diary, and enfranchisement wasn't going to add anything to her life that she felt she needed. In fact, the South felt that all the effort that had put forth in enfranchising black Americans during Reconstruction had created far more harm than good.

The movement was a period of intense religious activism that trickled down from northern, urban cities and affected Protestant denominations with a heightened sense of social activism. Bettie V. Jones, a resident of Fluvanna County, Virginia, received numerous letters from family and friends, including her husband, William J. Payne, and various other people from and around Charlottesville, Virginia. According to the letters, the Payne family was prominent in the political sphere of central Virginia; included in the letters is a mention of the 1852 Whig convention and the upcoming election, along with a seating chart for the House of Delegates for the 1853-54 session. Jones, a Methodist herself, corresponded with a few Albemarle County residents about the Charlottesville Methodist Church revival, an event that was probably similar to the countless other religious awakenings sweeping the nation that sought to, among other things, counter the assertion that the Bible was fallible. ","Of particular interest to the historian in the collection is a letter addressed to Jones from a family member in Arkansas, a slave state admitted in 1836 on the condition that Michigan was admitted in 1837 as a free state. The issue of runaway slaves is addressed in the letter, a contentious subject that caused a great deal of strife among slaveholders and non-slaveholders alike. The Fugitive Slave Law, enacted in 1850, was established in response to the demands from the South for more stringent and detailed Federal legislation concerning the rights of slaveholders and the punishment of runaway slaves. This controversial law further divided those for and against slavery, prompting the increase in the number of abolitionists and the inception and increased efficiency of the Underground Railroad. ","The central tension that is elucidated in the letters to Bettie V. Jones is that of the revivalist spirit and increased moral awareness of southern Americans coupled with the institution of slavery. The collective conscience of the American South was at a crossroads in the 1850s; on one hand, the comfortably profitable lifestyle many southerners had grown accustomed to depended on slave labor as the backbone of their economic system while, conversely, the Third Great Awakening signified a renewal of vigor and strength in relation to the importance of personal religion. In 1845, some slaveholding states left the official Methodist Church to form their own branch, one that condoned slavery on the basis of moral justification by invoking God's will and the examples of slavery in the Bible. The Third Great Awakening focused on the intertwining of religion in the public and private sphere, a relationship that forced both community leaders and citizens to evaluate their beliefs in order to steer clear of hypocrisy. Bettie V. Jones, along with the other central Virginians who experienced the awakening, grappled with the inherent moral and social contradictions presented by religion and slavery that created an unsolvable dilemma, one that only a schism could reconcile."],"display_date":"1849 - 1856","search_date":"1852-12-31","locations":[{"id":13819,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3609,"title":"The Truth About Mormonism\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-04-03","end_date":"1880-04-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was April 3rd, 1880. Ellen E. Dickinson was about to record the official statement of Mrs. Matilda Spaulding McKinstry's, describing her understanding of the connection between her father's Manuscript Found and the infamous Joseph Smith's Mormon Bible. The connection between the old romantic manuscript and the piece of religious writing was about to expose the real, and far less celestial, origins of the Mormon religion. This story could potentially blow the lid off of the mysterious genesis of Mormonism; Ellen was about to get the interview that would finally show that Joseph Smith's Mormon religion had its roots in an old, unpublished story written by an Ohio gentleman in 1812, and most certainly <em>not</em> in some gold plates divinely revealed to Mr. Smith.   ","Mrs. M. S. McKinstry was the daughter of one Reverend Solomon Spaulding, who happened to be Ellen's great-uncle. Naturally, Ellen's interest in her family's potential link to what was looking to be like a religious conspiracy was great. Rev. Spaulding created the Manuscript Found after discovering bones and relics in some mounds of earth behind their Conneaut, Ohio home when McKinstry was just a girl. As Ellen interviewed Mrs. McKinstry and recorded her statement, the events that began with the creation of the fantastical Manuscript Found by Rev. Spaulding and ultimately led to the creation of the Mormon Bible by Joseph Smith started to become clear; Mrs. McKinstry's account confirmed that family and friends who had heard the manuscript read aloud as a fictional narrative in 1812 noticed the gross similarities between it and the Mormon Bible.  Mrs. McKinstry affirmed that her father had lent the manuscript to a publisher for some time, at which point it could have been copied or replicated. Whatever the case, McKinstry was asserting that many who knew of the contents of the manuscript would swear it was the source of the Mormon Bible. Ellen had recorded the words that would end the debate on the validity of Mormonism for good. ","Ellen Dickinson's interview was extremely significant to the religious dynamic of the South in the late 19th century. Historians David F. Boone and David Buice explain that Mormonism never became mainstream in the South, and Mormons were persecuted for their unique religion which promoted scripture outside the Bible and espoused other departures from the Christian faith. The Mormons had migrated West in the 1830s due to persecution from Christians who felt threatened by their doctrine, but they began to conduct missionary work in the South after the Civil War. They were fairly successful in spreading the Mormon faith, and because of that success, they were persecuted even more violently than before. It was in this environment that Ellen Dickinson chronicled an interview that she hoped would invalidate Mormonism and eradicate the threat she believed it posed on Southern life."],"display_date":"April 3, 1880","search_date":"1880-04-03","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3622,"title":"Vestry Meeting in Bedford County, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-07-27","end_date":"1839-07-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Religion permeated every aspect of nineteenth century life for many Southerners. The congregations of St. Stephan's Episcopal and Trinity Churches of Bedford County, Virginia were no different. In the minutes of St. Stephan's Episcopal and Trinity Churches' vestry meeting, the close bond between pastor and congregation was more than apparent. Although their pastor, Reverend Nicholas H. Cobb, was leaving their parish for another in hopes of advancing the Church at large, the congregants were somewhat apprehensive to welcome a new pastor. The congregants of St. Stephan's and Trinity Churches had an even greater reason for concern, being that Reverend Cobb's replacement, Reverend Andrew's was a northerner from Pennsylvania no less."," Though the gospel of the Episcopal Church mirrored itself in both the North and the South, groups and individuals outside of the Church used scripture along with their regional location either to advocate for or against slavery. Outside of the debate over slavery, religion played a large role in lives of nineteenth-century individuals; however, many southern churches tired to skirt political and social issues. During the antebellum period, southern churches and church leaders avoided getting involved in social issues particularly those pertaining to race. Consequently, southern churches generally did not participate in efforts toward social change. Southside Virginians were especially adept at using scripture in defense of slavery. And though Reverend Cobb most likely never made any reference to the merits of slavery or the need for the abolition of the institution, the parishioners were leery of a northern reverend adhering to such customs.

While in Suffolk, Riddick studied under a Mr. Wright, from whom he learned about and gained interest in religion. Riddick later moved to Prince Edward County, Virginia where he kept an elaborate journal of his daily life. While in Prince Edward County, Riddick became a member of a local Baptist church. In his journal, Riddick mentioned how lost his soul was prior to joining the church. Furthermore, in his journal, Riddick emphatically apologized for neglecting to have written for a span of two weeks. He went on to explain that the reason for his neglect was that he was preoccupied by his church's revival.

By the nineteenth century, Evangelical Christianity became an integral part of the Southern tapestry. Church revivals were and still are a way in which Evangelists disseminate their beliefs and achieve their goal of winning additional souls for Christ. Evangelist revivals often spanned a course of a weekend or even a week, at the commencement of the revival the Evangelicals set their goals knowing their salvation through an experience of Jesus Christ. It was probably through an experience with Christ during the revival, which made Riddick realize he would like to conduct his life in a more Christ-like manner. Furthermore, evangelical Christianity looked down on the rowdy nature of some Southerners, urging them to turn to the Lord and let go of their worldly ways-this may account for Riddick's apologies for his past transgressions."],"display_date":"October 17, 1833","search_date":"1833-10-17","locations":[{"id":14168,"lat":37.2365347972,"lng":-78.4710141577,"zoom":10,"place":"PRINCE EDWARD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3631,"title":"Regulators in Louisiana Dismantle a Secretive Group\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-02-17","end_date":"1893-02-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["David Stern, a prominent storekeeper in Amity City, a city in Tangipahoa, Louisiana, was the leader of a secret society. The organization - an oath-bound society, complete with grips, signs, and password and the ultimate goal of banishing Jewish merchants, wealthy residents, and negroes from the well-populated parish of Tangipahoa - was highly guarded and only wanted a very small set of people to know of its existence. In selecting members, the group had to be especially careful to not approach the wrong men to join. However, they did exactly that, thus making the clan and its goals well known. Unfortunately for Stern, regulators were notified of the group and served notice on him to leave the area. The other members of the society were given warnings as well, and like Stern, they ignored their seriousness. Nevertheless, Stern and his cohorts did not pay any attention to the notifications, and later regulators sent them more. In an effort to remain in the area, Stern showed the warnings to several of his neighbors because he knew they would stay on his side - he was only a simple business man to them. The resultant publicity of this issue resulted in angry citizens and prompted regulators to force the group not to operate in the parish. "," In the late 1800s, white men and women of the South were still becoming accustomed to living in equality with those of differing race, religions, and viewpoints. Many were not ready to make the adjustment and stood stubbornly in their racist tracts. Groups like Stern's were not an uncommon result of white Southerner's views toward their changing lifestyle. A huge wave of Jewish immigration had just hit the United States, with tens of thousands of European Jews from Russia and Poland coming into the country. These immigrants had left Europe to flee persecution, but were unfortunately experiencing it in American, as well, where they thought they would be escaping it. Anti-Semitism was normalized in the U.S. by the 1800s, just like racism towards African Americans had been. Since the Jewish immigrants had a greater opportunity to be educated in Europe and African Americans did not have as much of a chance to be in the U.S., white citizens were very threatened by the Jew's existence in their country and thought they had a greater potential to take jobs from them, and therefore intervene in the business world and the economy. The first large scale movement against the Jews and other minorities was in 1852 in the organization of the Know-Nothing or American Party, whose creed could be summed up in two words: Americanism and Protestantism. This party, however, quickly split once it entered the world of politics. Stern's group was reminiscent of the American Party's ideals. Though the Anti-Semitism that the Jewish immigrants faced in the U.S. was a serious issue, it was not as widespread and enduring as the racism felt towards African Americans. Stern's clan was a precursor to much more radical and powerful groups, like the Klu Klux Klan, a group advocating white supremacy, which emerged in 1915. Clearly, forcing his prejudice and racist group out of the parish of Tangipahoa was not a solution to the problem and was direct foreshadowing of the horrors to come.

The number of girls under the care of the Society was increased to twenty and a smallpox scare in the city required a visit from Society Physician Dr. Alex Whitehead for a round of vaccinations for all the girls. However, certainly the biggest event of the year happened in July when the Society received a letter from a generous citizen of the city. The letter was from the Executor of the will of Captain John Maxwell informing the Society that 2,500 had been bequeathed to them for the purpose of establishing an Asylum for Female Orphans. Additionally, Captain Maxwell's Executor had already purchased a lot on Brigg's Point for the new structure."," The 1816 annual report of the Female Orphan Society shows their elation at receiving such a large donation. The report states that they would desire... to proclaim our gratitude to our deceased benefactor & to God, the inspirer of all good, for this generous gift which promises to perpetuate our institution as a lasting honor & blessing to the community. Their happiness is well understood when one considers the average yearly earnings of a small-time farmer during the era was well under one thousand dollars. Simply put, 2,500 was a lot of money."," The Female Orphan Society was not a fledgling organization. It was founded in 1804 by Norfolk women in order to provide a temporary home, education and training for indigent white girls, orphans or otherwise. In order to stay afloat, the organization relied on the generosity of private individuals, churches, relief agencies, and finally clubs or other organizations to provide food, clothing, education for the wards, and wages for Society employees. The fact that after twelve years the organization had not yet acquired their own building shows the difficulty of financing a charitable organization such as the Society. In fact, at the time the Society received the donation, they were just deciding that they had sufficient funds to attempt to look for a lot for the construction of their own building. Such a large donation allowed the Society to build a larger building than perhaps they had hoped, enabling them to expand the breadth of their charitable work. Orphan Societies such as the Female Orphan Society of Norfolk factored greatly in the lives of America's poor children from the early nineteenth century until the 1920s. The Society of Norfolk was typical of these early institutions in that it was established to help female children and dealt mostly with children who had one or more parents living. These institutions served to help a family through tough times by providing for a child until the parent was able to do so themselves. The Norfolk Society was also indicative of Orphan Societies at the beginning of the nineteenth century in that it was entirely funded by private donations and managed by specific religious organizations. "," Orphan Societies began to be established in response to changes in the United States as a whole. During the early nineteenth century, American cities experienced massive growth due to European immigration. Cities grew by leaps and bounds and the population of urban poor grew with them. Additionally, the growth of wage labor often left many of these poor families unable to care for their children after a tragedy like the loss of a parent. Finally, improved transportation facilitated the easier spread of diseases like cholera, which led to a spike in the establishment of orphanages after an epidemic in the 1830s. By the Civil War, Orphan Societies had become very common across the United States and were thought of as being the best way to manage the upbringing and education of poor children outside of their own homes."],"display_date":"January 1, 1816 - January 1, 1817","search_date":"1816-07-02","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3643,"title":"Moses Austin&#39;s Final Move\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-07-17","end_date":"1830-07-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Moses Austin had been dead nine years when his final move came about. The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one. From politics to economics and the social realm, religion was an important influence in the South."],"display_date":"July 17, 1830","search_date":"1830-07-17","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3646,"title":"Annual Report of the Norfolk Bible Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-03-07","end_date":"1815-03-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In early 1815, a charitable religious organization in Norfolk, Virginia by the name of the Norfolk Bible Society published its first annual report in the form of a small pamphlet.

The pamphlet stated that the principal duty of the Society was that of procuring Bibles and Testaments and distributing them to the poor. The report stated that the Society had distributed 235 Bibles and 882 Testaments in the prior year. Some of these books were delivered to the poor of Norfolk, but others were delivered to the neighboring counties of Princess Anne, Nansemond, York, Elizabeth City, and even as far away as Matthews and across the Chesapeake Bay in Northampton. Donations were also made to the children under the care of the Norfolk Female Charitable Society and to the crew of the famous Navy vessel the <em>U.S.S. Constellation</em>. Finally, the Society made monetary donations, both to The Bible Society of Virginia and the Bible Society of New York for the printing of a French language edition to be donated to the poor inhabitants of Louisiana and Canada.

These groups strove to put their printed religious materials in the hands of as many people as possible. The activities of these groups coincided with and served to drive the explosion of the American printing industry in the early nineteenth century. Small printing shops soon became ubiquitous while urban printing companies grew into truly massive industries that were intimately connected to religion. Early nineteenth century improvements in transportation combined with an increased access to capital brought on by the economic prosperity of the era allowed Tract and Bible Societies to reach a national audience.

In a letter dated October 13th, 1849, from E.W. Cooper, Thomas Cassels Law learned of a Negro insurrection in his home district of Darlington, South Carolina. Cooper served on an investigating committee to respond to the matter. Although they could not gather sufficient evidence to have the four leading insurrectionists hanged, they were lodged in jail and later sent out of the state. One of the enslaved men mentioned that word was spreading around Darlington that this was the last year the slaves would be held in bondage; white men traveling between Sumterville and Darlington City were apparently spreading the rumors. Cooper believed his own slaves were largely ignorant of the matter, but he warned Law, You had better keep a look out.","It is unclear how much of an impact this letter had on T.C. Law, but it is known that he was an active member of the Darlington Agricultural Society. In 1852, Thomas Cassels Law gave an address to the society entitled, Report on Management of Slaves - Duty of Overseers and Employers. Law's chief purpose was to give some insight in keeping an efficient and productive operation, and he incorporated an intricate analysis of the relationships between master and slave and overseer. He began, If slaves were brutes, as many seem to view them we might more easily point out their proper management, but they are human beings - morally accountable - committed to our care by a mysterious Providence, for, no doubt, a wise purpose. Law advocated for a moderate and constant work schedule for slaves, with proper intervals of rest. Yet, he also justified the use of the whip by citing scripture: he that spareth the rod hateth his child. Law recommended giving slaves a small plot that they could work in their off time and have a small notion of ownership. When the owner buys crops from his own slaves, it convinces them of your doing justice. ","As Law's report suggests, the relationship between master and slave was intricate and multi-faceted, layered with contradictions. Slaves were seen as racially inferior, yet still morally accountable human beings. Slaves were quite literally the property of their owners, and Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul </em>examines the reduction of human beings to financial numbers. Yet, Law and other planters found it immoral and improper to rule by simple and violent dominion over their chattel. Religious and racial convictions compelled white masters to treat slaves with paternalistic supervision. There was also a level of insecurity. So, giving a token piece of land to the slaves and convincing them of the justice of the system was a rational approach to slaveholding. Though men like Thomas Cassels Law may have applied the industry of slavery moderately and sensibly on their plantations, the existence of slaves as economic property was inherently dehumanizing."],"display_date":"October 13, 1849 - August 10, 1852","search_date":"1851-03-13","locations":[{"id":11496,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3660,"title":"Alexander Campbell and John Thomas Debate Reimmersion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-02-01","end_date":"1836-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As Alexander Campbell promoted his restoration movement, one of his colleagues questioned him on the issue of baptism. In 1836, he entered into a debate with Dr. John Thomas in the <em>Millennial Harbinger</em>,  Campbell's own religious journal. At first, their ideas corresponded well with one another, as they both required immersion to attain salvation. Their concurrence did not last long, for the debate grew heated when their discussion turned to reimmersion. In the <em>Millennial Harbinger</em>, Campbell accused Thomas of being sectarian, so the relationship dissolved.","According to Campbell, Thomas published in his journal, the <em>Apostolic Advocate</em>, that reimmersion was necessary for believers who did not understand the purpose of the immersion at the time of their baptism. Therefore, they should be rebaptized so that they understood baptism at the time it occurred. Thomas argued that corruption got into the Baptist church, as people were baptized originally without understanding. When this happened, Thomas argued that they should be reimmersed."," Campbell blasted Thomas' argument as being too extreme. He argued that Thomas counted understanding the immersion at the time of its occurrence as a requirement to enter the pearly gates. Campbell set forth three criteria for Christians to complete in order to get into heaven when a person dies. First, a Christian must believe that Jesus was the Messiah. Second, one must be baptized. Third, one must fully understand why he was immersed. Campbell argued that all three of these must be complete by the time a person dies. He thought it was necessary to believe that Jesus was the messiah at the time of the baptism, but did not require that one must understand the baptism at the time. As long as one understood what the baptism meant sometime after it occurred and believed in Jesus at the baptism, then the baptism was valid as long as he consented.","This starkly contrasted Thomas' reimmersion belief because Thomas said that if a person did not understand what the baptism meant at the time or did not believe in the Messiah, then he should be rebaptized to fully understand the immersion. Campbell feared that the people of the church, in their confusion, would get it into their heads that they did not understand baptism at the time of their immersion and therefore their baptisms did not count. If people felt like their baptisms were slighted by their own lack of understanding, then he reasoned that people would not feel as close to God. Then, they would get baptisms once or twice more, which Campbell feared, they would substitute for actually worshipping God and improving on their own discipleship. He argued fiercely in the February 1936 issue of the <em>Millennial Harbinger</em> that we are too fond of making converts, and too regardless what sort of converts they are. The last thing he wanted his church to do was produce ignorant and faithless converts. Campbell accused Thomas of putting too much emphasis on the baptism. Campbell argued that the baptism did not save; God saves. As long as you believe in Christ, are immersed, and sometime over the course of your life understand what the baptism meant, then you were going to heaven.","Campbell walked a fine line on the issue of baptism. On the one hand, he disagreed with extremists such as Thomas who placed too much emphasis on baptism and favored reimmersion. At the same time, however, he could not side too much with Baptists because they did not place enough emphasis on baptism and it being essential to salvation. Baptism was just the first issue of controversy between Thomas and Campbell. Some historians theorized that Thomas and his supporters wrote the famous Lunenburg Letter in 1837 to get Campbell to clarify his views on unimmersed Christians. While this seemed like an attempt to trap Campbell in his waffling on the issue of the necessity of immersion, Campbell maintained his fine line trying to make his views in the middle of the extreme views of the Baptists and Thomas. ","The debate between Campbell and Thomas highlighted the philosophical religious debates that took place while the movements for the restoration of the Church to primitive Christianity were in their beginning. In its beginning, the restoration movement had to define itself while at the same time distinguish itself from other branches of Christianity. The Campbell movement broke away from Baptists in America in favor of primitive Christianity. In doing so, his movement began in Appalachia and grew nationwide. Campbell's Restoration movement was just one of many primitive Christian movements in nineteenth-century America. These primitive or restorationist movements placed an emphasis on following the New Testament closely and interpreting the text strictly. As primitive Christian movements caught on, people returned to the text for answers in order to grow in their faith with Jesus Christ."],"display_date":"February 1836","search_date":"1836-02-14","locations":[{"id":14550,"lat":40.3948805836,"lng":-80.5752113928,"zoom":11,"place":"BROOKE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3661,"title":"Alexander Campbell&#39;s Movement Grows\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-04-01","end_date":"1836-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["By the time the <em>Millennial Harbinger</em> hit the presses for its April 1836 issue, the movement begun by its editor, Alexander Campbell, had grown so substantially that it began to challenge other Christian denominations. D.S. Burnet, a writer for the <em>Millennial Harbinger</em>, exclaimed the growth of the restoration movement of primitive Christianity. He explained that ever since its founding, the movement for primitive Christianity, which had begun a mere 12 or 15 years prior, had converted close to one hundred and fifty thousand persons. This nineteenth-century movement to restore the primitive Christian tradition was termed many things from the Restoration movement to the Reformation. In  America, the Reformation had a larger growth rate than the Baptists, Presbyterians, or Methodists because it had been in existence for a shorter time period, but had grown substantially. The Reformers chased the heels of the larger religions in North America. ","According to Burnet, the average annual increase for the Reformation was four times as great as the Baptists, six times as great as the Presbyterians, and was greater than the Methodists. Although the restoration of primitive Christianity grew in belief and literature, critics continued arguing that the Reformation was going down. In response, Burnet argued that those critics were mistaken, because the numbers spoke to the fact that the movement was there to stay.","The restoration principle of going back to what the New Testament explicitly states created a different sect of Protestantism. Alexander Campbell created the Restoration movement aimed to restore the principles of primitive Christianity because no other Christian denomination in America was committed to that purpose. In 1958, more than a century after Burnet's assessment, Campbell's restoration denomination, which had split into the Disciples of Christ and the Churches of Christ, had reached 1,922,484 and 1,700,000 respectively. These restorers of primitive Christianity were at their strongest in the southern states in 1958, which coincides directly with Burnet's argument, as he stated that the movement was growing in the South along the frontier. ","The creation of the primitive Baptist movement stemmed as a response to the religious and doctrinal changes in denominations during antebellum America. Primitive Baptists relied on a primitive interpretation of the scripture because they were threatened by the rising innovation, which threatened their traditional religious beliefs. Primitive Baptists saw themselves as promoting the true church of God as espoused in the New Testament. While reacting to other denominations, they not only separated themselves from Baptists and other sects, but competed for members with these very denominations.","Following the war of 1812, American Protestants attempted to create a united front. Congregations sought Protestant unity, especially when facing increases in diseases and poorer peoples in the cities, as well as the question of westward expansion. This idea for unity, however, had the opposite effect. The publicity for Protestant unity revitalized Protestant religion, which grew in numbers. The growth in numbers actually strengthened individual denominations. It seems that the strengthening of individual denominations increased denominational competition. Thus, competition among Protestant denominations was one of the defining characteristics of the antebellum south. By extension, evangelism was one of the major forces shaping American society in the decades leading up to the Civil War."],"display_date":"April 1836","search_date":"1836-04-15","locations":[{"id":14550,"lat":40.3948805836,"lng":-80.5752113928,"zoom":11,"place":"BROOKE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3662,"title":"Baptists Educating Women for the Sake of Men\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-08-11","end_date":"1854-08-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When the Holston Baptist Association convened in 1854, the reverends of the association discussed the education of women. While 38 churches in attendance wanted to sustain denominational schools already in place, Reverend N. Baldwin, representing Abingdon, Virginia had a different suggestion. Baldwin's address began by accusing Europeans of being destroyers of Christian values. He argued that the European population and the laziness of southern gentlemen had transformed the South into a land of anti-Christian and anti-republican values. He argued that the only source of protection against the destruction of values and morality is a sound Christian education. Baldwin suggested that the association plant a school house and church on every hill and in every valley. ","According to Baldwin, not only education, but the education of women in particular was important. He said, Educate the mothers, train them up to their mission, and their sons will become intelligent and virtuous. He noted that there were 962,878 free white persons, who could not read nor write. He argued that the key to solving problems with males and their values was female education. By educating females, gentlemen would need to educate themselves in order to impress the women. Educating women set higher standards for men, thereby limiting troublesome male behavior. He shouted, Educate your daughters and the young men will seek and education to qualify themselves for their society...Wherever the Bible has been brought to bear on mankind, it has had an elevating effect on the moral character and social rank of women. The gospel has a peculiar elevating influence on the social and domestic state of woman. This Baptist institution hoped to use its efforts in faith to benefit the social good by having a well-behaved, educated population.","The arguments put forth by Baldwin reflected a larger sentiment at work in Baptist society. At about the same time Baldwin delivered his remarks from the pulpit, A.W. Richardson, a reverend from Alabama, echoed Baldwin: Educate the girls...and the boys in order to render themselves respectable in their eyes, will find means to educate themselves. Resulting from these Baptist opinions that women's education was essential, Baptists put their plan into action to develop schools, including the Brownsville Baptist Female College in western Tennessee. Female colleges created environments secluded from interruptions by boys, as women had no correspondence with gentlemen. The Baptists pitched the idea as a way to let daughters learn marketable skills such as teaching or bookkeeping before womanhood. The main theme underlying female education, however, was to keep young men from misbehaving.","Seeing such southern belles of high class, southern gentlemen would have to educate themselves and learn value, morality, and religion in order to even have a chance with educated women. Educating women in the antebellum South reflected larger Baptist values to cleanse the state of immorality and sectionalism. Likewise, the South needed to restore morals and values in its young men."],"display_date":"August 11, 1854","search_date":"1854-08-11","locations":[{"id":14343,"lat":36.7220692336,"lng":-81.9642215133,"zoom":10,"place":"WASHINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3663,"title":"Primitive Baptist Association Makes Policies to Maintain Purity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-10-24","end_date":"1855-08-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In October of 1851, nine Baptist churches in Appalachia came together to form an association. The Stony Creek Primitive Baptist Association began with nine churches: Stony Creek, Copper Creek, Three Forks Powells River, Moccasin Creek, Blue Spring, Red Hill, Tom's Creek, Big Glade and Crane's Nest. By 1854, the association had grown to 11 churches, with Little Stonegap and MC Cluse as the new additions. At the first meeting, they formed their Constitution. The Preamble of their Constitution read: we [are]... convinced of the necessity of a combination of churches in order to perpetuate an union and communion among us and preserve and maintain a correspondence with each other in our union. At the second meeting on October 25, David Jessee, Jr., the elected moderator, proceeded to business. The seventh item of business called for the union of the churches, including those with representatives present, of Primitive Baptists. In explaining the terms of the association agreement, Jessee stated, For the safety and union of the churches, we advise our churches not to invite members of other denominations to...council and we think it disorder for any church or pastor to do so.","This policy passed by the Association in its founding days intended to exclude other denominations from the Association. This rule illustrated the belief that they had to maintain the sanctity and purity of their faith. In order to do this, they had to exclude other denominations from their association to form a more perfect union. This exclusion was not a policy that the members conjured up themselves. Rather, their faith instructed them to bring the church back to the first churches, or primitive churches, set forth in the Bible. They merely followed the early foundation laid before them of the earliest churches, who admitted only those who converted, professed faith in Christ, and underwent baptism by immersion. If the necessity arose and a member disobeyed these maxims, he would be excommunicated. Just as a member could be excommunicated from a congregation, a church could be excluded from an association. Primitive Baptists excluded the beliefs of other denominations, which seemed to them impure and false if conflicting with Primitive Baptist belief. For Primitive Baptists, their adherence to discipline in the church reflected their larger purpose of purity in the church. ","Primitive Baptists were not the only denomination that emphasized purity. While there was an emphasis on purity for mainline Baptists as well, the two differed on their implementation of discipline within the church in order to maintain that purity. Baptists believed that issues of discipline could be solved within each congregation. On the other hand, Primitive Baptists believed issues of discipline should be settled on the broader scale involving multiple churches. Associations, such as the Stony Creek Primitive Baptist Association, acted as regional forms of church government. Baptists, on the other hand, believed associations interfered with the right of each congregation in matters of discipline; therefore, they settled discipline disputes in house. However different their views regarding associations, both Baptists and Primitive Baptists regarded discipline as the method to maintaining purity in the church. Whenever a congregation or association strengthened its campaign for discipline, this indicated an increase in spiritual vigor, because these organizations had to maintain that enthusiasm by keeping what they deemed unfit beliefs out of their organizations. Baptists in the South, regardless of being primitive or not, used practices of exclusiveness to maintain their purity. Purity to them was important to maintain principles in the church. They believed that members of a congregation or a church in an association with unorthodox beliefs would make the general reputation suffer, thereby undermining their evangelistic mission. In order to sustain their reputation, this concept of purity became essential to them in spreading their faith not only in Appalachia, but all over the nation."],"display_date":"October 24, 1851 - August 17, 1855","search_date":"1853-09-19","locations":[{"id":14259,"lat":36.7553079974,"lng":-82.6074809232,"zoom":9,"place":"SCOTT, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3680,"title":"Congregation of African Americans \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-01-19","end_date":"1860-01-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Bishop Clark basked in the serene melodies and felt his heart rise with the crescendo of the chorus.

","The church Bishop Clark visited consisted of approximately 1500 African Americans, most of whom were slaves.

Some churches were established only after white sponsors or trustees legitimized them, while others had regular white preachers but a black administration and pastoral staff. All African American congregations were subject to some form of surveillance.","Bishop Clark's awe at the worship style of the churchgoers was a common experience for whites. Even whites who attended mixed churches remarked on the differences, the most obvious being the exuberant clapping and dancing through which Blacks celebrated their connection to God, a connection which would one day deliver them from the bonds of slavery.

Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press.

More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable.

They also up held their pledged amount for the year. The church also debated whether to change the name to Methodist Episcopal Church in America, but voted against it. Only two men voted for the change, but the article does not give their reasoning. The conference adopted a memorial on temperance and elected delegates for the following conferences.

This 1886 meeting is their annual conference and a continuance of their efforts to maintain membership. Also during this period, revivalism started gaining force. The meetings the church held concentrated on proper behavior of its members, and instructed them that gambling did not belong in their lives while dancing had a shaky position. The test sermon to which the chairman objected could have pushed the boundaries concerning social issues.

Due to this obvious protest of slavery, Quakers faced many conflicts with their slave-owning neighbors.    Quakers received harsh treatment and persecution for their actions as well.  These problems caused many Quakers to flee to the new frontier.  The majority of the Quaker population ignored their neighbors' resistance and continued to fight slavery from within North Carolina.

Randolph, representative of Albemarle  County, gave a speech in regards to possible emancipation within the state.  Although it was 1832 at the time of this address, the proposed plan that Randolph spoke about would only affect slaves born after 1840 and would take 80 years to complete.  Virginians would hold male and female slaves until they reached the ages of 18 and 21.  Upon this age, the state would remove the slaves from the Commonwealth.  This produced a heated debate among Virginia leaders, and Randolph sought to promote the plan; at the very least, he wanted to propose the idea to all the constituents of Virginia.     ","            The Virginia emancipation debate of the 1830s rarely consisted of extreme abolitionist views.  However, some Virginians did have opinions about whether or not the institution of slavery was politically and economically necessary.  Randolph suggested that the gradual emancipation plan would not hurt the state economically, as it \"levies no money tax upon the people - each slave pays his own removal by his hire.\"  He argued that slaves would still be in the state until they reached adulthood, and even afterwards, they could be sold to other southern states for a profit.  Politically, Randolph argued that since the plan would take a full 80 years, its effects would not be sudden.  He said even if negative consequences emerged, then \"a repeal of the law\" would bring things back to the 1832 standard.  ","            In addition to the political and economic aspects of gradual emancipation, Randolph discussed the immorality of slavery.  He pointed out that slavery was not justified by the fact that other lands practiced it.  He argued that \"upon the same principle he could justify...plurality of wives...,murder...,\" and other endeavors that Americans considered wrong, but which took place in other areas.  Furthermore, he criticized the many Southerners who used the Bible to justify slavery.  He highlighted the Biblical passages that actually made slavery a dishonorable practice, such as \"that which teaches charity, justice, and good will to all.\"  At a time when southerners rarely questioned the morality of slavery's moral aspect, Randolph clearly took a risk in some of his arguments.","            Following his political, economic, and moral reasoning, Randolph exploited southerners' anxieties regarding slaves in order to advance his argument.  The Nat Turner Rebellion, which led to the deaths of many Virginians, afflicted fear upon the state and led some to question the institution of slavery.  Randolph argued that if gradual emancipation and removal were not put into effect, then the slave population would grow and become uncontrollable.  He said this group could potentially be found \"burning with enthusiasm for the liberation of their race\" and rebel.  Even with this daunting point, there were still many listeners who opposed Randolph's strong democratic views.  Randolph therefore implored that his fellow delegates at least propose the plan to their constituents in order to decide what step to take next.  Mostly western Virginians, along with the state's governor and a few legislators, applauded Randolph's idea. However, other eastern Virginians such as William Brodnax thought it was \"a scheme...destined to produce 30 years of domestic warfare...(and)...to make every patriarch a child-seller.\"   Various ideas emerged following Jefferson's proposal, including Brodnax's plan for immediate deportation, many elitists' hope to discontinue the debate all together, and Archibald Bryce's \"abstract affirmation of colonization.\"  Randolph supported Bryce in hopes to start any sort of emancipation movement. Legislators debated Bryce's plan to fund the deportation of blacks but ultimately only passed it in the House without confirming it in the Senate.  Thus, although, Virginia adopted what historian William Freehling calls \"an ambivalent, ineffective colonization experiment,\" the power struggle between eastern elitists and western egalitarians was significant.  It foreshadowed the tension in Virginia that would persist for decades to come.

Chiles wrote a letter to fellow South Carolinian Reverend James C. Furman detailing the health of Chiles' family and the surge of religious revival in his area.  Chiles began the letter with an apology that it had taken him so long to respond offering the explanation that he had been close to death and his youngest sister had died.  Joy and sorrow flowed together as he lamented the determination of the diseases that attacked his family, but praised God for his sovereignty.  Chiles continued on matters of God, taking a more optimistic turn as he recounted the great spirit of revival in his area that year, and he told Furman about the many baptisms he was performing in local churches.   He briefly mentioned the \"excitement of politicks\" regarding their state and how he hoped they were rightly following the path of God.  After committing to pray for these events he ended his letter asking for a personal meeting with Furman to see each other and preach together.","  Chiles' letter echoes the attentions of many Americans during the early 1830s.  The masses had a general awareness of political events and conflicts, but they concentrated most on personal matters with a particular emphasis on disease, death, and religion.  The early 1830s brought an onslaught of contagious diseases such as influenza and cholera, but the simultaneous onset of a widespread Christian revival offered hope to families stricken by epidemic disease.  Americans believed that God was in control and looked forward to the promise of seeing loved ones again in the afterlife.  Additionally, with death and religion capturing the attention of the people, there was little time left to ponder the tenuous condition of state and federal affairs.  Chiles' vague mention of excitement in his area most likely refers to the nullification crisis of the early 1830s when outraged Southerners proposed to nullify the high tariffs they believed favored Northern manufacturing cities and crippled the South.  President Andrew Jackson objected to the nullifiers and proclaimed secession unconstitutional, even while Vice President John Calhoun (a South Carolinian) led the faction supporting nullification.  The same month that Chiles wrote his letter, December 1832, Calhoun stepped down from the vice presidency as tension rose over the split in ideology.  Henry Clay managed to mollify the situation with the Compromise Tariff in February 1833 by calling for a gradual lowering of tariffs which eased the threat of conflict for the present.  Even in the midst of such seemingly crucial events, personal matters still consumed individuals like Chiles and prevented them from entering into the political dialogue.

","    The anonymous Confederate soldier wrote home that \"[if] it should be the Lord's will that I should fall on the battlefield, it will all be right.

Woodworth writes that their faith \"encompassed many facets of life, and they also believed that this present life was not the conclusion of their existence.\" This most certainly gave soldiers a sense of relief and peace, know matter what experiences they may have to endure on Earth. The Confederate and Union soldiers not only had a high chance of dying on the battlefield but also that it would be a very gruesome or lingering death, especially when the main method of healing a musket wound was by amputation. But the soldier from Nansemond County found that not all men outwardly practiced their beliefs. He witnessed that the circumstances of \"camplife are any thing else but favorable to religion, or deeptoned piety. Here I see and here [sic] more wickedness in one week than all that I ever met before put together.\" ","    In his letter the soldier reasoned with his family and urged them not to worry, arguing \"this world is not my home, and we should never shudder, or grieve at the escape of those we love, from a dreary desert, to a pleasant home.\" Of those who were Christian, Woodworth asserts that many soldiers \"spoke feelingly of heaven as home.\" This brought comfort not only to the soldiers but also to their loved ones or survivors left behind and out of the danger of war. ","    At the tail end of the soldier's letter he firmly advised his family to follow the word of God. \"Make the service of God the great object of your life, and He will make your salvation the great care of His heart.\" Woodworth states that many citizens and soldiers alike viewed \"heaven as a place of happy meeting.\" This view comforted both those close to death and those left alive. Soldiers and civilians both had the reassurance that death was not the end but only the beginning of life. The soldier not only wanted to ensure his own seat in heaven but those of his family as well so he could die peacefully with the knowledge that he would see them again.

The North Carolina party claimed to be \"zealously devoted to the advancement of the interests of the great Temperance reform.\"  In the pamphlet, they declared that alcohol has \"deceived Christendom,\" caused criminal activity, and \"hardened the hearts\" of many people.

There was not one mention of abolition throughout the North Carolina pamphlet; it solely pertained to the subject of temperance.  The Sons of Temperance drew more membership and popularity during the 1840s and 1850s, especially among white middle-class and artisan groups.  The wealthy-planter class did not become too invested in the movement partly because alcohol and \"social drinking\" were \"essential to the lives of the southern gentry.\"  The reformers involved emphasized self-discipline and self-improvement by abstaining from alcoholic beverages.

In a diary entry dated October 1874, she noted, \"as teachers we should set an example worthy of imitation, (for there is a fearful responsibility resting upon us,) and there is no better way of doing it than by showing reverence for God's word and seeking his guidance.\"  Being religious herself, Gregory desired to imbue her pupils with an appreciation for having a relationship with God.  Lynn Lyerly, a historian who has studied women and religion in the South, discusses how many women in the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century South sought to engage in mission work outside of home and the church.  Numerous organizations of Protestant women sought not only to witness the Gospel to the public, but also to perform acts of kindness and charity for the less fortunate.","      According to historian Charles Wilson, Southern religion has always been heavily influenced by the Calvinists' negative attitude toward human nature.  For this reason, churches in the South tend to emphasize the need for a conversion through God's grace and a subsequent life of morality.  Wilson's assertions help explain Lyerly's description of many Southern women as motivated to evangelize and perform mission work outside their traditional spheres of influence.  Gregory seems to have been one of these women, seeing as she used her position as a teacher to spread the word of God in hopes of positively influencing the lives of her students.  In her own words, \"for the past two mornings our principal has opened the school by reading the Scriptures and prayer.  I am decidedly in favor of it-it will make a lasting impression upon the minds of the children.\"  Gregory's support of prayer and Bible-reading in school suggests a belief that children who are taught in a religious environment are likely to live more proper lives.

Many people were present and most of these were family and friends who lived in the nearby area.  It is interesting to note, however, that Bible verses were listed on the announcement and the marriage was recorded in the family Bible.  In addition to this particular marriage, many others were listed in the same place.  This indicated that the Walkers saw the joining of two people as a sacred event.","The thick relationship between marriages and churches was not uncommon in the South during this time.  Religion, predominantly Protestantism, had a tremendous affect on all aspects of Southern life.  These Protestant roots of the South spread throughout people's lives.  From farming to slavery to the family, religion influenced all aspects of Southern life.  Many families did not go a week without attending a church meeting, which is why the Walkers had a religious wedding ceremony.  ","These deep roots in the Protestant religion resulted from the revivals of the mid-eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century.  Revivalism reached the hearts of many Southerners, especially Virginians.  The aftermath of these revivals resulted in the Southern focus on religion.

Beginning in 1872, when Victoria Woodhull published in <em>Woodhull and Clafin's Weekly</em> an account of the affair between the famed pastor, Beecher, and his parishioner, Elizabeth Tilton, the scandal captivated the public. The details of the affair and its aftermath were complicated and convoluted. At first, Beecher chose to ignore Woodhull's initial accusation, which seemed to be a logical strategy as she was notorious for creating scandal. As time went on though, and adultery accusations accumulated, events escalated and Beecher was forced to take the defensive. Elizabeth Tilton's husband, Theodore, filed suit against his former friend, Beecher, in 1875. Elizabeth Tilton presented contradictory evidence before, during and after the trial stating at different times that Beecher was innocent or that he was guilty.  Due to inconclusive evidence, contradictory accounts presented in the case, and an indecisive jury, Beecher was exonerated. Because of their involvement in the trial, Elizabeth and Theodore Tilton, who by the end of the case were no longer married, among others were excommunicated from Beecher's church. ","As a case study of public discourse in reference to the trial, the newspaper, <em>The Atlanta Constitution,</em> handled the events within the scope of a nation with a shifting structure and societal values.  In fact, the case was so etched in rhetoric indicative of  the changing era that even as late as 1895 an <em>Atlanta Constitution</em> article tried to make sense of what happened by stating that Elizabeth Tilton was hypnotized, which was why she acted in such contradictory ways. According to historian, Altina Waller, the case excited public discourse to such an extent because it was a representation of the power struggle and breakdown of traditional structure in the post- Civil War society. Beecher and Tilton entered the trial as anomalies to traditional structure. Beecher was a prominent liberal Christian and both he and Tilton were involved in the promotion of women's rights and other radical reform movements. Yet in the trial, Beecher tried to present himself as more moderate than Tilton so as to have an attractive case to more people which shows that even Beecher acknowledged that people may not have been ready for some of his progressive ideas.  Despite this, the progressives still supported Beecher and the traditionalists took up the cause, not necessarily for Tilton but against Beecher. The conflict of the trial turned into one between progressives and traditionalists and became a symbol of people's attempt to understand and adapt to social changes.  By the end of the trial, neither man was fully exonerated in the eyes of the public. The trial became emblematic of the vices of the struggle between progressives and traditionalists.","Through various articles, the <em>Constitution </em>supported Waller's view and highlighted the impact of the case on public discourse in that it often explains the volatile nature of discussion of the case and also served as bank of impassioned rhetoric. For example, in the article \"Fighting About Beecher Trial,\" the <em>Constitution</em> stated that people discussed the trial and became so heated in their arguments that certain bars had to ban the discussion of the Beecher trial to prevent violence. The <em>Constitution </em>also emphasized the misdemeanors of all involved in the trial. The majority of the articles did not approve of either Beecher or Tilton's actions and illustrated them as adulterous and evil. Beecher, in particular, was made to be a villain in the paper since he was supposed to have been a pious man, yet was accused of adultery and manipulation. Through the disapproval of the actions of Beecher and Tilton in the trial, the <em>Constitution </em>discredited new social systems and upheld more traditional values.

Over two hundred listeners gathered for a picnic at the local Fisher's Hill one July morning in 1888.  The event was relaxed with picnic food, a speech, and a Woodstock Cornet Band for entertainment.  Yet it focused on an issue of substantial importance: temperance.  As the local <em>Strasburg Weekly Dots</em> paper reported, the theme of the picnic was \"Liquor Traffic is a Crime\" and Virginians gathered in their common belief that alcohol was unnecessary and unjust.  ","The idea of temperance that the people of Shenandoah County promoted was not isolated to their area. Beginning around the 1830s, many Southerners, especially women, started to worry about the negative aspects of alcohol consumption.  One of the most important temperance organizations was the Women's Christian Temperance Union, created in 1874.  Other local temperance efforts, such as this picnic, occurred throughout the nineteenth century.  ","Religious and racial tensions plagued many temperance efforts. Most of the temperance women were evangelical Protestants who often criticized the Irish Catholics and Germans frequently associated with alcohol consumption and production.  Discord also existed between blacks and whites, as some white women claimed that black men were especially a danger with alcohol.  Although these apprehensions existed, for the most part the temperance movement was successful in incorporating women of various \"socio-economic, racial, religious, and national identities.\" Many women used the Bible to justify temperance; they claimed that it was God's plan for women to help the men and \"most commonly likened women...to Christ's apostles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dots</em> does not mention the demographic or religious background of the picnic's guests having had any effect; in fact, it says there \"was no disorder.\" This furthers the idea that locals were unified by a common aspiration. ","Although temperance is traditionally associated with women against alcohol consumption, at the time, it was just as important in promoting white women's overall equality.  For example, the WCTU helped educate women \"to take on public personas because the nineteenth century offered [them] limited formal education in rhetoric.\"  Often, people saw the strive for equality as radical.  Thus, as historian Carol Mattingly writes, \"newspaper reporting focused largely on issues of gender rather than on the subject of temperance\" which she says \"reflects a general discomfort with women's changing roles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dot</em>s, on the other hand, presents an article focused on the issue of temperance as opposed to gender.  This is likely because the focus of their gathering was \"not yet Congress, Legislature, Judge, Jury, Church or state;...but the Rum Traffic, was the prisoner at the bar.\" Long-term changes for women, such as the Nineteenth Amendment, would not occur for some time. Still, the nineteenth-century temperance movement fueled the steps towards gender equality.  Events such as the Shenandoah County Temperance Picnic, although small, represented a larger movement that took place throughout the South."],"display_date":"June 28, 1888","search_date":"1888-06-28","locations":[{"id":14271,"lat":38.8584536791,"lng":-78.5704125087,"zoom":9,"place":"SHENANDOAH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3983,"title":"Sons of Temperance: Young Southern Men and the Temperance Movement\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-01-01","end_date":"1856-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["    Temperance reforms in the nineteenth century were not widely known for their success in the South.  In fact, Delaware was the only slaveholding state to enact prohibition laws in the 1850s.  However, temperance reform victories can be seen on a smaller, yet equally effective, scale throughout the southern United States, especially among young men.  The Southern temperance movement was driven by fraternal organizations of men, and eventually women, holding each other to the standard of temperance and encouraging themselves and others to lead a temperate lifestyle.","    The Sons of Temperance was the most widely known fraternal temperance organization.  The Order was founded by temperance advocates in New York City in 1842 but quickly became a nationally recognized brotherhood.  Its three goals were clearly laid out in the constitution of the organization, which \"proposed then, as it does now, three distinct objects-To shield its members from the evils of intemperance; afford mutual assistance in case of sickness, and elevate their character as men.\"  ","    Fraternal temperance orders became exceedingly popular in the south as the nineteenth century progressed.  Members from slave states comprised 44 percent of the national membership of the Sons of Temperance in 1850.  This is especially important because the Sons did not admit African Americans, and the South only represented 32 percent of the nation's total white population.  The Independent Order of Good Templars was another prominent fraternal organization dedicated to temperance, and also boasted a large southern participation rate.","    These orders tended to function like secret societies and rarely published their membership lists.  This was largely done in order to limit bad press.  It would have been extremely embarrassing for a brother to be seen violating the codes of the Order, and secrecy eliminated the possibility of bad exposure.  Another reason for secrecy became important when sectional differences began to get out of hand.  Since the society had Northern roots and linkages, many Southern chapters kept their activity under wraps so as not to anger the political powers at hand.

The crack of the whip onto bare skin had an unmistakable sound.  All those who witnessed the brutal whipping cringed with each crack.  The slave's back was already covered with old scars; some several years old and some only days old.  Mary Boyden became used to seeing her father discipline unruly slaves, but this time she became disgusted with his behavior.","            Before Mary went to sleep on the night of January 3, 1857, she wrote in her diary as she did every night.   Normally, Mary would write about the weather and the people she had met throughout the day.  This entry, however, had a particularly different focus. Mary began this entry with the thought, \"another day has dawned upon this sin polluted earth,\" followed by an emotional, detailed description of the brutal whipping of a slave that she had witnessed early in the day.  Her father, an overtly bigoted, violent man, had senselessly beaten a slave in an attempt to solidify his superiority over the less-than-human slaves who worked on the plantation.  His futile actions had disgusted Mary, a religious adolescent girl who tended to sympathize with the slaves that her family had owned.  Mary had developed a substantial internal conflict between her personal ideals and the beliefs encouraged by her Southern Baptist religion. ","            Mary wrote about her personal hatred and disgust with the Southern culture, which heavily revolved around slavery.  She did not agree with the idea of slavery and wrote, \"white folks will have to pay for making slaves of the black folks, in the insurrection.\"  Mary no longer wanted to experience the routine whippings of the slaves, whom she had developed close relationships with.  She longed for a way to remove herself from the life that her family was so deeply imbedded in.   ","            Conflict between religion and slavery was not an uncommon dilemma in the slave South during the years immediately preceding the American Civil War.  Many deeply religious slave owners were even troubled by their own involvement with slavery.  Some slave owners who were particularly religious considered the institution of slavery to be evil and were often convinced that they would be going to hell.  However, Southern Christian churches often supported the idea of slavery.   Religious communities considered the institution slavery in terms of its social, political, and economic consequences as well as in terms of its ethical implications.  The majority of the religious communities, however, feared that emancipation would lead to devastating effects.   Slave owners used the views of their churches as a foundation to rationalize or justify their own involvement in slavery.  As a result, many slave owners considered slavery an economic and political issue that was beyond their control and ignored the ethical issues surrounding the institution.  Mary Boyden embodied this internal conflict which existed between her own ethical beliefs, her religion, and her family's use of slaves to bring in revenue.  This conflict proved to be a crucial weakness for many southerners fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

Rowan Barclay, carrier of the <em>Lexington Gazette</em>, printed a special broadside in 1881 to the subscribers of his newspaper, urging them to realize the true meaning of Christmas. His broadside was a poem titled \"An Incident of Christmas Eve\" and told the story of an old woman who was unable to cross the street. Several passersby overlooked her until Barclay introduced a group of rowdy schoolboys. Most of the boys were too excited about the fresh snow to notice the old woman, but one boy walked over to help her. After he aided her in crossing the street, he returned to his friends who asked why he stopped to help. The boy calmly responded that if one day his mother became like the old woman, he would hope some person would be charitable enough to help her.  ","    It was at the end of the poem that Barclay stressed the need for charity during the Christmas season. He mentioned that the old woman went home that night and prayed thanks to the young boy, in hopes that his life became prosperous and good. Barclay ended his poem with the reference to the old woman's prayers as if to stress that charity was a representation of faith. He appears to have made the point that all people should follow the actions of both the boy and the old woman, especially at Christmastime. ","    While western Virginia in the nineteenth century was not the most affluent region of the South, the religious and social values of those in Lexington stressed an importance on giving. Generosity was a positive sign of wealth and this importance on giving continued from the antebellum period well into the Reconstruction ear. Charity not only indicated the honor and wealth of a person; it also demonstrated religious piety, a quality that Southerners felt was essential in a human being. Because there was often a large gap between wealthy and impoverished, people like Barclay attempted to reach the entire community by publishing town-wide documents such as his broadside. Christmastime was an especially important time for giving, not only because of the religious significance, but also since it was a holiday that everyone celebrated, rich or poor.

His departure invoked many of the religious passages in her diary as she used religion as a comfort and a way to calm her fears. Bond often prayed to God in that she \"may not be entirely cut off from [her] husband,\" and that \"the cruel enemy may be driven from our soil.\" Her prayers to \"put a stop shortly to this miserable war\" were her comfort, and God, she believed, would answer those prayers.  Religious belief was how Bond coped, and she held her beliefs close. Even through illness, which was common throughout her diary, Bond remained religious.

Evangelicals believed that the Bible was their guide and their actions must follow the Bible. In Bond's case, she strongly believed in the teachings of the Bible and believed that her prayers would be answered.

In order to live a good life, Protestants like Bond tried their best to follow the teachings of their savior. Prayer was her salvation from the horrors of war and illness, and she believed God would reward her in the afterlife. On August 34, 1863, Bond prayed, \"Oh, I do pray the good Lord will grant me this prayer-that I once more may visit the place of my nativity.\" She arrived home, in Maryland on January 2, 1866 and died shortly after.

William White wrote a narrative about African American Preachers. In it he tells the story of a black preacher known as \"Uncle Jack.\" Slave traders kidnapped Jack from Africa when he was seven years out and sold him into slavery in Nottoway, Virginia. When he was forty he heard a Presbyterian Minister from Prince Edward County preach and became religious. White wrote  that once Jack found religion he wanted to learn to read so that he could study the bible. He convinced his master's children to teach him by \"promising to reward them for their pains with nuts and other fruits, as tuition fees.\" Once he learned to read, he received his license from the Baptist church and began to preach. In Nottoway at this time there were not many churches and Jack was \"often called to preach at a distance of more than thirty miles from his home.\" Additionally Jack \" secured the respect and confidence of the white people,\" as well as the adulation of blacks, and when his master died he was able to buy his freedom thanks to donations from white members of the community. ","Uncle Jack's experience as a black preacher was not typical. Many white southerners were hostile to black preachers after 1831 because of the slave rebellion lead by Nat Turner, a slave preacher, which was responsible for the death of 57 white men, women and children.  Slave owners passed laws making it illegal to teach slaves to read or write, and encouraged slaves to attend services given by white preachers who indoctrinated them with the idea that good, hardworking slaves who respected their masters would go to heaven. ","There are several reasons why Uncle Jack might have been exempt from these restrictions. The first is that he did not fit white stereotypes about slaves, especially in terms of his speech. White wrote, \"the reader must not be surprised, therefore, that nothing occurs in what we quote from his own lips, of the jargon peculiar to the African race. Nobody ever heard the good old preacher say massa for master or me for I.\" Another reason he may have been exempt from restrictions was that he rejected typical \"slave\" style preaching. In particular \"he uniformly opposed, both in public and private, every thing like noise and disorder in the house of God. His coloured auditors were very prone to err in this way. But whenever they did, he suspended the exercises until they became silent.\" Whatever the reasons, Uncle Jack achieved something extraordinary through his religion and lived a life unlike most other slaves because of it.

The treaty, or rather collective of three treaties signed at Medicine Lodge, Kansas in October of 1867, was a comprehensive peace settlement between the U.S. government and the Plains Nations of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.  Major provisions in the treaty were that the nations would move onto reservations in the Indian Territory and that the United States would help them become \"civilized,\" providing them with necessary supplies and instruction.","            At Medicine Lodge, most of the Native American nations wanted peace, but did not agree with the constrained reservation system that limited autonomy and pushed white civilization upon them.  Among the more outstanding spokesmen of Medicine Lodge were Chiefs Ten Bears and Satanta, who represented two of the most prominent nations, the Comanche and Kiowa, respectively.  Their two voices well addressed specific problems with the proposed reservations, but also addressed broader issues of Native American identity, prospects, and the nature of their relations with whites.","            Satanta, one of the major figures in the armed conflicts leading up to Medicine Lodge, argued very emotionally and emphatically: \"I love the land and the buffalo and will not part with it. I want you to understand well what I say.  Write it on paper.\"  Satanta argued that the land, the hunt, and the independence from \"medicine lodges\"-the churches and schools advocated by whites-were essential elements of his culture, his means for happiness.  Secluded from this lifestyle, he said, \"We grow pale and die.\"  He also emphasized the way in which whites interacted with Native Americans, saying that while he was open and honest with the commissioners, they were deceitful and unreliable.  Yet far worse for Satanta were the U.S. troops who, he said, \"cut down my timber; they kill my buffalo.\"","            Ten Bears was more ready for peace and as such his speech was gentler in tone, beginning with an expression of warm feelings towards the commissioners.  Yet he too blamed the United States for a great deal, saying that it was they who started the conflict: \"There has been trouble on the line between us...but it was...you who sent out the first soldier and we who sent out the second.\"  Ten Bears also broadly criticized the plans of the commissioners, rejecting the reservation scheme with houses and medicine lodges.  He stressed the freedom and happiness of life in the prairie and contrasted it with living and dying as the whites suggested, hemmed in by \"walls\" and \"enclosures.\"  ","            Ten Bears reiterated Satanta's consideration of culture, saying: \"I lived like my fathers before me, and like them, I lived happily.\" He further defended his right to this life based on the promise made by the \"Great White Father\" (the President), which guaranteed the permanence of land rights as they then stood.  Finally, Ten Bears argued that far from removing his people to a better location, the proposed reservation site was \"too small\" and that the Texans had taken away the land and timber that best supported prosperity.  The final words of his speech summarized the plight of Native Americans in powerful, fatalistic terms, saying, \"The white man has the country which we loved, and we only wish to wander on the prairie until we die.\" ","            Though not actually faced with extinction, the nations of Medicine Lodge were in the midst of such upheaval that the period could justifiably be called the end of an age for their peoples.  Arguments like those of Satanta and Ten Bears at Medicine Lodge were not new; Native Americans had long defended their essential rights, sovereignty, and freedom-political rhetoric that is itself very telling as it specifically caters to Western ideology.  Yet the virtue of these values were not enough to protect Native Americans in a seemingly intractable clash of cultures, wherein they were opposed by both U.S. governmental policy and the very real \"shock of civilization\" that saw the buffalo hunted almost to extinction while frontier settlements swept across Native Americans' lands, dominating them in trade and constantly fighting with them.  In the twenty years after Medicine Lodge, Native American sovereignty and their free, unsettled lifestyle, as espoused by Satanta and Ten Bears, were both rejected by the United States.  The two major blows came in the shape of a Congressional act in 1871 that ended treaty-making with Native Americans, and the Dawes Severalty Act in 1887, which divided up the communal land into individual allotments and made Native Americans U.S. citizens."],"display_date":"October 19, 1867 - October 20, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-19","locations":[{"id":4553,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Unorganized, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4086,"title":"Organization of Women&#39;s Movements in the South: Belle Kearney, WCTU, and Suffrage","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-04-01","end_date":"8/18/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["  For many women in the South, the Women's Christian Temperance Union served as an opportunity to organize with other women, gain public career skills, and work outside the home. This experience was later able to transfer in women's work for suffrage. Belle Kearney, a leader within the WCTU and later a women's suffragist, wrote about the beginning of her career in the WCTU in her autobiography, <em>A Slaveholder's Daughter</em>. In this work she analyzes the affects of the Civil War on women in the South and discusses her own experiences as a daughter this post-Civil War society. Kearney desired to be well educated and to pursue a life beyond the domestic sphere of women. She stated that women in the South had assumed responsibility while the men were at war yet when the men returned, women were expected to return to the female domain. For Kearney, remaining in this womanly sphere was not acceptable. In 1889, she was given her chance for public work when her father encouraged her to listen to a speech given by the President of the WCTU, Frances Willard. After this, Kearney accepted a position in the WCTU which became, for her, an outlet to the public sphere and prepared her to later serve in the women's suffrage movement.            ","According to historian Louise M. Young, this experience in the WCTU was not exclusive to Kearney. Women's promotion of temperance was seen as acceptable public work for them because temperance fell into the womanly sphere of \"protecting the home.\" This allowed women in public work to become more acceptable and thus gave women the courage and ability to work for more radical causes such as women's suffrage.  So, women took the training hat they received in the WCTU and applied it to the suffrage movement. Temperance also opened other avenues for suffrage in that supporters of temperance wanted to give women the vote so that they would have political power to enforce temperance. For the South, this was important because Southern women had not participated in the abolition movement in the North which had prepared women for the first wave of the women's suffrage movement. Thus, in the South the WCTU served to prepare women for the women's suffrage movement as the abolition movement had in the North."],"display_date":"April 1, 1889 - August 18, 1920","search_date":"1904-12-09","locations":[{"id":7161,"lat":32.6346973664,"lng":-90.0338114186,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4093,"title":"Women&#39;s Benevolent Societies\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-09-14","end_date":"1831-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 14, 1831, members of the Female Assistance Society of New York met to discuss preparations for their charitable work for the upcoming winter.  Eighteen years previously, the organization had been founded by wives of high status New York men who wished to do more than simply be an ordinary housewife.  The main focus of this non profit organization was to provide as much assistance as possible to the poor and homeless people living on the streets of New York City.  It was to be made clear to the rest of society that these women were not focusing on their own charity work out of selfishness; their simple goal was to aid the poor, sick, widowed, and homeless, and provide these people with a fraction of the sense of security they themselves felt.  At this particular meeting, the officers discussed how they should be preparing for the approaching winter in regards to helping the homeless.  The previous winter had been terrible, and the members of the organization wanted to ensure that they would have the capabilities to provide assistance to more people than they had in earlier years.","The Female Assistance Society of New York was not the first formal organization of women.  Primarily in New York and Boston, females of prominent Protestant households had been working in organized groups to assist the less fortunate for decades.  During their early years, the procedural aspects of these societies were managed solely by women, but in order to reach their goals, male counterparts were called in for financial management purposes.  Some groups were more successful than others, and this depended largely on the demographic of the group they were attempting to assist.  The New York Society for the Relief of Poor Widows wit Small Children campaigned successfully for funds, while the Boston Female Moral Reform Society faced more trouble finding financial support, as the most prominent members of society were reluctant to donate to a charity for \"unrespectable\" women.  ","By 1850, the most prevalent female organization was the Ladies Benevolent Society, which had many of the same goals as the Female Assistance Society.  Founded by the wives of prominent Protestant men of the time, this society provided aid and a foundation of Christian beliefs to those less fortunate, particularly widows and orphans.  The creation of such societies that were managed entirely by women were the early foundations of the women's rights movement that dominated a large part in the history of the early twentieth century.  Although these women were not seeking independence from their husbands or any rights of their own, the way in which they organized entire societies on their own accord with little or no help from the men in their lives shows how women were able to take initiative to accomplish what they wanted on their own.

Historian Richard Carwardine notes at the base of urban city revivals, like that of Boston, was the influence of Charles Finney. His new Presbyterian revivals were based on an active part in one's own salvation instead of waiting passively to see if one was saved. He succeeded in taking revival techniques of Methodism, some of which developed in western communities, back to eastern urban cities. The availability of the religion to both poor and rich, black and white, east and west, made Methodism a nationally unified religion.

Arrested in New Echota by the Georgia Guard and detained indefinitely, Butler and Worcester were charged with the direct violation of a new Georgia state law which addressed the issue of Americans dwelling within Native American territory. The law, passed on December 22, 1830, created a requirement for white men to declare an oath of loyalty to the Georgia state government and to receive a residency license from the governor. Those who did not abide by these laws would be imprisoned for a minimum of four years hard labor.  Refusing either to take the oath or leave, Butler and Worcester, shackled around the neck, endured the four-day march to Camp Gilmer in Lawrenceville. ","This incident raised questions about the extent of state power and whether Georgia had the right to exert political authority within the Cherokee territory. American Baptist Magazine defended the actions of Butler and Worcester. While Worcester appealed the ruling of the state, in a letter which was summarized in the magazine, Butler claimed that he and Worcester had influenced the convicts at Milledgeville penitentiary: some promised to renounce profanity and other inappropriate behavior. The missionaries led the prisoners in song, religious readings, and prayer sessions. ","This controversy surrounding the power of state government brought the case to the Supreme Court, presided over by Chief Justice John Marshall. The court ruled in favor of Butler and Worcester on March 3, 1832. In his opinion, Marshall declared the laws of Georgia unconstitutional and unenforceable within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation. Marshall also ordered the state to reverse its judgment against the two prisoners. Although defiance from the state government continued, Marshall's decision in the case of Worcester v. Georgia represents the pivotal recognition of Cherokee sovereignty within the boundaries of the American Nation and the acknowledgment of their existence as an independent power in the eyes of American law.

For many, clothing choice reflected how a woman was viewed by her society. In early American Christian towns men wanted their wives and daughters to be seen as virtuous and plain in their dress. Due to this perspective about fashion women would choose conservative and simple styles to fit into what their society wanted. According to Springs, a woman was allowed to dress in any manner she wished so long as it did not offend her husband and the society she was in. Springs continued to say, \"Fashions, which characterize a gay and worldly circle, a Christian woman will avoid.\" A Christian woman in the 1800's had to make sure that her hem was just right, her colors were just so and her hair was in place, all while not being vain. ","Women in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries had a wide variety of standards set upon them. Much of how society viewed women in the time depended on a woman's social class and religion. Religion was a major factor for how women dressed and were perceived. Christian women were expected to maintain a clean and orderly appearance.  Under these strict Christian guidelines, women in this time had to sacrifice their education and knowledge simply to be the perfect domesticated woman. Along with the ideal of staying constantly presentable, women could not allow themselves to be attracted to the vanities that modern fashions had to offer, such as the bright \"worldly\" colors that Dr. Springs mentioned. They had to hold up the ideals of their religion and still fit into the world of quality clothing and attire. Dresses that were simple in fabric and color were the only acceptable garments to wear. Women who thought bloomers were decent garments were taught by prominent males that bloomers were garments which promoted \"that wild spirit of socialism.\"  While some upper class women were wearing jewels and riches, Christian women were not to indulge in such ornament."],"display_date":"April 1825","search_date":"1825-04-15","locations":[{"id":6206,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":6,"school_id":2}},{"id":4190,"title":"Spontaneous Combustion of a Drunkard\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-12-07","end_date":"1831-12-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    In the year 1831, Dr. Peter Scholfield was invited to speak at the formation of a temperance society in the small town of Rustard, in Upper Canada.  His speech was a direct attack on drunkenness and the dangers it entailed.  Dr. Scholfield began his speech with the remark, \"It is well authenticated, that many habitual drinkers of ardent spirits are brought to their end by what is called 'spontaneous combustion.'\" He then told of a young man under his care, who at just 25 years old had been a habitual drinker for many years.  The doctor was summoned at approximately 11:00pm by the local blacksmith and arrived to find the young man \"literally roasted from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet.\"  The young drunkard had been found burning inside the blacksmith's shop, looking like the wick of a burning candle.  Nothing else in the shop was on fire; and there was no damage to anything, it was \"simply a case of spontaneous combustion.\"  ","    The doctor then began to explain, in gory detail, the path the man took to his death.  \"His flesh was consumed or removed in the dressing, leaving the bones and a few of the larger blood vessels standing.\" Thirteen days later, the young man died an excruciating death, his screams and laments were said to have unsettled even the most hardened men.  In his death throes, the young man screamed out that \"he felt no pain of the body, for his flesh was gone. He was suffering the torments of hell; that he was just upon the threshold and should soon enter its dismal caverns.\"  Dr. Scholfield concluded his story with this remark: \"I have seen other drunkards die, but never in a manner so awful and affecting.  They usually go off senseless and stupid.\"","    By the early nineteenth century, temperance societies began springing up across the Untied States, in protest to the drunkenness running rampart throughout the country.  Although alcohol was not made illegal until the eighteenth amendment was passed in 1920, temperance societies began to grow in popularity as early as the 1790's.  By 1831, when Dr. Scholfield's article was published in the Western Luminary, a religious periodical, there were more than 8,000 American Temperance Society chapters across the country.  Speeches like the one given by Dr. Scholfield were an attempt to convert more people to the way of temperance and the avoidance of spirits.  Although scare tactics such as those used by Dr. Scholfield worked on some people (mainly women and devout individuals), the majority of the American public largely ignored such stories of spontaneous combustion. The consumption of spirits was a vital part of society and because of this, it was impossible for many people to imagine life without them.  The large change about the use of spirits came after the American Civil War, when the abuse of alcohol by veterans in both the north and south helped bring about a change in the way people viewed its destructive nature.  Women who had witnessed firsthand how it harmed both the men and their families began to work even harder to outlaw alcohol throughout the country."],"display_date":"December 7, 1831","search_date":"1831-12-07","locations":[{"id":4796,"lat":38.0422598094,"lng":-84.4586978215,"zoom":9,"place":"FAYETTE, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":6,"school_id":2}},{"id":4199,"title":"Missionaries and the Choctaws\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-01-01","end_date":"1831-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Mr. Cushman and his fellow missionaries broke ground in the \"unbroken wilderness\" of Choctaw Nation on October 15, 1827 and on July 31, 1831 he published a letter about his experiences in The Missionary Herald titled, Effects of the Gospel on the People. Upon his arrival in 1827, Cushman found the members of the Choctaw tribe to be entirely heathen and uncivilized in both appearance and practice. He was surprised to see that \"only a few of the men labored at all, as this was a disgrace to the sex,\" and that \"very few of them had ever heard the gospel.\" Over the next four years he and the other missionaries would open a school in one of their homes and also expand the number of Choctaw people who belonged to the church and attended regular religious services. By the end of his mission he boasted that, \"there are now in good standing in the church 51 natives, six being under suspension for unchristian conduct. Our Sabbath meetings were well attended, generally by eighty or a hundred adults.\" Cushman also stated that, \"their Indian costume is almost entirely laid aside…\" and that \"nearly all the adult females have learned to make shirts and pantaloons, &c….\" that, \"public opinion is now in favor of industry and the lazy man is disgraced.\" These statements demonstrate the pride that Cushman and the other missionaries took into account not only the spiritual transformation of the members of the Choctaw tribe but also in their conversion to a Euro-American of life.","The sentiments of Mr. Cushman regarding the spiritual well being of the Choctaw people paralleled the feelings of other missionaries who worked among Indian tribes at this time.

Coleman writes that this ideal of convincing Indians to adopt Euro-American cultural norms was, \"part of a nineteenth-century crusade to „uplift and assimilate Indians into American society, and thus save them from extinction.\" This process included the schooling of children in missionary schools that instilled western values regarding social, economic and political structure as well as gender roles. Historian Michelene E. Pesantubbee in argues that cultural transitions included a dramatic change in the division of labor between Choctaw men and women, from men who traditionally hunted and women who maintained farm work and tended to other household duties, to men working the fields and women being solely restricted to the house. This shift was seen as a major victory to missionaries, she writes, \"…by the 1800s…as the sexism and ethnocentrism of white society began to infiltrate the infrastructure of Choctaw society…[In] white America, males dominated the economic, religious, and political arenas. White women occupied the separate and secondary domestic domain.\" With their promotion of such a cultural shift, missionaries „empowered men by demoting women to holding lesser status."],"display_date":1831,"search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":2390,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"INDIAN LANDS, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":6,"school_id":2}},{"id":4241,"title":"Chicago Prepares for Lincoln&#39;s Remains\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-30","end_date":"1865-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            April 30, 1865, was a busy yet solemn day for the residents and city officials of Chicago.

However, on July 1, 1866, something extraordinarily important happened: several black men applied for a blanket \"letter of dismission\" to cover every \"colored member.\"  Prior to this date, the church officers had been unconcerned because the only requests had been from white members, but black men and women liberated by the Civil War were eager to form separate congregations for the first time, and this was the cause of some concern.  ","The First Baptist  Church record indicates that a committee was formed to decide whether or not to allow the division, ultimately recommending letters to those \"whose standing [was] unquestioned.\"  The committee refused to grant a blanket letter because some blacks wanted to retain their First Baptist membership.  While the church seemed hesitant in permitting separation, it was \"glad\" to sustain black membership.  Those who stayed were guaranteed all privileges enjoyed before.  But these probably included stringent limitations as there was no further movement toward racial equality.","Following the Civil War, race relations within the church were thrown into confusion.  Southern white preachers taught in a process called \"theological racism\" that God supported divisions and inequalities between the races.  At first, white Southerners believed that the situation would remain much the same: white leaders with segregated black sections.  But as evidenced by the First  Baptist Church records, many black people wanted complete separation.  Generally once religious segregation began, white Southern churches resisted the reintegration hoped for by Northern brethren, and black Southerners wanted to retain their new independence, even though they understood its limitations.  Blacks and whites found very little common ground and eventually wanted nothing more than complete separation.  Among various Southern Protestant denominations, the Baptist church was one of the most accessible.  Its independent and localized structure easily supported the organization of new black churches.","In 1866, the First Baptist Church of Charleston, S.C. was in transition, simultaneously supporting segregation and peaceful coexistence.

He addressed the crowd of students with the words, \"women's sphere lies within the limits of private life. Home is the true scene of her influence.\"  He stressed the meaning of women as mothers, mistresses, advisors, physicians, judges, and educators.  James Furman advised the women of the college to take full advantage of their education at the seminary in order to become better mothers for the future generation. He also, mentioned his fears of women in the public sphere of a man's world.  He believed women did not belong in places like an autonomy class or the rough atmosphere of poll boxes around voting time.  Religion was applied generously to the advice he gave women on their duties. He challenged women to use the Bible as, \"the true Lady's Book,\" to maintain virtue and honesty, instead of finding merit in aesthetic assets, like beauty and the comforts of luxury.  James encouraged the students to \"cultivate habits of neatness and order,\" so that it would better the skill sets they would require for God's design.  He finished his speech by reminding the young woman of the seminary to use the influence of a woman to demonstrate the goodness of God and to set Christian examples for their future husbands. ","        James C. Furman's address to the students of Johnson Female Seminary indicated the view of women in the mid-nineteenth century as a companion to men and a devoted mother.  J.M.C. Breaker, another minister in the neighboring county of Greenville agreed, when he addressed the domesticity of the home and the role of women as \"angels of mercy\" in his speech for the Greenville Baptist Female College in 1858. Christianity provided the foundations of this concept as the secular world became a place for men to leave the home and pursue occupations separate from home life.  Women were to carry the ideology of goodness, purity, and the humanity of men, by their behavior in private and public life.  ","      When Furman mentions the Bible as a \"lady's book\" he is associating God's word to a lady's journal.  Popular in the day, women's magazines were used to demonstrate correct manners, give advice on child rearing, and to guide women through their daily chores as caretaker and submissive companions.  Lady's journals, like <em>Godey's Lady Book</em> provided women with stories of romance and duty, much like the bible would provide the spiritual guidance women needed.  Rev. Furman implies that even though beauty and dress is important, the basic values of goodness are better.","      In the speech, Furman states that he would be shocked to discover a woman in a classroom or in any realm of public life.  A year earlier, in 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman in the United States to graduate from medical school.  By August in 1850, several revolutionary women had taken steps to improve education and missionary work.  Public opinion circulating during this time deemed the pursuit of a career by a woman was an act of aggression. Intellectual training was ill suited for the poor, frail mental and physical design of a woman.  ","      Even though, the aim of altering women's education toward better intellectual standards was slowly evolving in the United States, the students of Johnson Female Seminary were being groomed for the life of a plantaintion mistress.   James C. Furman's speech is an example of the nineteenth century values that restricted women's right toward higher means of learning.  Action came though, in the next ten years women's colleges and seminaries would instruct female students as teachers.

Hudson that also became members of this Baptist church at the same time. Two columns in the record separate members by race; white members were on the left and \"colored\" members were on the right. Who was Easter Hudson? Was she a slave or was she free?","The Greenville County Census of 1830 dictates five thousand and sixty-three slaves were accounted for in that year. There were only thirty-two black residents of Greenville who were recorded as free. By 1840, the census records a twenty percent increase in slaves and an estimate of forty-three freed persons in Greenville, S.C. Looking at the South Carolina deeds of sell for 1820 to 1850 there is an indication that the circulation of slaves was very high. Several slaves who had a trade as a blacksmith, painter, mariner, or other essential profession were sold sometimes as often as twice a year. Slave women were also sold at this rate if they were accomplished cooks or seamstresses. Greenville County's slave holders would rotate these professionals based on demand throughout the region. Usually slaves were only mentioned in the sale by their first name. At this revolving rate, slaves coming through Greenville or the vagueness of the actual records of sold slaves makes it difficult to distinguish if Easter Hudson was a slave owned by a member of the Hudson family or a freed black in 1835. "," The presence of Easter's name in the roster of Brushy Creek Baptist Church indicates that she was accepted as a legitimate member regardless of her position; free or slave. Due to the fact she appears in the \"colored\" column of the record describes her position as a black member, as well as explaining how white members viewed \"colored\" members.  This leads the question; did Easter Hudson participate in the Baptist Church as a slave? Was she forced to attend, because of her owner's wishes or did she attend on her own free will without the confines of her social situation? "," Brushy Creek Baptist Church recognized slaves as members of the church since its establishment in August 1805. The practice of white Southerners bringing their slaves to church was a very common one. The gallery in a church was especially designed to separate the races in a church. Evangelization was extremely important for southerners to rationalize slavery as an institution based on the paternalistic duties of \"civilizing\" the slave. Slave evangelization was promoted by slave owners, because the ministry of Christianity might, \"encouraged slaves to be more obedient and less prone to rebel against circumstances.\" ","Easter's mere existence in the church minutes is an example of the involvement of black members in a religious organization during the early nineteenth century. The status of black church members is redefined by the emancipation of slaves, especially during the Reconstruction period of the South. Religious racism continued throughout the Reconstruction period and well into the Gilded Age as these individuals struggled with participation and clergy rights in white churches.

In the mid 19th century the two sects of the Baptist Church sought to educate the many tribes of the Cherokee Indians.  The records for the interactions between the two peoples are at best biased, bureaucratic, opinion, and afford little to no information on how the Cherokee really felt towards their missionaries.  The first record of the missions found from the Southern Baptists began in 1869 at the Southern Baptist Convention.","    At the Southern Baptist Convention of 1869 a committee known as the Indian Board submitted a report on the state of the many missions to the greater Cherokee nation and their successes.  Suffice to say the reports cite many instances where the Cherokee have readily accepted Christ and are better because of it.  Such instances include the removal of Natives from their lands.  When the Natives were removed from their lands they lost contact with their pagan gods as well as their way of survival.  The missionaries were able to show the Cherokee how to farm and gave them a new God to fill the spiritual void.  ","    The missionaries took several approaches in bringing the Cherokee into the folds of Christianity.  One of the most obvious forms was the creation of missions and churches at Cherokee settlements.  At the churches, sermons would be delivered in English and other religious rights of passage and would be administered.  However, these had little effect on the Cherokee who, with a few exceptions, had no understanding of the English language.  This problem was over come more easily by the Baptists and not the Southern Baptists.  A reason for that might be the lack of capital in the South following the Civil War that could be appropriated towards mission work.  In fact, in the 1873 Southern Baptist Convention records, the accounting records show a decrease in funds appropriated towards hymns, Bibles, and other religious texts being printed in Cherokee.","    The Baptists to the North suffered no such setbacks and published many books.  The Cherokee Hymn Book published in 1877 was distributed among the missions and was in the Cherokee language.  The book had the exact same layout and hymns as it English translation and even included a part in the back for helping Cherokee translate the words into English.","    The missions did not always result in a relationship of equality.  In fact the Southern Baptist records and reports seem to have instances where the Cherokee begin to become subservient to their Missionaries, almost completely reliant on them for daily needs.  This came out a feeling that they were indebted to the purveyors of Christ.

Included in Manly's offenses was the prayer at Jefferson Davis' inauguration to the presidency of the confederacy in February 1861.  As part of a special group of ex-confederates who could not sign the typical oath of allegiance, Manly needed a Presidential pardon.  Individuals like Manly had to submit a petition to Andrew Johnson to be pardoned.  Following the petition, Manly had to obey five terms to become and remain a United States citizen.  First, he took the oath of allegiance as established by President Johnson on May 29, 1865.  Manly then had to pay any costs owed from any proceeding and disclaim property or proceeds from the sale of confiscated property.  He was instructed to notify the secretary of state to legitimize the pardon upon its arrival, and if Manly used slave labor of any kind in the future, the pardon would be void.  On October 19, 1865 Manly received two more official letters signed by Secretary of State William H. Seward: the first stated that he had taken the oath of loyalty, and the second professed the first letter was a valid copy of the letter Seward had on his file.  At age 67, just three years before his death, Manly Basil, Sr. was once again a citizen of the United States.","            At the end of the Civil War, Lincoln (and later Johnson) was faced with the task of reintegrating those who had participated in the rebellion against the United States.  Lincoln designed a plan that included an oath of allegiance readily available to the masses, but required leaders of the Confederacy to ask him for a pardon directly.  By not forcing anyone to take the oath, Lincoln encouraged a feeling of amnesty when the war ended.   After Lincoln's death Johnson adopted a similar plan, but included a greater number of people in the \"exceptions\" who must ask for presidential pardon.  Manly's role in establishing the confederacy meant that he fell within the fourteen categories of exceptions which included those rebels who had served in political office, held a high ranking military position, or owned property valued at over twenty thousand dollars.  With so many people requiring special consideration, there was a significant influx of petitions for pardon between July and October of 1865 from those who wanted to attend the upcoming state conventions.  Basil Manly's petition for pardon coincided with press reports claiming President Johnson was giving pardons more freely than before.  Lincoln's hope of rebuilding the nation by granting citizenship to large numbers of ex-confederates set up an interesting dichotomy.  While Radical Republicans grew increasingly angry at Johnson's laxness on those they saw as traitors, Southern Democrats slowly began fighting to reassume power in the South.  Instead of finding a unified nation, the two factions continued the struggle for power until after Reconstruction ended."],"display_date":"September 12, 1865 - October 19, 1865","search_date":"1865-09-30","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4362,"title":"Reverend McGill Offers His Religious Views on Slavery\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1862-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Alexander T.

Blacks and whites were opposite races which could never coexist. McGill used Mexico as an example of what could have happened if the freed slaves were allowed to stay in America. After all races were made free and equal in Mexico, \"amalgamation advances, degradation deepens; anarchy prevails; laws, constitutions, and the ballot box are a mockery.\""," The only possible way the slaves could be freed without greatly harming the country, according to McGill, would be to send freed slaves to Liberia, to return to the home of their fathers, which McGill claimed was determined by God. Sending the freed slaves to Liberia was thought by some as a \"New Testament Exodus\", mirroring the Old Testament Exodus in which the Israelites were sent out of Egypt.  McGill wrote that by doing this, the freed slaves would gain a Christianity better than white men could ever hope to have, and were doing a wonderful thing for Africa, which desperately needed the freed slaves to come home. It would have also benefited America financially because it would only be about half the cost of the war.","Many religious institutions held these beliefs, though not all. Some churches wanted the slaves to be freed and kept in the country, while others were not against slavery at all and felt that it was their God-given right to have slaves, and felt completely justified about doing it.

Reverend Wadsworth gave a sermon to his southern congregation based around the idea of how the 'American' people had come to a point where they needed help from Him to get their lives back to the way that God had intended them to live.  ","He talked of how the whole nation has violated the Ten Commandments and requires times of fasting and repentance in order for God to take back his people and helps them understand how to live.  He presented his reasons for their sins based upon the personal sins that had taken place, not the issue of slavery that the northern churches had so heavily put on the shoulders of southerners.  His testimony was based on an anti-abolitionist view.   ","Wadsworth argued for two reasons why God was not angry with the fact that the south owned slaves.  First, even the Bible says it is proper to own slaves, and he feels that God has blessed the southern states with the right to this privilege.  Second, he used the idea that God had not destroyed nations solely on the fact that they own slaves.  He reiterated that slaves were a part of everyday life in many civilizations in biblical times.  He supported these arguments by pointing to the New and Old Testaments, and nowhere does it mention that slavery is a sin.  This shows that the people have nothing to fear of the wrath of God.  Many people worried about the sole purpose of their religion which was salvation.  In <u>Southern Churches in Crisis</u>, Samuel S. Hill reports that southerners lifted salvation above other things in the church, unlike other religious groups.  Salvation and making sure that one lived as God would want them to live was the foundation where all the assumptions and programs of the church are based. ","Wadsworth wraps up his sermon by pointing out that the northerners had \"malignantly misrepresented\" the South.  Paul Harvey uses Governor Ross Barnett and his colleagues' ideas that \"our Southern segregation way\" was the \"Christian way\" to refute the Northern perspective.  Wadsworth has provided a reason that slavery is not the reason that God is angry with his people.  In his argument it gives a way for southerners to take care of their personal sins to get their lives back to the way they should be.  Also, this made many southern citizens realize how much the north is against their way of life and that they are trying to take it away from them, which in turn give a sense of Southern Pride to fight for what they believe in most of all, Slavery.","Slavery proved to be an issue that was fought about in the churches because of the impact that it had on people's lives.  The impact worked well for the group rather than an individual, which is supported by Samuel S. Hill in his autobiographical writings on Southern Religion and the Religious.  According to Hill, \"What marks off their (congregation) positioning may be a judgment that the whole is greater than the parts...\" is referring to how people would gather around each other in order to get their point across."],"display_date":"January 4, 1861","search_date":"1861-01-04","locations":[{"id":11230,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4424,"title":"Ursuline Nuns Relocate their Convent outside the City of New Orleans\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1823-03-25","end_date":"1824-09-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1824, a dispute with the city of New Orleans drove the Ursuline nuns of New Orleans to leave their century old convent in the city for a new location outside the city. A drawing of the \"new\" convent shows an elaborate building with elements of classical architecture consisting of a three story convent, orphanage and chapel. Designed by architectural firm Gurlie and Guillot, the convent was decorated with galleries, columns, and Baroque ornamentation. Facing the Mississippi river, it rivaled many of the surrounding plantation homes in both size and construction. ","Before the Ursuline nuns relocated to this new convent from their previous location in the middle of the French Quarter, they had been an important presence in the city of New Orleans for almost a century. They arrived from France in 1727 to establish a school for girls in what was then a French colony. They provided an education not only for white girls of the colony, but also for slaves, free girls of color, and Native American girls. In addition, the Ursulines ran an orphanage and a hospital. In the years immediately following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Ursuline nuns experienced several conflicts with both federal and city officials. One such conflict with the United States government concerning property ownership within the city, led the nuns to purchase property two miles outside New Orleans with the idea of moving. In 1819, the nuns experienced a different conflict: as New Orleans expanded, a closed off street going right through the convent compound had become an inconvenience to the public. In response, city officials decided to open this street to the public, despite protests from the Ursulines. This decision was what drove the nuns to sell some of their city property and to construct a new convent outside the city. The new location gave the nuns the ability to expand as well as the advantage of both being outside the jurisdiction of city officials and of being out of the way of city development.","The convent cost 83,172 to build, and the chapel was an additional 23,635, a total equivalent to about 2 million today. Emily Clark argues that by spending this much money to build an extravagant convent, the Ursuline nuns were making a statement as self-governing Catholic women in a Protestant country that valued a woman's submission to the authority of a husband. In an ironic repetition of the city's attempt to encroach on the nun's interests in favor of development, the 1824 convent was demolished in 1912 to make way for the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal linking the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain. At this time, the Ursuline nuns again moved their convent and their school, both of which are still in operation."],"display_date":"March 25, 1823 - September 1, 1824","search_date":"1823-12-12","locations":[{"id":5595,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4419,"title":"A Missionary&#39;s View of the Choctaw Nation in 1825\n","course_id":17,"status":"P","start_date":"1825-02-15","end_date":"1825-02-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"Y","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In February of 1825 the Western Recorder published an extract from a letter describing the current state of the Choctaw Indians.  The missionary L.S. Williams wrote the letter in December of 1824 after having lived with the Choctaw for almost eight years.  He wrote that the human nature he saw in the Choctaw nation was lower than any he had previously witnessed.  He regarded the Indians as ignorant, poor, and lacking moral fortitude.  Williams lamented that despite the efforts of missionaries the Choctaw were still wretched and barbaric.  Having heard their pagan songs and dances every night, he declared that only the combined prayer of all Christians could improve the Choctaw. ","    Williams evaluated the Choctaw Nation by American Christian standards.  Since the Choctaw people had a culture and belief system that was contrary to his model, Williams labeled them as heathens.  The people of the Choctaw nation had a stable society in which tradition and rules were observed.  Women were in charge of the home and crops, while men were expected to hunt and become great warriors.  No evidence can be found to suggest that one gender's work was considered less important than the other's. Like the Euro-American settlers around them, the Choctaw people relied on farming as an important source of food.  The nation also actively traded milk, beef, and animal skins with the Euro-Americans. ","The Choctaw opposed missionary efforts out of their desire to preserve their native culture.  Historian James Taylor Carson has pointed out that it would have been easy for Choctaw women to use copper kettles and glass bottles, but they chose to continue their tradition as potters.  Carson has detailed also how Choctaw men used traditional tactics of warfare to raid settlers on Choctaw land.  Settlers were taking up their land and resources, and instead of settling the conflict by way of court or treaties, the Choctaw men acted in their traditional role as warriors to take back their wealth from those encroaching on it.  Though the Choctaw were not civilized in the ways of the Europeans, they had their own set of morals and traditions that guided them in their everyday life."],"display_date":"February 15, 1825","search_date":"1825-02-15","locations":[{"id":7362,"lat":33.3786296634,"lng":-89.6348761581,"zoom":7,"place":"INDIAN LANDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4471,"title":"Growing Pains in New York&#39;s Lower East Side","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-01-01","end_date":"12/31/01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["An early 1900s postcard photograph from New York's Souvenir Post Card Company captures the Lower East Side's crowded and chaotic environment. As American Jewish historian Hasia Diner notes, \"at the right moment in time, under the right conditions, ordinary places become transformed into spaces throbbing with meaning.\"  Such was the case with New York's iconic Lower East Side.  The photo shows Hester Street, a main avenue through the Lower East Side, clearly depicting the neighborhood's massive population.  The scene is inundated with adults selling goods and children playing in the street, framed by dozens of towering tenement houses crowded closely together.  Due to the living conditions within the tenements, most activities like business and recreation took place in the street.","As author Deborah Hopkinson details, in the mid 1800s, tenement buildings were hurriedly and inexpensively built in the Lower East Side to quickly accommodate hoards of new immigrants.  Hearing stories about new opportunities available in a predominantly Jewish atmosphere, multitudes of European Jews flocked to New York, America's hub of immigration, in search of a new life.  By the late 1800s, the Lower East Side quickly earned a reputation as America's ultimate Jewish neighborhood, filled with Jewish immigrants.  By 1910, more Jews lived in New York City than any other city in history.  But, with such a rapid influx of people, the Lower East Side neighborhood was forced to deal with a serious urban housing problem: overcrowding.","Tenement buildings served as the main source of housing, providing very modest living spaces for newly arrived immigrants.  But, over time, most Lower East Side tenements fell into disrepair as many landlords lacked interest in maintenance or improvements.  Therefore, by the 1880s, the already overcrowded tenements became unsafe and unhealthy havens of filth, often lacking necessary amenities.  The worsening living conditions of the Lower East Side drove some individuals to action, including Jewish immigrant and journalist Jacob Riis.  Noting that \"nowhere in the world are so many people crowded together on a square mile as [the Lower  East Side],\" Riis drew attention to the urban overcrowding problem through photographs.","With the invention of flash photography in the 1880s, Riis and other individuals were able to clearly depict Lower East Side housing problems by capturing indoor images of the actual dark, decrepit, overpopulated living spaces inside the tenements.  Riis' revealing photos later appeared in his famous 1890 book, <em>How the Other Half Lives</em>, influencing later New York City housing reforms like the Tenement House Law of 1901 and the creation of the Tenement House Commission.  These decisions enforced new safety and health standards for New York's overcrowded tenement buildings and set a precedent for urban renewal in the United States."],"display_date":"1880 - 1901","search_date":"1890-12-31","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4989,"title":"<strong>Elizabeth Ricord Opens Female Seminary in Upstate New York </strong>","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-05-01","end_date":"1829-05-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In May, 1829, the Geneva Female Seminary opened for its first school year with only about 15 students. It continued to grow and develop under the leadership of Elizabeth Ricord, the founder and principal of the school, and six years later, enrolled over 120 students. During the early American republic period, hundreds of female academies sprang up throughout the nation in both cities and the countryside, proving that these institutions were becoming an important part of American life. The growing opportunity to earn an education helped redefine the role of women as it gave them the knowledge and skills to participate in American civil society.","Ricord designed her academic courses to teach students how to think and reason. The school offered basic courses like spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic, history, botany, philosophy, chemistry, algebra, geometry, rhetoric, and political economy. There was even a course specifically designed for preparing students for the “duties of society,” called Practical Knowledge. Ricord encouraged her students to “seek more lofty objects” and use their education in a constructive way. She also placed a special emphasis on religion and mental philosophy, as she was especially interested in these topics. Ricord and other teachers at the seminary believed it was very important for young women to develop strong morals. In fact, this was one of the main purposes for women to earn an education at Ricord’s seminary.","Ricord wrote there was an “uncommon degree of order, regularity, and moral rectitude” among the students. The laws of reason, conscience, and the Bible ruled the seminary. The middle-class women who graduated from these seminaries claimed to have “female moral superiority,” which influenced the way they engaged in civil society. Female seminaries during the early republic era helped cultivate the position of women as moral agents whose job was to raise virtuous children and teach them the ways of the Bible. After earning an education, many women became school teachers to fulfill this new role.","Female academies played a significant role in pushing women into the public sphere and helped them become active members in the developing civil society. Many of the women who graduated from these academies went on to become reformers and worked to help abolish slavery, to petition for women’s suffrage, to help feed the poor, and to combat men’s dominant role in politics.  The teachers in the female seminaries trained a new generation of women to be able to engage in politics and form individual opinions on local and national issues. Elizabeth Ricord’s commitment to educating women transformed the lives of her students and helped redefine the role of women in American society."," "],"display_date":"May 1829","search_date":"1829-05-16","locations":[{"id":8961,"lat":42.899208773,"lng":-77.359355699,"zoom":8,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":642,"tag":"Civil Society"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":539,"tag":"Women's Seminaries"},{"id":552,"tag":"women's education"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4990,"title":"“Reverend Proudfit argues for the use of the Bible in Common Schools”","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-03-01","end_date":"1826-03-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Second Great Awakening, there were many religious figures who transformed the way the general population thought about religion and its social practices. Much of the new religious thought came from upstate New York from areas called “burned-over districts,” because of the frequency with which they experienced religious revivals, or transformative incidents, which changed a person’s religious outlook. One such person who was a transformative figure during this time was Reverend Alexander Proudfit, from Albany, who argued very vehemently for the use of the Bible in common, or primary schools. In a letter he sent to the Geneva General Advertiser, Proudfit attempted to justify the use of the Bible in primary schools by using educational grounds. He connected the literacy of the emerging American nation, with an emphasis on liberty and intelligence, to the moral and religious principles that were present in the Bible. Proudfit argued that “a nation the most illiterate, the most unprincipled and profligate; may be controlled by the iron arm of despotism. He tried to argue that the democratic values that were beginning to develop in America could be connected to the Bible, and this justified its use in common schools.","The connection that Proudfit made between democracy and religion was intriguing. The emerging Arminianism that was developing in Geneva influenced the Methodists that had founded a church there. Just by the fact that this religious was becoming a major factor in Geneva, and Arminianism was a sect that embraced education, Proudfit had targeted the right audience for his editorial, as the tradition that was being developed connected religion and education strongly.","The democratic values that the Methodists believed, which Proudfit argued were to be a result from the Bibles’ teachings, were part of the reason of the increase in free will and freedom of ideas during this time. The movement of ideas helped to spur intellectual social movements that would change society during time. Additionally, the increase in political action during this time was partially caused by the free flow of ideas that these religious revivals helped to produce."],"display_date":"March 1, 1826","search_date":"1826-03-01","locations":[{"id":8961,"lat":42.899208773,"lng":-77.359355699,"zoom":8,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":5036,"title":"<strong>Sudden Jump in Southern Church Membership </strong>","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1822-01-01","end_date":"1822-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["After years of meetings focused on the business of dealing with church members who struggled with drunkenness or loose morals, the minutes of the Turkey Creek Baptist Church took a fairly drastic turn into the nineteenth century, showing records of meetings now consumed with the granting of fellowship to slaves.  Almost every entry in the mid-nineteenth century included some account of “a woman of colour belonging to…” or “a man of colour” coming forward to relate his or her “travels” and “after an examination the Church recieved” the new member.  Expanding Christianity to all people, including slaves, is no cause for question or concern, but the suddenness of the matter is one fact worth questioning.","In the mid 1800s, the Civil War was imminent and growing abolitionist sentiment throughout the nation was apparent.  Slaveholders in the South were ever under scrutiny, but the Christian slaveholders wanted to clarify their objectives.  As Christian masters it was their duty to be just and convey to their slaves that the authority was delegated to them by God.  Evangelicals had to “redefine the scope and shape” of their responsibility when “routed in their battles with slavery.” This “Mission to Slaves” exemplified the Evangelical ethic of slaveholders, reinforcing their belief and outward claim that slavery was an effort to convert African-Americans because neither the civil nor “social condition affected the need for salvation or the responsibility to provide it.”  This Mission did not reach maturity until around 1830, but Methodist and Baptist churches in the South had begun years earlier, hence the entries from the Turkey Creek Baptist Church dating as early as 1822.","In short, when skepticism and disapproval of slavery grew, those who believed they were serving a higher purpose were forced to defend themselves.  By increasing slave membership to their churches, Southern Evangelical slave owners were able to provide those who doubted with evidence of their cause."],"display_date":1822,"search_date":"1822-07-02","locations":[{"id":11416,"lat":34.1679782338,"lng":-82.3756180087,"zoom":9,"place":"ABBEVILLE, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5068,"title":"Kind Words for Sunday School Children teaches children to live a Christian lifestyle.","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-01-01","end_date":"1866-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Once a month, children all over Atlanta, Georgia would rush to the front yard to gather up the newspaper. With their Bibles in hand, they eagerly flipped to their favorite section labeled Kind Words for Sunday School Children. These “kind words” were stories written for the Christian children to read and to take away important lessons that the Bible teaches. These stories were stories from the Bible with a modern twist. They were designed to teach children to follow Christian teachings and to develop a moral center.","During the nineteenth century, the American Bible Society was formed. The society’s main purpose was to promote moral reform.  But during the 1850s, the society began to undergo major changes. The group became institutionalized and commercialized. The focus was no longer on spreading ideas of moral values but now it had a bureaucratic feel to it, it was business, not religious anymore.

Wise argued that it was Grants overwhelming rapport amongst his men that saved him from complete and total humiliation and the threat of losing his job within the military.  It is interesting to see Grant as a man who could make a mistake as severe as this one as opposed to the typical viewing of him as the most intelligent and steadfast general in the Union’s arsenal during the Civil War."],"display_date":"January 18, 1863","search_date":"1863-01-18","locations":[{"id":5085,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MC CRACKEN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5356,"title":"Pennsylvania Quaker William Still Fought Against the Evils of Slavery","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-11-25","end_date":"1857-11-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 25, 1857, William Still recorded a story that told of the horrors of slavery in the South.  Still assisted a group of slaves on the journey to freedom by way of the Underground Railroad.  He was among the abolitionists during this time that believed that blacks should be afforded equal rights and opportunities that would allow them to earn a living.  Still did not feel that blacks were inferior to the white race in any respect and he did what he could through his writings to change existing stereotypes.","One of Still’s successes came in helping a runaway slave who was flogged, stabbed, and had his feet slit when his master captured him.  Still quoted a slave who witnessed the incident, “then they cotched him, then struck him a hundred lashes, and then they split both feet to the bone, and split both his insteps, and then master took his knife and stuck it into him in many places.”  Still obtained this account from a runaway slave named Harry who he described as “the hero of this party, and withal…an intelligent man.”  Still used stories such as these within his writings in order to convince whites that slavery is an immoral practice.","Still served as a member of the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee and he was steadfast in his belief that slavery was wrong.  The Vigilance Committee became more active in the Underground Railroad following the Compromise of 1850 and the new Fugitive Slave Act.   Still’s religious faith led him to believe that blacks could win the respect of whites in society. He felt that they could if they had the chance to work and earn money on their own. Still believed that he could gather statistical information that would be strong enough to refute claims of black inferiority by testing intelligence and gathering stories from those he had helped on the Underground Railroad.","Pennsylvania became a safe haven for blacks in the mid to late 1800s because of the increased involvement of private organizations and groups of people such as the Quakers.  Quakers in southeastern Pennsylvania helped an unknown number slaves reach freedom and refused to aid in the retrieval of escaped slaves, even after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and the penalties that went along with it.  With the help from people such as Still, blacks would receive a warm welcome and a helping hand to freedom in the state.","William Still helped several slaves on their way to freedom through Pennsylvania.  He also did what he could to speak out about slavery and everything that he believed to be wrong with the institution.  Still was one of a group of pioneers in the United States who believed that slavery was not only atrocious but also completely immoral.  His work was all aimed towards the goal of ending slavery in the United States."],"display_date":"November 25, 1857","search_date":"1857-11-25","locations":[{"id":11229,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5687,"title":"African-American Pastors Develop the ‘Black Temperance Movement’","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"8/14/10","end_date":"8/14/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A flyer stating “Colored Citizens Mass Meeting” describes the movement of African-American pastors to change the view of the “Negro Race.”. The flyer describes the place and time that congregations would meet and the objectives of the meeting. The meeting was called in an attempt to “protest against colored women visiting barrooms and barroom premises [and] also against children visiting such places, for whisky and beer.” The pastors also called for a protest in favor of temperance within the African-American communities because alcohol was viewed as “[an] evil... [that is] most disgraceful to the Negro race.”","Although, as the flyer suggests, African-American pastors were concerned about African-American welfare and pro-temperance historian Lee Willis claims that “black churches remained reluctant to endorse temperance whole-heartedly.” This reluctance of the African-American community was due to the racial undertones of the temperance movement within the white community. Historian Wayne Flynt examines how Alabama Baptist ministers harnessed racism within Alabama as a catalyst for the Temperance movement. Flynt states that “Crumpton combined racial politics with prohibition, describing whiskey bottles ‘sold only to the brutish negroes’ that contained pictures of nude white women.” The racist rhetoric used by Crumpton and other white temperance leaders is the cause behind the ambivalence of African-American pastors and community leaders to join the movement.","Despite the reluctance of many African-American leaders to join the cause of the white temperance movement the African-American community would begin to establish their own independent movement. This allowed the African-American community to ride the wave of temperance all the while having distanced themselves from white attempts to regain control of their community. African-American pastors would establish their own movement in an attempt to create a “stepping stone to a greater civil and political advancement.” Although white communities had their own agendas; Historian Donald Yacovone explains that African-American communities made efforts to “adopt temperance principles [in order to] gain white respect.” Many African-American leaders hoped to curb the prejudice views of the white community through temperance.  ","This flyer exemplifies the African-American community’s reaction to the Temperance movement and the attempt of African-American pastors to create, as described by Yacovone, a “moral reform [that] would cause slavery, prejudice, and intemperance to disappear.” The call for “protest [against] the evils [that are] most disgraceful to the Negro race” show an attempt for the African-American community to move forward in order to control their own communities through reform and progressive acts without allowing the white community to once again control their daily lives."],"display_date":"August 14, 1910","search_date":"1910-08-14","locations":[{"id":18257,"lat":33.553801834,"lng":-86.8960886107,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5949,"title":"The Hungarian Footprints in Delray","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/11","end_date":"12/31/11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Eastern Europeans found home in industrial southwest Detroit throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries. One notable group was the Hungarian community who carved a rich history in Delray. The first wave was in the mid-1800s, just in time for Delray’s industrial boom. Delray’s waterfront access and industrial nature made it an attractive location for businesses to locate. Some immigrated to America to escape punishment by Austrian authorities after defeat in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. At the turn of the century, 1.7 million Hungarians immigrated to America in hopes of chasing the “American Dream.” The waterfront industries, along with the Cadillac Clark Avenue plant, provided jobs for the immigrants and cultivated a Hungarian community in Delray. The Hungarian population was not uniformed in faith, practicing diverse religions such as Roman Catholicism, Judaism, Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodox Catholicism.","In 1911, Hungarian parishioners the Holy Cross Roman Catholic church celebrated its 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary and announced its plans to expand the church due to the growing need for more space. In 1920, the dense number of Hungarians in the neighborhood provided the resources to complete the Holy Cross Hungarian Catholic church. The momentous structure became the heart of the community, even after the early immigrants began moving to the suburbs. After World War I, a 1000 per year quota was set for Hungarians seeking to migrate to America, reducing the inflow for the next 30 years. After World War II, President Eisenhower set loose immigration laws for Hungarians in light of the Soviet invasion of Hungary. In 1956, the next wave of Hungarian immigrants continued to settle in Delray and kept the Holy Cross church vibrant.","Today, the red brick church still stands high in Delray, holding masses regularly. However, its existence is threatened by the planned international bridge between the US and Canada. While the Hungarian population is no longer right around the block from the church, Hungarian Catholics from Southwest Michigan continue to call this church home."],"display_date":1911,"search_date":"1911-07-02","locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2074,"tag":"Roman Catholic"},{"id":2073,"tag":"Hungarian Immigration"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
