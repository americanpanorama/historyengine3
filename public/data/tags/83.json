According to police records, a man paid a prostitute twenty dollars and took the woman to a friend’s house. The next morning, the man woke up and discovered that the prostitute took all of his belongs, including his car, a suitcase full of clothes, his wallet, money, and the pants he was wearing. <br /><br />Learning that the house he was in had no telephone, the man wrapped a sheet around himself and went to a neighbor’s house to call someone to bring him some clothes. Later, the man found the prostitute and asked for his car back. The prostitute explained that she hit a parked car and told the owner of the parked car she couldn’t pay for the damages. The owner then demanded for the car she was driving for payment and the woman willingly gave it to him. The man never recovered any of his belongings.<br /><br />In the United States the crime of prostitution is defined by “sex offenses of a commercialized nature, such as prostitution, keeping a bawdy house, procuring, or transporting women for immoral purposes .” From 1994 to 2004, prostitution arrests have gone down. In 1994, nationally there were 97,600 arrests. In 2004, nationally there were 86, 100. While in recent times it has gone up it’s not as high as it was in 1997. Nationally, in 1997 there were 100, 200 arrests.<br /><br />By being a prostitute, the woman is already committing a crime.

It was so bad that in June of 1975 the city of Homewood passed a new ordinance that reduced the number of hours prostitutes were allowed to be on the street. The week before the ordinance was passed, three prostitutes were arrested for working out of a motel. Mayor Bob Waldrop said that Homewood was working to deal with the problem of prostitutes working out of local motels. The ordinance made it illegal for prostitutes to work between the hours of nine p.m. and six a.m. Waldrop called the ordinance “old fashion. The ones arrested last week were caught at two in the afternoon.” Homewood city attorney Irvine Porter countered by saying the ordinance “forbid known prostitutes from even being on the streets during such times .”<br /><br />According to Hilary Evans in her book, Harlots, Whores, & Hookers: A History of Prostitution, women have gone to different lengths to provide either food for their children or drugs for themselves. By preventing prostitutes to go out and earn their own form of pay, it prevents them from making money that allows them to buy food for themselves or their children.  <br /><br />Jess Winchester, a former prostitute claims that “the motive for many of the women is to earn a wage that supports their children well and allows them to be able to spend more time with them than most working mothers .”<br /><br />The big picture is that the majority of women become prostitutes for two reasons: for an economic opportunity that they couldn’t other wise achieve or because it allows them support their family while letting them spend time with their children. To deny a woman the right to choose either is wrong. And limiting the prostitutes’ working hours in the 1970s was preventing them from working."],"display_date":"June 24, 1975","search_date":"1975-06-24","locations":[{"id":35012,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":204,"tag":"Seventies"},{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"},{"id":83,"tag":"Prostitution"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}},{"id":5143,"title":"Fighting Back, Lola Montez","course_id":52,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-07-15","end_date":"1852-07-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In July of 1852, Lola Montez opened a copy of the <em>New York Daily Times</em> and came face to face with column after column of slanderous comments directed at her. Defamation of character is probably one of the most challenging things that one person can go through. People expressing half-truths without actually knowing the real story is a battle most people will face at some point in their lives. In the case of Lola Montez, the <em>New York Times</em> and the Common Council, an elected legislative body of the city of New York, called her a brazen prostitute and said that there are certain crimes that cannot occur without accomplices. They claimed that she proved herself guilty to everyone what her true character was by fleeing and hiding from the public. Finally Lola had enough, and on July 15th she wrote a letter to <em>Times</em> editor H.J Raymond, the gentleman who had allowed the slanderous comments to be printed in the newspaper in the first place."," ","Marie Dolores Eliza Rosanna Gilbert, or Lola as she was more famously known, was born in Limerick Ireland; her dream was to leave Europe for America believing that she would live among generous and justice loving people there. She was an Irish adventuress; she took dance lessons in Spain and proclaimed herself to be Spanish dancer. With her dance training she was able to tour throughout Europe. She was the daughter of an army officer.  When she was a child around eleven years old she had acquired her wild and free eccentric habits. She came to America with the same mentality as most immigrants did, and with the same premonitions as most females during that time period. Her goal was not to do harm to others but to look for a better paying job and escape from poverty. Desperate for money, she turned to prostitution. During this time period, the number of brothels had sky rocketed in New York. Lola was not the only prostitute looking for a chance to escape poverty. Many others such as, Maria Williamson bought and controlled a few brothels making her a substantial amount of money."," ","In her letter to the editor of the <em>New York Times</em>, Lola never depicts herself as a prostitute. Instead, she depicts herself as a Spanish trained dancer, who happened to catch the attention of a very noble king looking for companionship. She met King Louis of Bavaria in 1846 while touring as a dancer in Munich. She soon became his mistress and influenced him greatly in supporting things that she believed in such as liberal and anti-Jesuit policies. She married King Louis in 1847, and her power over him provoked angry reactions and once she realized that she was unsuited for his character, she divorced him in 1848 and fled the country and returned back to the stage, leaving King Louis to abandon his throne. Never once did she ever believe that her name would be used in vain and used for so many cruel and unjust things."," ","History shows that in the nineteenth century New York City was a thriving location for unscrupulous landlords, consumers and prostitutes. Unregulated and unsupervised, the red light districts exploded across the city, which eventually lead to twenty and twenty five thousand prostitutes working there by 1869. In fact, between five and ten percent of women in the city were involved in prostitution. With time, prostitution transformed to reflect and cater to consumer demand. During this time period, prostitutes were among the freest, wealthiest and most educated women in the United States. Like Lola Montez, many prostitutes befriended and gained the confidence of men that were looking for outside companionship. While some feminists were seeking to free women from slavery, prostitutes married later in life and divorced more frequently than other American woman. The <em>New York Times</em> stated that the Common Council had been taking lessons from Lola Montez, and said also that she hides herself in shame. They claimed that she took advantage of public charity as well. Lola challenged these accusations and called on her accusers to specify and prove her alleged offences."," ","In the final part of her retaliation against the editor of the <em>New York Times</em>, she requests that he admit his ignorance and state that he wrongly accused her of immoral activities. Otherwise she would be seeking legal action and let the courts decide who was actually being unjust, even though that was a road she did not really want to walk down. She was defenseless at that point; no one would take her seriously in order to prove that she was nothing more than a dancer and a companion to men. The letter makes it clear that Lola was tired of people belittling her without giving her a chance to clear her name.   She appealed to the editor to write another article in which he admitted that his cruel words were nothing more than pure ignorance, however no such letter had ever appeared in the column of <em>Times</em>."],"display_date":"July 15, 1852","search_date":"1852-07-15","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":859,"tag":"Nineteenth Century"},{"id":83,"tag":"Prostitution"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":6887,"title":"Wartime, Women, and Sexual Constructs","course_id":190,"status":"P","start_date":"11/9/18","end_date":"11/9/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["       On November 9, 1918, the social reformer, Dr. Eleanor Bertine spoke at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York about “sex morals.” An article about her speech, titled “Social Morality and the War,” was published in the campus newspaper, <em>The Vassar Miscellany News, </em>on November 14, 1918. In her speech, Dr. Bertine argued that laws on sex were unjust toward women and that therefore, ‘the single moral standard’ should be followed as a regulation. The single standard pushed for men to abide by the same rules they expected women to abide by: abstaining from sexual relations before marriage and remaining loyal to their husbands afterward. As a whole, women wanted to hold men accountable for their own role in engaging in sexual behaviors. The “double moral standard” excused male indiscretions, but not female.","       During the Progressive Era, male and female reformers began to devise regulations to control and ultimately destroy commercialized prostitution. At the beginning of World War I, male reformers formulated new regulations on prostitution through licenses, special courts, and laws that disciplined women. Female reformers like Bertine, however, pointed out the issue with prostitution was the conduct of men, and therefore pushed for a single standard of sexual behaviors. These female reformers felt that the double standard divided women into bad and good, while condoning the behavior of men using women for their own sexual benefit.","       The problem with the double moral standard, Bertine said, was that people assumed it was “caused by actual physical differences of sex, by the mistaken ideals of boys, too often imparted by women, and by the lesser necessity for responsibility in a man.” Under the double standard, women were expected to remain pure, while men were encouraged to explore their sexuality before and while being married. The Historian John C. Burnham notes that young men at this time rarely were loyal to their fiancés or wives, and even doctors commonly believed that abstinence was harmful to a man’s health. Dr. Bertine’s talk shows the inequality of expected social-sexual behaviors between men and women. Circumstances and regulations against women, created under the double standard, showcase a global epidemic of blaming and punishing women, and the hypocrisy that goes along with it, for actions that men were obviously a part of as well.    "],"display_date":"November 9, 1918","search_date":"1918-11-09","locations":[{"id":53213,"lat":41.696413124963,"lng":-73.918141494751,"zoom":13,"place":"124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604"}],"tags":[{"id":83,"tag":"Prostitution"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":1111,"tag":"World War I"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"SUNY New Paltz","course_id":190,"school_id":102}}]}
