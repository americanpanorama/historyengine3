The show, hosted by Dick Clark, debuted nationally on August 5 as a product of the American Broadcast Company (ABC). In J.P. Shanley’s <em>New York Times</em> review of <em>American Bandstand</em>’s premiere from August 6, 1957, he stated that “Viewers who are beyond voting age are not likely to derive much pleasure from ‘American Bandstand’ the disk jockey show that began yesterday.” Shanley gave clear reasons why older viewers would dislike the show. He explained what the “attractive group of youngsters” wore: “pretty gowns” for the girls and for the boys, “there were no motorcycle jackets and hardly a sideburn in the crowd.”  He criticized the dancing on the show and Dick Clark’s hosting. Shanley was not impressed by <em>American Bandstand</em> and called it “almost identical to that of a show that has been conducted in here over Channel 9” as a warning to adults in the area to stay away. The <em>Times</em> portrayed <em>American Bandstand</em> as a mediocre show entirely directed at a teenage audience.","By bringing<em> Bandstand</em> to a national network and advertising show-themed products to more viewers, Dick Clark became a popular television figure in the already forming teenage consumer culture of the 1950s. One of the leading historians of <em>American Bandstand</em>, Matthew Delmont, in his book, <em>The Nicest Kids in Town,</em> claimed, “<em>American Bandstand’s</em> daily images encouraged teenagers to imagine themselves as a part of a national audience enjoying the same music and dances at the same time.” Delmont also explained: “by representing the show’s teenagers consuming all of these products, <em>American Bandstand</em> constructed a national youth culture centered on simultaneous consumption” that imitated the larger consumer culture of America in 1957.","When asked by author Michael Shore about <em>Bandstand</em> going national, one of the regular dancers from the show, Justine Carrelli, responded, “That first network show had to be the first, last, and only time I can recall ever seeing Dick Clark acting the least bit nervous.” It was one of the only days when Dick Clark and show producer Tony Mammarella had to hand over control of <em>Bandstand</em> to network producers. The show lost much of its local flavor when ABC producers changed the interior design to a generic, national backdrop by adding a United States map and discarded local high school pennants. Delmont said, “When ABC decided to take <em>Bandstand</em> national in 1957, dozens of local markets had or would soon start their own teen dance shows.” It was those changes ABC made when debuting nationally that caused teenagers to tune into <em>American Bandstand</em> instead of their local programs. Even though the show displeased critics like Shanley, ABC guaranteed that <em>Bandstand</em> became a facet of American popular culture until the show finished in 1989 because it created a mainstream teenage culture in the United States and popularized television shows created for a specific youth audience."],"display_date":"August 5, 1957","search_date":"1957-08-05","locations":[{"id":30458,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":2197,"tag":"Television"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":123,"school_id":3}},{"id":6351,"title":"Better Television for More People","course_id":140,"status":"P","start_date":"9/19/49","end_date":"9/19/49","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After World War II, technology and society changed rapidly. New technologies were introduced while other technologies became consumer goods. One such example is the television. From 1948 through 1958, television went from being in only .4 percent of homes to over 80 percent of homes. (Baughman, pg. 42) The “availability of [broadcast] TV service” was the biggest reason for the explosion in television purchases. (Baughman, pg. 42) Society was also going through what is known as the “Baby Boom.”(Baughman, pg. 42) This increased the population of young people and children that were going to be using this technology. Thus, a market for child-focused programming started and was quickly embraced by television programming providers. (Baughman, pg. 42) This new audience sparked brand new types of programming. (Baughman, pg. 42)"," ","International Telephone and Telegraph Company was in the business of producing and selling TV sets.(<em>Duke Digital Collections</em>) In 1949, they purchased an advertisement that ran in the September 19 edition of <em>Time Magazine</em>. (<em>Duke Digital Collections</em>) The advertisement features a quasi-television screen that features a football game with their slogan, “better television for more people.”(<em>Duke Digital Collections</em>) The advertisement also featured a body of text touting the association of IT&T with Capeheart-Farnsworth, especially noting the combined “technical resources” of both companies.(<em>Duke Digital Collections</em>) IT&T was an aggressive player in the international communication and electronics market during this time and its partnership with (and 1951 acquisition of) the struggling Capeheart-Farnsworth company allowed it to enter the budding television market. (\"History of International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation\") This partnership would “inevitably result” in “better television for more people."," ","The advertisement was intended to reach the general populace and appeal to all people, not just elites who may have already purchased a TV. In other words, they were appealing to the middle class and used their slogan twice in their advertisement in order to develop a brand identity. In fact, the advertisement featured the quote “A Pledge to the Nation’s Fastest Growing Audience.” (<em>Duke Digital Collections</em>) IT&T wanted to generate sales from the largest segment of the population, the non-elite."," ","The advertisement referenced recent events in order to appeal to readers. For example, a little over a year before the advertisement ran, the first NFL Championship Game was televised.(\"1948 NFL Championship Game\") The inclusion of a football game “on” the TV in the advertisement was hardly an accident. Instead, it was likely a calculated marketing decision. Only ten years earlier, the first televised sporting event, a Columbia University vs. Princeton baseball game, had been shown. (Koppett, no pg.) Television production companies and marketing executives were cognizant that sports was an important part of television programming and one that would become even more significant in the near future.

The film dramatized the aftermath of a nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. The movie took place in Kansas City, Missouri and included cities such as Lawrence, Kansas. <em>The Day After</em> explored the effects of nuclear war from the perspective of ordinary Americans. The story focuses on several sets of characters: most notably Russell Oakes (played by Jason Robards), a doctor and professor at the University of Kansas, the Dahlbergs, a farming family from Harrisonville, Missouri and Billy McCoy (played by William Allen Young), an Air Force reservist stationed at Whiteman Air Base. The film became infamous at the time for scenes of violence and the graphic portrayal of characters perishing from radiation sickness. The movie ends with the ominous warning that “the catastrophic events you have just witnessed, are in all likelihood less severe than the destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear strike against the United States…” <em>The Day After</em> attracted 100 million viewers, and remains the highest rated television movie in U.S. history.","The controversy surrounding the movie’s release caused an uproar among the American population. Americans criticized U.S. nuclear policy because of what they had seen in the film. ABC and the White House received hundreds of calls from anxious viewers, many of whom supported the movie’s message. Anti-nuclear activists rallied behind movements such as “Let Lawrence Live” and 800-NUCLEAR. Those in favor of nuclear deterrence, however, worried that the emotional fall-out of the movie and controversy surrounding it would negate any critical analysis of nuclear weapons. Director Nicholas Meyer stood firmly on the side of the anti-nuclear activists, denouncing ABC’s attempts to tone down the movie’s political nature. According to historian Deron Overpeck, Meyer wanted to “clobber sixty-million people over the head” with his criticisms of nuclear weapons.","The role <em>The Day After</em> played in changing U.S. nuclear policy is debatable. When the movie premiered in 1983, U.S. relations with the Soviet Union were at their worst levels in twenty years. President Ronald Reagan viewed it days before its premier on ABC. While the movie left Reagan shaken and disheartened, he continued to defend nuclear deterrence as a means to pressure the Soviet Union to the negotiating table. Despite this, <em>The Day After</em> spurred public conversation about nuclear war to reach levels unseen since the Cuban Missile Crisis twenty-one years earlier. The movie’s greatest impact was not changing the minds of policy makers, but its effect on how ordinary Americans debated nuclear policy."],"display_date":"November 20, 1983","search_date":"1983-11-20","locations":[{"id":8915,"lat":40.7804872,"lng":-73.9679741,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":1041,"tag":"Film"},{"id":293,"tag":"Ronald Reagan"},{"id":2197,"tag":"Television"},{"id":3507,"tag":"ABC"},{"id":3508,"tag":"Anti-Nuclear Activism"},{"id":3509,"tag":"Movie"},{"id":3510,"tag":"Nuclear War"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":178,"school_id":3}}]}
