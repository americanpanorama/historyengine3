Some states have equal punishments for the prostitute and the customer. In the state of Alabama, both the prostitute and customer can spend up to a year in jail and/or have to pay a six thousand dollar fine.

The week before the ordinance was passed, three prostitutes were arrested for working out of a motel. Mayor Bob Waldrop said that Homewood was working to deal with the problem of prostitutes working out of local motels. The ordinance made it illegal for prostitutes to work between the hours of nine p.m. and six a.m. Waldrop called the ordinance “old fashion.

Seated in Jefferson County, which is located in central Alabama, Birmingham was named after the industrious steel city of Birmingham, England. Also known as the “Magic City” and “Pittsburgh of the South”, Birmingham had earned these titles after its immense industrial growth. Birmingham’s steel productivity was made possible by its twenty-five local blast furnaces. These twenty-five blast furnaces were used in the smelting process. Smelting is the process in steel making that removes the iron metal away from its ore.  Birmingham’s extreme industrial success was due to the locality of iron, which was found on nearby Red Mountain.  Red Mountain’s ridge runs southeast along the Magic City’s southern border and was named “red” after the color of the iron that was found there.","    Bertha Bendall Norton, a Birmingham historian writes, “If in early 1900 you had stood on Red Mountain where Vulcan, the largest iron statue in the world stands today, and gazed out upon this once sacred valley of Indians, you would, perhaps, have had a strange feeling of wonder, excitement and pride.”  The Pittsburgh of the South was exactly that, exciting and wonderful. New jobs were being created by the arrival of the steel and iron industries such as Sloss furnaces and Tennessee Iron and Coal Company, which opened in 1886.  Birmingham’s industry became self- sustaining and that began to concern northern industrialist who, at first, were not involved. Much of the United States was still oblivious to the Magic City’s capabilities of becoming the leading iron producer in the  industry.

From ground level of the plant, one could see brilliant light almost as bright as the sun flowing from the ladles into the troughs as men worked frantically to obtain their quotas of pig iron. In an 1984 interview, Alonzo Gaines revealed life as a black worker at Sloss Furnaces in Birmingham, Alabama.  Alonzo Gaines was a Laborer/Stove tender during his tenure at Sloss Iron and Steel Company from 1925 to 1940. As a black worker in the South, Gaines experienced some extreme working conditions.          ","            Born in 1906, on a farm in Athens, Georgia, Gaines was exposed to racism from a young age.   “They always called us niggers, not blacks, but that didn’t bother me much, because for me working at Sloss Furnaces was a great opportunity,” said Gaines. Alonzo, like many other blacks at the time flooded into factories in search equality and opportunity. The conditions for blacks were good in industrial Birmingham. There were many jobs to be had by black workers in the \"Magic City\", and working at Sloss Furnaces was a popular place for many African Americans like Gaines.","            Although many blacks found that there was money to be made at Sloss Furnaces, outside the factory gates they were confronted with a segreagated, Jim Crow society.  As Birmingham historian, Bobby M. Wilson notes, “Sloss furnaces, like other large corporations in Birmingham, were unique in how they gave blacks a chance to improve their status in the workplace.” But Wilson goes on to pinpoint the difficulties of translating that status to the wider community.  Gaines stated, “I used to look forward to going to work, because I could work beside a white man and he would talk to me like I was a man instead of an animal.” For this reason blacks sought security in such industries as Sloss. Job security for blacks became more evident and concrete with the advent of labor unions and the Civil Rights movement in Birmingham.

The Fox once housed one of the city’s many theatres; however, that was not the reason Nelson wanted to save it. The building was an architectural marvel and a structure he believed was Birmingham’s equivalent to Chicago’s Old Water Tower, the only standing structure after the Great Chicago Fire. The building was built in the Italian Renaissance palaccio style. With three floors, each separated by a cornice rib that could be seen from the street. Built by an early mayor of Birmingham, the building had architectural, social, religious and political significance; however, its close proximity to the Central Business District and lack of interest in revitalizing downtown, made the building a prime target to be torn down.","Throughout the late summer and early fall, <em>The Birmingham News </em>ran stories on the back-and-forth court battle that was taking place. Finally, the newspaper reported United States District Judge U. W. Clemon ruled that the building could be demolished after a long and excruciating grassroots effort to save the building failed. The judge’s ruling stated that the preservationists had waited too long to file a suit to save the building. Even though there was an effort to save the building, the Judge said that there was a severe lack of interest in restoring the building. Instead, he said, the Fox building had been an unoccupied eyesore in the city for years. In its place was to stand a branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.","According to John Poole, author of “The Federal Theatre Project in Georgia and Alabama,” Birmingham’s explosive growth at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century led to its citizens caring more about economics than history. Poole’s theory has proven true with the demolition many historic buildings in Birmingham to make way for new buildings and parking lots that will be more practical to the city. Because of this, Birmingham lost many pieces of its history. Future generations will not have as many architectural marvels as past generations had to rejoice over.

Captain O’Brien is best remembered for his other contribution to the city: O’Brien’s Opera House. Like Sublett’s Hall, O’Brien’s Opera House opened in the upper floors of a brick building. However, the Opera House was built ten years later in the city’s Northside. The theatre’s opening night was a sell-out. On that night, the theatre showed <em>The Black Cook. </em>The Parisian musical had been controversial when it played in New York. Sermons were even preached against it. Opening night was eventful for another reason. The lights would not turn on. Captain O’Brien borrowed headlights from locomotives from the nearby train yard.","In 1899, a New York company, Klaw and Erlanger, leased the theatre for five years for $4000. The story attracted attention because New Yorkers were taking interest in Birmingham’s new theatre life and <em>The New York Times </em>even reported on it. O’Brien’s Opera House attracted large crowds from all parts of the young city until 1900 when the larger and more beautiful Jefferson Theatre opened a few blocks away.

The plants were shut following a court order under the aegis of the 1970 Clean Air Act which set safe levels for particulates in the atmosphere, levels that Birmingham had routinely exceeded. The day after the shutdown, November 18, 1971, an article in the Birmingham News’ Metro Edition reported “an estimated 8,000 to 9,000 workers... lost a day’s pay as a result of [the] federal injunction.” Campbell was a North Birmingham resident where the particulate levels in the air were commonly above a safe standard, according to EPA guidelines.  Campbell, however, like many of his neighbors: was more concerned with the community’s livelihood than their lungs; “What are the people in Birmingham going to do if they [District Judge Sam C. Pointer and the EPA] run industry out?”","The plants were reopened the day after the shutdown and unions encouraged the installation of particulate devices that they claimed U.S. Steel had been reluctant to spend money on previously.  Though they lost that day’s pay, these workers argued that the shutdown was their employer's fault for not having installed these devices previously.  The particulate level would never again rise to the point where another shutdown was necessary, thanks to the new measures brought in to factories, and the eventual dwindling of heavy industry in Birmigham.","A full report on the story, staunchly supporting the EPA’s efforts, by journalist Patrick J. Sloyan assailed U.S. Steel for weakening a 1969 bill on pollution control, for ignoring the early EPA request to curtail production when the pollution level was first considered hazardous, for concealing this inaction to the media and for having their attorneys first on the scene in protesting the injunction.  The front-page report on the story in the Birmingham news confirmed the company’s inaction, listing it amongst other companies that failed to respond promptly.  However the Birmingham News held back any criticism of the company, with most of its opinion pieces on the matter condemning the EPA for the halting of industry.","The EPA had been formed eleven months before the incident in Alabama, after President Nixon had called for several smaller environmental agencies to be consolidated.  The new agency defined the danger levels of air pollution just one month prior to the events in Birmingham.  It was these guidelines the EPA’s enforcement team in Birmingham put forward to Judge Pointer when attempting to achieve the injunction.  Shortly after the EPA’s formation, in December 1970, Nixon signed the Clean Air Act into law, stating “I think that 1970 will be known as the year of the beginning, in which we really began to move on the problems of clean air and clean water and open spaces for the future generations of America”.","The incident in Birmingham would be the first time the EPA utilised the Clean Air Act, and demonstrated the federal organisations muscle over big industry in emergency situations.  The events and responses of this tale in America’s environmental history show how government agents and politicians might envisage the best for the American people without considering real world aspects.  The people seem to respond with much more day-by-day realism on the matter, according to the quotes used in the Birmingham News, the steel town <em>needed</em> the factories running.  With mouths to feed the citizens didn’t feel like they could afford the luxury of clean air and healthy lungs if that meant industrial operations would cease."],"display_date":"November 1, 1970 - December 30, 1971","search_date":"1971-06-01","locations":[{"id":35012,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":963,"tag":"Iron and Steel Industry"},{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5437,"title":"Anniversary march in Birmingham asks same questions","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/93","end_date":"12/31/93","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["<strong>Y</strong>ears after civil rights pioneers, like Martin Luther King Jnr., walked the Birmingham streets protesting against segregation and for equal opportunity, influenced black Baptist preachers rewalked the march route in September 1995.  Raising awareness for a campaign to increase the black polling population nationwide; march leader Rev.

These measurements collected over separate areas of the city could not be ignored any further as a thick blanket of pollution covered the cities skyline for several days. As Alabama’s largest city and a southern industrial hub, Birmingham served as home to many steel and iron producing plants that accounted for much of this pollution. In response to the crisis U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer of North Alabama issued a temporary injunction on twenty-three local industries and prompting the intervention of a federal strike force of environmental specialists by recommendation of the still new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.","However, when the Birmingham News announced the arrival of a congressional subcommittee to hold a hearing, the question of most concern was determining if federal action was either too extreme or not aggressive enough, in spite of claims that local industries had been slow to act accordingly. If voluntary action from industries weren’t in place, then feds would exercise emergency powers of the Clean Air Act of 1970. While The Clean Air Act enforced EPA standards, it was The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 that paved the way for the institutionalization of environmentalism. NEPA was enacted as a means to assure safe, healthy and esthetically pleasing surroundings, while attaining the most possible benefits devoid of compromising unwanted consequences.  At the height of the pollution crisis, particulate counts measured double the national average. Even after the count dropped following the shut downs, local industries still complained the order was carried out with little evidence any individual industry was to blame. Though the injunctions did not demand the complete shutdown of industrial plants, the dramatic reductions implemented brought production to a crawl. With so many employed by these industries and such huge cutbacks, worker’s jobs and their livelihoods were placed on the line. According to historian Thomas Wellock, up until recently any though of limiting industrial growth was considered “civic heresy.”","Nestled in the Deep South, Alabama has long been a state of proud independent character with a long political history preferring little to no federal intervention. However as Wellock points out, in the seventies politicians were aware of the publics demand for federal action, and Alabama’s leaders knew better than to alienate their constituency. Major legislations, like NEPA, were passed that would instill environmental values within local, state, and federal bureaucracies’. With Vietnam War, Civil Rights movement, and so many dividing issues during those times, the environment became one topic of bi-partisan support. To politicians, this was a win, win scenario that everyone can benefit from especially when it comes to votes."],"display_date":"November 18, 1971 - November 20, 1971","search_date":"1971-11-19","locations":[{"id":35012,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1355,"tag":"Clean Air Act"},{"id":1354,"tag":"Air Pollution"},{"id":1353,"tag":"NEPA"},{"id":1352,"tag":"EPA"},{"id":1351,"tag":"Environmentalism"},{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":84,"school_id":10}},{"id":5583,"title":"Understanding A Letter From Birmingham Jail","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"4/16/63","end_date":"4/16/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After being arrested in downtown Birmingham on a Good Friday, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. wrote his famous letter, <em>“A Letter From Birmingham Jail” </em>responding to the criticism demonstrated by eight prominent white clergy man. This letter has been found important through out history because it expresses King’s feelings toward the unjust events and it is an example of a well-written argument. Most importantly, this letter explains current events in Birmingham in 1963 as well as in the rest of America and it demonstrates the approach Reverend King took through out the whole civil-rights movement of 1950s and 1960s.","Due to unfortunate circumstances, the great injustice of slavery makes up a significant portion of America’s history.  Even after this chapter of history ended, it left its legacy of “blacks” being portrait as subhuman and it developed a sense of racism in the new generations. In addition, following the Civil War, that legacy was expressed through the Jim Crow Laws, which promoted segregation. These new laws violated the fundamental american tenet that “all men are created equal” and are “endowed by their creator with certain unalienable right”. [1] Historian C. Vann Woodward describes the segregating Jim Crow laws as:","“That code lent the sanction of law to a social ostracism that extended to churches and schools, to housing and jobs to eating and drinking. Whether by law or by custom, that ostracism extended to virtually all forms of public transportation, to sports and recreations, to hospitals, orphanages, prisons and asylums and ultimately to funeral homes, morgues, and cemeteries.”[2]"," ","The American people were motivated by the terrible acts of violence on black people and were touched by the civil-rights movement’s message of “respect for the dignity of the individual”.[3] There are different opinions of what led to start the civil-rights movement of 1950s and 1960s. Although some may say it was after the Supreme Court’s decision in the Brown v. Board of Education 1954, Fairclough wrote that it was a “consequence of the rise of black voting after World War II”.[4] Nonetheless, it is a fact that Alabama was home to the three most significant campaigns. First there was the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56, followed by the Birmingham protests of 1963 and later on the Selma Campaign of 1965.","After 1945, African Americans in Birmingham made significant gains as they “built parks, playgrounds, and swimming pools for blacks, and it took action to punish white policemen who beat up black prisoners.”[5] In addition, by the mid-1950s, a substantial black electorate arose numerous enough to influence the outcome of some elections. This grabbed the attention of white candidates, which were then forced to decide whether to seek the support of the black voters or humiliate them to solidify the white vote. With a growing sense of fear that black voters were going to change the “southern way of life”, politician Eugene T. Connor of Birmingham took an anti-black stance and made white racial privilege the focus of his campaign. Martin Luther King Jr., in his letter, describes Birmingham as “the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States” where “ negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts” and had “more unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches”.[6]","Specifically, in 1963, there were numerous current events that took place in Birmingham that support Dr. King’s words. For example, in a racially mixed neighborhood two people were killed in a bomb explosion. Police Commissioner Connor ordered police dogs and water hoses against the elementary and high school students who joined the “Children’s Crusade” demonstrations in downtown. 1,500 people rioted around the Gaston Motel after being bombed, leaving 50 people injured. And last but not least, the Sixteenth Street Baptist church was bombed killing four Black girls and wounding several other children.[7]","Given a few examples of the many occurrences that happened in Birmingham in 1963 and after reading Martin Luther Kings thoughts on it, it is hard to understand why Martin Luther King did not choose to retaliate with the same violence and instead chose direct action. In his letter, he explain to the clergyman his reasons for choosing direct action which was “to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation”.[8] These words truly depict Martin Luther King’s idealism of not only the civil-war movement but of democracy as well. After studying theology, King’s views for America’s political future was theological.  According to Heltzel, King believed a democratic community had to be made up three characteristics, which were: inclusivity, interculturality and non-violent love.[9]","It is believed that King’s ways came after the Bombing of his Montgomery home where he was confused and frightened and saw no other solution but to pray to God. It was then where he became inspired by multicolored dreams of democracy.[10] He rendered democracy with the metaphor of “beloved community” which meant, “Every person is sacred, unique, dignified, and loved by God and thus must be fully and meaningfully incorporated into the human society”.[11] He believed that to achieve this it could only be done through non-violent love because violence was the death of the very possibility of Democracy.[12]","Overall, “A Letter from Birmingham Jail” is one the best written argumentative pieces. It’s a piece full of history but most importantly is a piece where we can witness how Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. approaches his problems and how well it worked."," "," "," "," "," "," ","[1] Canady, Charles T. \"America's struggle for racial equality.\" Policy Review no. 87 (January 1998): 42. Academic Search Premier, EBSCOhost (accessed September 7, 2012)."," ","[2] Canady, “America’s Struggle For Racial Equality”.","[3] Canady, “America’s Struggle For Racial Equality”.","[4] Fairclough, Adam. \"Dividing Lines: Municipal Politics and the Struggle for Civil Rights in Montgomery, Birmingham, and Selma.\"<em>Alabama Review</em> 57, no. 2 (2004): 132-140. http://ezproxy.rollins.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/211800689?accountid=13584."," ","[5] Fairclough, “Dividing Lines”.","[6] King, Martin Luther. \"Letter from Birmingham jail.\" Letter From Birmingham Jail (January 2, 2009): 1.

That was because a lot of the wealth and growth in the city of Birmingham was because of Sloss and its role in the industrial boom.","With this historic landmark under fire to be torn down and replaced by an amusement park or some ordinary building with no historic significance, many Birmingham natives began to fight to protect and preserve the old furnaces because of what Sloss meant to the city, it was not just a place where people came to work.  It was a place that changed Birmingham forever.  Robert Stipe stated that preservation is important because it is a way to pay our respect to what built what we have today.  To honor and understand the events, structures, and people that created the good for a city, state, or nation.  If it was not for Sloss Furnace and its large amounts of production, Birmingham would not have grown into the city we have today.  Sloss brought people to the city to work, which created new homes and stores.  These homes and stores where built to house, feed, and provide clothes to all the workers moving to the Magic City to work in this very popular furnace.  This was because Sloss made Birmingham one of the top cities on the nation.  W. David Lewis called Sloss the industrial empire due to its position on the railroads which made transportation in and out of the city easy.  With efforts to save Sloss Furnace from destruction, the historic furnaces are still standing.  When Sloss closed the doors in 1970 the Furnace was changed into a museum dedicated to the industrial and railroad history.  There was also a celebration that was held on April 12, 1982.  That celebration was to celebrate the preservation and history of Sloss Furnace, and it commemorated the first run of iron that had ever flowed at Sloss. That first run was made in the original Sloss Furnace Number One just a century prior to the celebration.","Blast Furnaces once played a key role in so many communities.  Several furnaces are being preserved and recognized for their significance. For example, the Oswego Iron Furnace, in Oswego New York, has already won an award by the National Trust of Historic Review.

Brown and the Heart of Dixie Railroad Society tried nonstop to save and preserve this building.  These organizations came up with several ideas for the terminal like a transportation museum with gift shops or a restaurant and shopping center. The idea of a restaurant was very popular because the groups wanted to preserve the restaurant that already existed inside in an effort to keep something inside the terminal active and in working order.  Dr. Gilbert Douglas from the Railroad Club said that Birmingham had nothing to offer historically, and this terminal could be the main attraction to draw tourists into the city.  All of these groups knew the importance of preservation.  Robert Stipe says that historic preservation is important because the historic buildings, structures, and homes can show the importance and beauty that cannot be rebuilt.  Once it is gone it is gone. However, Birmingham officials did not understand this because they had sent a wrecking ball to knock down the historic terminal that once brought so many people into Birmingham.  Another man, Albert Tucker, a veteran baggage porter, understood the importance of preservation.  As a matter of fact, Albert Tucker stood all by himself on Platform 5, waiting on the final train, the “City of Miami” to arrive on the final day of the Birmingham Terminal.  He told reporters that, “they’re building a little bitty place, 40 by 60 feet, down at the end of the platforms.  Inside there was only a ticket agent and an elderly couple because now train was not the way to travel.  Both the ticket agent and Mr. Tucker knew that.  They both also knew that when the sun rises, workers from T. M. Burgin Demolition Company would come and start the engine to the crane and swing the big ball into the walls of the Mosaic tile walls that lined the terminal.  However, they were wrong, the workers came earlier, they showed up in the middle of the night and tore down the terminal in order to avoid the protestors and angry organizations.","The city of Birmingham lost a key piece of its history in 1969.  However, if the demolition of the terminal would have been a few years later the train terminal might still be standing.  This is because of a push for protection of properties that are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places began in the mid-1970s.  Additionally, as mentioned in Historic Preservation Law, in 1975, the Landmark and Preservation Law Division began expanding programs to protect urban landmarks and historic districts.  Therefore, if the laws were put in place in the sooner this historic landmark would still be standing.  Or, one could say that the nation learned its lesson after tearing down historic landmarks like this one, because, when its gone, its gone."],"display_date":"June 26, 1969 - September 22, 1969","search_date":"1969-08-09","locations":[{"id":31662,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1720,"tag":"Birmingham Terminal"},{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}},{"id":6116,"title":"“Prohibition in Alabama- Newspaper Fiasco”","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"2/25/15","end_date":"2/25/15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a New York Times article published on February 25, 1915 titled “Prohibition Running Amuck” a story is told about a newspaper and magazine distributer in Birmingham, Alabama. The distributers name was Hiram R. De Laye and he was the largest distributor in Birmingham. He was arrested because he sold a copy of a newspaper published outside Alabama that had a liquor advertisement within the newspaper. Hiram had to pay a fine that was not less than $50 but no more than $500. Hiram also had imprisonment at hard labor for not more than six months stated in the article. The article stated that, “The Alabama Legislature passed, over the Governor’s veto, a law making this a penal offense.” This would have restricted the state’s citizens to reading mainly home papers and also it would have made citizens mostly stop reading magazines.                                                                                                      News dealers of Alabama tried to rectify the situation by cutting liquor advertisements out of the papers before they delivered them. This ended up being very costly for Laye since he had the largest distribution of the printed press he had to employ more laborers to get the job done. Thenewspaper article then went on to say that Laye would not have to worry about labor for much longer because his customers would soon stop buying papers and magazines if nearly all the material is cut out. A portion of the paper says, “The Birmingham Age-Herald prints a cartoon of an indignant citizen trying to read the report of a battle in Belgium and finding the important part cut out because a liquor advertisement was printed on the back.”  This portion shows that the prohibition act could hamper literature as a whole.","The sheriff of Birmingham got involved and told the press that the city was not trying to make an example out of Laye, but if he continued to violate the law he would be arrested every day he broke the law. The Montgomery Advertiser and The Birmingham News then decided to ignore the law. The article continues to speak on how prohibition is running mad and how human interest should not be sacrificed. Also the article states how if this situation were to logical extremes it would give states with anti-cigarette and anti-racing laws the right to exclude those advertisements in the paper.  Pretty soon the customer would be getting nothing for their money. The article ends with the author trying to bring citizens to his side by saying, “They might enact a law providing that if a citizen takes a drink in Tennessee and crosses into Alabama he should be arrested on the ground that he had carried liquor into the State.”","This <em>New York Times </em>newspaper article shows how there can be complications between the amendments. For instance, just how far do citizens’ rights protect someone when going against the government? Historian Robert M. Entman states that the government influences or determines some of the information citizens receive from the media. If the government sees it will benefit the larger majority of people they will alter information. Entman states that the First Amendment does not prevent the government from shaping most important dimensions of the news media’s messages. Many other news affiliates thought Laye was innocent yet the legislature found him guilty which shows how amendments can clash with each other. This clash ended with Laye being found guilty and being thrown in jail. All of this can be an example of how even our amendments have flaws, and they can be obstructed by each other."],"display_date":"February 25, 1915","search_date":"1915-02-25","locations":[{"id":18257,"lat":33.553801834,"lng":-86.8960886107,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"},{"id":2273,"tag":"Newspaper"},{"id":1397,"tag":"Amendment"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6120,"title":"Desegregation of UAB Medical Center","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"7/2/64","end_date":"4/25/65","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Birmingham, Alabama was referred to as: \"the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States” by Martin Luther King, Jr. It was also given the name “Bombingham” due to the fifty unsolved racially charged bombings between 1945 and 1962. These bombings were directed towards the homes of African American leaders, integrated neighborhoods, and meetings for the Civil Rights Movement. Perhaps the most notorious occurred September 15, 1963 at 16th Street Baptist Church. Three members of the Ku Klux Klan decided to place dynamite under the steps of the church killing four young girls. The 16th Street Baptist church was where many civil rights leaders and activist held their meetings. This single moment in American history was the turning point for the Civil Rights Movement and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 enacted July 2, 1964 which prohibited any discrimination or denying access to public places based upon race, religion, sex, or national origin. The same year the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, the phrase, “Joe Loves Niggers” was drawn on the entrance of the Medical and Dental Basic Science building of the University of Alabama November of 1964.","<br /> This graffiti was in response to Joseph Volker; the Vice President of Health Affairs at the University of Alabama Medical Center first attempts to desegregated their facilities in accordance to the new legislation. On April 25th of 1965, Joseph Volker received an email from Mathew McNulty, Jr. entitled the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which stated that “If it should be recorded, it is here reported that the University of Alabama at Birmingham hospitals and Clinics are 100% “non-segregated.” This letter detailed that University hospital’s attempt to desegregate the hospitals were successful although it was met with disdain from not only the community but from those inside of the facility. Mathew McNulty, Jr. was forced to place several members of the hospital in specific places such as the cafeteria to serve as “arbiter, race relations leader, persuader, and policemen” as he tells Volker in a letter explaining the difficulties of the transition.","<br />The problems that faced Volker as he attempted to comply with the new piece of legislation seemed not to bother him.  When asked about the difficulties of the patients in the newly desegregated facilities and how he was able to perform what would then be considered a difficult task and a less than progressive city, Joseph stated “We decided to do absolutely nothing except we started putting patients in on a first come, first served basis depending on the kind of care they needed. The first week, the black patients and the white patients looked at each other and turned their backs on each other, and that was the only protest that was made. They are too sick to do anything else… But after a week, everything began to settle down and people must have agreed that sick people are sick people. They’re not black, they’re not white. They are just sick, and they want to get well. And so, they started gradually turning over and speaking to each other.”","<br />Volker’s actions to comply with the legislation without fear benefitted the community dearly. This was a turning point not only for healthcare for the city of Birmingham, Alabama but soon a communal understand and progression. This allowed for people to have equal opportunity to decent care. It had the potential to give doctors colored or otherwise the ability to see patients and join in on a larger medical institution. Due to Volker’s progressiveness and concern for other’s helped make the University of Alabama the institution it is today with the University of Alabama at Birmingham being ranked fourth in student diversity by The Princeton Review.<br /><br />"],"display_date":"July 2, 1964 - April 25, 1965","search_date":"1964-11-27","locations":[{"id":31662,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"},{"id":1795,"tag":"integration"},{"id":2285,"tag":"UAB"},{"id":2286,"tag":"Civil Rights Act 1964"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6121,"title":"Holy Family Hospital: Birmingham's First Colored Hospital","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"4/11/41","end_date":"4/11/53","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","On February 10, 1957 the <em>Birmingham Post-Herald </em>headline story was “Beds Scarce For Negroes in Hospitals.” Arthur Bailey, the administrator of Jefferson-Hillman hospital said that they had been forced to turn colored people away up to two weeks before this articled was printed. Due to Jim Crow Laws black people were unable to receive equal treatment in the medical community and were often forced to give up their bed if it were needed by their white counterparts. Facilities that offered a segregated unit did not house as many beds for African American’s which led to many people being turned away or denied proper healthcare.  Clyde Sibley, the director of Baptist Hospitals said, “For the first time, negroes have enough to go to a hospital. It will get much worse as the time goes on because more and more of them are buying it.” The need for black hospitals in which colored patients were guaranteed beds and served as the main priority and doctors of colors had a safe sterile place where they could treat their patients was becoming more and more needed in the Birmingham community.","Nearly a decade before this article was printed, Mother Ann Sebastian of Nazareth, Kentucky sent three sisters from Kentucky to Alabama to care specifically for the needs of African Americans. This facility, was the first hospital in Birmingham, Alabama created specifically for the care of African Americans and black doctors and nurses were able to care for their patients in a safe, sterile environment. This hospital originally completed in 1946 initially housed twelve beds. However, it wasn’t until 1954 that the hospital was expanded due to the large demand of people needing a pace to go to seek proper healthcare. It was also then that more black physicians and nurses were hired to care for the patients.  The colored physicians were “especially happy” now because they could follow their patients into the hospital and care for their needs for the first time in the history of Birmingham, Alabama. Dr. L.D. Green, president of the Mineral District Medical Assn. said, “This is a stepping stone…and a hope…where a colored patient of Jefferson County can enter to be treated by a physician of his choice.” This gave the black patient autonomy over his health. Dean of the Medical Center Roy R. kracke, M.D sent a letter sent to Mr. Robert Ingalls on May 16th, 1949 stating: “There is no need as great as hospitalization facilities for negroes in the county here a negro doctor can take a patient.” Kracke also sent a letter Father Eustace Eilers on June 21, 1949 stating that he believes that “a hospital for the negro physicians is both necessary and desirable in this community.” The need was so great the Holy Family hospital was forced to do a third expansion to meet the demands of those needing a place to go where they knew they could not be turned around.","Holy Family hospital was not only a stepping stone for the black community but also for the community as a whole. In 1954, a dedication ceremony brought hundreds of people of different race and religions from black and white to Jewish to those of the catholic and protestant faith. Along with city representatives and medical professionals. Col. Pritchard stated at the ceremony: “The friendship of men, regardless of race or creed, has brought into being this hospital, dedicated to relieving sufferings of our Negro friends.” People recognized that there was a need for patient care in the community colored or otherwise."],"display_date":"April 11, 1941 - April 11, 1953","search_date":"1947-04-11","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"},{"id":2283,"tag":"Holy Family Hospital"},{"id":2284,"tag":"Colored Hospitals"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}}]}
