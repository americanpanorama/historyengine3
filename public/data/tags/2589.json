As more and more people packed into the theaters, the film industry expected a prosperous year. Since the early 1970’s, movie attendance rose by 40% and the box-office in 1978 took in 12% more than in 1977 with a whopping, record-breaking $2.7 billion.[1] One 1977 movie also broke records for major American film studio Twentieth Century-Fox. The release of <em>Star Wars</em> brought in almost $235 million for the media conglomerate.[2] The success of the film increased the company’s annual stocks to $7.25 in 1978 from $6.52 in 1977.[3] One big question in the stock market and film industry, would Warner Communications’ <em>Superman</em>, DC Comics superhero, be able to contest with the success of <em>Star Wars</em>? No one could be sure, but regardless, the “man of steel” looked to bring a positive outcome for Warner.","Stock analysts believe that <em>Superman</em> would also set records for Warner’s share of profits, from $1.33 to $1.50 a share for the first quarter. Even if the film fell short of what <em>Star Wars</em> did for Fox, there was still a lot of speculation in Warner’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange.<sup>2</sup> <em>Superman </em>did bring success to Warner by returning about $75 million in domestic rentals and helped the company reach an industry half-year high of $79.2 million in foreign billings.[4] The general economy outside the film industry though was not doing as well. Inflation skyrocketed from the beginning of 1979 to 1982 due to a shock in oil prices. Real GNP from 1979 to 1982 was almost stagnant proving the weakness of the economy at the time. [5]","Warner Communications did have its share of enemies though. In 1976, a feminist group called the Women Against Violence Against Women, or WAVAW, began its efforts by targeting Warner Communications. They were unhappy with the violence against women depicted on Warner’s album covers. At a 1976 NOW convention in California, WAVAW called for a boycott focused on Warner. The boycott concluded in 1979 with Warner agreeing to stop using images that portrayed violence against women on their album covers.[6]","The comic book market was shrinking however in the 1970’s. Although, major companies such as DC Comics still found profit in licensing deals with toy companies and Saturday-morning cartoons. Licensing profit was much growing faster than that of the comic book, but it was understood that the quality of the comic book was still at the core. Consequently, companies such as Warner introduced new executive leadership to upgrade their comic book divisions. [7] In fact, Warner Bros. is the parent company of DC Comics today.","The Superman of the 21st century continues the success of the hero with the release of “Man of Steel” in 2013, distributed still by Warner Bros., a subsidiary of Time Warner, formerly Warner Communications. The film grossed $657 million worldwide, making it the highest grossing film of the entire Superman franchise, proving that the caped hero continues to bring people to the box office."," ","[1] John C. von Koschembahr, \"Movie Stocks: Bring on the Gas Lines and the Recession.\" Financial World 148, no. 14 (Jul 15, 1979), 45.","[2] Robert Metz, “Market Place: How High Will ‘Superman’ Fly?,” <em>New York Times</em>, January 4, 1979, sec.

Ali chose to write a scenario in which he and Superman, who was unable to use his powers, boxed against each other as mortals. In fighting Superman, Ali is clearly reflecting the internal racial war that was going on during 1970’s America. He made the conscious decision to choose a superhero that was most associated with conservative American values such as equality, freedom and justice.","Siegel and Shuster had intentionally created Superman as a symbol of hope to the people during the time of the Great Depression, and gave him the alter ego of  “Clark Kent” in order to relate more with the people. As the gap between the American Dream and reality began to take a toll on the Americans in the 1930’s, Superman fought for justice and upheld the idea of the traditional American hero.","On the other hand, Muhammad Ali was a boxer, who was also known as being one of the biggest Muslim and African-American figures during the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. He spoke out on American hypocrisy towards other races, and criticized how Superman was meant to be the one to speak out for justice and American values, yet there were still oppressed minorities living in America. Ali’s comic book scenario clearly puts Superman as the superior white American male against himself, standing in place for the oppressed minorities who lack equal rights. In taking away Superman’s powers, Ali is literally leveling down the playing field, which shows how unequal the whites and blacks were in America. Superman’s “superpowers” would have been a representation for the social and economical power that whites had in America and the blacks were willing to fight for. Ali’s ending, in which Superman is knocked out in two rounds, creates the controversial alternative to American society as it features a world in which both races are equal, and minorities are able to defeat white Americans.","In conclusion, Ali was trying to send the message to the public about his opinions about race and inequality in America. He struck a chord in the American public by using one of the biggest Superheroes ever created. His comic book scenario featured a black man and a white man fighting against each other, and threatened to defeat the oppressed status quo just like how he defeated Superman in the ring."],"display_date":"February 1, 1978","search_date":"1978-02-01","locations":[{"id":36051,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2597,"tag":"Muhammad Ali"},{"id":2589,"tag":"Superman"},{"id":2201,"tag":"Minority Groups"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6813,"title":"The Transformation of Transmedia: The Influence of Outside Media Tie-Ins in Comic Books","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"10/1/87","end_date":"10/1/87","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Comics themselves are influential enough to serve as their own form of popular media. However, in issue #126C of <em>Amazing Heroes</em> titled “Millenium,” there’s an emphasis placed on popular culture outside of comics themselves. One short article in the beginning of the issue, titled “<em>Captain Eo</em> Hits Stores in August,” brings a music star into the comic world. An ad for a comic adaptation by Tom Yeates of a 3D film starring Michael Jackson that could only be see at Disneyland and Epcot Center, the book was predicted to have extensive reorders due to Jackson’s massive popularity. ","The idea of bringing Jackson, a megastar, into comic books supports the concept of transmedia. According to Henry Jenkins, transmedia is defined as “storytelling [that] represents a process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience... the strategy may work to draw viewers who are comfortable in a particular medium to experiment with alternative media platforms,” (Jenkins par. 2 and 6). It’s often used in the comic world, being that superheroes would debut in print and make their way to other platforms like radio, television, movies, physical merchandise, and more.","Transmedia in comics became crucial when World War II was emerging, mainly through the means of incorporating Superman into radio propaganda. Being the first superhero, Superman was, arguably, the most popular of them all. Seeing his success in the printed comic world, it was figured that he could prosper in other media platforms as well. On February 12<sup>th</sup>, 1940, <em>The Adventures of Superman </em>radio serial aired, only a few months after the first propaganda film for World War II emerged. Appearing on the Mutual Broadcast System, Superman was depicted fighting more villainous, real forces— affiliating himself with pro-American wartime imagery as a result. Serving as its own form of transmedia, “propaganda, in effect, was a form of advertising, enabling media messages to flow more freely across the borders of media. Both the strategies of producing interlinking narratives in the Superman comics as well as the character’s new construction as propaganda had involved many of the same industrial configurations, with both concerning the production of a flow of adjoining content across media—urging those who had purchased Superman already to purchase Superman again,” (Freeman par. 14). By using Superman in propaganda-like radio shows, the superhero found success in an audio format as well as print by fighting the “real” enemies of the American people. In turn, people would trust him more, and buy more of his comics as well.","Carrying into the 1980s, transmedia was used in “<em>Captain Eo </em>Hits Stores in August.” Through using Michael Jackson, the world’s most famous pop star at the time who appeared in several other media tie-ins like the 1978 film <em>The Wiz, </em>along with Pepsi commercials, <em>Amazing Heroes</em> knew that bringing him into their comics would not only increase their sales, but bring in readers who previously hadn’t picked up their comics. Not only was incorporating Jackson beneficial to them, but to Jackson as well, being that “it [was] necessary to develop new strategies, codes and narratives that brands and artists [were] creating to connect with consumers. Music [was] the basis of the collective experience and, in addition, it connect[ed] intensely and emotionally with the identity of groups that [were] its potential target,” (Sánchez-Olmos and Viñuela 11). Though he already had ample exposure, Jackson hadn’t been included in the comic book world before, giving him a new audience of people.","            Though popularized within the comic’s industry in World War II due to Superman transitioning to radio, transmedia proved to be popular in the industry long afterwards, incorporating a powerhouse musician into a print format to increase sales and draw in new readers."],"display_date":"October 1, 1987","search_date":"1987-10-01","locations":[{"id":53146,"lat":42.7353595,"lng":-84.4831298,"zoom":11,"place":"East Lansing, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1775,"tag":"Comics"},{"id":2589,"tag":"Superman"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":3585,"tag":"Transmedia"}],"course":{"name":"ENG 492H Honors Seminar in English","school":"Rollins College","course_id":185,"school_id":5}}]}
