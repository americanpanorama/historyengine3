The German Foreign Office promised to pass on all pertinent information regarding their investigation into the case of Dr. Mulvihill on to the United States government. They promised the same for similar cases as well, such as that of Mr. Roland Velz, who had been similarly assaulted by two German men when he failed to salute an emblem of the Nazi party.","In these cases, the severity of the punishments may seem somewhat harsh, and also appear unusual to us due to the fact that our knowledge of the use of prison (or concentration) camps generally derives from the post-war period and not before, and we are rarely informed about non-Jewish, German prisoners.  However, at the same time that the Nazi régime was investigating and punishing the men involved in these crimes, the articles notes that there were also “problems arising from Germany’s severance with the League of Nations and the arms parley at Geneva.” Regarding the latter issue, between the years 1932 and 1933, a World Disarmament Conference was held by the League of Nations in Geneva at which the constituent countries (primarily the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Germany) could not come to an agreement. On the one hand, according to Historian Marlies ter Borg, the German representatives believed that their country had taken the initiative in beginning the disarmament process and asked that the others follow suit. France, however, refused to do so unless they could have a promise of “collective security” from the United Kingdom and the United States, whereby those nations would intervene if war should break out in Europe. As Borg mentions, unfortunately for France, neither of those countries were willing to do so at the time.","In terms of the former concern, Historian Colum Duffy notes that when the nations who afterward became the Axis Forces during the Second World War (Germany, Japan and Italy) were accused of “committing acts of aggression” by the League of Nations, they made known their intention to withdraw from it “in order to prevent the machinery of the [League] from functioning effectively against them.” In light of these events – and their mention in the article – it is likely that the Nazi régime made their promise to hand over the information about these cases in an attempt to alleviate (somewhat) the issues that were quickly developing at the time and would damage their international image."],"display_date":"August 8, 1933","search_date":"1933-08-08","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"},{"id":806,"tag":"League of Nations"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":56,"school_id":28}},{"id":6823,"title":"Civilized Italy Rejects Civilized Negotiations","course_id":189,"status":"P","start_date":"9/4/35","end_date":"9/5/35","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","War was coming to Ethiopia. It was September 4<sup>th</sup>, 1935 and Italy’s delegate to the League of Nations, Baron Pompeo Aloisi, just delivered a final memorandum on Ethiopia. (<em>The Globe)</em> There is no chance of future negotiations between the two countries. Geneva, Switzerland became the backdrop for the League’s latest crisis when Italy demanded that Ethiopia’s membership be revoked. According to Aloisi, Ethiopia was a “Barbarian State” that did not qualify as a civilized nation, worthy to be part of the League.(<em>The Globe)</em> In addition, Italian assets in East Africa were constantly being threatened by Ethiopians, which could not be controlled by their own monarch, King Selassie. On the other end, Captain Eden of Britain pleaded for arbitration over war, stating that conflict would lead to the League’s collapse. He was aware that the League of Nations hasn’t resolved many conflicts. The pressure was on to find a solution since the whole world was watching their every move. He also declared that Ethiopia should remain independent. Considering that Italy already had major influence over Ethiopia’s finance and economy, courtesy of Britain and France, Eden argued that further concessions were overly generous. Ethiopia’s representative meanwhile, was present but not invited to speak. Professor Gaston Jeze spoke on his behalf and questioned whether war could be a possibility. He maintains that negotiations are a more civilized choice. It had been seven years since Italy signed the Kellog-Briand Anti-war Pact. However, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and his government had already “said [their] last words” (<em>The Globe)</em> and hastened war preparations.","Leading up to the Italo-Ethiopian War, which began a month after this article (<em>Mussolini Defies League on Ethiopian Dispute</em>) was published, Italy’s fascist government increasingly mounted pressure on the League to expel Ethiopia. Mussolini was adamant that “wicked and pretentious barbarians.” (Gooch, 1022) were threatening Italian assets. His position was similar to colonial attitudes that were common in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century that set Europe and western culture as the center of the civilized world. This fed into racial and ethnic discrimination, which determined whether certain people should be allowed within a group. The rise of fascism in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century certainly sped up this discrimination and led to the persecution of Jews and other minorities, which included the Ethiopians. Although the League of Nations was formed by “collective action by the sovereign states to maintain the peace,” (Eloranta, 30) they neither had the authority or desire to curb racism or aggressive threats, such as the one posed by Italy. For instance, when Japan began conquering Manchuria in 1931, the security council met only to discuss the drafting of a new disarmament agreement. (Eloranta, 33) No armed forces were sent to meet the crisis and no sanctions were imposed on Japan. In addition, member states could leave anytime, which Italy promptly did in 1937. This illusion of unity within the League would be fully shattered with the Second World War, but the cracks were already there. This article not only shows that outright acts of discrimination were beginning to resurface in 1935, but also that the League, by its vast limitations, could not prevent it."," "],"display_date":"September 4, 1935 - September 5, 1935","search_date":"1935-09-04","locations":[{"id":53155,"lat":46.2043907,"lng":6.1431577,"zoom":8,"place":"Geneva, Switzerland"},{"id":53161,"lat":9.145,"lng":40.489673,"zoom":8,"place":"Ethiopia"}],"tags":[{"id":3609,"tag":"Appeasement"},{"id":3608,"tag":"Italo-Ethiopian Crisis"},{"id":806,"tag":"League of Nations"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":189,"school_id":28}}]}
