This statement was clearly attempting to dissuade fear of the weapon testing area by informing the reader of the lack of live ordnance.  Weapons testing in the 1950’s caused both fear and a feeling of empowerment within American society. A large amount of both the national and international populace feared what the outcome of continued development and production weapons of mass destruction would mean for the world. People felt that it was their moral duty to oppose weapons of such incredible power. However other people felt that the continued creation of the hydrogen bomb was necessary for national security. The debate led to a split amongst the general populace, politicians, and, most importantly, scientists. Edward Teller and J. Robert Oppenheimer were the vocal leaders for each of the movements. On one side, the scientists felt it was their moral responsibility not to use their abilities for the creation of  weapons of mass destruction (Oppenheimer). The other, represented by Teller, felt that it was their responsibility to ensure the U.S. had the strongest weapons possible in its opposition communism & The U.S.S.R.. (2)","             A split in opinions led President Truman to put a stop to nuclear weapon research after the World War. This temporary respite ended rapidly when news reached the United States suggesting the Soviet Union was well on its way to developing a hydrogen bomb of its own. This news caused enough fear among the population to motivate President Truman into restarting the nuclear weapon research program. The first hydrogen bomb was tested shortly thereafter in November 1952. Creation of this new bomb was not enough not enough to appease the populace and testing to create an even more aggressive delivery system and bomb began. However, testing continued both on the hydrogen bomb and on missiles that could carry the bomb to a target. In 1957 the first intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear payload deemed operational was created by the Soviet Union. (3 ) The ability to strike the U.S. with a missile launched from within the Soviet Union was a nightmare come true for the United States. In reality, this nightmare was actually a false illusion created by the Soviets. The Soviets were only minutely ahead of us in terms of long-range missiles according to our intelligence. In 1960, our country introduced the first nuclear submarine; according to Eisenhower this creation essentially shifted the balance of power in favor of the United States. Unfortunately, this information could not be shared with the public and thus the fear continued to grow as the general populace believed the Soviet Union and by default communism was pulling aggressively ahead in the arms race. This false fear had a very real effect on the speed of the U.S.’s approach to the arms race.  With the growing fear of attack, the United States continued to develop and produce nuclear weapons.  In reaction to our weapons buildup, the Soviets increased their pace of development leading to an historical weapons race. (4)"," ","Fear caused by communism dominated our weapons development and politics during the 1950s. Political candidates used this fear to achieve office and scientists used it to gain support for their projects. What is often overlooked is what this fear did to the American people. It led to a cloistered, us against them attitude that persists somewhat to this day. The Cold War and the fear it brought may be passed but the aftershocks of this historic conflict are felt throughout the world today. "],"display_date":"1947 - 1960","search_date":"1953-12-31","locations":[{"id":52960,"lat":37.09024,"lng":-95.712891,"zoom":8,"place":"The United States"},{"id":52961,"lat":51.2206431,"lng":51.3635194,"zoom":8,"place":"The Soviet Union"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":1029,"tag":"Atomic Bomb"},{"id":3111,"tag":"Soviet Union"},{"id":3112,"tag":"Arms Race"},{"id":3113,"tag":"Hydrogen Bomb"},{"id":3114,"tag":"Edward Teller"},{"id":3115,"tag":"President Truman"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}},{"id":6740,"title":"Cold War Nuclear Arms Race","course_id":175,"status":"P","start_date":"10/29/62","end_date":"10/29/62","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","It was October 1962 and the Cuban Missile Crisis had narrowly been avoided. However, the stress of the of nuclear war still remained in President of the United States John F. Kennedy and the First General Nikita Khrushchev, leader of the USSR. This is evident in the political cartoon, drawn by Leslie Illingworth in the British newspaper, <em>The Daily Mail. </em>The cartoon which appeared in the paper on October 29, 1962 depicts the two world leaders arm wrestling.  The dominating feature of the cartoon is two men engaged in what appears to be an intense arm wrestling match. Viewers can see the sweat pouring off the leaders, especially Khrushchev who does not want to be shown up by the young United States president. Looking closer the readers can see that the two world leaders are not sitting on chairs, but rather on two hydrogen bombs, which are connected to a button that appears to be the signal for nuclear war. Each leader has their fingers ready to press the button, and to end the stalemate and begin the war that most wanted to avoid. ","            The anxiety of nuclear war between the USSR and US were new and unique to the world because of the introduction of the hydrogen bomb. The United States was the first country to test the hydrogen bomb in 1952 and the USSR quickly followed in 1953. According to historian Kari Frederickson, the hydrogen bomb “could project to be one hundred times more explosive” than the atomic bomb because it gets its energy through the fusion of atoms rather from fission. This development by both countries resulted in exactly what is depicted in the cartoon, a nervous and intense stalemate. ","The new emergence of the hydrogen bomb is only part of what makes the cartoon so accurate for this time period. It also perfectly portrays the delicate negotiating that was required by the Cold War and the many pivotal moments in the early 1960s that lead to this standoff. The first major encounter between Kennedy and Khrushchev came at the Vienna Summit on June 3, 1961. The meeting occurred shortly after the United States failed Bay of Pigs Invasion and put immense pressure on young President Kennedy to shows his foreign affairs prowess. However, Kennedy at times seemed to be affected by the brash and more experienced Khrushchev as the two argued about topics such as the Berlin Crisis, Laos, and a nuclear test ban. At the end of the two days tensions remained high as compromise did not seem possible and war seemed possible between the two. According to historian James Giglio, the encounter culminated with Kennedy telling Khrushchev “It will be a long winter” if the countries went to war.  ","            The threat of war would only grow and eventually came to its height four short months later in October with the Cuban Missile Crisis. The intense 13-day political standoff was over the nuclear missiles put on the island of Cuba only 90 miles from the United States. As a result, President Kennedy acted swiftly by placing a naval blockade around Cuba and making it clear that military force would be used if the United States sensed a threat. However, the two sides came together to avoid nuclear war as the USSR agreed to remove the missiles on Cuba in exchange for the United States promising to not invade Cuba. Leaving the tense arm wrestling match between the two in a stalemate.
