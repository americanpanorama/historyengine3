He would miss the people and the vineyards he worked in. But he had no choice because his town had been destroyed in an attack by Communist rebels. Demoes was part of the outnumbered troops that fought against them to the very end. After his town was virtually destroyed, Demoes and his family managed to come to Birmingham, AL with the help of some relatives. He was grateful for the opportunity for a new life and requested help for those he had left behind from his new community. He did not want to forget his roots.<br /><br />Demoes was one of a great number of Greeks that migrated to the United Sates and especially the South during the early part of the twentieth century. Most Greeks arrived in the South starting in the late nineteenth century in an effort to find work. Some Greeks also arrived later as a result of the ongoing war in their home country. Demoes was one of these Greeks. He brought his family to the new country and established his allegiance to it. However, he never forgot those that were left behind."],"display_date":"January 1, 1946","search_date":"1946-01-01","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":221,"tag":"Greeks"},{"id":222,"tag":"birmingham"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}}]}
