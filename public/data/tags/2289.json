The main issue with a single-shot weapon is the time it takes to reload. It took twenty seconds to reload a single-shot flint lock firearm. In that time Indians, for instance, could shoot up to six arrows (Kinard 66). Soldiers in the heat of battle were left vulnerable while they took time to reload. Samuel Colt’s successful patent on the six-shot revolver revolutionized the firearms industry. Colt did not invent the revolver but improved upon the design by making it a multi-shot weapon. The multi-shot revolver made it possible to fire six times before the weapon needed to be reloaded. This could save not only time, but soldiers’ lives while they were in battle (Kinard 65-66).","Samuel Colt was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1814 and was always fascinated with weapons and explosives. Being an American entrepreneur, Colt was looking for ways to make money off of his interests. Colt came up with his patent idea while studying navigation at sea (Kinard 63). He was fixated by how a ship’s wheel rotates and could also be locked into one position. Being an innovator, Colt brought some of his ideas to life by carving the components of his patent out of wood (Kinard 63). After working and saving, he had enough money to perfect his idea and employ gunsmiths to make prototypes. Colt then opened up a firearms manufacturing factory in Patterson, New Jersey, in 1836 (samuelcolt.net). There he worked on a design for a pistol that would utilize a cylinder and could be preloaded with six shots instead of one. ","On February 25,1836, Samuel Colt submitted an application to the United States Patent Office detailing his new invention (Colt). He wanted a patent in order to safeguard the design from his rivals. Not only did he safeguard his design from rival firearms manufactures, but he also protected his own interests by taking the patent out in his personal name instead of his company, Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company (Munz). Colt’s petition carefully detailed each of the components used in the new revolver and explained exactly how they operated throughout the firing processes. He wanted to make sure that the examiners at the patent office had no issues understanding what his patent was about and why it was a new and original design.","Samuel Colt’s patent application is seven pages long with three of those pages being drawings showing the breakdown of the specific components used in the new firearm. The patent application is extremely technical in the description of each component used and the material that it is made from. The way the firearm operates can easily be broken down into four steps.","Colt outlined the advantages of his design to the Patent Office.  Besides being multi-shot, the revolver used percussion caps instead of the flintlock’s that were used in the single shot muzzleloaders. Flintlocks were very susceptible to moisture whereas the percussion caps were more tolerant of moisture (Kinard 65). His firearm used a rotating cylinder that would turn and lock with the caps at the end of the cylinder itself. This kept the smoke of the powder and the exploding cap separate from the rest of the loads in the other chambers of the cylinder. There is a connecting rod between the hammer and trigger to rotate the cylinder to the prospective chamber. When the hammer would strike the cap, the recoil was minimal so the firearm was able to be held steady for better accuracy. The gun can be fired as fast as the hammer can be pulled back and the trigger pulled (Ikenson 85). ","At the time period of Samuel Colt’s patent, the United States was on the verge of starting to expand its western boundaries. Wars were inevitable when the United States tried to force its way onto lands that were inhabited by Indians for many years (Kinard 67). Colt saw that there was a need for improved weapons and geared his new design toward the military (Kinard 66). The improvements Colt made were of great advantage to soldiers and settlers that were exploring new lands."],"display_date":"February 25, 1836","search_date":"1836-02-25","locations":[{"id":1183,"lat":41.8064084993,"lng":-72.7328417292,"zoom":9,"place":"HARTFORD, Connecticut"}],"tags":[{"id":2287,"tag":"Colt Revolver"},{"id":2288,"tag":"Samuel Colt"},{"id":2289,"tag":"Weapons"},{"id":2290,"tag":"Guns"},{"id":2291,"tag":"Patents"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":124,"school_id":43}},{"id":6859,"title":"The United States Army Dismisses Repeating Rifles","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-12-09","end_date":"1861-12-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            In December 1861, Union Brigadier-General James Ripley wrote Secretary of War Simon Cameron to give his opinion on the newest firearms advancements. General Ripley did so to address gun makers’ proposals to sell their repeating Henry and Spencer “magazine arms” to the Union Army. He went on to describe these rifles and the ammunition that allowed them to fire multiple shots without reloading. While the General noted that reports on the repeaters “are favorable,” he believed their trials were too limited to identify them as effective combat weapons. He also shared his concerns about the weight of the loaded rifles, safety of the self-contained ammunition, and complexity of supplying that ammunition. In his opinion, the breech-loading carbines, which were already ordered by the Army, were good enough. Ripley felt that the repeating rifles should “be stopped by the refusal to introduce any more unless upon the most full and complete evidence of their great superiority.”","             The world in which General Ripley wrote was one of great technological advancement, firearms included. Throughout the Civil War, most soldiers carried single shot, muzzle-loading rifled muskets. While these rifles were certainly an advancement over early smoothbore muskets, they were slow and difficult to reload. Capable soldiers could only fire a few shots per minute. To help remedy this, a number of inventors developed breach-loading carbines, which could be easily loaded from the rear of the barrel. Both Union and Confederate forces adopted numerous versions of this design and implemented them with some success.","Although breech-loaders were an effective technological advancement, the first practical repeating arms entered the market shortly before the outbreak of war. Lever-action type carbines, including the Volcanic, Spencer and Henry, proved to be the most enduring and effective designs. These weapons could be loaded with several rounds of self-contained ammunition in a tubular magazine. Actuating a lever ejected the spent round and reloaded a fresh one from that magazine, readying it for fire. The self-contained ammunition required by the Spencer and Henry rifles used a metallic casing, which conveniently held the bullet, gunpowder and the primer, mercury fulminate. Altogether, this system yielded a much higher rate of fire.","            Despite General Ripley’s letter discrediting the new repeating arms, they did see some official service in the Civil War. A number of Union units were equipped with Spencer carbines by 1863. A few units also adopted the superior Henrys, although more soldiers privately purchased them. Mounted cavalry especially coveted the repeaters. They proved to be quite effective in battle, allowing small numbers of soldiers to produce huge volumes of fire, even in adverse situations. Expended use of these repeating carbines, despite concerns, likely would have helped the Union achieve victory in the Civil War sooner. Yet, most army brass continued to follow Ripley’s overly cautious thought process. Even decades after the war, single shot trapdoor rifles remained standard issue. While civilians and foreign governments welcomed the repeating arms, the U.S. Army did not adopt one as its standard issue rifle until 1892."],"display_date":"December 9, 1861","search_date":"1861-12-09","locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.920310953731,"lng":-436.99169966104,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3665,"tag":"Rifles"},{"id":2289,"tag":"Weapons"},{"id":599,"tag":"Technology"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
