Well, for Coca-Cola, it made the world of difference. In the hot summer of May, 1886, John Pemberton created the beginnings of what would be the most revolutionary and world-renown product as of yet.","This time, the Gilded Age, was the rise of advertising. Everyone and their brother had an idea for a concoction or medicine which cured, supposedly, exactly what ailed you. With so many different, unnecessary, products on the market, only those which made a name for themselves were successful.","In the first year of its invention, Coca-Cola only sold 25 gallons of syrup, enough for just a few hundred glasses. In 1886, the advertisements for Coca-Cola featured a pretty, well-dressed girl drinking Coca-Cola with the caption or idea, \"Drink Coca-Cola\". At its inception, Coca-Cola had to convince you that it was what you wanted to drink. Part of the way to do this, especially in a world dominated by men, was to convince them using a woman's beauty.","But by 1907, Asa Griggs Candler had made Coca-Cola a country-wide phenomenon. The 1907 advertisement is a well-dressed man drinking the last few drops of Coca-Cola from a glass with the caption \"Sold Everywhere.\" Now that everyone knew what Coca-Cola was, the emphasis in advertising shifts from enticing people to try the new product, especially using the seduction of a woman, to reassuring people. Reassuring them that Coca-Cola is indeed what they want to drink because it is the best, as proven by the successful look of the man drinking it.","Pemberton, a well-known pharmacist in Atlanta, had many concoctions brewed for various ailments. This one just happened to be in the right place at the right time. It was eventually bought by another very successful pharmacist Asa Griggs Candler. Candler was the true business-man with the idea that Coca-Cola, as it came to be known, would be great.","From 25 gallons the first year, to \"Sold Everywhere\" was a remarkable change and that was just the beginning. Coca-Cola would become the world's most recognized symbol and word.","It is important to understand, however, the circumstances under which Coca-Cola was born to its original owner. John Pemberton was a Civil War veteran, and like many, many others, he was addicted to morphine. The power and effects of the coca plant, from which we derive cocaine, were just being discovered. Not only that, but prohibitionists in Atlanta were gaining ground and it seemed inevitable the city would become dry. John first was experimenting with the coca-plant, making a sort of wine out of it, but eventually he traded the alcoholic part for the caffeine jolt from the Kola plant. The name derived from its two main ingredients and was written by John's bookkeeper in the classic, flowing script we all recognize. Not only this, but at first, the syrup become known more as a medicine for headaches and stomach pains, than an enjoyable drink it was mixed with regular water, not carbonated. It became carbonated after a soda fountain operator accidentally mixed it with carbonated water.","So the history of Coca-Cola is not nearly as glamorous as one would to believe, or as Coke would like to have you believe. It was born of a morphine-addicted Civil War Veteran, originally as a medicine. However, the true greatness of the story lies in Asa Griggs and the Great American dream. Asa bought the formula and all its creation details and tools for a total of $2300 in 1888 and by 1906, he had just built the largest building in the city of Atlanta. From \"Drink Coca-Cola\" to \"Sold Everywhere\" is a pretty good idea of just how far an knack for advertising and some hard work can take you."," "],"display_date":"May 1886 - May

Porter was a man of many talents.  Born in 1792 in Massachusetts but moving to Maine when he was nine, Porter was apprenticed to a shoemaker by his family, but he was far too restless for that kind of life.  After leaving home he played the fiddle, traveled to Hawaii, taught dancing school, had 15 children by two wives and became one of the most accomplished mural painters of his day.  However, his true avocation was inventing.  Among his creations (he had over 100 patents) were a fire alarm, signal telegraph, fog whistle, washing machine, and a revolving rifle.  Showing the kind of business sense that has rendered his name obscure in the annals of American history, in 1844 Porter sold this last idea for $100 to Samuel Colt, who then used it to build his renowned firearms company.","Porter may have struck out in the weapons industry, but his contribution in the field of journalism was just as long-lasting.  He took over the <em>New York Mechanic</em> in 1841, but sold it after relocating to Boston the next year in order to work as an electroplater.  Back in New York City, on August 28, 1845 he put out the first issue of <em>Scientific American</em>, a magazine that survives to this day.  In his first editorial, Porter gives the goal of the new journal as “to furnish the intelligent and liberal working man and those who delight in the development of the beauties of Nature…with a paper that will instruct while it diverts and amuses them, and will retain its excellence and value, when political and ordinary newspapers are thrown aside and forgotten.”","The first issue certainly made a good effort on these promises.  There are, as might be expected, scientific articles such as a discussion of the first principles of mechanics and another on how two compounds mixed together could make a very different color than each separately, a fact no doubt related to Porter’s artistic career.  There are also descriptions of the latest technology, improved railcars and the steamship <em>Great Britain</em>, complete with engravings.  There is a list of all of the patents recently granted.  Then there are some articles of a different bent, like the surprising assortment of poetry.  One article is entitled “Rational Religion,” that no doubt provides a distillation of Porter’s own sunny philosophy and the first in a regular theological column.  The story of a horse that is sensible enough to go by itself to the blacksmith is found between an article on lithographic painting and another on the properties of zinc.","One article that deserves of particular notice discussed the invention of one Signor Muzzi.  Muzzi claimed to have invented a method of aerial locomotion, which was basically a propelled balloon.  The author of this article dismissed the practicality of this claim with scorn, writing about how Muzzi’s plan received undue attention simply because he was Italian while a far more rational plan proposed by an American had previously been dismissed.  The vehement dismissal of Muzzi could perhaps be explained by realizing that Porter’s lifetime goal was to develop a working airship and the American referred to in this article was likely none other than himself.","Porter would devote most of his life until his death in 1884 to working on his airship plan, retaining his optimism in the face of business and technical failures.  As for the <em>Scientific American</em>, Porter sold it to two patent lawyers, Orson Desaix Munn and Alfred Ely Beach, for $800 just 10 months after the first issue was published.  He would stay on as editor for another year, but it was under their leadership that the broadsheet would begin to flourish.  Porter himself passed away in Connecticut in 1884, a man whose “eccentricity of genius” was too little appreciated in his day."],"display_date":"August 28, 1845","search_date":"1845-08-28","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW

November 24, 1874, the United States Patent Office issued Patent No. 157124 to Joseph F. Glidden of De Kalb, Illinois.  Glidden invented “a new and valuable improvement in wire fences,” with the goal to “preserve cattle from breaking through wire fences…the fence wire is composed of two strands which are designed to be twisted together after the spur.”  The United States Patent Office issued a total of nine patents for wire fence improvements in the five years leading up to and including Glidden’s.  Michael Kelly was issued the first patent in November, 1868. Glidden’s barbed wire, however, proved to be the most popular and most effective.  According to historian James Roark, the invention of barbed wire changed America’s west by “revolution[izing] the cattle business and sounded the death knell for the open range.”","Before barbed wire, if ranchers wanted a fence for their livestock they made it out of wood which was expensive because it was scarce in some parts of the west and had to be shipped in from the east.  Wire fences before barbed wire consisted of a single strand of wire that could easily be broken by cattle.  Without fencing to keep cattle in, the bovines grazed freely competing for grass and water and destroying crops like wheat.  Every year, cattle owners led their herds to slaughter houses unhindered by wire fencing.  Barbed wire limited the open range and in turn limited the freedom of ranchers and cowboys.","Barbed wire had a major impact on the many settlers and nomadic Native Americans living in the west.   Previously, the land was open for public use with many ranchers’ cattle roaming freely, eating, and drinking.  Now, ranchers and settlers fenced off their land with many believing they were being cut off from necessities. This started many disputes, and eventually led to a concentration of power in the hands of the land owners. The wealthy ranchers started fencing their land and individuals with livestock but no land had nowhere for their livestock because much of the public land was becoming too overgrazed.  For the small-time ranchers, many had to sell out to large ranches, and then many had become wage workers for the large ranches.  Nomadic Native Americans used to roam freely, but now these barbed wire fences began to limit their movements.  Some even began calling barbed wire the “Devil’s Rope.”","The invention of barbed wire changed the west permanently by limiting the open range and starting many fights over land.  Glidden did not invent barbed wire, but simply made the best improvement of Kelly’s first design.  Besides having the most effective barbed wire by locking the barbs into place with a double strand of wire, Glidden also invented the machine that mass-produced his barbed wire.  Glidden’s patent was challenged in 1892, and in 1895 he won his case and can be considered the Father of Barbed Wire."],"display_date":"November 24, 1874","search_date":"1874-11-24","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":118,"tag":"invention"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2468,"tag":"American West"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6296,"title":"Pinkerton Creates First Photographic Wanted Poster","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-01-01","end_date":"1874-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“Abduction of Charlie Brewster Ross,” announced a wanted poster created in 1874, and handed out to people in the Philadelphia area. Two young boys had been kidnapped from their wealthy family. The older of the two boys was later found on the street, where the kidnappers had abandoned him. Unfortunately, though, the criminals kept Charlie, the younger brother, with them, and used him to force a ransom from his parents. The family hired Allan Pinkerton, founder of the Pinkerton Detective Agency, after the police ran out of leads. Pinkerton created this wanted poster in hopes that it would lead to Charlie’s eventual discovery. Pinkerton added a photograph of Charlie Ross to the poster, which made his work one of the earliest examples of photography used on public posters.","The horrific abduction of six-year old Charlie Brewster in 1874 portrays the emotional state of some individuals during Reconstruction. Some people had lost everything; money, family, homes. The volatile economy including a depression made it hard for some to get by every day. Perhaps that is why these individuals felt the need to kidnap the children of wealthy families; simply for the ransom money. However, if that were the case, one would think that the kidnappers would have returned Charlie after receiving the cash. Instead, Charlie was never returned to his family, and to this day no trace of the boy’s body has ever been found.","Although Reconstruction brought chaos and struggle to some, and had many Americans feeling depressed and helpless, it also consisted of the creation of many new ideas and inventions, like the photographs on printed posters. These fresh innovations showed how the United States was advancing in some ways, while it was seemingly struggling to get back on its feet. Along with the invention of photographed printed work were the inventions of the telephone in 1876 and the electric light bulb in 1879. Lastly, along with modifications in technology, the Charlie Brewster wanted poster portrayed changes in practices for police and private detectives. These posters, and other propaganda, aided the law enforcement, and made it much simpler for them to communicate information and receive assistance from civilians who may be able to help. Because of this, children after Charlie had a much greater chance of being rescued than those before him.","Overall, the wanted poster titled “Abduction of Charlie Brewster Ross” emphasized the utter helplessness that many individuals felt during the time of Reconstruction, and the lengths that some of these people were willing to go to for money. Pinkerton’s new idea of using photography in police work transformed law enforcement practices. Wanted posters soon led to the idea of mug shots that further served police forces. Therefore, the photographed printed work portrayed, at the same time as a depression, how there was also a sense of hope and advancement in America through new ideas and inventions."],"display_date":1874,"search_date":"1874-07-02","locations":[{"id":11231,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":2570,"tag":"abduction"},{"id":118,"tag":"invention"},{"id":1161,"tag":"Photography"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6357,"title":"History of Radio","course_id":140,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/53","end_date":"12/31/53","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1953, <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em> magazine ran an advertisement for clock radios. Zenith Radio Corporation, one of the leading producers of clock radios was responsible for the ad. The ad highlighted differences in clock radios. Regular radios only broadcasted music and shows. Clock radios, like the ones featured in this advertisement offered consumers a bonus feature. They could also tell time. Radio clocks received wireless time codes and could synchronize to within a fraction of a second of the correct time. This proved to be a big hit for consumers that needed a clock but also enjoyed listening to radio shows or music before they went to bed. With clock radios they could even be awakened by a buzzing sound or by music.","The advertisement noted that Zenith radios differed from other clock radios in two distinct ways. The Zenith clock radio featured the Alnico 5 speaker. This speaker offered tone quality that the advertisement claimed was unheard of for such a small machine. The other key difference was the antenna. Zenith clock radios used wave magnetic antennas. It could pull weak signals from the air for long distance reception, which made it easier to separate radio stations that were close together. The ad offered three different Zenith models to consumers. The Zenith AC-DC table model was a smaller cheaper option for those who did not have, or were not looking to spend, a lot of money. It featured both the wave magnetic antenna and the Alnico 5 speaker. The second option, the Zenith – Phonograph cost a little more money and featured all the same capabilities as the AC-DC model but also included a phonograph. Lastly, the third model offered in this ad was the Zenith AM-FM table model. It had all the same features and capabilities of the other two, however with this model consumers could access AM and FM stations[B2] . Each of these models came in a few different colors that consumers had the option of choosing from. Whichever radio consumers needed, Zenith offered it.","The Zenith Radio Corporation was a leader in capitalizing on the abilities of radio, but if it were not for inventors and visionaries the firm would not have enjoyed such success.  Originally, radio was conceived as a means to transmit telegraph messages wirelessly. In 1864, James Clerk Maxwell published a paper stating that electromagnetic currents could be perceived at a distance and that they traveled at the speed of light. In the 1880’s Heinrich Hertz tested Maxwell’s theories and found that they were correct. He successfully produced electromagnetic waves. In 1899, Guglielmo Marconi became the first individual to successfully demonstrate the controlled transmission and reception of long range radio signals. He shocked the world by telegraphing the results of the America’s Cup Yacht races from a ship that was out at sea to a station in New York.  The press was quite excited by the idea of wireless telegraphy. It provided a means for communication without the limitations imposed by wires, and it helped to loosen the monopoly enjoyed by telegraph and telephone companies.","In the beginning wireless broadcasting was limited to coded dots and dashes, the same Morse code transmitted by telegraphs. Then on December 24, 1906, Reginald Fessenden sent the first long-distance transmission of human voice and music from his station in Massachusetts to stations as far away as Virginia. This test helped to set the stage for voice and music broadcasting. Radio broadcasting continued to be improved through a variety of relevant inventions. In 1907, Lee De Forest introduced the patented Audion signal detector. This detector could amplify radio frequency signals dramatically. Another invention was the development of FM broadcasting by Edwin Armstrong. FM provided a clearer broadcast signal than AM did. New and constant inventions fueled the demand for radio. The period from the 1920’s to the 1950’s was considered to be the golden age of radio. In the beginning of the 1930’s about 12 million homes owned a radio, and by the end of 1939 radios were in over 28 million homes. Comedy shows, game shows, and popular music shows as well as other shows brought in millions across the United States.","Radios became the central piece of furniture in most households with parents and children crowding around listening to music, comedy and talk shows. It was so appealing to consumers during this time because it served to unite communities of people if through no other way than, virtually. It provided a basis of entertainment to families that owned this piece of technology.  Radio is a powerful piece of technology that continues to impact American society. Through numerous inventions throughout the years have helped to improve the quality of radio, it has been able to maintain its position in American life. Zenith’s ad in <em>Better Homes and Gardens</em> in 1953 displaying the three different versions of radios that the company manufactured could not have been possible without the development of wireless telegraphy and the countless other inventions of numerous American inventors."," "," "," "," "," ","References","<em>The Big Difference in clock radios is the Radio Itself!</em> (n.d.).
