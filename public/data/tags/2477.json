Since the majority of the breweries in the United States were owned by German immigrants and still retained German names, they became a convenient target of both prohibitionist and anti-German crusaders.","The cartoon “Hun Rule Association” was created by the Anti-Saloon League in the period of 1914-1920, when the United States was at war in Europe during World War 1 (Anti-German Prohibition).  It depicts a parade of beer kegs and bottles, many with stereotypical German faces on them, marching and waving placards.  The placards state the supposed ills that the Anti-Saloon League blamed on alcohol consumption.  The use of German imagery and the term “hun,” an anti-German slur, was meant to associate our enemies oversees with the liquor and beer industries, making Prohibition appear patriotic in a sense.  The Anti-Saloon League went as far as to refer to the Milwaukee brewing industry as “the worst of all our German enemies” (Digital History). These enemies that the league spoke out against were, in fact, some of the most successful and industrious immigrants that had come to America, spreading a culture that is still ingrained in the collective American society.  Germans built a flourishing brewing industry and distribution network, dominating saloon business.  They also introduced the concept of beer gardens to America, providing a family-friendly drinking environment that included food, games, and live music in a well-lit, inviting setting (Immigration).","The organization responsible for this and many other anti-German, prohibitionist cartoons was the Anti-Saloon League.  The organization was founded in 1895 by members of the Republican Party as a national, bipartisan organization tasked with the advancement of alcohol prohibition through public support.  It exerted influence on religious leaders and local politicians to allow it to spread its message to the largest number of citizens possible.  The readers of these cartoons created by the League were ordinary patriotic, god-fearing people that were easily swayed by clever rhetoric.  These common folk would then demand that their church leaders and local politicians do their part for the prohibition cause, further strengthening the movement.","The results of cartoons like “Hun Rule Association” were rapid and violent.  German culture was swept under the rug as German music, including that of Beethoven, was no longer played, books were burned, and businesses were boycotted (German Immigration).  German citizens were attacked, beaten, and on occasion lynched as examples to others.  A once proud and substantial portion of the population was forced to hide a proud heritage, one that had already become a major part of American culture.  Financially, the German beer brewing industry faced massive losses when National Prohibition went into effect.  The value of breweries during the period of prohibition dropped as much as two-thirds (Immigration).  The only way that breweries remained in business until alcohol was made legal again was to diversify production, manufacturing barley malt syrup, ‘near beer’, malted milk, and other pantry staples.","“Hun Rule Association” and similar propaganda remain today as examples of misguided crusades against convenient enemies.  The German immigrants that helped to build business and industry in the United States were victimized, but they still retain their place in American society.  Alcohol’s prohibition did little to lessen its supposed effects, namely wife beating, child abuse, corruption, and Machine politics (Digital History).  The Anti-Saloon League is long gone, but beer is a booming business, and German culture is experiencing a resurgence in the United States."],"display_date":"1917 - 1933","search_date":"1925-07-02","locations":[{"id":17541,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"},{"id":16292,"lat":43.0070321924,"lng":-87.9667286742,"zoom":10,"place":"Milwaukee, Wisconsin"},{"id":18861,"lat":38.6407017012,"lng":-90.4430188422,"zoom":9,"place":"St Louis, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2478,"tag":"german americans"},{"id":2477,"tag":"world war one"},{"id":2275,"tag":"Anti-Saloon League"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":133,"school_id":43}},{"id":6886,"title":"A Women's War","course_id":190,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/17","end_date":"11/30/17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Residents of Carmel, New York, woke up on Friday, November 30, 1917, to a letter to the editor on the <em>Putnam County Courier’s</em> front page from an advocate for woman’s suffrage, Mrs. C.A Hopkins. In her comment, Hopkins explained that men should be recognized for their valor during The Great War, but also argued that women should be appreciated as well. Hopkins wrote, “I feel sure that the women who have so faithfully and efficiently labored for the Red Cross, for the Liberty Loan, and for the YMCA fund, may also be depended upon to further the recognition of a subject already long delayed.” This subject was women’s right to vote. New York state was at the epicenter of the women’s suffrage movement throughout 1916 and 1917. Suffragettes hoped to win the support of “the most economically and politically influential state in the nation.”","World War One created many difficulties for the suffrage movement. Suffragettes were split between those who supported that war and those who did not. On April 3, 1917, President Wilson announced his war aims to Congress. He declared that the United States must enter the war because “the world must be made safe for democracy.” This claim from Wilson stirred controversy amongst suffragettes, who believed America first had to first fix its democracy at home by allowing women to vote. In his book, <em>Winning the Vote</em>, the historian Robert Cooney, Jr. details how the suffragist Doris Stevens argued, “We must not let our voices be drowned by war, trumpets or canons.” Steven and others who did not support the war worried that the war would bring the suffrage movement to a halt. Many women abandoned their suffrage for war work, such as laboring in munition factories, selling war bonds, raising money for war relief, and providing aid at the front for fallen soldiers with the Red Cross.","Activists such as Mrs. C.A Hopkins supported the war and argued for women’s rights. Suffragettes took part in patriotic rallies all over New York State. In the book <em>Women Will Vote, </em>Goodier and Pastorello explain, “By the summer of 1916, most cities held preparedness and patriotic rallies. The fifty thousand marchers who participated in the parade included suffragists; suffragists participated in similar events in Albany, Rochester, New York, and elsewhere.” New York suffrage leaders wanted to bring back attention to their primary goal: reviving their suffrage campaign by emphasizing women’s contributions to the war. Suffragettes spoke at every possible venue, including training camps for soldiers. They printed and distributed leaflets, posters, and newspaper articles asserting that more than a million New York Women demanded that voters pass the suffrage referendum on November 6, 1917.","Acts of leadership like Mrs. C.A. Hopkins and acts of courage like the women who participated in the war helped women in New York gain suffrage on November 6, 1917. It was the stepping stone that would eventually lead women to gain suffrage across the nation. This movement did not only require women from big cities to be heard but local ones as well, such as New York’s local town of Carmel in Putnam County."],"display_date":"June 1, 1917 - November 30, 1917","search_date":"1917-08-31","locations":[{"id":53211,"lat":41.197785310004,"lng":-75.38473046875,"zoom":6,"place":"Putnam County, New York"},{"id":53212,"lat":41.197785310004,"lng":-75.38473046875,"zoom":6,"place":"New York State"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":2692,"tag":"The Great War"},{"id":2477,"tag":"world war one"},{"id":2647,"tag":"Women's Suffrage"},{"id":3698,"tag":"Suffragette"},{"id":617,"tag":"Feminism"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"SUNY New Paltz","course_id":190,"school_id":102}}]}
