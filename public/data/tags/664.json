Waters Schwab, the president of J.R. Wood & Sons, Inc., the increase was due to the Korean crisis.  It was mere weeks before this escalation of ring sales that the Korean War began.  Mr. Schwab noted that this increase in sales was following the same pattern that occurred at the beginning of the Second World War.   One of the executives of Lambert Brothers, Inc., Henry Lambert, explained that jewellery stores were filled with young couples purchasing rings.  This occurrence seemed to grow in just under a fortnight, and had not been seen since the end of World War II.","<br />Throughout the twentieth century this trend of increased weddings, and ring sales before, and during a major conflict was noted in both America and Europe.  During the months prior to World War I and World War II, young couples were joined in matrimony much more frequently than in times of peace.  In addition to the increase in marriages, there was a change in the average age that men and women were wed.  Throughout the first half of the twentieth century the average matrimonial age for men dropped from twenty-six to twenty-three, and for women dropped from twenty-two to twenty.","<br />Some argue that, the major influence on this sudden explosion of romance in the United States was the Selective Service Act of 1948 which reintroduced conscription.  The original act was passed in 1917 and revised in 1940.  Volunteer enlistment in the years following World War II was not enough to satisfy the needs of in this new Korean conflict.  The new act required all males over the age of eighteen to register for the draft and made all males between the ages of nineteen and twenty-six eligible to be drafted, thus increasing the number of conscripts by 100,000.  When the Selective Service Act was imposed in 1917 there appeared to have been a corresponding rise in the sale of wedding and engagement rings.  This trend was again seen at the outbreak of the Korean War.  The Selective Service Act was further revised in 1951 (Universal Military Training and Service Act) introducing a college or training exemption and reducing the draft age from nineteen to eighteen and a half.   While the war cast a dark shadow over these rushed marital vows, the uncertainty of the times and the notion that these men and women did not want to take the chance of deferring their weddings until after the war may shed some light on this upward trend in weddings and jewellery sales."],"display_date":"July 15, 1950 - July 27, 1953","search_date":"1952-01-19","locations":[{"id":28501,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":665,"tag":"Conscription"},{"id":664,"tag":"Korean War"},{"id":405,"tag":"Marriage"}],"course":{"name":"American History since the Civil War","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":42,"school_id":28}},{"id":6778,"title":"MASH Doctor Performs Emergency Medicine From the Book","course_id":178,"status":"P","start_date":"6/25/50","end_date":"7/27/53","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dr. Hermes Grillo had just arrived on his first assignment to a MASH unit during his tour in Korea.  He served in a medical unit with the 1st Marine Division and the Fleet Marine Force. Once the doctor had to operate by the book, which means directly from a book.  He recalled, “I had taken one medical book to Korea with me…I remember opening it to whatever page it was, which showed the hilum of the lung, and I propped it up on an ammunition case.” Dr. Grillo described the circumstances further, “…of course, the first thing I encountered was a massive outpouring of blood from the hilum of the lung.” He then proceeded to simultaneously read from the book and perform the operation. The Interviewer then asked “So you, in essence, were operating by the book.” “By the book,” Responded Dr. Grillo.","During the Korean Conflict (1950-1953) the United States fought alongside South Korean and United Nations troops seeking to oust communist North Korean and Chinese forces.  As an innovation based on lessons from World War II, the U.S. instituted MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hosptial) units that moved medical personnel as close to the front lines as possible, and also brought women closer to the front lines than ever before.  The goal was to help improve the survival rate of casualties.  If a soldier got to the surgeon quickly enough he had a quite good chance of survival. According to medical surgeon Dr. Grillo “… very few of them died… the worst wounds never make it; they’re dead. And then a lot of others die in transport.”  Still, to be able to save almost all your patients is an impressive feat. During 1951, MASH 8076 treated 21,143 patients and of those patients only 188 succumbed to injuries or illness. This means that only 0.889% of their patients died in 1951.","MASH units played the role of unsung hero of the war at least until the feature film and highly successful television show made Americans much more aware of their history. In World War II there were no MASH units and each soldier had a 1 in 56 chance that he was going to die. When you look towards the Korean War the soldier had a 1 in 171 chance of dying. That is a dramatic difference and a huge number of young men who did not need to die."," ","The doctors of the Korean War did everything they could to keep the soldiers that came into their care alive. Thanks to them and the system that was set up they were able to keep more people alive than in any previous war. Even the doctors themselves that when they out of all the soldiers they cared for very few of them died."],"display_date":"June 25, 1950 - July 27, 1953","search_date":"1952-01-09","locations":[{"id":53119,"lat":40.339852,"lng":127.510093,"zoom":5,"place":"North Korea"},{"id":53120,"lat":35.907757,"lng":127.766922,"zoom":5,"place":"South Korea"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":664,"tag":"Korean War"},{"id":3511,"tag":"MASH"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":178,"school_id":3}},{"id":6819,"title":"The Korean War - A Trigger of a New Great War","course_id":189,"status":"P","start_date":"6/26/50","end_date":"6/27/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After the WWII had ended, many thought that a period of prosperity would finally arrive. However, the struggle for power and influence in Asia between the Soviet Union and the Western World led to another conflict. On June 26 1950, The North Korean Communist Party (DPRK) launched a surprise attack and crossed the 38th parallel, which had previously acted as a border between North and South Korea. Until the morning of 27 June 1950, the situation strongly favored the North Korean side. The North Korean army was well prepared and swiftly penetrated the South Korean defense line. Due to the immense shock and the difference in equipment, the South Korean troops were unable to resist the invaders. They slowly retreated and attempted to regroup.  The North Korean invasion was criticized by the United Nations Security Council for breaking the peace and North Korea was ordered to retreat immediately or else the United Nations would take military action to maintain peace. This proposal was supported by nine other countries. The Soviet Union representative, a North Korean ally who had the veto power, was absent during the discussion. As a result, this proposal was passed.The United States, as the most powerful supporter of this proposal, assembled the land army stationed in Japan and they were ready to intervene, and their air forces based in Japan and Guam were also on standby and ready to reinforce. (<em>The Globe and Mail, </em>1)","<strong><br /></strong>","Before World War II, The Korean Peninsula was annexed by Japan, and later liberated by Soviet Union in 1945. Due to the concern of balancing the power structure in East Asia, the Korean Peninsula was divided and ruled by the pro Soviet Communist Party in the North (DPRK) and the pro American Republic government in the South. The border between two factions was the 38th parallel line, which is almost at the center of the Korean Peninsula. In 1949, the Chinese Communist Party successfully defeated the Pro-America Chinese Nationalist Party and established the People’s Republic of China. “The victory of the Chinese communist strongly encourged Kim to believe that he could make the same thing happen in Korea” With these optimistic beliefs, a conference was held between Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, the CCP leader Mao Zedong and the DPRK leader Kim II Sung in 1949 to discuss the possibility of unifying Korea and to establish another communist country in East Asia. Mao and Kim had underestimated the South Korean military strength. They suggested that if the war would end swiftly, the United State’s military intervention could be avoided. They also believed, the Korean War was “An internal matter of the Korean people”, and other countries had no legitimate right to step in. With such expectations, Stalin approved the plan of invasion . In other words, the communist powers were initially not ready for a direct conflict with the United States and expected a swift victory against the South Korean army."," "," "],"display_date":"June 26, 1950 - June 27, 1950","search_date":"1950-06-26","locations":[{"id":53151,"lat":37.4583787,"lng":126.7475953,"zoom":6,"place":"Seoul"},{"id":52971,"lat":37.9386451,"lng":127.2198661,"zoom":6,"place":"korea"}],"tags":[{"id":3597,"tag":"1950"},{"id":664,"tag":"Korean War"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":189,"school_id":28}}]}
