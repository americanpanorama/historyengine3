Alan Riding wrote “Reagan Impact Felt in Central America” as a broad overview of the actions and reactions that happened in the region due to anticipated changes in United States policy. This reporter had credibility on the subject of U.S.-Central American relations because it was his journalistic specialty from 1970-1989.","Alan Riding reported in the article that the Guatemalans greatly anticipated Reagan coming to power “The conservative Government and private sector in Guatemala, which had been strongly critical of President Carter’s human rights campaign, were delighted by his defeat and seemed hopeful of resumed American military assistance to help combat leftist guerrillas.”","The historical context leading up to this involved official policy from the previous administration.","In 1977 President Jimmy Carter ordered a human rights report on the actions of the Guatemalan military. What the study found was later confirmed by the United Nations Commission for Historical Clarification. The Guatemalan military was responsible for 93% of the human rights violations committed during the war, the guerrillas for 3%. The Guatemalan government reacted to these negative findings by refusing United States military aid.","Reagan immediately voiced his support for funding Guatemala once again in his first presidential news conference. He stated: “You can [not] turn away from some country because here and there they do not totally agree with our concept of human rights.”  Public opinion at the time about United States involvement in Central American Civil Wars is hard to gauge. While some, like former Peace Corp volunteer John Elder actively participated in the process of bringing Guatemalan refugees to the United States, most Americans remained inactive. The United States Military’s involvement was mostly logistical, so the violence did not have a direct effect on American citizens. Our aid to Guatemala did not cause the same public out rage that Vietnam did because few Americans died. The reinstatement of funding was a political success from Reagan’s point of view and by 1983, most of the Guatemalan countryside was subdued. This episode correctly previewed the situation in Central America and the changes that Ronald Reagan's administration would bring to US policy for that region."," "],"display_date":"November 16, 1980","search_date":"1980-11-16","locations":[{"id":40259,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":39105,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":293,"tag":"Ronald Reagan"},{"id":294,"tag":"Containment"},{"id":295,"tag":"International Relations"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":26,"school_id":3}},{"id":6776,"title":"Americans Shocked by Television Movie The Day After.","course_id":178,"status":"P","start_date":"11/20/83","end_date":"11/20/83","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Day After,</em> a made-for-television movie directed by Nicholas Meyer and written by Edward Hume, aired November 20, 1983, on the ABC Television Network. The film dramatized the aftermath of a nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. The movie took place in Kansas City, Missouri and included cities such as Lawrence, Kansas. <em>The Day After</em> explored the effects of nuclear war from the perspective of ordinary Americans. The story focuses on several sets of characters: most notably Russell Oakes (played by Jason Robards), a doctor and professor at the University of Kansas, the Dahlbergs, a farming family from Harrisonville, Missouri and Billy McCoy (played by William Allen Young), an Air Force reservist stationed at Whiteman Air Base. The film became infamous at the time for scenes of violence and the graphic portrayal of characters perishing from radiation sickness. The movie ends with the ominous warning that “the catastrophic events you have just witnessed, are in all likelihood less severe than the destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear strike against the United States…” <em>The Day After</em> attracted 100 million viewers, and remains the highest rated television movie in U.S. history.","The controversy surrounding the movie’s release caused an uproar among the American population. Americans criticized U.S. nuclear policy because of what they had seen in the film. ABC and the White House received hundreds of calls from anxious viewers, many of whom supported the movie’s message. Anti-nuclear activists rallied behind movements such as “Let Lawrence Live” and 800-NUCLEAR. Those in favor of nuclear deterrence, however, worried that the emotional fall-out of the movie and controversy surrounding it would negate any critical analysis of nuclear weapons. Director Nicholas Meyer stood firmly on the side of the anti-nuclear activists, denouncing ABC’s attempts to tone down the movie’s political nature. According to historian Deron Overpeck, Meyer wanted to “clobber sixty-million people over the head” with his criticisms of nuclear weapons.","The role <em>The Day After</em> played in changing U.S. nuclear policy is debatable. When the movie premiered in 1983, U.S. relations with the Soviet Union were at their worst levels in twenty years. President Ronald Reagan viewed it days before its premier on ABC. While the movie left Reagan shaken and disheartened, he continued to defend nuclear deterrence as a means to pressure the Soviet Union to the negotiating table. Despite this, <em>The Day After</em> spurred public conversation about nuclear war to reach levels unseen since the Cuban Missile Crisis twenty-one years earlier. The movie’s greatest impact was not changing the minds of policy makers, but its effect on how ordinary Americans debated nuclear policy."],"display_date":"November 20, 1983","search_date":"1983-11-20","locations":[{"id":8915,"lat":40.7804872,"lng":-73.9679741,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":1041,"tag":"Film"},{"id":293,"tag":"Ronald Reagan"},{"id":2197,"tag":"Television"},{"id":3507,"tag":"ABC"},{"id":3508,"tag":"Anti-Nuclear Activism"},{"id":3509,"tag":"Movie"},{"id":3510,"tag":"Nuclear War"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":178,"school_id":3}},{"id":6808,"title":"The Spider Man of Ronald Reagan: Defeating Threats to Masculinity","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/81","end_date":"8/31/81","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As tensions arise in the sphere of gender rights in America, Spider-Man swings in to save the day, or at least save the men of the world from the threat of feminism. In August 1981, Fantagraphics Books released their third issue of <em>Amazing Heroes</em> which includes an interview with the new editor for Marvel’s <em>Spider-Man</em> titles, Tom DeFalco, on his plan to “revitalize” Spider-Man by “returning to the ‘grandeur and the power and the menace” of the hero’s original days. As Spidey’s revamping to “use his powers to the fullest potential,” the push to extend the date for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ratifications was struggling under the presidency of Ronald Reagan (Amazing Heroes 54). The Equal Rights Amendment, passing on March 22, 1972, had a seven-year deadline on ratification processes, meaning it could not be ratified after 1979. Congress approved an extension until June 30, 1982, but after the swearing in of Ronald Reagan, the ERA lost its support from the republican party (Francis). On the major political loss, Anne Costain says, “what makes gender differences distinctive in the 1980s is that they are now tied to a consistent preference in the part of women for the democratic party and its candidates” (Costain 115). A citizen’s right to not be denied or abridged based on their sex was undermined by more than half of the political system: the feminist movement was battling against Reagan’s presidency.","            Hegemonic masculinity took over the US and feminists were fighting for equal rights on the basis of sex. In the midst of this political tension, Tom DeFalco presses for a character of justice, masculinity, womanizing, and heroism of full amelioration, found in none other than the friendly neighborhood hero, Spider-Man. The political realm of equal rights was battling a threat and the face of masculinity that was in charge was being opposed by a mass movement. Spider-Man’s supposedly old-and-improved characterization is an agent of protection against the threat of femininity and, more specifically, feminism and gender inclusivity. In fact, based on a study about the embodiment of superheroes done by Dr. Edward Avery-Natalie, “evolution toward hyperbolic forms has been increasing since the Golden Age of comic books” (Avery-Natalie 81). Furthermore, male characters can be, as it is typically found in this study, fetishized to embody the fullness of male power that is depicted through masculinity of said character (Avery-Natalie 80). The article in <em>Amazing Heroes</em> includes sketches for the upcoming Spider-Man, captioned by DeFalco that he’s bringing back lots of “hoo-hah and shenanigans to spider-man” (<em>Amazing Heroes</em> 58). “Hoo-hah and shenanigans to spider-man,” is repeated throughout the story. The sketches detail the muscular, intense, action-packed, violence-packed fight scenes that Spider-Man takes action in. Penciled by Bob Hall, these scenes are exactly the fun and invigorating graphics that depict ideal masculinity: “children live in a historical period, undergoing political, economic, social, cultural and technological changes; those changes are so complex that boys and girls are confronted with many different experiences, which lead them to criticize certain hegemonic values” (Silva 526). In addition to Sylvia’s claim, the call to criticize hegemonic values is accompanied by the exposure to hegemonic values. Comic readers can see masculinity and other historical contexts via this article, especially the want for hyper-masculinity in the time that it’s patriarchal power is being threatened by the strive for greater equal rights.","            Under the new Reagan presidency, the Equal Rights Amendment struggled to get momentum for ratification and the push for more hegemonic, hyper-masculinity was on the forefront for America and in comics. Tom DeFalco’s re-vamping of Spider-Man shows how masculinity plays a large role in the construction of comics and the urge for patriarchal power to take control in America."],"display_date":"August 1, 1981 - August 31, 1981","search_date":"1981-08-16","locations":[{"id":52950,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":2598,"tag":"Comic"},{"id":293,"tag":"Ronald Reagan"},{"id":1771,"tag":"masculinity"},{"id":617,"tag":"Feminism"},{"id":3576,"tag":"ERA"},{"id":3577,"tag":"Spider-Man"},{"id":3578,"tag":"Amazing Heroes"}],"course":{"name":"ENG 492H Honors Seminar in English","school":"Rollins College","course_id":185,"school_id":5}}]}
