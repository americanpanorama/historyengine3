She went on to parallel slavery to having their own sisters and daughters exposed in public.

Many Anti-Nebraskans, such as Indiana Representative Schuyler Colfax, remained dedicated to the anti-slavery cause.","            Colfax was a charming individual whose charisma and oratory skills gave him a great advantage in the House of Representatives.

He worked to help slaves and promote abolitionism in his lifetime, including spending his own money for the cause.  In a letter to a friend, Smith described how he had posted bail on different occasions for a man named Chaplin, who was being punished for enticing slaves away from their southern masters.  Gerrit Smith felt that the money he spent on bailing Chaplin out of jail, though costly, was necessary because it was for a good and just purpose.  He wrote, \"I am robbed of these 12,000.  I have been robbed of a great deal from time to time, in the sums which I have felt myself morally compelled to pay in the purchase of the liberty of slaves.\"","As described by historian M. Leon Perkal, Gerrit Smith, along with other radicals of the Liberty Party, advocated an idea that interpreted the Constitution as providing abolition of slavery in all states, and guaranteeing the equality of African-Americans.  As a whole, the Liberty Party did not completely accept this novel interpretation; however it did represent the stances of some of its members on slavery.","Having the leader of a political party bail someone out of jail for trying to illegally free slaves demonstrates the contrasting range of political views in the 1840s and 1850s.  The radical abolitionists in the Liberty Party wanted to free all slaves, and believed they were constitutionally empowered to do it.  At the same time, law enforcement had every right, according to the Fugitive Slave Act, to put someone in jail for aiding in the escape of slaves.

Many gathered -- presidents, vice presidents, and secretaries -- in order to set straight their position in regard to the Free Soil Party and the church. They were also going to let the people of Pennsylvania know their stand on the United States Constitution. As soon as the convention started, Edward M. Davis, president, invited all people attending the convention, whether they were friendly or unfriendly, to the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society to participate in the discussions at the Convention. Many of the people who attended the convention felt that Congress should secure the freedom of every slave who set foot on any national territory or national vessel. Congress received different petitions through letters; some members of Congress read different newspaper articles and brought them up at meetings. The petitions came to be very successful, only because they agitated the nation.  "," Six problems were addressed and resolved during the convention. The first two basically reviewed the rise and accomplishments of the anti-slavery cause. The next two established a committee chairperson to be in charge of running the petitions. Finally, members resolved that the anti-slavery convention would express their hearty approval and would further recommend throughout the state and country that the appropriate petitions to Congress were needed."," The Convention reaffirmed its use of antislavery petitions as a tool in achieving emancipation. Mr. H.C. Wright, a convention official, said, \"in our efforts to abolish slavery we must be prepared to cut through whatever should stand in our way. Now is the favorable time to press these petitions and others.\" With this being said, after the convention adjourned, abolitionists near and wide petitioned everywhere they could. Slavery was to be the great question of discussion during the coming sessions of Congress."," Two key issues that Congress debated from 1848 to 1850 were the Compromise of 1850 and the Fugitive Slave Act. Moreover, the anti-slavery petitions started to become more important.  Slavery played a major role in these debates. The Fugitive Slave Act was the most controversial; it required citizens to assist in the recovery of fugitive slaves. The passage of this act made abolitionists all the more resolved to put an end to this slavery.

Seeking a position in the Maryland General Assembly, Raymond was highly publicized in the anti-slavery circles in Maryland. One such publication, the <em>Genius of Universal Emancipation and Baltimore Courier</em> touted Raymond’s disdain for slavery and his support of gradual emancipation. Nominated by the Anti-Slavery Society of Maryland, Raymond represented the best hopes of abolitionist Marylanders under the system of slavery. While Raymond lost the election and the following one in 1826, his candidacy raises many questions as to the nature of the anti-slavery movement in Maryland. Who exactly was Daniel Raymond and why did he support abolition?","<br /> Daniel Raymond was originally from Monteville, Connecticut and he moved to Baltimore in 1814. A veteran of the battle for Fort McHenry, Raymond gained notoriety for his various publications while in Baltimore. Of these works, his 1819 pamphlet on the Missouri Compromise contributed the most to his rise in the anti-slavery movement in Maryland. Raymond’s profile as an anti-slavery advocate was not unique for the 1820s, his belief in gradualism and manumission were the leading theories at the time and his membership in the American Colonization Society was very common for the period. Following the publication of his pamphlet, Raymond became increasingly involved in the anti-slavery movement. In September of 1824, Raymond was elected secretary of the Baltimore Emigration Society, a local colonization group headed by the Mayor of Baltimore. As he gained more prominence from this position, he used his connections to help found the Anti-Slavery Society of Maryland in 1825. During a meeting in August of that year, Raymond was elected President of the Society. Now possessing a considerable amount of influence within the anti-slavery community, Raymond was able to make a run at political office. Using his new platform to express his ideas, Raymond’s campaign literature was filled with his anti-slavery theories.","<br />Raymond contributed to anti-slavery thought in a predominantly economic and demographic way. His pamphlet on the Missouri Compromise was filled with economic arguments concerning the problems of spreading slavery. Raymond’s main argument against slavery was that slaves, while adding to the overall production within the economy, were also a detriment because of their lack of motivation. As Raymond saw it, free whites were better contributors to society because of their innate desire for self-advancement whereas slaves had no ability to advance themselves while in bondage. Even when freed, Raymond noticed their lack of motivation continue. He wrote that “in regard to manumitted slaves...nine out of ten…industrious and moral before, become vagabonds, and one half of them perhaps, get into the penitentiary.” However, Raymond later wrote in favor of total manumissions for all slaves because by making the entire black population free, there would be less of a distinction between blacks and whites. Raymond used his second campaign in 1826 to express many of these ideas. In a public address to the citizens of Baltimore, Raymond presented an argument of his critics, that “the free negroes are a nuisance in the community, and therefore their numbers ought not to be increased.” In response, Raymond said “that if all the negroes in the state were free, they would not be so great a nuisance as the present number of free negroes are.”","<br /> Without his rise through the anti-slavery community and his high profile as a political candidate, Raymond may not have had the opportunity to present his theories on slavery. Raymond’s quick accession through the ranks of the anti-slavery community suggests that the movement was small and isolated in Maryland. The nature of the anti-slavery community in Maryland presents many avenues for further study and Daniel Raymond could be a potential starting point for a deeper examination into the subject. The unique geographic and ideological position of Maryland beseeches historians for a closer look."],"display_date":"September 24, 1825","search_date":"1825-09-24","locations":[{"id":5928,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"},{"id":280,"tag":"Maryland"}],"course":{"name":"The Abolitionists and American Society","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":23,"school_id":11}},{"id":4712,"title":"<strong>John Brown Gives his Last Speech to the Court</strong>","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-11-02","end_date":"1859-11-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John Brown, noted abolitionist, was arrested after his raid on Harper’s Ferry in early October 1859.

Brown denied having committed any crime aside from wanting to free the slaves. He stated that he never intended to murder, to commit treason, or to incite slaves into a rebellion. However, having had committed murder, Brown did not appear remorseful of that fact. His only goal was to free the slaves as God wanted him to do. He seemed resigned saying, “if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children and with the blood of millions in this slave country whose rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments--I submit; so let it be done!” Brown spoke a couple more words to the court and then resumed his position on the cot.","A month after his closing words, on December 2, Brown was  hanged outside of Charles Town.

Sturge’s observations reflect that the passengers on the voyage to America could see the waiter as a man, much as themselves, and could not deny the accuracy of his response.  In decades earlier, few black men standing alone would have dared speak out without fear of immediate and unanimous reprisal, yet this was 1841, and here was a glimpse of the gradual but necessary progressions of the public outlook about slavery as an unacceptable institution.","Abolition-movement members such as the American brothers Arthur and Lewis Tappan were working diligently towards their cause, an attempt to “ma[ke] the whole nation look the captives in the face”, as yet another overseas onlooker noted.   People were becoming uncomfortable with slavery and racism as it seemed uncivilized and sinful amongst developed men.  Author St. George Tucker noted how even in pursuit of  independence and the hope for a better life which the Americans had sought for themselves, somehow they had turned from the oppressed into the oppressors, and in many cases, much more viciously.","The traveling writers from overseas were being joined by many American intellectuals, such as Emerson and Thoreau amongst others, all pointed in their goal of revealing a changing attitude about slavery in the United States.  Developments in communication allowed this perspective to circulate more widely than ever possible before.  Many people now not only understood the institution of slavery but were faced with its details every day.  The cultivation of thought encouraged by publications seemed to require a new evolution in behavior."],"display_date":"March 10, 1841","search_date":"1841-03-10","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 -

The writer will visit your paper soon, and pull your damned nose for you.”","On January 1, 1831, Garrison released the first issue of his abolitionist paper, <em>The Liberator</em>. A rising figure among the abolitionist community, Garrison stated that with his paper he was going to be, “As harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice.” From 1831 until 1865, Garrison released weekly issues of the anti-slavery paper, during which he gained a tremendous number of followers, despite beginning with limited circulation. However, once the paper entered into the South, Garrison began to receive various threats to his life.","According to author Nick Fauchald, in Columbia, South Carolina, there was a $1,500 reward posted by the Vigilance Committee for the capture of any persons who had possession of <em>The Liberator</em>, and there were other cities that passed laws forbidding the paper to even leave the post office. In Raleigh, North Carolina, it was threatened that Garrison would be thrown in jail if he ever entered into the city; and the Georgia House of Representatives passed a bill which offered a $5,000 reward for anyone who captured Garrison and brought him to court. Garrison, however, did not take these threats seriously claiming that they were “free publicity” and boasted, “My language will displease many. To displease them is my intent.”","By publishing these threatening letters in his own newspaper, Garrison showed that he was not afraid, but instead used them to demonstrate that he was unwavering. Despite these letters, and hundreds more like them, Garrison was not deterred from his cause. In reality, Garrison and his supporters became even more devoted to their anti-slavery cause, which contradicted the intended effect of the Southern writers."],"display_date":"January 1, 1831 - February 15, 1839","search_date":"1835-01-23","locations":[{"id":6207,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5377,"title":"Angelina Grimke and Her Secular Language of Rights","course_id":81,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-10-02","end_date":"1837-10-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1837, Angelina Grimke authored a series of letters to Catharine Beecher on the topic of the cultural roles of women as they relate to their social, economic, and political rights. One was reprinted in <em>Women's Rights Emerges within the Antislavery Movement, 1830-1870</em> by Kathryn Sklar. In the letter retitled by Sklar as, “<em>Human Rights Not Founded on Sex,</em>” Grimke argues that humans have rights because they are moral beings:","“the rights of all men, from the king to the slave, are built upon their moral nature: and as all men have this moral nature, so all men have essentially the same rights” (Grimke, Human Rights Not Founded on Sex).","In a very formal sense, Grimke used a secular argument to articulate a point about the what rights are and a necessity to respect them. Her persuasion proved to be effective and her methods involving secular justifications for equality of rights contrasted with other religious justifications for and against slavery and women's rights. Her points differed because they did not involve an appeal to her audience's religious sentiments, they involved an appeal to their reason. By appealing to reason, Grimke presented a new language of rights as they related to women and slaves, to the political climate of the mid 1800s.","The new kind of appeal that Grimke proposed was one that provided a stronger case for an immediate end to slavery, rather than gradually phasing it out. Gerda Lerner discusses the contrast between these two arguments in The Grimke Sisters and the Struggle Against Race Prejudice:","“If the Negro was entitled to equality on the grounds of his humanity, it followed that equality was his right, not a privilege to be granted at the slaveholder's pleasure” (Lerner, The Grimke Sisters and the Struggle Against Race Prejudice).","Lerner points out that if one granted Grimke the explicitly moral point she made in “<em>Human Rights Not Founded on Sex,</em>” then it followed that a gradual phasing out of slavery is morally wrong in a sense similar to why not ending it all was wrong. Grimke's point being presented on secular grounds was essential to her point having the amount of salience necessary to illustrate the way in which those calling for a gradual phasing out of slavery posited an internally incoherent message: they acknowledged slavery was morally wrong, but also suggested that it also be allowed to continue until a point that was convenient for a slaveholder. They were concerned with morality only insofar as slaveholders were not inconvenienced. The secular nature of Grimke's point had more salience because the Bible was used to argue both for ending slavery immediately, and to let it continue (Lerner, The Grimke Sisters and the Struggle Against Race Prejudice). Likewise, how one viewed the rights of women depended on how one interpreted the Bible. Grimke's secular language of rights were justificatorily minimal: they presented an account of rights of slaves and women that could accommodate the values of more than one point of view. The sense in which rights were to be respected on Grimke's account extended beyond what any religious account of morality could have provided. Religious justifications of rights only had normative force if the audience to which they were presented already believed the interpretation was correct. Grimke's language of rights contrasted with this because she reasoned through the status of the rights of slaves and women, meaning that her point was conceptual, rather than interpretive.","Grimke's justification for the equal rights of slaves and women was one that could have had normative force regardless of an individual's opinions. It was different because it appealed to reason rather than emotion. Consequently, her speeches and the arguments made in them reshaped the dialogue concerning the moral status of women in slaves in the mid-1800s."],"display_date":"October 2, 1837","search_date":"1837-10-02","locations":[{"id":6216,"lat":42.3509402419,"lng":-71.9042530938,"zoom":8,"place":"WORCESTER, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":1199,"tag":"Angelina Grimke"},{"id":1198,"tag":"Secularism"},{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":81,"school_id":2}},{"id":5564,"title":"<strong>The World Antislavery Convention: From Emancipation to Women's Rights</strong>","course_id":96,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-06-01","end_date":"1840-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["For ten days in June 1840, abolitionists from both sides of the Atlantic met together at the World Antislavery Convention in Freemason’s Hall in London, England.  The purpose of the convention was to better organize and unite international abolitionist forces in the fight for emancipation.  Ironically, while championing the freedom of black slaves, the convention reinforced a different type of subordination—that of a woman to a man.  The treatment of Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton at the convention led them to begin their own movement—for women’s rights.","The convention was a vastly popular event, with 350 delegates from countless countries and anti-slavery associations throughout the Western world.  In fact, so many people came out to the event that the doors were opened early, and “every available foot of the large hall, with the exception of the platform, was densely crowded.”  The female delegates believed they were to be seated, but upon their arrival they were turned away and forced to the gallery.  Lucretia Mott wrote in her diary “The Friends present were nearly all opposed to women's admission. We were told…that our coming had been announced in London Yearly Meeting, and that they were put on their guard against us”.  In fact, few men at the time were comfortable with female anti-slavery advocates publicly speaking out and serving as leaders in the fight for abolition.","There were exceptions, including William Lloyd Garrison.  Within the wing of the abolitionist movement that Garrison led, women had already been introduced into leadership roles. Yet by this time, the ranks of the Garrisonians were falling, and a rival organization had been formed in opposition to the Garrisonians.  The convention mainly consisted of delegates from this new organization, and they were determined to keep the women out.  Yet Garrison, who was present at the convention, and a few other male delegates protested the treatment of the females, and sat in the gallery alongside their female counterparts. Though the women attempted to  “reason with them on the subject” and urge them to remain in their seats, they found “[the men] were fixed” upon joining them.","What happened at the convention had a profound impact on Mott and Stanton.  Upon their arrival home in the United States, they pondered their treatment and decided they needed to begin a women’s rights movement to protest the societal roles of females. Stanton penned “my experience at the World's Antislavery Convention, all I had read of the legal status of women, and the oppression I saw everywhere, together swept across my soul, intensified now by many personal experiences”.","The product of the treatment of women at the World Antislavery Convention culminated into a Women’s Rights Convention in Seneca Falls New York in 1848. Conceived by five women, Stanton, Mott, Mary Coffin Wright, Maryanne McClintock, and Jane Hunt, this new convention was created to bring life to the women’s rights movement.  The five declared a need for equality between the sexes.  At the convention, Stanton read the Declaration of Sentiments she had written, which were explicitly based off of the Declaration of Independence.   This convention was essential in the organization of the Women’s Rights Movement, as it laid out plans and goals for the progress of women in society.  The Seneca Falls Convention spearheaded the progress of the movement, but the fight for women’s rights truly began on those fateful days in London, as the women were rejected as man’s equal in an ironic discussion of freedom and human rights."],"display_date":"June 1840","search_date":"1840-06-15","locations":[{"id":52574,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"},{"id":9090,"lat":42.7999140458,"lng":-76.8297839055,"zoom":9,"place":"SENECA, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1493,"tag":"London"},{"id":634,"tag":"Elizabeth Cady Stanton"},{"id":635,"tag":"Lucretia Mott"},{"id":633,"tag":"Seneca Falls Convention"},{"id":796,"tag":"Women's Rights Movement."},{"id":190,"tag":"William Lloyd Garrison"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"},{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Transatlantic Abolitionism","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":96,"school_id":11}},{"id":6217,"title":"History Engine Episode II","course_id":130,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-01-01","end_date":"1846-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Some affairs in the media are profound enough to make a mark on peoples perspectives. The trial and imprisonment of Jonathan Walker was one of these cases. This episode takes place in Pensacola, Florida during 1845. Walker had been sympathetic to slavery and took action toward its abolition, which eventually led him to be the first and only victim to suffer the severe punishment of being branded with the letters “SS” on his right-hand palm. The letters stood for “Slave Stealer,” because Walker was very active in trying to provide safe havens for slaves to flee to, and would gather slaves to transport them to countries where slaves could be free; such as Mexico, Canada, and the Bahamas. He was eventually caught and found guilty in court by the Territory of Florida for “coercively” transporting seven slaves to the Bahamas, in hopes of their freedom. This case proved to be very controversial, with abolitionists siding with Walker and preservationists of slavery opposing him.","In 1845, immediately after complying with the sanctions that were given to him; Jonathan Walker wrote his narrative, “The Branded Hand,” in which he explained his recounted experience throughout the incident, pointed out the discrepancies of the legal system regarding his punishment, and alluded to the abolition of the slave system. Walker wanted to set the story straight with this book; while at the same time, exposing the disparity between slavery and natural rights. This incident caused Walker to devote the rest of life toward the abolition of slavery. And so he began to actively join the rhetoric that was spread throughout America during this time period to finally end slavery.","His unfortunate experience of the branded mark he wore on his hand turned out to be a spark in the eventually fire of the abolitionist movement. Other abolitionists began writing about his case to use him as inspiration for the continuation of the fight to end slavery. William Lloyd Garrison also began publishing some of Walker’s writings in his publication, “The Liberator.” One of the most impactful works of all the rhetoric surrounding Walker’s case toward abolitionism was a poem written by John Greenleaf Whittier, also titled, “The Branded Hand.” This poem reached a much broader audience than just abolitionists. This poem that displayed the big picture of the case, and compelled many Americans to reevaluate their views toward slavery.","Jonathan Walker, himself was dedicated to ensuring the liberties that the United States of America was founded upon to all. His contributions to the abolitionist movement deserve partial credit toward the eventual abolition of slavery. While he may have had to endure cruel punishment and scrutiny for what he stood for; the same ultimately made a perpetual mark on American society’s views on the slavery system. With Walker’s fight, along with many other abolitionists during this time period he fought with. Leaders such as Frederick Douglas, William Lloyd Garrison, and John Greenleaf Whittier. America gave a second thought on the slave system, and put it to an end."],"display_date":"1844 - 1846","search_date":"1845-07-01","locations":[{"id":1332,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ESCAMBIA, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1962,"tag":"African-American history"},{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"},{"id":1599,"tag":"Abolitionist Movement"},{"id":2428,"tag":"Jonathan Walker"},{"id":2429,"tag":"Pensacola, Florida"}],"course":{"name":"African-American History to 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":130,"school_id":5}}]}
