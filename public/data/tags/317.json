The reason is that the battles in the east took place in close proximity to some of the larger national newspapers while the battles in the west were not and therefore did not get the same kind of publicity. The battle itself was a very important piece of the Civil War in the west. Shiloh, when looked at closely, can be considered the Gettysburg of the west.

Cyprus Hall and the 14th Illinois Infantry did not mean much. According to his report of the battle one would think differently. In his account of the battle he describes, move-by-move, the chronology of the actions his men took and what they witnessed. Many of Hall’s descriptions of battle fail to give any recognition to the events of the rest of the battle, much less the Civil War. At first, Hall describes many of his actions as if he does not know what is going on around him but rather that he is just awaiting orders: “I ordered my men to lie down, conceal themselves as much as possible, and await orders”. Hall was even forced to cease fire when he was not sure whom he was firing on. It is a popular belief that the brigade commanders were only giving the power to carry out orders. On the contrary, because of the vast landscape of most battlefields and the resulting slow communication, many officers were charged with the responsibility to both carry out orders and to adapt to the events of battle without putting the army at a disadvantage: “General Grant ordered me to advance, feel my way cautiously, and engage the enemy wherever I might find him”. As the report goes on, Hall is able to acknowledge his surrounding much better than before. He was able to regurgitate every other brigade’s position around him and what he believed to be the positions of the enemy soldiers. While he did not have a true grasp on what was happening in the battle as a whole, he did understand his own positioning and the responsibilities that came with it.","It is interesting at the same time to notice that while he did not seem to mention the purpose of the battle or even the Civil War, he did recognize as many killed and wounded soldiers as he could. He mentioned the bravery of many of his Captains saying that they “were all wounded on Sunday morning, while bravely and gallantly leading and encouraging their men.” Col. Hall’s account of the battle was a very personable one, with great attention to detail of his men, not the entire battle."],"display_date":"April 6, 1862 - April 7, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-06","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":317,"tag":"1862"},{"id":318,"tag":"Shiloh"},{"id":319,"tag":"Pittsburgh Landing"},{"id":320,"tag":"Cyprus Hall"},{"id":321,"tag":"Union Army"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":4722,"title":"Shiloh: Col.

The general populations’ recognition of the battles in the west, concentrating on Shiloh in particular, does not equate to their recognition of the battles in the east such as Gettysburg and Harpers Ferry. The reason is that the battles in the east took place in close proximity to some of the larger national newspapers while the battles in the west did not, and therefore did not receive the same publicity . The battle itself was a very important piece of the Civil War in the west. Shiloh, when looked at closely, can be considered the Gettysburg of the west. If the South had won, it quite possibly could have been the end to the war in the west. “Long after the last gun cooled on the Shiloh field, writers would bitterly argue the nearness of a Confederate victory on April 6.”<br /> <br /> Except for the familiar names of Grant, Buell and McClernand, one can barely decipher which battle he or she is reading about. Shiloh is just a normal battle to the men fighting. The importance of the battle was only understood by those leading the war effort. An Ohio native who studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1837, Col. Ralph P. Buckland, 72nd Ohio Infantry, Commanding Fourth Brigade wrote a report his battle accounts from the battle of Pittsburg Landing (the northern name for Shiloh) to higher authority on April 9, 1862. Buckland, like many other Federal commanding officers, did not know the lay of the land of west Tennessee very well, nor did he have any pre-Civil War combat experience or training. He described his first encounter of the battle as if it came out of nowhere. He wrote, “We had marched about 30 to 40 rods when we discovered the enemy, and open fire upon him along the whole line…” Although he seemed to be unsure of his own positioning and the positioning of the enemy, Buckland’s report comes off as very confident and calm. He talks of the successes of his men during the battle writing that “I think I may safely put the number killed by my brigade in that action at 200.”<br /> <br /> Buckland's account of the battle never mentions the broad scheme of the battle or his opinion of the war. It only really talks about the events that are affecting him directly (i.e. the fighting for life and death of he and his men). This lack of opinion can be partly attributed to the intent of the report to be merely a factual account of events and casualties for the use of higher ranked commanding officers. One can also notice Buckland’s feeling of personal responsibility to recognize the dead and wounded in his ranks by describing the extent to which his men, alive, wounded and dead, were brave and fought for their country. Buckland even gives credit to the surgeons working the field for the Federal army saying, “I take the liberty to refer to the important services of Surg. J. B. Rice and the assistant surgeons of the 48th, 17th and 72 Regiments Ohio Volunteers. They labored…taking no sleep for two days and nights.\"<br /> <br /> Following the war, Buckland was elected to the thirty-ninth and fortieth Congresses as a Republican. He later retired from politics, worked as the government directory for Union Pacific Railroad. He died in Fremont, OH in 1892."],"display_date":"April 6, 1862 - April 7, 1862","search_date":"1862-04-06","locations":[{"id":12073,"lat":35.1986686307,"lng":-88.1843543266,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":322,"tag":"Ralph P.

Initially during this time there was only one man who had the authority to end the existence of the gruesome institution once and for all. The man in question was Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln was elected President of the U.S in 1861. Being that he was the elected official, he bestowed the power to do something that slaves and citizens of the North had long waited to happen. He emancipated slavery once and for all just two years after being elected. Although he didn’t take charge immediately to end the existence of the gruesome institution, he did it just at the right time during the war."," ","    During the war Lincoln issued a Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. This document was issued by Lincoln in 1862, which was almost a year from the official document. In this document, Lincoln did in fact free slaves. But did he free every slave? Here’s the issue with the preliminary document. Instead of freeing all slaves, he only freed slaves in slave holding Union states. Being that slaves in the union would be emancipated, this would mean that slaves in confederate states would have to wait much longer than they had anticipated. This act also created questions like “ Why not free every slave ?”. There was more to the story leading up to the emancipation of slaves.   "," ","    Being that the country was in an internal war, Lincoln would have to be very clever with the decisions that he made. Because the Confederate Army had possession of part of the country, it was almost impossible for Lincoln to emancipate the slaves in full. The Confederacy definitely wouldn’t allow it. Although Lincoln was the president of the country, the South wasn’t too fond of his ideas and philosophies. The South perceived Lincoln as an imbecile and refused to let him take their source of commerce away from them."," ","Eventually, the Union pushed pass Confederate forces to the point where they had more control. Once they gained as much ground as they did, the war was putty in their hands. After gaining ground into Confederate territory, this opened the door for the emancipation of slaves. In 1863, on the first day of the year, Lincoln finally freed all slaves once and for all. Being that slaves were free, many doors opened up for the African American population. After being freed many of the slaves went on to join the Union Army to give them an edge over the once notorious south. Two years after being emancipated, the slaves joined the Union Army in victory over the Confederacy in 1865. The emancipation of slaves played a vital role in the Civil War. In fact there’s a possibility that the Confederacy may have caused an unexpected turnaround  had slaves  not joined in on the war. The emancipation of slaves changed the structure of the U.S and will forever be remembered."],"display_date":"January 1, 1862 - January 1, 1865","search_date":"1863-07-03","locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.968343,"lng":-77.0087889,"zoom":7,"place":"Washington D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3317,"tag":"Abraham Lincon"},{"id":3252,"tag":"1863"},{"id":317,"tag":"1862"},{"id":98,"tag":"Emancipation Proclamation"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}}]}
