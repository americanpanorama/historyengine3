Henry Wirz came to America from Switzerland in 1849.  He settled in Louisiana and worked as a doctor to slaves on a plantation.  At the beginning of the Civil War, he joined the Fourth Louisiana Infantry and fought for about a year before he was wounded and lost most of the use of his right arm.  Since he could not fight, the army reassigned him to work at a couple of prisons and he eventually became emissary of Jefferson Davis to Europe.  After a year in Europe, Wirz came back and was made commandant of the Andersonville Prison in Georgia.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andersonville was known for being a particularly brutal prison.  Prisoners were not given enough food, and many prisoners died of starvation.  Disease also ran rampant.  In addition to these problems, gangs of raiders' within the prison bullied and beat other prisoners for money and possessions.  The Union Army arrived at Andersonville in May 1865 and they, as well as the public, were shocked by the atrocities of the prison and wanted to punish someone for these crimes.  Wirz was made the scapegoat and arrested on May 6.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His trial by a military commission began on August 23 and he was found guilty on October 24.  He was hung at the Old Capitol Prison on November 10, 1865.  Prisoners and other guards gave many differing accounts of Wirz's character.  Some made him out to be a kind-hearted, compassionate man, and others made him seem evil.  Wirz was calm and fearless at his hanging, maintaining his innocence of committing the atrocities at Andersonville until the end."],"display_date":"November 10, 1865","search_date":"1865-11-10","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":19,"title":"409 Slaves from Africa arrive in Georgia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1798, Georgia banned involvement in the Atlantic Slave trade, followed a decade later by a nationwide ban.  The Constitution had required the ban when signed, and Congress put it into effect on January 1, 1808.  As the Hon. Joshua Giddings announced in a speech to the House of Representatives, the United States;pronounced the African slave trade to be piracy, and those who followed that vocation to be pirates worthy of death.'  All captured Atlantic slave traders in the future would tried for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strong sentiment against the Atlantic trade was not as universal as people imagined.  Many politicians in the South were unyielding in their attempts to reestablish the Atlantic routes.  Fifty years later, a candidate for Mississippi office announced that the the great want of the South is more Negroes, fresh from Africa,' and he was not alone in this idea.  The development of an illegal slave trade started as soon as the law was enacted, and this black market continued for decades.  However, the illicit trade was costly and dangerous, and the already flourishing domestic slave trade replaced the Atlantic trade to a large extent.  The last known delivery of African slaves occurred in 1858 when the Wanderer smuggled 409 slaves from the Congo and Angola into Georgia, near St. Simons Island.  The slavers responsible were not caught."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":1838,"lat":31.0887336961,"lng":-81.4509546531,"zoom":9,"place":"GLYNN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":26,"title":"State vs. Oscar decided\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the decades before the Civil War, Louisiana began using special tribunals to try slaves accused of violent crimes.  State vs. Oscar is just one example of a case using such a tribunal, where Oscar, a slave, was on trial for the rape of a young white girl.  Oscar was tried in a regular court, but his appeal went to a special tribunal.  The tribunal upheld his guilty verdict, and he was subsequently executed.  The tribunals were often fraught with errors and allowed prejudices to easily influence verdicts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Louisiana tribunals were indicative of increasingly harsh treatment of slaves by the law.  Vigilance committees became common as groups of citizens banded together to investigate and observe the actions of blacks.  Though some government officials, such as Governor Wise of Virginia, tried to prevent such groups, it was to no avail.  Meanwhile, citizens pressured police authorities to enact stronger rules.  In South Carolina, the Lancaster Ledger reported a new ordinance that it shall be the duty of all patrols to whip all slaves, who shall be found with improper permits'.

Kellogg was named governor over Democratic candidate, John McEnery in early 1873. Although The Courier-Journal reported the allegation that Kellogg's opponent, John McEnery, received almost 7,000 more votes, the Courier also revealed that Kellogg issued a bill of complaint. Here, Kellogg claimed that the current Louisiana administration engaged in a deliberate purpose to defraud [Kellogg] of an alleged election to the Governor of Louisiana, by falsifying, mutilating, and destroying the election returns received;which returns he claimed to constitute the indispensable evidence of his election.' Any result other than declaring Kellogg the winner would be a shame and fraudulent return and count, declaring McEnery elected.' Despite the decision by the Louisiana Circuit Court that Kellogg was the fair governor, there continued to be heated debate and active crisis between those that argued McEnery's rightful governorship and those that asserted Kellogg's election. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the year, Governor Kellogg attempted to appease his opponents by offering appointments to local offices and reforming the finances of the state, but he was unable to alleviate their bitterness and hostility. Maintaining that he was the lawful governor, McEnery organized his own militia in March 1873 and unsuccessfully attempted to seize control of the New Orleans police stations. Furthermore, as Kellogg faced strong opposition right from the beginning of his term, the darker side of the white-line politics came to the forefront.  This emerging political conflict would only open the doors for the violence and lawlessness among the white and black communities to ensue, leading to brutal happenings like the Colfax Massacre. Despite President Grant's intervention in the Louisiana clash by formally naming Kellogg Governor, he often spent time in the North in order to avoid the antagonistic fever boiling in his state."],"display_date":"May 22, 1873","search_date":"1873-05-22","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":57,"title":"Blockade of Missouri River\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-08-12","end_date":"1856-08-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the summer of 1856 tensions ran high between pro slavery and free soil groups in the territory of Kansas and thus trickled into the nearby, slave state Missouri.

Free soil groups vehemently opposed instituting slavery in this territory not due to moral objections, but rather because they wanted to create an all white state where plantations wouldn't usurp all of the wealth of the land.  In addition, they just didn't want blacks in the region.

This measure of the act served to directly overturn the decision in Prigg vs. Pennsylvania which formerly declared that states did not have to aid in the recapture of slaves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fugitive Slave Act was a source of strife between the North and the South because many northerners did not feel the law was warranted nor justified.  Consequently, some northerners chose to directly disobey the act and not aid in the seizure of runaways at their own risk.  As a result, posters and advertisements for runaway slaves like the ones that appeared almost daily in The Daily Dispatch, were abundant.  In one advertisement, a runaway named Armistead Clarke had fled his mistress in Richmond only to be caught in Henrico County.  One broadside offered a reward for the capture of a slave named Lewis; although Lewis, as reported by his owner Thomas Clagett, had a crippled leg and a hernia, he had still fled enslavement.  Clagett's description of Lewis not only demonstrates the lengths to which slave owners would go to recover slaves, but also the lengths to which slaves would go to try and escape; even though Lewis was physically debilitated he still attempted to escape bondage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use of advertisements and posters to retrieve runaway slaves was widespread in the 1850s and created an extensive web of people being vigilant over the property of their fellow neighbors.  This sense of community might have been heart warming if this community had not been created to protect slavery.

Its editor, Cassius Marcellus Clay, was an outspoken abolitionist from the South (a Whig from Kentucky).  His arguments against slavery usually were primarily economic in nature, thus appealing to the self-interests of farmers and small slaveholders that, at the time, were feeling the effects of severe economic depression in the tobacco market.  Clay listed several reasons why slavery was inefficient: it impoverishes soil', slaves weren't as skillful, energetic, or full of self interest' as whites, slaves supposedly produced less and consumed more than freemen, and slavery caused the poor to despise labor by degrading' it, while at the same time turning slaveholders into lazy, idle people.  He also argued that slavery caused national poverty, kept economic development from occurring at the pace that it could have by restricting education, diverting funds into slaves, and discouraging development of skills.&lt;br /&gt;Clay was correct to fear pro-slavery forces in Lexington; he fortified the office of the True American with cannons, rifles, lances, and a keg of gunpowder, and carried weapons with him wherever he went.  The Christian patriot' John G. Fee, who also harbored antislavery sentiments, experienced the threat of violence against Clay in Kentucky himself: About this time, at my suggestion, a petition was sent to Cassius M. Clay, requesting him to come to Lewis County, July 4th, 1846, and make to us an address on the subject of slavery and emancipation. The call was signed by twenty-seven citizens, to be sent to Mr. Clay.

The race riot occurred in an isolated area in the southwest corner of the state and because of this remote location, it was very difficult for reporters to obtain reliable details. However, as of Friday March 21, at least seven victims had been identified and by Saturday, it was believed that at least twelve were dead. &lt;br /&gt;According to the Birmingham newspaper, Little River County was known for its racial turmoil. The negro population is large and has for a long time proved very troublesome to the whites. Frequent murders have occurred and the fights have been common affairs'. In this particular incident, whites claim that they had discovered a very carefully laid plan among blacks in the area to incite a race war and that individual whites had been identified at potential targets. They believed that as many as twenty-three men were involved in the plot. In response, whites set out to wipe out' all twenty-three of the supposed conspirators. The Birmingham paper reported chaos in the region: white men are collecting in mobs, heavily armed and determined; negroes are fleeing for their lives, and the community is in uproar'. Anyone suspected of involvement that was found was quickly hung from the closest branch. When black citizens learned of the first several deaths, they became panicked and fled the area. Several among the dead reached the Texas state line before being caught by mobs and killed. Surrounding towns, such as Texarkana, Arkansas and New Boston, Texas learned of the uproar when wagons full of fleeing blacks arrived in their towns. &lt;br /&gt;Reporters had trouble gathering details about the incident because of the location but also because citizens were reluctant to share information. The white citizens are very reticent and are apparently not willing to give any news for publication'. A justice of peace was sent into the area from Texas on Saturday March 22 and reported of one of the victims that the deceased came to his death from natural causes, or was frozen to death'', a comment which was taken to be a cruel joke. However, this reaction demonstrates the indifference on the part of Southern officials towards the injustice being done to blacks in the area."],"display_date":"March 18, 1899 - March 22, 1899","search_date":"1899-03-20","locations":[{"id":654,"lat":33.7005137104,"lng":-94.2343382029,"zoom":9,"place":"LITTLE RIVER, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":158,"title":"Laredo Smallpox Riot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-03-19","end_date":"1899-03-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A breakout of smallpox in the Texas town of Laredo in 1898 eventually led to a confrontation between citizens and a group of Texas Rangers, which left one man dead, thirteen wounded and another twenty-one imprisoned. At the beginning of 1899, State health official, W.T. Blunt, ordered drastic measures- house-to-house vaccination, fumigation and burning of all personal effects suspected of contamination- to be taken to control the smallpox epidemic. However, by March 16, conditions had grown worse rather than better, so Blunt was ordered to the region to spearhead the effort. However, a group of Laredo residents, largely Mexican American, refused to comply with Blunt's instructions, leading Blunt to call in the Texas Rangers to assist in the implementation of his orders. On March 19, the Rangers arrived, and commenced using forceful tactics against those suspected of having the disease. The citizens took to the streets in protest and began hurling rocks at the Rangers, prompting them to shoot into the crowd, wounding at least one man. The following day, a report was made to the local sheriff that a large order of buckshot had been made in that area of the city. The investigation led Sheriff Ortiz to the home of Agapito Herrera where, after brief negotiations, a gun battle ensued between the police and a group of armed men inside Herrera's home. Herrera was fatally shot and several others on both sides were wounded. After evacuating their injured officer, the rangers returned to find an armed crowd surrounding Herrera's body and another shootout followed. Throughout the night, gunfire could be heard throughout the surrounding neighborhoods. Finally, on the morning of March 21, backups from the US Cavalry arrived and restored peace. In the following days, work continued to try to control the smallpox epidemic and twenty-one people suspected of involvement in the riot were arrested. &lt;br /&gt;          Smallpox and other diseases were still rampant at the end of the 19th century. A Richmond Dispatch article from January of 1899 reports that smallpox had broken out in Mississippi, Alabama and, likely, in Tennessee and Georgia, as well. These diseases often affected minority groups disproportionately because their substandard economic situation and inferior living conditions made them more susceptible to illness. Disease was the leading killer in the Spanish-American War, killing nearly 5,000 US soldiers. In fact, the majority of casualties were suffered after the fighting had ceased.&lt;br /&gt;          Efforts were being made by scientists to cure these diseases and by officials to help citizens do whatever they could to avoid them. An anatomy exam from the University of Virginia in May of 1899 asked students to describe in detail such parts of the body as the skull, certain bones, ligaments, joints, several different muscle groups, the kidney, the pancreas, the cerebrum, the heart, and several different nerves. This illustrates that universities were working hard to educate students about the intricate workings of the human body. Extensive work was done by doctors and scientists during the Spanish-&lt;br /&gt;American war to discover how diseases spread. Walter Reed, an American Army surgeon was able to prove that yellow fever was spread by mosquitoes. He would go on in 1900 to create a vaccine for yellow fever. And, like in Texas, when officials in North Carolina discovered a method they thought could fight disease, they used the law to enforce cooperation with their plan. On May 3 they issued an ordinance making vaccination against smallpox compulsory, threatening to fine those who did not comply. Disease was a powerful killer throughout the nineteenth century and, while steps were being taken to understand the spread of disease and to stop it where they could, officials and scientists still could not prevent outbreaks and citizens still resisted their attempts to impose unwelcome policies upon them."],"display_date":"March 19, 1899 - March 21, 1899","search_date":"1899-03-20","locations":[{"id":13306,"lat":27.8795150762,"lng":-99.636805503,"zoom":8,"place":"WEBB, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":162,"title":"Returning Board Case\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-01-01","end_date":"1878-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In New Orleans, the beginning of 1878 saw a tumultuous case played out in the press about the returning board of elections scandal.

The court convicted this free black for forcibly breaking into a house and stealing items of a small value.'  His punishment was death, to be carried out on May 3rd.  This punishment was certainly extreme for such a petty offense, but the court was using what was called the Bloody Act of 1806.  This act as the Raleigh Register explained it said: any person shall break into any dwelling house, shop, warehouse or other outhouse thereto belonging and feloniously take away any money, goods, or chattels of the value of 20 schillings or upwards;shall suffer death without the benefit of clergy'.     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henson's skin color certainly did not help his case, but surprisingly the Raleigh Register actually took to the defense of William Henson.  They did not however, come to the obvious conclusion that this act was utilized mainly because of Henson's pigmentation, but instead took it from the fear that any man (particularly white) might be tried under this obscure yet existing law.  People were advocating that although laws needed to exist to curtail crime, they must be equal to the crime.  The Register put it best when it said: Again and again we repeat, let a penitentiary be established'.  People wanted peace, but not at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This occurrence shows two strains that mark the South throughout the nineteenth century.  One, that there was a double set of standards for the free black and the white male (even the poorest of whites).  Henson was the sacrificial lamb towards a political movement towards prison reform, not discrimination.  Second, that the entire justice system of the 1800's would undergo drastic changes during this time period from a place of punishment to a place of reform.  It would bring men like de Tocqueville from France to come to the United States and report on this new prison system in 1831.  Therefore, one can see that in many ways 1827 differed from current times but yet it maintained a battle over security vs. freedom that is still being debated to this very day."],"display_date":"April 27, 1827 - May 3, 1827","search_date":"1827-04-30","locations":[{"id":9840,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":168,"title":"African-Americans Try to Improve the Status of Their Race\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-01","end_date":"1864-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beginning in 1863, black communities began to hold large meetings to discuss the articulation and communication of new attitudes towards African-Americans.  One such meeting was held in a black Baptist church in Memphis to commemorate the first anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation.  This meeting was one of the first of black convocations that called for social reforms among the black community and improvement of their status through emancipation, military service, and education.'  In addition, at this meeting, African-American men in all places, at all times and under all circumstances' were encouraged to stop using the vulgar phrase, nigger,'' because it had become common practice for military officers to address black soldiers as such (Journal, 186).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that African-Americans did attempt to improve the status of their race, the officers did not always respond favorably to these attempts.  For example, on February 2, 1864, a Georgia newspaper printed an article saying that there had been a situation in Mississippi where the officer of an African-American company harshly admonished one of his men for carelessness during shooting practice.  The soldier said that he would not stand such language,' especially considering the how respectable the officer was.  The officer responded by hitting the soldier over the head with his gun, which instantly killed him.  The black soldiers then flew to arms' and wounded or killed over one hundred whites.

Other shipping firms followed suit.  The firms, which appealed to the US Courts for protection, claimed that they hired blacks, not because they would work for lower wages, but because the central issue was simply and solely one of whether merchants of New Orleans shall conduct their own business in their own way, or whether they shall be dictated to by a handful of employees.'  &lt;br /&gt;On March 11, 1895, white laborers in New Orleans upset by the labor situation,' decided to go uptown to where the blacks worked.  The crowd was stopped by police who had been watching the distressed laborers.  A reported for the Atlanta Constitution claimed that an hour after the dispersal of the white laborers, a shot was fired which struck a black laborer, Philip L. Fisher, in the back.    The following day, two riots over a disagreement over the loading of cotton vessels occurred in the city under a presumably arranged plan.  The white workers had one of the strongest labor unions in the country and dictated their own terms of work at the levee.  However, they felt that their work was in jeopardy as a result of the influx of black workers.&lt;br /&gt; The riot resulted in the deaths of six blacks and is exemplary of rising tensions between whites and blacks in the South.  The white laborers clearly blamed the black workers for the job shortage and took their rage out on the blacks to terrorize them into leaving their jobs at the levee.  On the morning of March 13, 1895, a striking feature on the levee was the almost entire absence of Negroes,' said an Atlanta Constitution reporter.  The black workers slowly trickled back to work over the course of the month under the watchful eyes of the State Militia.  A Grand Jury investigated the riots and spoke with laborers and while several arrests were made, the vast majority of the white rioters were not punished.  Following the riots, the white unions disbanded, bringing an end to fifteen years of union power in New Orleans."],"display_date":"February 1, 1895 - March 13, 1895","search_date":"1895-02-20","locations":[{"id":5602,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":234,"title":"Ida B.

The white Northern press excluded most African American writers, so Wells was forced to create new arguments and tactics.  In an effort to attract attention to the plight of blacks, Wells attacked white fears of declining manliness and blamed those fears as the motivation and perpetration behind lynchings of blacks.    &lt;br /&gt;In 1895, Ida B. Wells released her pamphlet titled A Red Record: Tabulated Statistics and Alleged Causes of Lynchings in the U.S. 1892-94.  The pamphlet drew on her rhetoric about declining manliness and described hangings, burnings, and mutilations of blacks, thus revealing the nation's tolerance of cruelty to blacks.  In the pamphlet, Wells claims that it is the white man's civilization and the white man's government which are on trial.'  Through her discourse on manly civilization, Wells showed that white manliness could only be saved and civilization advanced by obliterating lynch law.  The pamphlet and Wells's rhetoric shocked white America and it became quite popular in Northeast cities as well as in Great Britain.  &lt;br /&gt;On April 8, 1895, following the release of Wells's pamphlet, women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony joined Wells at a lecture at the First Baptist Church in Rochester, N.Y.  Wells defended her position that Negro lynching had increased in the South and cited that between 1882 and 1892 1,000 colored people were lynched on slight pretexts, and in many cases, when they were known to be innocent.'  A young Texan theological student echoed the sentiments of many Americans during the time and rebutted that if Negroes are so badly treated in the South, why do they not come North, or go West, or to some more congenial place?'  Anthony and Wells both retorted that the North treated Negroes no better than the south.    Although lynchings did not all together stop with the publication of the pamphlet and Wells' lectures, she was influential in blossoming an anti-lynching movement in the U.S. and Great Britain."],"display_date":1895,"search_date":"1895-07-02","locations":[{"id":14347,"lat":36.7220692336,"lng":-81.9642215133,"zoom":10,"place":"WASHINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":240,"title":"Black Men &amp; Women Charged with Murder and Robbery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-06-14","end_date":"1895-08-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On June 14, 1895, 56-year-old Lucy Jane Pollard (a white woman) was found murdered and robbed in Keysville, VA.

Three days after the murder, another suspect, a black man was hunted down by the white community of Keysville.  When the black man, Solomon Mirable, was captured, 50 men brought him to the local magistrate and wanted to lynch him.

In his inaugural address in 1894, Virginia Governor Charles O'Ferrall pledged to restore the supremacy of the law,' which had been weakened by the surge in lynching since the mid-eighties.  To uphold his word, O'Ferrall sent 50 troops to the rural county to protect the suspects.     &lt;br /&gt;In the first round of trials, all four suspects were found guilty of their alleged crimes.  All four appealed and two of the three women had the charges against them dropped in the middle of their trials.

According to a Georgia newspaper, the Atlanta Constitution, which claimed it represented the true facts of the case,' Connell opened the door when the Sheriff knocked and fired a double-barreled shot gun at him; The contents entering the sheriff's head tore both eyes out.  With a shriek, the sheriff dropped dead in his tracts.'

They especially feared miscegenation. Depending on the roles played, such behavior could lead to justifiable homicide.

The two innocent men were somehow dragged in to the whole mess, and they were left to defend themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On January 10, 1832, Mr. A. Walker publicly accused three men N.H.

Again, if the adulterous men had been black, the town and the husband would have taken much harsher measures. The three men had sworn to a civil officer that all three of them had been innocent, before the true adultery of Gilbert and Mrs. Walker was admitted. At this point, Beal and Gilbert's stories looked a lot better. The men were left to wonder how a town believed a woman, who agreeably to the declarations of her husband was not a virtuous woman at the time of his marriage and had criminal intercourse with various individuals almost up to the very time of their separation;' (Beal, Georgia Messenger, February 4, 1832, 2).

Around this time period in South Carolina the leadership sold vagrants into slavery for varying lengths of time.  This trend demonstrates the unwillingness of the planter class to fairly treat almost anyone outside of its class, as well as its desires to misappropriate human labor for the good of a few large planters. &lt;br /&gt;Earlier in the year, the Time-Picayune published an article commenting on the unusually large number of beggars present in the streets of New Orleans.

By the third day, blame was shifted from Fulton Gordon and the lover Arch Dixon Brown to the deceased Mrs. Gordon herself.   The governor didn't believe that his son had led her from the path of virtue' for, according to him, Mrs. Gordon was a reckless and imprudent, if not an unchaste woman.'  The governor's words are interesting because during this time, men were usually seen as sexual predators and woman as naturally chaste and pure.

Violence and aggression on the part of the KKK toward black voters and Radical white supporters spiraled out of control; in April of 1871, President Grant took the powers given him by the new Ku Klux Klan Act to their full extent, declaring nine counties in the South Carolina upcountry to be in a state of rebellion against the U.S., suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and sending in Federal troops to bring Klansmen to justice.  831 indictments resulted from the crackdown, but by 1873 Grant, along with the rest of Washington, had begun to lose interest in the prosecutions.&lt;br /&gt;In July 1873, Grant decided to drop the whole operation.  He pardoned every Klansman serving jail time, discontinued current prosecutions, and decreed that no new prosecutions should be commenced.'  The above changes did not include active participators in murder or other outrages.'  In a rare show of support for a Republican policy, the Charleston News & Courier praised Grant's decision as highly esteemed; The action of the President does him honor, and time will show that his conduct in the Kuklux matter was as wise as it is generous and just.'  The implications for the freedmen's futures, however, were not so rosy.  The federal government's withdrawal from Klan prosecutions was one of the first inklings of what was to come in 1877, when the government's removal of remaining Federal troops from the South effectively abandoned blacks to Jim Crow.  Grant did manage to destroy the Klan organization in South Carolina, but on a larger scale, his failure to bring violently bigoted whites to justice set the stage for the rise of unabashed racial brutality, especially lynching, during the 1880s and 1890s."],"display_date":"July 31, 1873","search_date":"1873-07-31","locations":[{"id":11639,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":349,"title":"The Virginius Affair\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-10-31","end_date":"1873-11-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Virginius was a former Confederate blockade runner which had been captured by the Union during the American Civil War.  A Northerner, John Patterson, purchased the Virginius from the government, and, unbeknownst to the New York Customs House, planned to use the ship to take supplies and men to Cuban insurgents fighting the Ten Years' War with Spain.  The Ten Years' War was the Cuban war for independence which lasted from 1868-1878; the last three months of the conflict would escalate to become the Spanish-American War. On October 31, 1873 in international waters near Jamaica, a Spanish naval vessel took the Virginius (which was flying the American flag) and its passengers and crew into custody.  There were 52 American and English crewmen, and around 100 Cuban passengers.  On November 4 in Santiago de Cuba, the Spanish summarily tried and executed 53 of the Virginius's crew, including the ship's commanding officer and former Confederate Captain Joseph Fry, as well as some passengers who turned out to be insurgents.&lt;br /&gt;Americans were outraged at the news; it was inconceivable that Spain would dare to board a vessel flying the U.S. flag in international waters, then impound and execute most of the crew.  Southerners were especially angry at the death of the ship's captain, an upright gentleman' and native Floridian; melancholy obituaries of the Captain who supported the secession of Florida from the Federal Union, and served throughout the war in the navy of the Confederate States' appeared in papers across the South.  In exchange for the loss of such a man, ever ready to espouse the cause of liberty,' Southerners wanted justice: The blood of Captain Fry and his comrades has not been shed in vain. From all over this country will go up a cry for vengeance upon their murderers, and Cuba soon be free Cuba.'&lt;br /&gt;Even after the news came out that the Virginius had flown the American flag illegally, tensions were high between the U.S. and British and Spain.  However, on December 8, Spain agreed to release the remaining prisoners, return the Virginius to the United States.  In 1875, the Spain paid an indemnity of 80,000 to the American and British governments in apology for the execution of American and British citizens two years earlier.  Though the Virginius incident rallied Southern pride, it also lit a fire of nationalism in the United States, a prelude to the rise of nativism later in the century, and sowed a seed of discord between the American and Spanish governments which would yield the Spanish-American War a few years later."],"display_date":"October 31, 1873 - November 8, 1873","search_date":"1873-11-03","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":354,"title":"Lynching to Protect White Women\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-07-31","end_date":"1873-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though the exponential increase in lynching did not truly begin until the late 1880s, the upward trend had already begun a decade earlier.  Casual articles with headlines like A Rascal Lynched' were fairly common in the newspapers of the 1870s; already, much of the Southern public was blinded with fear and rage at the idea of a black man with a white woman.  A lynching was most likely to occur in cases where a black man had been convicted of outraging' (raping) a white woman, though a lack of conviction did not mean whites presupposed an accused negro's innocence.  In Cairo, Mississippi, for example, a black man arrested for attempted rape of a white girl was taken from the jailhouse by a number of citizens and hanged.'  Threats of extralegal executions for black men were accepted as almost normal when a white woman's integrity and supposed virginity were at stake; many newspaper accounts failed to even mention the suspect's name.  A one-sentence account in the Richmond Daily Dispatch relayed a Mason County, Kentucky incident: A negro was shot dead in Mason County yesterday for rape.'  &lt;br /&gt;But why did rape merit the death penalty only in cases where the accused was black and the victim was a white woman? The Civil War ripped apart the Southern social structure; white men were no longer the unquestioned masters of their region.  The threat of white-black racial amalgamation coupled with post-slavery black competition in social and economic spheres struck fear into the hearts of white men across the South and compelled them to reassert their power over both their' women and the black men who were their competition. During Reconstruction, scattered incidents of lynching foreshadowed its exponential rise during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  Lynchings in 1873 and those that occurred 2 decades later differed only in their frequency and intensity.  By the last decade of the nineteenth century, lynching had become the ultimate public expression of white male dominance, complete with cameras, newspaper announcements, and special excursion trains chartered for urban whites to view the ritual and extended torture of African-American men and even women in rural areas."],"display_date":"July 31, 1873","search_date":"1873-07-31","locations":[{"id":5125,"lat":38.5951990256,"lng":-83.8240569898,"zoom":10,"place":"MASON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":361,"title":"Trial ends in hung jury in the case of John Surratt, Jr.","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-08-10","end_date":"1867-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Perhaps one of the most publicized events of the summer of 1867 was the trial of John Harrison Surratt, Jr. and its impending verdict.  When the verdict was announced as a hung jury' on August 10,1867 after more than two months of arguments had been presented, the responses from the public ranged from resentment to relief.  Indeed, much information needed to be digested to make a decision on Surratt's guilt or innocence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only eighteen years old when the Civil War began, Surratt, who was from Maryland, left school to become a Confederate courier.  During his time in the Confederacy's equivalent of the secret service, Surratt met John Wilkes Booth.  In 1866, when he was first arrested on charges of conspiracy to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln, Surratt maintained his innocence.  While he admitted to being a part of a plot to kidnap President Lincoln a few years prior, he denied taking participating in the murder of the president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to the complexity of this case was the role of Surratt's mother.  Mary Surratt had been tried and hanged in a military court two years prior for her role in the assassination.  Mrs. Surratt had allowed Booth, her son, and other later-charged conspirators to meet in her home, which, according to the military trial, made her culpable.  The public would be as divided over her son's hung jury as they had been by her hanging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A myriad of witnesses were called by both the prosecution and the defense in this case.  One of the more troubling pieces of evidence against Surratt was his fleeing to Europe, where he received protection from the Catholic Church.  When Surratt was finally arrested, it was in Alexandria, Egypt.  Newspapers across the United States published daily updates concerning the Surratt Trial, who had testified, and the editors' opinions on the impending verdict.  The Daily Dispatch actually published the four names of the jurors who had wanted to pronounce Surratt guilty, but not the names of the eight men who chose to proclaim Surratt as innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surratt was never re-tried in any court.

This law completely transformed punishment in the state of Tennessee. For example, whipping posts, stocks, and cropping were abolished.

This law was drafted with much foresight and was not substantially changed until 1913.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Governor Carroll's new law was certainly revolutionary in Tennessee, it was also part of a national trend taking place in 1829.

It was also stated that, amazingly, only 23 organized penitentiaries' existed in the nation's current 24 states. The editor went on to note that around one out of thirteen hundred free persons were being imprisoned, and that this was a sad picture indeed ' In Virginia, Governor Giles saw it as a cause to boast that only one white woman has been convicted of a Penitentiary offence within the last four years.' Penitentiaries were open to both men and women, even at this early time in penitentiary history. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tennessee's Penitentiary law of 1829 was representative of the nation's growing concern for the imprisonment of criminals and also of growing sentiment for the humane treatment of prisoners.

President Jackson's destruction of the Bank of the United States had resulted in uncontrolled speculation, and frontier people were clamoring for more land.  This was in spite of the 1832 Treaty of Cusseta, which stipulated that individual Creeks be given a parcel of 320 acres if they decided to stay in Alabama.  But neither the Alabama state legislature nor the settlers respected this agreement.  Speculators and settlers bought land from the Indians for much less than it was worth.  Some Creeks resigned themselves to this forced displacement and emigrated west.  Others resisted removal; finding themselves dispossessed of their land, the non-compliant Creeks adopted the practice of stealing livestock from the frontier people, especially those near the Florida border.  Skirmishes between farmers and small bands of Indians became a common occurrence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of May 15th, a sizeable contingent of Creeks made an attack in Georgia for the first time.  After crossing the Chattahoochee River from Alabama, the party raided the town of Roanoke, killing several whites and burning their homes.  The Southern Recorder reported: There were 70 or 80 persons in the town, including a small company of infantry under Capt. Horne... the number of the enemy being ascertained (about 300) it was thought prudent to retreat, which they did in disorder.'  Unable to overtake the retreating settlers, the Indians decided to return to the town and burn it to the ground.  A number of those who had escaped alerted a military encampment of the attack, but by the time a group of militiamen made it to the hamlet, the Indians were gone.  The Recorder reported that at least seven whites and five blacks were dead, with 15 people missing; the Indians lost only three of their number, while the rest crossed back into Alabama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reports of Indian hostilities' and depredations' became more and more frequent, considerably heightening the distress of those whites who were already dealing with Seminole disturbances in the Florida territory.

Kincaid reported that married Congressman William Taulbee was seen in a compromising way' with a young woman in the United States Patent Office.  As a result, Taulbee's political career ended.  On February 28, 1890, Taulbee came across Kincaid in Washington, D.C. and threatened the journalist.  According to a Capitol doorkeeper who witnessed the threat, ex-Congressman Taulbee grabbed Kincaid by his coat collar and said Kincaid, come out into the corridor with me.'  Kincaid responded to Taulbee's actions by saying that he was in no condition for a physical contest' and that he was unarmed.  Mutual friends separated the two men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in the day, the two men crossed paths again in the Capitol building outside the House restaurant.  Kincaid drew a revolver and shoot Taulbee in the face, about one-quarter of an inch left of his left eye.  Kincaid then made no attempt to escape but rather announced his responsibility for the shooting.  Local physicians including a Congressman quickly attended to Taulbee and his wound.

Hose, a farm laborer, was accused of murdering his employer, Alfred Cranford, after a dispute broke out over wages and of brutally attacking his wife, although sources differ on the precise details of the encounter. Hose escaped from Palmetto, Georgia, where the crimes took place, but was captured the following day in the neighboring town of Griffin by the Jones brothers. Citizens of Griffin wished to execute Hose immediately, but it was decided that he should be taken to the sheriff in the county seat, Newnan, so that the Jones could claim the reward that had been offered. &lt;br /&gt;          The train carrying Hose to Newnan was packed with people who were eager to witness the man's execution. As soon as Hose was off of the train, a huge mob crowded around him and marched him to the jail, cheering and shouting along the way. Plans were made to take Hose back to Palmetto for his execution; however, several prominent members of the community spoke out, pleading with the mob to allow justice to take its course. Governor Candler ordered even ordered out the troops. Upon hearing this, the mob decided that the execution needed to take place immediately and within minutes, Sam Hose was hanging from a tree. &lt;br /&gt;          Hose's execution was extremely brutal. Hose initially refused to confess, but after his ears were cut from his head, he claimed responsibility for the crimes. The Atlanta Constitution reported that 2000 witnesses watched as he was burned alive and his body cut and mutilated. Peculiarly, the man responsible for dousing Hose's body and clothes in kerosene was a stranger from the North, who was reported as saying that, though he did not know how people from his part of the country would respond to this, he felt the need to avenge the terrible crimes that had been committed. For sickening sights, harrowing details and bloodcurdling incidents, the burning of Holt is unsurpassed by any occurrence of a like kind ever heard of in the history of the state'. Even Hose's bones were taken from the scene as souvenirs. &lt;br /&gt;          Hose claimed that he was paid to murder Alfred Cranford by Lige Strickland, another African-American from the same community who was arrested and tried the day after Hose's execution. Strickland denied the accusations, but it was believed that he would be hanged regardless. The involvement of more than one black laborer led many to believe that Cranford's murder was part of a widespread conspiracy on the part of blacks. However, those present at the execution reported feeling relieved and comforted by the fact that Hose was so quickly apprehended and executed. &lt;br /&gt;          Coverage of the story varied tremendously from publication to publication, with whites typically portraying Hose as a vicious murderer, while blacks pointed out that he was never given a trial or proven guilty of the crimes which he was accused of. Reverberations were seen throughout Southern newspapers of the period, with eve many whites condemning the excessive violence and brutality employed in Hose's lynching."],"display_date":"April 23, 1899","search_date":"1899-04-23","locations":[{"id":1703,"lat":33.3534509508,"lng":-84.7632908294,"zoom":10,"place":"COWETA, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":506,"title":"Danville Riot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-11-03","end_date":"1883-11-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Racial tension in the late 19th century peaked in the Southeastern United States.  Blacks fought what seemed to be an impossible objective as they sought out equality in a predominately white world.  Nevertheless slow and steady progress was being made as African American advanced in social, political, and economic arenas.  These establishments brought with them the wrath of Southern white fear and prejudice.  What happened on November 3, 1883 in Danville, Virginia was a horrible example of an all too familiar bias that dates back to slavery.&lt;br /&gt;The Danville Riot of 1883 was spurred by white fears in the political spectrum.  The 1883 Virginia statewide elections featured a political party that had in the past been relatively successful.  The Readjuster campaign took an aggressive approach to winning the support of its followers.  For this year the Readjuster ticket had promised three distinct changes: Negro schools, an asylum for Negro insane, and abolition of the whipping post' (Melzer, 12).  The night of the third, a meeting was held by the Coalition Rule in Danville,' a group comprised of several prominent white men who denounced the Readjuster campaign (The Post, 11/4/1883, 1).  A crowd of black men soon congregated outside which inevitably resulted in an altercation.  After the meeting an African American shoved one of the members and tempers quickly escalated.  Even though the man apologized, many white men had already drawn pistols.  A scuffle ensued resulting in seven black men dead and two whites injured (NY Times, 11/5/1883, 1).  The military arrived shortly there after and the crowd dispersed.&lt;br /&gt;Much damage had been done, but many of the effects of the riot were not apparent until after the elections.  Whites patrolled the streets after the riot with shotguns in an attempt to keep fear and submission in the hearts of African-Americans.  The propaganda proved effective when the polls were tallied as 31 of the 1,300 blacks registered to vote submitted ballots (Ayers/Willis, 142).  The result was a landslide victory for the Democratic Party.  This event also marked the end of the Readjuster era."],"display_date":"November 3, 1883 - November 5, 1883","search_date":"1883-11-04","locations":[{"id":14155,"lat":36.8111162856,"lng":-79.3976134371,"zoom":9,"place":"PITTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":527,"title":"Martial Law Declared in North Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-06-08","end_date":"1870-11-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Ku Klux Klan began its attempts to undermine the formulating North Carolina state government in 1868.

As a result the Tolberts controlled the Negro vote and exercised a significant amount of power over the Republican Party. In the election of 1898 R.R. Tolbert, a candidate for Congress, garnered a large amount of Negro support. In order to assist blacks in overcoming the barriers of disfranchisement, members of the Tolbert family placed Republican ballot boxes at voting locations convenient for blacks throughout South Carolina. <br /><br />Violence ensued when Mr. Ethridge, a respected man in Phoenix was shot dead after he attempted to take the control of the ballot boxes away from the Tolberts. Next a group of armed white Democrats physically attacked Thomas Tolbert for collecting black ballots.

Whitecapping in Mississippi specifically refers to using violent tactics to force African American farmers to leave their farm land and their homes. Farmers living in poverty because of widespread agricultural problems were usually the culprits of this type of violence. When a farmer was forced to give up his land because of too much debt, local merchants acquired the land and often hired African-Americans to farm the land. Poor white farmers were angered by the fact that African-Americans were farming the land that another white farmer had been forced to give up and they took out their anger on the African-Americans by using whatever means they had to force them to leave. &lt;br /&gt;The issue came to a head on May 5, 1893 when over a hundred white farmers interrupted the proceedings of the court in Jackson, Mississippi by surrounding the courthouse, pistols in hand. The presiding judge, Judge Chrisman, left the courthouse and fearlessly denounced them and ordered their arrest' (1), read the Atlanta Constitution. The whitecaps soon retreated, upon arrival of another posse of armed citizens raised by Judge Chrisman. After their retreat, the governor of Mississippi arrived with a military company to insure that the whitecaps didn't try another attack later that night.  &lt;br /&gt;The whitecaps taking part in the siege on the Jackson courthouse claimed their actions were meant as a dispute against their fellow imprisoned whitecaps being denied bail. However, the acts the imprisoned whitecaps were arrested for were acts of arson on buildings inhabited by humans, acts which were not allowed bail in Mississippi at the time. Local citizens were outraged at the nerve of the men who thought they could overrule the law with intimidation and violence. The good citizens of the county are aroused, and publicly denounce the actions of the sympathizers of the prisoners' (1), read the Atlanta Constitution.

Affects of the Civil War had created a dominant middle class, as well as a strong African American vote, in Clarke County. When the 1892 elections for Governor of Alabama arrived, most Clarke County residents supported one of two political parties- the Democratic Party or the Farmer's Alliance. The race for governor between Democratic candidate, Thomas Goode Jones, and Alliance-backed candidate, Reuben F. Kolb, promised to be a close one. Local newspapers enhanced the dramatic race by publishing warnings from the Democratic Party, stating that Misrepresentations and falsehood are the chief weapons of the Kolb party' (2). Conflict began immediately after the election, with claims that Jones' victory was the result of illegal actions, such as ballot stuffing. The front page of the Birmingham Age-Herald reported, just days after the election, that The political situation in Alabama is critical and the gravest fears of the leaders of two legislatures and two state governments from present indications, may be realized' (1). Democrats carried the black vote in Clarke County, infuriating citizens of the rural precinct of Mitcham Beat, who had turned to the Alliance after feeling ignored by their own local Democratic Party. This group of citizens of Mitcham Beat, secretly named Hell-at-the-Breech, didn't have a loyalty to the Alliance, either, but voted that way simply to be accepted politically. When the Alliance began reporting lawlessness on the part of white men in Mitcham Beat, the men took out their frustration with violence.     &lt;br /&gt;The murder of elite Democratic Party member Ernest McCorquodale, allegedly over McCorquodale's foreclosure of a Hell-at-the-Breech member's farm , was investigated, but never solved after all suspects were found to have alibis. Not long after, in June 1893, a black man, William Howze, was murdered outside of Mitcham Beat for mistreating a white woman. When the black man's brother was accused of the same crime a month later, two prominent citizens of Clarke County stepped forward to prevent his lynching. When the Hell-at-the-Breech posse confronted an upper-class store owner in a neighboring town over allegations that the store owner had mistreated a boy from Mitcham Beat, leaders of Clarke County saw connections between McCorquodale and Howze's murders. The Mayor stepped in to protect Clarke County around the same time that McCorquodale's death was avenged by the murder of Hell-at-the-Breech member, Lev James. Soon after, Hell-at-the-Breech members' names were given by tortured members and, to make a point, the mob of Clarke County men publicly shot one of the most prominent members of the group, Quincy Bledsole. Although this ended the reign of Mitcham Beat's Hell-at-the-Breech, the bitterness of the working class would live on in Clarke County."],"display_date":"June 1, 1893 - August 30, 1893","search_date":"1893-07-16","locations":[{"id":83,"lat":31.6766489025,"lng":-87.8308040287,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":793,"title":"Kansas &#147;Jayhawkers&#39; Loot Western Missouri\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-10-30","end_date":"1861-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Kansas militia led by Jim Lane and Doc Jennison rode into Western Missouri in the Summer and Fall of 1861, claiming they intended to protect the railroads.

However, the strike's lasting economic ramifications, as well as its galvanization of labor groups prove that its impact would be remembered.  Despite the economy's recovery into the 1880s, the number of labor strikes tripled , and state troops were dispatched at an increasing rate.

In North Carolina, and the throughout the rest of the South, however, Holden's impeachment was considered well-deserved. The Richmond Whig defended Holden's impeachment in 1871. According to the Richmond Whig, Holden's impeachment occurred because the people of North Carolina were outraged by Holden's arrests and imprisonment of certain citizens of North Carolina. The impeachment investigation of Holden also determined that under Holden's leadership the judiciary system, from the negro magistrate to the Chief Justice on the Supreme bench', in the State was extremely biased toward the Republican Party.

Upon arrival in the city, referred to by Civil War historian James McPherson as the “communications center for abolition,” Knight and Hughes were met with hostility and resistance, rather than cooperation or even legal compliance, with the Act.","William and Ellen Craft had escaped their master’s hold two years prior, in December of 1848. Ellen, being the offspring of an African American woman and her white owner, had sufficiently light-skin as to cross the color-line, disguised as an ailing white man, after obtaining the proper attire and cutting her hair. With William posing as Ellen’s servant accompanying his master, the couple traveled on a variety of steamships and trains inconspicuously even though stopping in several slave-holding areas, such as Charleston, SC, Wilmington, NC, Fredericksburg, VA, and others before finally crossing the Mason-Dixon line into Pennsylvania.","Soon after the couple settled themselves in Boston, the Crafts became involved in the active abolitionist efforts in the city. With a firm community of members in Beacon Hill, the Crafts found themselves swept up in abolitionist lecture circuits throughout the area. Unfortunately, such activism naturally increased the risk of discovery, as they told the story of their disguised escape to fellow campaigners. Thus, when the Fugitive Slave legislation passed, the Crafts’ owner knew exactly where to find the pair.","While Section 5 of the Fugitive Slave Act required that “..all good citizens [were thereby] commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution of this law..” the reaction to Knights and Hughes was anything but. Theodore Parker, the chair of the Vigilance Committee, (the primary organization in Boston created to aide fugitive slaves, which had increased by 100 members since the arrival of the two slave catchers) hid Ellen in his home, placed William in a separate safe haven, and ensured that both blacks were guarded by at least one armed white. Additional members of the committee filled the town with notices depicting the “two prowling villains,” “the pursuing bloodhounds,” as they were described.","Yet the truly extreme abhorrence for the Fugitive Slave law among these Boston abolitionists was seen in the multiple arrests of Knight and Hughes. The two were arrested on October 26 around 3 p.m. by Deputy Sheriff Coburn, according to <em>The</em> <em>Farmer’s Cabinet, </em>on charges of slander against William Craft. After making bail, both men were again arrested some hours later, this time for conspiracy to kidnap the Crafts, accordingly in clear violation of the new legislation. Bail for each arrest was set at $10,000, and it remains unclear who posted such bail, yet speculation has been made, namely that John H. Pearson (a noted pro-slavery acquaintance of the men) and Patrick Riley (US Deputy Marshall) had a hand in assisting the men in this manner.","President Fillmore upon hearing of these actions, which effectively drove Knight and Hughes out of the city by October 30, warned the Bostonians of his inclination to send federal troops to the city to enforce the law, and assured the Crafts’ owner that he would be provided with any and all support he desired to attempt the recapture a second time.","Fillmore failed to deliver on such promises, however, as the Vigilance Committee was determined not to yield to legislation they believed immoral in all aspects. Members placed William and Ellen Craft safely on a ship destined for Liverpool by December of that year, enabling the couple to successfully continue their plight speaking out against the evils of slavery, and leaving the Bostonians to view the event as a victory among the context of the larger sectional crisis."],"display_date":"October 25, 1850 - October 31, 1850","search_date":"1850-10-28","locations":[{"id":6209,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":602,"tag":"Transportation/Migration"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":836,"title":"Temperance Movement Debated in Tennessee\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-07-01","end_date":"1853-07-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The fate of alcohol was uncertain during mid-nineteenth Century.

Soon after, though, scores of black men on board the train rushed forward to try to stop the arrest and to rescue both Johnson and Barton.

In addition, Sheriff Wilcox sustained injuries as he was shot through his arm.&lt;br /&gt;The event's significance stands out on a number of fronts.  First of all, the illegal selling of goods aboard trains is a fine example of two new vices which became prevalent throughout the South at this time for black people: liquor and tobacco.

Simkins recounts that the black lower classes' new-found access to alcohol scared many local officials as they believed the blacks were the cause of the profanity, vagrancy, murders, and assaults' which permeated Southern streets on average Saturdays now.

Johnson's commutation ignited a tumultuous debate and uproar throughout the state of Virginia.  On the night of the commutation, a violent and unruly crowd of over 2,000 whites gathered outside of Richmond's City Hall to denounce Johnson and his commutation.  The untamed mob began to damage property and threatened to storm City Hall.  Some factions of the crowd began to demand that either Hatcher be released to the crowd to be lynched or the crowd would threaten Governor Johnson.  The Virginia Guard had to be deployed to subdue and disperse the crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent gatherings to protest the commutation ensued over the following weeks.  Legislation censuring the Governor and overriding his commutation were contemplated, but eventually abandoned after appeals for Democratic unity from prominent politicians.  Several weeks of debate in the Virginia General Assembly were devoted to commutation fallout.  While Democrats were eager to vilify Hatcher as a murderous beast, they were reticent to denounce Johnson as this may have been perceived as sanctioning the lawless mob.  As in North Carolina, slaveholders were extremely concerned about uncontrolled lynch mobs of lower class whites who may seize or damage their property. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several gatherings were also held in Richmond to denounce the mob riots of 7 May.  The firestorm over Johnson's commutation exposed rifts in the Virginia Democratic party between the largely slaveholding Eastern counties and the recently enfranchised and largely non-slaveholding Western Counties.  While Eastern slave-holding Democrats in the General Assembly called for the imposition of stricter controls over Virginia's slave population, most notably to prohibit slaves from living away from their masters, no meaningful laws were passed in response to the commutation.  In fact, leniency toward slaves convicted of capital crimes developed as a pattern in Virginia jurisprudence over the next eight years.  Slaveholders were united in their opposition to lynch mobs and considered government interference in their administration of their slaves as an encroachment on their right to own, discipline and govern their own slaves."],"display_date":"May 7, 1852","search_date":"1852-05-07","locations":[{"id":13916,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":934,"title":"Ku Klux Klan Activity in South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-03-01","end_date":"1871-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Ku Klux Klan committed outrages against Republicans and their supporters throughout the South during 1870 and 1871; however, party leaders hesitated to respond.

Governor Scott had not hesitated to dispatch state militia to combat violence in 1869 and 1870, and it was evident that Scott was clearly reversing his policies. Governor Scott refused to declare martial law as he had done in the past. The white Ku Klux Klan community had grown too powerful and the Governor held the militia back in order to prevent bloodshed. In March 1871, Governor Scott finally decided to disband black militia units in Union, York, and Chester counties in a compromise with whites that they would do everything in their power to try and restore law and order. The federal governments responded as well, by dispatching troops to South Carolina, but the soldiers were severely outnumbered and represented only a potential threat. &lt;br /&gt;The Ku Klux Klan violence in South Carolina represented terrorism on a scale that was previously unknown.

The problem was simple: gold and other resources had been discovered on a huge tract of very rich and fertile land that was inaccessible only because it was occupied by people who white Americans at the time saw as uncivilized savages. It did not make sense to a growing America to ignore these valuable lands in the middle of existing U.S. states, and so events such as the Georgia Gold Rush helped lead to the Indian tribes being voluntarily or not so voluntarily relocated to different, less valuable territories."],"display_date":"October 9, 1830","search_date":"1830-10-09","locations":[],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1068,"title":"Threat of Houston, Texas race riot leads to armed suppression of African-Americans.","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-07-21","end_date":"1879-07-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Racial tensions rose to the boiling point after a black citizen named Floyd was lynched by a white mob.

The writer used primary evidence to make the argument that those who criticized Southerners for upholding the institution of slavery were hypocritical because many of them made money from illegal importation of slaves overseas, the act that produced this servitude (Alexandria).'  The transportation and selling of slaves from West Africa, or any other country, was officially outlawed in 1808 as a response to Northern persistence.  Nevertheless, between that time and 1860, the South illegally imported over 250,000 slaves.  &lt;br /&gt;This crime had become a major topic of controversy, especially earlier in the year in which the Herald published its article.  On January 7, 1820, the Secretary of the Navy, Smith Thompson, submitted a letter to the House of Representatives regarding any and all information he had on the introduction of slaves into the United States.  The US government required copies of communication about bringing slaves into the country since 1816.  Thompson's letter contained a few short letters he received about suspicious activity on the seas, as well as instructions he had sent in January, 1819, to all the commanding naval officers to make them aware of the illicit activity.  &lt;br /&gt;The Alexandria Herald correctly pointed out that though Northerners began to abolish slavery within their borders and speak out against the institution, it was frequently the shippers and merchants from those same states who engaged in the slave trade.  The moral ideals of the North were undermined by the economic mindset of these traders, looking to profit from illegal slave imports for the South.  The newspaper backed its accusation by reporting a recent capture of a Rhode Island schooner with a full cargo of slaves.  Sectional tension heightened as the frustrated South complained that they [Northerners] can bellow and rave in favor of Missouri restriction in public, and in private employ their wealth and enterprise in this unrighteous business (Alexandria).'"],"display_date":"June 9, 1820","search_date":"1820-06-09","locations":[{"id":14380,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ALEXANDRIA CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1234,"title":"Italo-American Incident\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-03-14","end_date":"1891-03-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A mob comprised of 20,000 residents of New Orleans, angered at the failure of a jury to convict the alleged murderers of David C.

The ritual act of lynching was used by white Southerners to literally destroy the humanity of the black victim, but also to symbolically destroy that of every member of the race.  White Southerners terrorized African-Americans into submission by publicly killing a black person who violated some arbitrary behavior.  White Southerners couldn't stand the idea of a black person injuring a white person and getting away with the crime. Whites feared if the crime went unpunished it would encourage blacks to rise up against isolated whites on plantations.  White Southerners used lynchings to compensate for what they perceived as weak governments.  Lynchings occurred at higher rates in counties that had limited law enforcement, limited communication with the outside world, and a transient population.  Since many black people were forced to migrate to where there was work, it created a volatile situation.   &lt;br /&gt;The Chicago Daily Tribune reported there were 95 confirmed lynchings of African-Americans during 1889, of which 92 occurred in the South.

In the South homicide among blacks and whites was the highest compared to the rest of the nation and world. Within the turbulent south during the 1880s and early 1890s, politics and economic turmoil' constantly threw both blacks and whites into conflict. Most violence was caused by whites going against the blacks, especially since it was they who believed that it was the blacks who were dangerous and the blacks who bred the violence that hung over the South.' Blacks, however, at times did turn against the whites, and when they did so, they risked serious punishment by the whites. As Ayers explains that because the white men believed a legal execution was too good for such criminals,' these blacks were often dragged from jail to be tortured, hanged, and burned by these mobs of white men. This very situation occurred in Eastman, Georgia on August 6, 1882. &lt;br /&gt;An argument between two black men started a riot when thousands of blacks gathered for a camp meeting. The Montgomery Advertiser simply explained that a white police man attempted to restrain the aggressor, but the aggressor knocked down the policeman. A white deputy marshal shot this aggressor, called a fleeing prisoner,' which infuriated the mob. On August 12, the Atlanta Constitution states that the marshal and deputy marshal of Eastman arrested Jake Johnson on the charge of stealing a watch, and he shot and killed him as he tried to run away.  &lt;br /&gt;As a result, the angry mob murdered Mr. James Q. Harvard whose identity was mistaken for the deputy. The Atlanta Constitution describes that young Harvard was shot through the face and in the arm, and then he was dragged into the street and his head beaten into a pulp with heavy scantlings in the hands of the brutes.'  This article also claimed that the black people called for setting fire to the white houses and killing local whites. Eventually the police was able to subdue and arrest the crowd. At the end of the riot, one white man, Harvard, and four black men were killed. &lt;br /&gt;Further, Ayers also stated that local black leaders, for their own purposes, often joined with the whites in blaming vagrant blacks for any crime in the neighborhood.' &lt;br /&gt;The colored citizens of Eastman held a meeting after the outbreak to adopt resolutions unanimously' as explained in the article The Riot at Eastman.' There were two resolutions. The first stated that they, as Christians and law abiding citizens,' condemned the actions of the mob. The second stated that they were sympathetic to the unfortunate families of the deceased. The article further explained that the Eastman County is overrun by a turbulent negro population' from Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

Although he was arrested and sometimes convicted on charges such as drinking and gambling, adultery, and theft, he became a leader of Choctaw County's blacks. He was also a somewhat successful organizer for the local Republicans and he played a key role in bringing the Republicans and the Greenbacks together. Not only were the whites persuaded that black crime was out of control, but as found in the Promise of the New South, whites were terrified of the rumors stating that black criminals were held up as heroes by the black community, championed for their bravery against persistent white.' Turner epitomized this situation, for he himself was a man of political influence, a leader of the black community, and he planed a conspiracy against the whites. &lt;br /&gt;On August 15, some papers were found supposedly revealing Turner as the leader of a widespread black conspiracy to murder all the whites in Choctaw County. The Montgomery Advertiser printed some of the papers that had been revealed. According to  these papers, the plot had been in existence since 1878. In 1882, the number of the conspirators had grown to 400. They had gathered guns and intended to rise up on Sunday night, September 17, when the whites would be attending a meeting unarmed.  &lt;br /&gt;Then on August 16, the citizens of Mount Sterling and Butler decided to arrest the leaders of the conspiracy: Jack Turner, F.D. Barney, Jesse Wilson, Peter Hill, Willis Lyman, Aaron Scott and Range West. These men were arrest on August 17,1882. Two days later, on Saturday August 19, about 700 people gathered, including around 150 blacks, and demanded the key of the jail from the sheriff.

In the decision, the Court reversed the wartime conviction of Lambdin P. Milligan, an Indiana resident, and declared that no citizen, not in the military service, [could] be tried and sentenced by any tribunal which denies to him the privilege of a jury of his countrymen' (National Daily Intelligencer, January 1, 1867).  Milligan's conviction was overturned because he had been tried by a military court even though Indiana civil courts were still in operation.  &lt;br /&gt;An opinion piece in the Daily National Intelligencer boldly claimed that no more important decision has ever been enrolled among the records of the Supreme Court of the United States' (Daily National Intelligencer, January 1, 1867).  This statement may seem overblown at first, but goes to show that ex parte Milligan was interpreted by some to be about much more than the imprisonment of an Indiana man.  For many, the decision reaffirmed the authority of the Constitution -- which guarantees a right to trial by a jury of one's peers -- even during times of national turmoil.  The Daily National Intelligencer also heralded the decision as a strong refute to any claim that martial law could ever be enacted upon a civilian. &lt;br /&gt;Although this decision dealt with a Northern state, it added to a debate over the validity of Freedman's bureau courts and military commissions that had operated at times when Johnson claimed Southern civilian courts to be legitimate.  The controversy surrounding ex parte Milligan and the question of civil courts versus martial law in the South is another example of the widening gap between President Johnson and the Republicans.  Republicans believed that Congress needed to challenge the civil courts Johnson declared legitimate, and affirm military jurisdiction' (Donald 557).  The Republican response to the ex parte Milligan decision foreshadowed Congress' implementation of the military-heavy Radical Reconstruction, which soon trumped Johnson's less intense Presidential Reconstruction strategy."],"display_date":"December 1, 1866 - December 31, 1866","search_date":"1866-12-16","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1344,"title":"Massachusetts 6th Regiment of Volunteers under attack by Baltimore citizens\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-19","end_date":"1861-04-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Baltimore citizens gathered en masse in the streets of Baltimore, Maryland as the Massachusetts 6th Regiment of Volunteers marched through on their way to Washington, D.C.  A mob of southern sympathizers threw stones and other objects at the soldiers as they marched through Baltimore. The volunteers fired into the mob of citizens as they passed through the streets in defense.  This created hysteria throughout the city as fights and more riots broke out.  A telegraph from Baltimore to a New Orleans paper read, The fight is still progressing at the time we telegraph.  The excitement throughout the city is of the most intense nature.'

Telegraph wires were cut, the railway tracks leading in and out of the city were severely damaged, and a wooden bridge was destroyed in the heart of the city.  Under martial law, businesses closed and both citizens and troops were gripped by fear.  News of the attacks reached City Hall and the Marshal's office although the official efforts from that point on were in vain.  By night time, all authority in the city had collapsed.

Yet, the very nature' of the western postal service, as Martin Klotsche says, opened the way for numerous frauds.' The vast distance of the nation kept the star routes hidden from government inspection. The Grand Jury charged the defendants, leading offenders including Thomas Brady and Stephen Dorsey, with conspiracy to defraud the government,' based on the pay on nineteen mail routes, which had been increased from 41,135 to 448, -670.90, while the revenue had amounted to only 11,622.36.' &lt;br /&gt;The trial began on June 1, 1882, and Klotsche mentions that the trial was faced with several obstacles, one being that because most of the Washington newspapers printed constant abuses against the members of the prosecution, these newspapers were able to create a atmosphere favorable to the defendants.' The District also had defective laws which made it impossible to tell what the law was, which forced the prosecution to accept conspiracy as the only charge that could be brought against the defendants.' The Montgomery Advertiser that a conspiracy must be proved against every one of the defendants or every one of them must be acquitted' since they were united by the indictments that it was impossible to separate the verdict. &lt;br /&gt;On August 17, Jeff Carpenter led the defense, particularly for the defendant Brady. He stated that fraud meant getting something out of the government without returning an equivalent in value.'  He argued that a good trade was not fraud, and that a man had the right to make the best bargain he could. Mr. Blias, however, argued on August 18 that there was a large discrepancy between stock annually employed upon the route and the number set out in the contractors' affidavit.' This had then benefited the contractors and was a great loss to the department. &lt;br /&gt;On September 4, the State argued that the trails were never intended for conviction;. Even should the jury find a verdict against them, they would not be punished. New trials would be asked and granted; or the appeals taken would lead to reversals of verdicts.'  Judge Wylie's charged, delivered on September 8, went heavily against the defense at every point, but the verdict satisfied no one, and two of the defendants were acquitted.

This letter, published at a midpoint in his imprisonment details the habits of Davis at Fort Monroe, and describes the ways in which he was already fast becoming a martyr for ex-Confederate Southerners.  Davis is portrayed in this letter as a pious and reflective man: Davis's main thoughts are religiously inclined ; [and] he is called upon by a number of clerical gentlemen, who share his unbounded confidence.'  The letter also expresses outrage at the delay of Davis's trial.  The anonymous author considers that the Secretary of War [must want] to kill his captive rather than let him be tried.'  As it turns out, Davis was released on bond and never brought to trial.  For many Southerners, Davis's prolonged imprisonment and delayed trial just served to further enshrine him as a martyr.  The letter communicates this sentiment: It makes no difference now what the government may do to this man, his fame is world-wide as a martyr ; Davis is a martyr to the lost cause.'' &lt;br /&gt;The lost cause' mentioned in the letter refers to a set of ideas (and a novel defending secession, The Lost Cause, by Edward S.

This enraged Maryland citizens who were at the heart of the matter.  They felt that this surrender of privileges of free men was unnecessary.  One reason for the suspension was due to John Merrymen.  He blew up a railroad bridge in Baltimore County in an attempt to immobilize Union troops.  His lawyer wished to move him from Fort McHenry where he was arrested by the military and whom then transferred him to civilian courts.  Military authorities would not grant the right to transfer based on habeas corpus because of the President's suspension of the writ.

He retrieved a weapon, and when one of the Abolitionists shot at Coleman, he shot the man dead.  Coleman gave himself up for trial, but, while he was gone, a mob of abolitionists drove Coleman's wife and children out of their home, setting fire to his property along with the homes of 15 other pro-slavery families in the area. This erupted into a larger conflict when the sheriff of Missouri arrested Lawrence, a friend of Dow's, on the charge of conspiring to retaliate against Coleman, as many of his comrades had already done by burning.

Their strategy was successful and the third Seminole War began on December 18th, 1855 when Seminole warriors attacked a small regiment that was vandalizing one of the native camps."],"display_date":"July 1, 1849 - July 30, 1849","search_date":"1849-07-15","locations":[{"id":1374,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"JACKSON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1399,"title":"Regulator Mob Burns RIchard Coleman\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-10-01","end_date":"1899-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The South was a region characterized by extreme violence following the civil war, much of which resulted from racial tensions.  The flagrant racism found throughout the south explains why the majority of murders were committed by white men against black victims.  However, many killings of blacks remained unreported as they often went unpunished.   All murder cases in which the victim was white were reported and the black murderer was more often than not put to death.  In 1885 a publisher  estimated over two hundred and twenty three murders occurred each year in Kentucky.  Violence towards blacks in the south was commonplace. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violence continued in Kentucky following the post-war periods.  Formal organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan initiated acts of violence in the years following the Civil War.  However, by 1890 Kentucky had become increasingly lawless and lesser organizations connected to the Ku Klux Klan carried out frequent acts of violence throughout Kentucky.  These groups were known as Regulators'.  They committed lawless acts under the justification that they were in fact doing their part for the preservation of justice in the white south.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In October, 1899 a civilian mob attacked the jail and demanded prisoner Richard Coleman.   Coleman, a cook for the Lashbrook's, confessed to the murder of Mrs. Lashbrook, whose father in law had represented Mason county in the third Constitutional Convention in 1850.  Her body was found on October 5, 1899 in a cabin on her husband's farm six miles outside of Mayesville.  On October 6, 1899 hundreds of people called for the hanging of Coleman and unsuccessfully attacked the jail at 2:00 a.m.  The following day, Mrs. Lashbrook's funeral was held and Coleman was sent to Covington for safety reasons.  Once the mob seized Richard Coleman, they burned him alive in front of hundreds of onlookers and publicly mutilated his corpse.  The African American Richard Coleman was an accused murderer. No punishment was imposed upon those who partook despite the fact that their identities were known."],"display_date":"October 1, 1899 - October 30, 1899","search_date":"1899-10-15","locations":[{"id":5127,"lat":38.5951990256,"lng":-83.8240569898,"zoom":10,"place":"MASON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1423,"title":"Kentucky Governor Election\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-12-01","end_date":"2/3/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William Goebel won the Democratic party's nomination in December, 1899 for Governor  of Kentucky.  In light of the fact that the Democratic party had previously been a Confederate dominated party, it was unusual for the Pennsylvanian to win the nomination.  His following was mainly composed of young democrats.  His campaign was extremely ambitious and well organized.  He stood for controlling corporations, aiding the laboring class, and was known as a friend to the common man' (p.269)  He was hated Republicans and a group of Democrats who formed the Honest Election League Party, also known as the Brown Democrats, when Goebel won the gubernatorial Democratic nomination.  In 1895 he killed one of his enemies,  a confederate democrat, in a duel in Covington, KY.  Before running for Governor he used his position in the State Senate to pass an act in 1898 which later became a law.  The act called for a Board of Election Commissioners, chosen largely by Goebel, that would decide the outcome of disputed state governor races.  Goebel's influence over these commissioners caused Republicans to react strongly.  In October, the Republican county chairman of London Depot, Kentucky notified Goebel election commissioners that they would be lynched if even one vote was stolen.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The election was too close to call between Republican candidate William S. Taylor and Democratic candidate William Goebel.   The Board of Election Commissioner declared Taylor governor and an investigating committee was assembled of ten Democrats and one Republican.  Republicans and Democrats threatened each other continuously as tensions rose at the state capital.  On January 30, 1900 Goebel was shot and mortally wounded outside the state capital.  Governor Taylor declared a state of insurrection' and demanded that the legislature reconvene in a safer location.  Democratic members of the legislature convened privately to discard enough votes to declare Goebel governor.  On January 31, 1900 Goebel was declared Governor of Kentucky.  His time in office only lasted until his death on February 3, 1900.  However in these three days he called for the dispersal of the militia and the reassembly of the legislature.  The Republicans refused to acknowledge the Constitutionality of  Democratic actions.  This conflict ended with each party stationing over one thousand armed men on the capital lawn.  Only after Goebel's death did tensions subside and the U.S. Supreme Court declared Goebel governor validating the actions of the democratic legislature.  Goebel's lieutenant governor, J.C.W. Beckham, took his place as Governor of Kentucky."],"display_date":"December 1, 1899 - February 3, 1900","search_date":"1900-01-02","locations":[{"id":4802,"lat":38.0422598094,"lng":-84.4586978215,"zoom":9,"place":"FAYETTE, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1426,"title":"Formation of the Ku Klux Klan\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-04-13","end_date":"1869-02-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 13, 1867 the Tennessee Conservatives held a convention in Gallatin. The convention had two speakers: the Honourable Bailey Peyton and an influential African American preacher. Reports on the convention stated that the preacher stood up, declared the present Republican Governor Brownlow a colored man in disguise, and encouraged the few African American present to vote for him. The proclamation resulted in a cheer from the few African-Americans in the crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The convention reflected the many failed attempts of Southern Conservatives and Democrats to attract the vote of the newly enfranchised black man. Instead, Tennessee blacks voted to ensure the political success of Governor Brownlow in the 1867 election. As a result April, 1867 saw that the first meeting of the Ku Klux Klan in Nashville, Tennessee. Democratic Party leaders, Conservative Unionists and ex-Confederates met with members of dispersed groups of men to form a centralized, united organization of the Ku-Klux Klan. It transformed the Ku-Klux Klan from a social club to the political and terrorist movement, which resorted to terror and intimidation to keep blacks away from the voting table, and to keep Republicans out of office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In April, 1867 the Ku Klux-Klan set up the administration of the organization, appointing General Forrest as their leader Grand Wizard of the Empire, and stressed the need for secrecy. In 1868, the Ku Klux-Klan developed a constitution including the aims to protect the innocent and the constitution of the United States. Over the next two years Ku-Klux Klan activity spread across West and Mid-Tennessee, and throughout the South. Despite two ineffective acts of legislation against the Ku-Klux Klan, it was not until February 25, 1869, with the resignation of Brownlow that the Ku-Klux Klan ceased its activity. General Forrest called for all the masks and costumes of the Ku-Klux Klan to be destroyed; believing that with the end of Brownlow's governorship the Klan had achieved its objectives."],"display_date":"April 13, 1867 - February 25, 1869","search_date":"1868-03-20","locations":[{"id":12485,"lat":36.1567844857,"lng":-86.2970579284,"zoom":9,"place":"WILSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1427,"title":"Lynching of Bob Harper\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-12-14","end_date":"1892-12-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 14, a black man assaulted Kate Anderson in her home in Park City, Kentucky.

Under this system, private businesses could lease convicts for a small fee.  Tennessee adopted this system as a way to deal with the rising prison population and to help relieve the burden of its state debt.  In 1884, the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company leased the state penitentiary.  The system caused many free laborers to lose their jobs and work for cheaper wages.  In addition, the conditions that the prisoners lived in were atrocious.  Much sickness, suffering, and starvation prevailed.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opposition to the convict lease system soon developed.

Conductor Rivers endeavoured to explain the rules of the company and that he had the right to forcibly remove them, yet the men did not move. Rivers called the police, but they also failed to remove the men.

The Trail, which was an overland trade route between St. Louis, Missouri, and Santa Fe, New Mexico, was critical to the growing economy of Missouri. It had resulted in a tremendous amount of trade through the mid-West, and had also spurred new industries such as wagon construction in Missouri. Indian attacks on caravans posed a major threat to the route, however, and threatened to disrupt it entirely. Senator Benton's bill therefore sought to secure federal protection for the area and had important implications in the development of US Western and Indian policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bill shows, as well, overarching national sentiments on Indians and the problems of state governments trying to assert their sovereignty over Indian territories. In The Globe, for example, a December 14, 1830, section entitled Missouri Politics includes an address by Missouri Governor Miller in which he states that the citizens of Missouri have already been greatly harassed by the depredations of Indians,' yet that the ground (the Indians) occupy is not attached to any county, and hence State officers cannot act in relation to the offences committed upon it.' The Governor goes on to declare the situation manifestly inconsistent with the sovereignty and policy of the State' and to call for the Federal government to ensure state sovereignty within their borders, including Indian territories within existing states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The situation in Missouri, in addition to representing a large threat to local stability and to the local economy, also represents a much larger movement in the United States of states demanding the right to sovereignty within their recognized borders. Eventually, this results in the Indian Removal Act enacted on May 28, 1830, which allows for the relocation of Indian tribes to unorganized territory west of the Mississippi River, and which inherently recognizes states' rights within their borders."],"display_date":"March 13, 1830","search_date":"1830-03-13","locations":[],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1461,"title":"Murder of Milton Seaton\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-11-25","end_date":"1899-11-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The prevalence of homicide in the south increased greatly in the second half of the nineteenth century.

The Baton Rouge Gazette reports on January 30, 1830, that on Saturday night last about 10 o'clock Mr. John Whitten was killed by one of his own slaves, by a discharge from a musket loaded with buckshot.' Events such as this, an actual murder by a slave were extremely rare in the slave South, and when they did occur were a shock to the community and caused a great deal of anxiety and often conspiracy theories about slave uprisings -- such as fear of events like what became known as Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. As to Gazette writes when we see such outrages committed by negroes of the country, what have we not to fear from the strange negroes who are introduced every day into the State of Louisiana?'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far more likely than the outright murder of his or her master was that a slave would simply run away, whether it be in an attempt to get to the North or just to a secluded local area. Southern newspapers, then, are littered with advertisements offering rewards for runaway slaves as well as notices of captured runaways and where they are being held. The Richmond Enquirer, for example, lists on April 16, 1830, on a single page three different rewards for runaways and three notices of a captured slave being held in the local jail. The Raleigh Regsiter, on March 25, 1830, includes an ad entitled Notice. Twenty Dollar Reward. Ran away from the subscriber on the 10th of February.' Interestingly, here the ad describes the runaway as a white slave,' referring to his skin tone, perhaps meaning he had a white parent or grandparent. All of these ads, however, list a brief description of the runaway as well as the name given by his or her master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, sometimes the unthinkable did occur and a slave struck back. The aftermath, however, is important because it is designed to establish a sense of justice in the eyes of white slave owners, and to reassure them about the continuity of a stable slave society.

The Mayor first informed the citizens of Annapolis on the by-law in an article published in the local paper, <em>The Maryland Gazette</em>, on March 25, 1824. The article permitted a week long period of time for news of the by-law to reach the people of Annapolis before the Common Council planned to implement it within the city limits. Under this by-law, any person found guilty of firing or discharging a gun within city limits except when performing military duty, shall be fined a sum no less than one or more than five dollars. In addition, this by-law declared that any person found guilty of carrying a gun uncovered through any of the streets, lanes or alley of this city shall be viable to a fine of one dollar."," In 1824, guns tended to be tools, luxury items, or broken relics. According to historian Jan E. Dizard, the people around Annapolis had to rely on blacksmiths to make repairs to their guns, since most areas lacked gunsmiths. Blacksmith most often had little knowledge of guns, and did not know how to make proper repairs. The overwhelming majority of guns tended to be poorly cared for, and passed from generation to generation."," The Annapolis by-law established that if any person offending against the provision of this by law shall be a slave and the owner or employer shall not elect to pay the penalty inflicted then another punishment will be in order, as long as it does not exceed thirty nine lashes or ten days imprisonment. Historian Dizard claims that in the nineteenth century, guns were mostly made of iron, and in order to prevent them from rusting they required constant attention. Thus, unless people of the Annapolis area had servants who constantly cared for their guns, they rarely brought a gun out with them. Any slaves within Annapolis city limits with possession of a fire-arm most likely had masters that put them in charge of caring for their guns. The Annapolis by-law presumably affected the relationship between slaves and their owners. With the implementation of the by-law, slave owners hesitated to entrust their slaves with care of their weapons. Slave owners feared that punishment of their slaves would have an effect on their own reputation among the people of Annapolis. No master wanted to be viewed as a man who could not keep his slaves under control. In addition, if a slave received thirty nine lashes or ten days imprisonment this slowed down the productive capacity of a slave owner's property.

The article informed the people of Easton that there is a gang of villains now in our borough, who are endeavoring to further a scheme of the most diabolical swindling, by putting into circulation Counterfeit Notes of 50 and 20 on the Union Bank of Maryland. ","Counterfeiters significantly threatened the efficient development of the American economy. For the merchants of Easton, failure to recognize counterfeit notes resulted in substantial financial losses. In terms of their customers, it meant the loss of one's reputation as a trustworthy vendor. Attempts made by Congress to create a sound currency clashed with the cherished belief held by many Americans that the federal government should have a limited role in the nation. According to historian David R. Johnson, the federal government reserved the right to coin money but neither institution that Congress created, the US Mint and the Bank of the United States, exerted much control over national development. "," Counterfeiters gained a tremendous advantage with the development and proliferation of state banks such as the Union Bank of Maryland. Due to the Mint's failure to produce enough coin for the rapidly expanding economy, Johnson claims that state banks began to compete with the Mint as a monetary source by issuing their own currency. State governments chartered privately owned banks, and granted them the right to issue currency backed by each bank's capital reserves. State Banks claimed that their bank notes did not violate the federal government's currency policy since the states neither directly issued these banks notes nor supported them with their credit. Counterfeiting became far easier with the increase of paper money in circulation. <em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> newspaper article stated, we look to our police, on this occasion, for such vigilance as may bring the whole of these wretches to justice. Counterfeiting threatened efficient development of the American economy, and failure to recognize counterfeit notes often resulted in significant financial losses. "," For southerners, the bank brought out their fears of an oppressive central authority, and the necessity for local control to protect liberty. Senator Nathaniel Macon in 1818 expressed the anxieties of southerners; I must ask you to examine the constitution of the U.S. ... and then tell me whether if Congress can establish banks, make roads and canals, whether they can free all the Slaves in the U.S. The rising numbers of counterfeiter bank notes in circulation became an increasingly greater problem associated with the banking system. The development of the American banking system created tensions between the North and South. According to historian William J. Cooper, opponents of banks in the South charged that the power of banks gave an unnatural privilege that imperiled both the independence of the community and the control individuals had over their own

the abduction of the boy from Mack Palmore even though the men who attacked him were unmasked."," The 1890s was one of the most violent decades in the history of the South.Interacial relations were very turbulent during this time and the slightest spark could ignite a bloody conflict.According to Edward Ayers, homicide rates in the South were higher than anywhere in the country.A man could buy a handgun known as the nigger-killer for three dollars.Whites were quick to shoot or lynch a black man.Often, mobs of whites would take black men from jail with the logic being that a legal execution would be too good.Unspeakable tortures of accused black criminals would often occur before a fair trial was given time to occur.Newspapers were hesitant to accuse townspeople of performing a lynching, instead focusing on the brutality of the crime committed by the murdered black man.Although lynching was not very common in Virginia compared to other states such as Kentucky and West Virginia, it was still a problem.In Richmond, lynching was rare because it had an established police force.However, the outskirts of Richmond were not as densely populated as the city."," By far the crimes that caused lynchings most often were crimes against white women.Assault and rape against black women sent white communities into a rage.The reason for such a strong reaction to these crimes was the belief that black men lusted after white women.The intensity of the reaction of whites towards these crimes caused blacks to teach young boys to avoid all contact with white women to prevent being falsely accused.The violence that occurred in the 1890s was an indicator that there were major problems regarding interracial relations.Even forty years after the abolition of slavery, there was still a long way to go before blacks and whites could live together without fear."],"display_date":"September 4,

cities, as technology and commerce lagged behind the rich Northern cities.Because of the lack of commerce and economic improvement, Richmond developed slums.Poor black families as well as struggling whites moved into the cities to find low wage jobs but there were very few positions to go around.Overcrowding caused areas of the city to become dirty and unsanitary.Edward Ayers described buildings in the city as having broken front doors that cannot be closed, revealing decaying floors, broken walls, stairways, and hallways reeking with dirt; chimneys tumbling, streets littered, everything in and about tending to degrade the human beings that call this section home.The sanitation of the city was also a mess.Indoor plumbing was a luxury that only the richest could afford.The streets wreaked of excrement from both humans and horses.This horrible way of life that many Richmonders experienced, coupled with the lack of jobs in the city, made crime a viable option for many."," As illustrated in Mr. Riggin's experience, most of the reported crimes in the newspapers described crimes committed by blacks against whites.Newspapers were extremely biased during the 1890s.The newspapers refer to all blacks as Negro's and their descriptions lead the reader to regard blacks as animalistic.The racist narration is repeated in the police logs day after day.However, crimes committed by whites

January 23, 1890, a small county newspaper printed in Lexington, Virginia published an article discussing the corruption of the election process with the memory of the prior year's November election fresh in the mind. The writer of the article was disgusted with the corruption of the election process, and was fed up with the continuing corruption. The congressional seats of important mining areas are described like commodities sold to the highest bidder. The paper describes the people as disenfranchised by the power of mineral kings, and that they had no more voice in the Senate than the people of England do in their House of Lords. The paper called for direct Senatorial election to eradicate the corruption that had so plagued the election process; it petitioned for the seventeenth amendment more than twenty years before it was passed by Congress."," The Democratic Party had a stranglehold on the South since the end of the Civil War. They used a variety of corrupt techniques to ensure their power in the South; bribery, ballot box stuffing, and even murder were common tactics used by the Democratic Party to push its agenda throughout the South. These problems were even stronger in Virginia, due to the high level of importance that the state held to the Democratic Party as a strongly populated and strongly influential state in the South. In fact, election fraud became such a problem that Virginia elections were challenged no less than sixteen times between the years of 1874 and 1900. The Democratic Party even appealed to the Southern white man's fear of the newly freed, enfranchised black American by calling Republican rule Negro rule. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, however, voters were becoming more and more disillusioned by the political process, and by the 1890's, the Democratic Party, so confident in the Solid South faced huge problems of voter apathy. Voter participation was around 40 percent in some areas as the South toward the end of the nineteenth century and in some years it even fell below that. People began to realize that they were almost absolutely disenfranchised from the political process because of the corruption that ran so rampant, and they began to ignore elections.

It was created in order to protect the farmers who were affected by particularly poor economic times in the late nineteenth century by helping push up the prices of their goods. Just prior to its fall, the Farmer's Alliance was viewed by some members of the Democratic Party as nothing more than somewhat of a nuisance. A small newspaper with strong Democratic leanings stationed in Lexington, Virginia, The Rockbridge County News described the great Alliance movement as, played out. They claimed that the Alliance failed because they lost sight of the reforms that were once the pillars of the movement. According to the article, they had lost sight of their goals of protecting themselves from monopoly and the encroachments of organized capital."," The paper also claimed that the movement had spread itself too thin and had broadened the topics of their grievances to encompass economics, social orders, political processes, and financial issues. This, according to the article was brought about by the new leaders of the movement, who were too liberal and too ambitious in their reforms. If only they had [made] their demands through the old political parties of the country If they had merely stayed small and specific, they may have experienced more success."," One can easily identify the outright bias the writer of this article has for the Democratic Party, and the hostility he likely feels toward the Farmer's Alliance. The Democrats of the age appeared to have cooperated with the Alliance when it emerged, but were clearly more interested in securing their southern votes than actually identifying with their grievances. Though Democrats such as the writer of this article may have disillusioned themselves into believing that the Alliance movement was not a threat, the Democrats' apathy toward the Alliances cause coupled with the Democrats' outright electoral corruption (the ballot-stuffing, the bribery, the assaults) forced the emergence of the Populist party, which occurred with the downfall of the Alliance, but changed the Democratic Party's political inner workings significantly. Thus, though the Democrats chose to ignore them, the Alliance posed as a serious threat to the stability of the Democratic Party in the White House and to a degree, in the South. The Farmer's Alliance and its eventual transformation into the Populist Party was significant not only because of Virginia's strong agricultural background, but also because of the Democrat's particular interest in Virginia as a very populous and influential Southern State."],"display_date":"March 3, 1892","search_date":"1892-03-03","locations":[{"id":14237,"lat":37.8135546685,"lng":-79.446551583,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1997,"title":"The 50 Dollar Reward for Harry the Runaway\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-12-12","end_date":"1846-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 12, 1846, Landon Harrison ran a wanted advertisement in The Nashville <em>Daily Union</em>. Months later, on Saturday, March 27, 1847, the Daily Union continued to run the advertisement. One of the slaves on Harrison?s plantation ran away, and Harrison entered a wanted ad in hopes of having him found and returned as soon as possible. In order to ensure the slaves safe return, master's like Harrison made thorough descriptions of their slaves in want ads. Historian Michael Mullin points out that whites identified ethnicity in three ways, appearance, patterns of scarification, and by dialect. In his wanted advertisement, Harrison described Harry as a young negro boy of around 18 years of age. Harry stood about five foot three inches tall with a black complexion. When he left Harrison's plantation he wore a mixed jeans frock coat, and a green blanket coat, and a palm leaf hat. Harrison believed that the boy traveled to the towns in which he had the closest relations: Gallatin and Lebanon."," The first line of Harrison's wanted advertisement stated the reward for the runaway in bold print. Landon Harrison offered 50 dollars reward for the return of Harry. He requested that if anyone found Harry, they needed to return him directly to the Nashville jail. From there, Landon Harrison would determine the reward by whether or not the capturer found Harry within the borders of the state. If captured within state lines, the reward stood at 25 dollars. If captured across state lines, the reward doubled to 50 dollars. Landon Harrison's reward was indicative of a slave's monetary worth. The further away an escaped slave managed to travel the less likely he is to be caught. Thus the monetary reward should be greater if someone captured Harry outside of the state. The slave master feared unoccupied, unsupervised slaves because of the cost they incurred when slaves escaped. Slaveholders knew the loss of investment that accompanied the loss of a slave."," Runaways who were returned to their owners received harsh punishment for attempting to escape. Michael Mullin gives one account of a master who bound, gagged, and left his slave to insects for running off. Sometimes, however, masters sold their runaways once someone found and returned them. Some masters did not want their other slaves to believe that they too could escape and get away with it. So instead, the master acted as though he made the decision to sell the slave in the first place. Slaveholders through out the South struggled in this same sense to maintain their power and threatening force over their slaves, who increasingly sought to experience freedom."],"display_date":"December 12, 1846","search_date":"1846-12-12","locations":[{"id":11952,"lat":36.1806707867,"lng":-86.8728574445,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2015,"title":"The Power of Scientific Racism in Central Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-11-27","end_date":"1888-11-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James Holladay, a farmer from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, felt relieved as he read Francis Ruffin's pamphlet entitled The Negro as a Political and Social Factor.  Holliday conveyed his gratitude in a letter to the author.  Holladay proclaimed, Your forcible presentation of facts, derived from a national experiment, and from extended intelligent and conscientious observation in different fields. . . is fitted to cement the union of those whose convictions of the unfitness of the negro, in capacity and character for the position to which he is hoisted, have rested mainly on circumscribed tho' it may be personal observation.  Francis Gildart Ruffin, a planter in Chesterfield County, Virginia, wrote several political papers based on scientific racism that were widely read and distributed.  Planters throughout Virginia and other southern states responded to Ruffin's writing with support and enthusiasm.  Scientific racism involved the use of observations or data to substantiate the claim that black people are socially, biologically, intellectually and culturally inferior to whites.  Proponents of scientific racism claimed that racial differences were a result of inherent genetic or biological qualities of the members of each race.  Central Virginians, like Holliday, placed importance on the use of systematic observations and facts to substantiate anecdotal evidence and validate their claims concerning the negro's inferiority.  Central Virginians who endorsed scientific racism at the end of the nineteenth century argued that the inferior attributes of negroes could not be overcome through social experiences.","Although Holladay directly articulated his support for scientific racism in his personal correspondence, other Central Virginians expressed scientific racism in more subtle ways.  In the Fredericksburg <em>Free Lance</em>, the reporter who wrote an article about an incompetent police officer, Policeman Brace, claimed, A little duck-legged colored girl out ran him so far in a chase that she was out of sight the first jump.  In order to make the policeman's lack of skill especially clear for the readership, the reporter chose the most extreme point of comparison, a young colored girl.  The concept of black biological inferiority was readily available in the minds of Central Virginians at the time.  Other newspaper articles attributed crimes committed by black men to their childlike mental deficits, such as one man's sweet tooth and another man's confidence in his good looks.  Central Virginians considered black perpetrators intellectually inferior, as their criminal intent stemmed from the mental defects of their race instead of a fully conscious, rational choice to commit crime.     ","According to George Fredrickson in <em>Racism</em>, scientific racism was a medium through which whites, like Holliday, from areas throughout the South justified denying black people full legal or social rights and status in the late nineteenth century.  Southerners thought that the northerners' support for black rights clearly contradicted southerners' arguments regarding the inability of blacks to successfully assume a higher position in the social and political order.  In the letter, Holladay expressed his anger as he claimed that northerners had abruptly placed [negroes] on a political equality with the intelligent and cultured white people who were recently their masters. Many southerners, such as Holliday, felt that northerners lacked the knowledge of the fallibility of the negro that southerners had developed through extensive experience with their slaves.  Yet, Fredrickson argues that northerners believed that African Americans were inferior, as well.  People from both the North and South had problems granting black people equal political and social rights in the late nineteenth century.

After discovering that Johnson had escaped, the staff of the asylum realized that they needed to act quickly.  An employee hurriedly wrote a note in order to inform the Sheriff of Louisa County of the incident before he had an opportunity to apprehend Johnson.  On February 16, 1881 the employee reported to the Sheriff, Mr. Johnson, a colored inmate from your county escaped from this asylum.  If he gives no trouble he will be allowed to remain at large. . .  The staff of the asylum did not want the Sheriff to return Mr. Johnson to the facility.  ","In Central Virginia during the late nineteenth century, judges and sheriffs decided the fate of those who the courts declared lunatics, such as Mr. Johnson. Judges customarily rendered decisions concerning a person's sanity.  On January 23, 1882 a court in Mr. Johnson's home county, Louisa, declared that William P. Anderson was a lunatic and ordered the Sheriff to transport Mr. Anderson to the lunatic asylum in Staunton, Virginia.  The judges noted in the next line of the court order that the Sheriff should instead take Mr. Anderson to the asylum in Williamsburg, Virginia.  Judges sent lunatics to one of the several nearby asylums in the state, such as the asylum in Richmond, Staunton, and Williamsburg.  Virginia asylums, such as the Central Lunatic Asylum where the Louisa judges sent Johnson, experienced problems with overcrowding in the 1880s and 1890s. Judges considered which facility could accommodate new patients when choosing where a lunatic should be sent.  ","During the latter half of the nineteenth century, an insanity judgment carried a different meaning for blacks, such as Mr. Johnson, and whites in Central Virginia.  Fredericksburg's paper,<em> Free Lance</em>, printed an article about a local colored man who was sent to the jail because the asylum in Virginia for colored lunatics was full at the time.  Thus, some asylums in Virginia were completely segregated.  Other facilities in Virginia took in both black and white patients.  Many asylums in the South segregated each ward by race, in order to prevent problems. The intermixing of black and white patients in asylums throughout Virginia and in other southern states led to racial tensions, which often escalated into verbal insults or physical assaults between inmates, according to Gerald Grob in <em>Mental Illness in American Society</em>.  Furthermore, Grob posits that white attendants often physically attacked black inmates who retaliated against their white aggressors.  To keep a colored inmate like Mr. Johnson outside of the facility would have helped to quell the racial tensions that spread throughout the asylums in Virginia and throughout the South at the time.","On account of the cruel treatment and violence against blacks that infiltrated the asylums of Virginia, Johnson had motivation to escape.  As Johnson escaped from the asylum, he also escaped the cruel and inhumane punishment reserved for lunatics in the asylums of the period. Confinement in an asylum in Virginia and throughout the South during this period was in many ways comparable to placement in the penitentiary.  The Fredericksburg judge decided to send the colored man to jail when the asylum was full, as a result of the similarities in the treatment received at asylums and prisons.  According to David Rothman, the wardens of the penitentiaries utilized brute force and cruel torture methods to impose order and command deference to authority.  The staff of the asylums also frequently utilized physical force or restraint devices on the inmates.  Superintendents of insane asylums developed procedures for the asylums that instilled a militaristic sense of order, restraint, and regularity.  Moreover, inmates had little to no contact with their families once admitted to an asylum.  The conditions in lunatic asylums throughout the South rendered inmates, like Johnson, ready to leave upon the first opportunity."],"display_date":"February 16, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-16","locations":[{"id":14014,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2020,"title":"Threat of Slave Rebellion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-07-24","end_date":"1841-07-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a letter to his father John C. Burruss on July 24, 1841, John W. Burruss asked, ...do we not dwell in constant danger, are we not standing, rather [lying] down - sleeping on a smothered - not extinguished - volcano? John W. Burruss was expressing his fear of slave revolt, a fear he shared with many southern plantation owners. In his letter Burruss described a discovered slave revolt in West Felicia Parish, Louisiana, not far from Burrus's own Mississippi plantation. An overseer had overheard slaves having a suspicious conversation in the fields. The slaves were whipped until they confessed to plotting an uprising and revealed the names of their co-conspirators. One of Burrus's slaves, Lewis Campbell, was accused of involvement in the conspiracy. Burrus seemed certain that Campbell was a key player in the development of the scheme. He assured his father that the proper authorities had taken Campbell and the other insurgents into custody."," Although the revolt was quashed, the community was left in a state of upheaval. After southern white citizens discovered news of the rebellion many immediately became aggressive, lashing out against their slaves, though not to the infliction of death. Burrus went on to note that the trial would take place in August. He remarked that though the turmoil surrounding this event would eventually calm, tensions would remain as plantation owners continued to feel the threat of revolution. Slavery had a strong presence throughout Mississippi, but it was particularly deep-rooted in the delta at this time. Whites had established plantations there long before the rest of the state. In territorial Mississippi, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, plantation owners viewed slavery as a necessary evil. Despite many restrictions on slaves, slave owners rarely enforced these strict regulations. However, attitudes toward slavery quickly began to shift. By the end of the 1830s, slavery was considered not only beneficial for the slaveholder, but also for the slave. The plantation system proved to be so profitable that plantation owners used any ideological means they could to justify slavery. In the 1830s the number of slaves in Mississippi grew exponentially. By 1840, there were more blacks than whites in the state. As attitudes toward slavery changed and the black population grew, slaveholders became increasingly frightened of revolt. "," A slave insurrection, such as the one John Burrus reported, not only threatened the lives of slave holders, but also their economic welfare and social power. The institution of slavery and the social system it created were essential to the wealth of the plantation owner. Southern whites had witnessed the violence against whites wrought by Nat Turner, a slave from Southampton, Virginia, in 1831. Other plots of revolt had also been discovered throughout the South. After these events slaveholders were continuously ready for slave rebellion. Knowing that he had everything to lose, Burrus surely feared that Lewis Campbell was another Nat Turner."],"display_date":"July 24, 1841","search_date":"1841-07-24","locations":[{"id":5781,"lat":31.0257853028,"lng":-91.6912544354,"zoom":9,"place":"WEST FELICIANA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2021,"title":"Mass Slave Runaway from McIntosh, GA Plantation","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Things were looking promising on Mr. Thomas' plantation, Peru, in 1850. He owned over 150 slaves and 15,000 acres, all of which produced great wealth in the form of cotton and other crops. Most of his slaves had been reared on his plantation alongside him and his son ten-year old son, Edward. Both father and son felt they were very good to their slaves and provided them with ample food, clothing, and housing. Their generosity was such that Master Thomas even allowed many of his slaves to own guns, boats, horses, and to raise their own crops to sell to others. The Thomas' felt they treated their slaves in a fatherly fashion and called them our people, feeling that the relations between master and slave could not have been better anywhere. Both masters and slaves even went to the same church on Sundays, although the enslaved people had to sit in the back and take Communion last. Young Master Edward felt particular kinship with some of the slaves, as he played with them and requested barbeques on the plantation that everyone enjoyed. In the eyes of the Thomas family, life could not have been better for everyone on the plantation during the planting time of 1850. ","However, this content feeling disappeared when the largest slave runaway in young Edward's memory occurred just before the crop planting of 1850. Immense amounts of cotton were due to be planted, and it was a time when the most hardworking slaves were needed. At this crucial time eight or ten of Mr. Thomas' best slaves ran away, along with several other slaves from neighboring plantations, numbering fifty or sixty in all. The whites in the neighborhood were very angry at the fact that the runaways fled to the woods and outlying areas, and were surviving by stealing crops and cattle at night. Mr. Thomas and Edward were most distressed because in addition to ruining the slave-crop ratio needed for the planting, when the slaves left they felt as if fifteen thousand dollars had taken wings to itself and gone. The neighborhood did not see the runaways as men trying to obtain their rightful freedom, but as outlaws and menaces that had to be caught. The neighbors searched on horseback and with hunting dogs, and actually saw the runaways steal a boat and flee further into the woods but could not stop them. After that, nothing more was heard of the runaways until the first of December. That night, they came back to the plantation, sought out young Edward, and told him to tell Master that they were come in here. Master Thomas did not proceed to beat them but instead said he wished them to hell and later hired them out to a railroad contractor for the rest of the winter.","The runaway from Peru Plantation was in no way an unprecedented event for Southern slave owners, and runaways occurred for various reasons across the South. The living conditions of Southern slaves varied. Many were driven from sunrise to sunset, beaten constantly, had little food and terrible housing, and were given virtually no free time. However, despite the harshness of the institution of slavery, some masters were more lenient. Many told themselves they had to be good to their slaves because they were obligated to watch out for them and care for them in a fatherly manner. Many owners in Georgia also gave their slaves rations of meat, instead of just meal and corn. Some, like Mr. Thomas, allowed the slaves free time, which many used to tend gardens and sell their crops, as the slaves on Peru plantation did. Many masters, such as Mr. Thomas did not require their slaves to work on the Sabbath. However, even when slaves were given some leniency, as they were on the Peru Plantation, their masters were foolish to believe that their slaves were satisfied and placated by their master's paternalism and provisions. ","One of the biggest outlets for slaves to express their dissatisfaction was to run away. When they hid out like the Peru slaves, and as many others did across the South, it hurt their masters monetarily and unsettled the white community. It reminded them that their slaves were not satisfied, even if it did not totally ruin their delusion of being good masters. Slaves that fled, often raided crops and joined with slaves from other plantations when running away. These characteristics of the McIntosh runaways were not unique. Another common factor in slave runaways is that the slaves often only left for a short amount of time and sometimes returned of their own accord as did Mr. Thomas' slaves. It was hard for slaves as far south as Georgia to make it all the way to a free state and it was also hard for them to hide in a community where people would recognize them. Often they returned to their masters' plantations and the most common form of punishment was either being beaten or sold. Mr. Thomas did this on a lesser scale by hiring them out for a season. However Mr. Thomas felt, it can be assumed he was surprised by the slaves running away since he thought they had such wonderful conditions and relations, but this was what most slaveholders across the South believed. The nature of the McIntosh runaway was typical and shared many trends with other slave runaways in the South."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":2023,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MC INTOSH, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2023,"title":"Slave Family Gets Smuggled to John Clark&#39;s Trader&#39;s Yard\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-01","end_date":"1863-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1861, it was illegal for Missourian traders to sell slaves to slaveholders in a different state. That did not prevent Captain Tirrell from taking Mattie Jackson, her brother, and her sister away from their mother and putting them onto a boat headed to Memphis. However, before the boat left St. Louis, Union policemen stopped the boat and returned the young slaves to their master. The Union policemen took no further action. Mattie recalled, Their power was limited to the suppression of the selling of slaves that go out of the city. Then two years later, seven men, four watchmen, and three traders, forced themselves into her home and put her family into a closed carriage. This carriage took them to a dilapidated prison where they spent the night. Mattie recalled that, [the] kidnapping had been in contemplation from the time [they] were before taken and returned. The family was transferred from one train car to another, until they finally arrived in Louisville where they were held at John Clark's trader's yard. The family was sold out separately, except [her] mother and little brother, who were sold together. Mattie recalled that her mother and brother spent two weeks in the trader's yard, her sister six weeks, and herself four.","Mattie's family was enslaved in Missouri at the beginning of the Civil War. Missouri was considered a border state and ultimately remained a member of the Union. Historian Ira Berlin argues that President Lincoln promised to respect the property rights of slaveholders in border states in order to keep them in the Union. Thus, slavery remained legal in Missouri. As Mattie knew however, interstate slave trading was outlawed. Despite violating the law, Captain Tirrell smuggled Mattie and her family out of the state and sold them in Louisville. Many other slaves experienced similar incidents. Mattie noted considerable smuggling was done. Although Union soldiers protected some slaves from being sold to areas outside of Missouri, slave owners and traders who [pretended] Unionism successfully smuggled slaves out of the state. ","The Union soldiers were not the only people Captain Tirrell fooled while smuggling his slaves out of Missouri. Mattie stated that Captain Tirrell tricked and deceived her family before he forced them to the trader's yard. She recalled that Captain Tirrell's kindness, generosity, and approbation to the contemplated marriage was only a trap. Such lies and trickery were common among slave owners in the South. Historian Walter Johnson argues, Many sellers resorted to ingratiation, deceit, and coercion. Slaveholders told their slaves that they would not be traded and then sold those same slaves weeks - or even days - later. Other slave owners tricked their slaves into thinking they were going to attend an event, such as a party, at another plantation. Once the slaves got into the wagon, they were brought directly to slave traders.","Trickery and lies were just the beginning to Mattie's horrible experience. Mattie described how her family spent considerable time in John Clark's trader's yard before being sold to their new masters. Mattie recalled that her mother and brother spent two weeks in the trader's yard, her sister six, and she spent four weeks in the yard for four weeks before being sold.

A letter from Governor Reeder of the Kansas territory, printed January 4, 1855, condemned the first election in the district for a delegate to Congress. Reeder stated that the majority of the people at the election meeting were not citizens of Kansas, but rather Missourians. These people rushed into the new territory only to return to their homes later that evening. Angry that Kansans were not making the decisions for the territory, he argued that the law guaranteed them the right to manage their own affairs. In a different article, a writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>was quoted as saying, If the thing [was] to be repeated, however, at every election in Kansas, it [would] ultimately lead to bloodshed. He went on to suggest that the Missourians were organized in separate parties...[each] designed to operate at specified locations. Members of such parties stood by the ballot box, asked to see people's ballots, and intimidated any person who did not support slavery."," Governor Reeder estimated that on that day anywhere from 200 to 400 Missourians came by ferry and horseback to vote in Kansas. Missourians reacted in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Under this act, popular sovereignty decided the issue of slavery in new territories. This meant newly forming states in the West had the right to vote whether they would be a slave state or free state. Reeder acknowledged his frustration that the people who lived in Kansas were not the ones who ultimately made the decisions. Historian David Potter states any resident could vote, however recently he arrived. Reeder recalled one man whose only attempt at a residence in Kansas [consisted] of a card nailed to a tree upon ground long since occupied by other settlers. "," Both Reeder and the writer of the letter to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> stated that the Missourians who invaded the new territory supported slavery. Historian John B. Boles suggests there were as many as 5,000 fraudulent votes from border ruffians who wanted to ensure a pro-slavery candidate would be elected. The writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> stated that an extensive scheme [was] on foot to make Kansas a slave state. Historian Clayton E. Jewett's argues that southerners used the annexation of western territories as a means of spreading slavery and gaining pro-slavery support in Congress. "," Tension mounted between the North and South as both sides struggled to control the future of slavery in new territories. Historian David Potter argues, Such friction was not unusual in frontier situations, and it often led to controversy, lawlessness, and violence. The writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> mentioned that the proslavery Missourians threatened and intimidated the judges, violently drove off all those who were suspected of being in favor of any other candidate than their own, and pointed revolvers as some cast their vote.

In a letter to his sister on February 13, 1865, he discussed the problem the Confederate Army had with absentees and deserters at the beginning of 1865. In an attempt to coax these soldiers back into the army, James stated that General Lee [issued] a general order granting amnesty to all who will within twenty days from the publication of said order report to their commands... The Confederacy had offered amnesty to deserters before, but James stressed this was their last opportunity to avoid the punishment which they deserve. Even though James stated these soldiers left when the army and the people were depressed in spirits, he also blamed women and the allurements of home, as reasons why soldiers left their post. While James placed part of the blame on women, he also added women of the confederacy [had] the power, if they [had] the will and determination, to save the country. It was the women's role to lead the Confederate soldiers away from the pleasantries of grand balls and home life. If they [did] this, James argued, 1865 [would] be the last year of the war."," Charles James kept his sister informed of the state of the Confederate army while he was in Virginia. These letters were the only way that his sister could follow the fighting. According to historian Edwin C. McReynolds, the fighting had ended in Missouri in November 1864. In his February 13, 1865 letter, James clearly stated the role Virginia women should have played during the Civil War. It was their duty, he argued, to put pressure on Confederate soldiers to resist the temptation to remain in their home. Historian George Rable claims, Women had to shame these cowards into doing their duty. James's sister would have been surprised to hear the extent Confederate women contributed to the war. Women in Missouri played a much larger role in fighting for the Confederacy than in Virginia. In his essay Women and Guerrilla Warfare, historian Michael Fellmen argues that Missouri saw the most intense guerilla fighting of the war. Women played an active part in this warfare, both as participants and as victims. They made both verbal and physical attacks against Union soldiers. "," Charles James said women had the opportunity to prove themselves equal during the Civil War. While James implied that this would happen if women focused on preventing deserters, women expanded their role in other areas as well. Historians Eric Foner and Olivia Mahoney claim that while the men were off fighting the war, women played a larger role in managing the plantation, slaves, and participated in other professions previously limited to men. Because there were great casualties for both sides during the war, these women were often forced to continue these new roles at the conclusion of the war. Historian Anne Firor Scott argues that the experience women gained during the Civil War opened doors for women who put their newly acquired skills to good use. James predicted 1865 [would] be the last year of the war.

The soldiers had heard rumors of the great wealth of Georgia cotton planters. Now, with a freedman guide leading them to the house of Robert Paul where the ex-slave insisted they would find 15,000 in gold and silver, the soldiers hoped to seize a piece of that fortune for themselves.","The plan quickly fell apart. Arriving at the house, the soldiers took Mr. Paul captive and searched the place, discovering only their guide's disappearance into the night. Upset, the soldiers took what animals and possessions they could and set off down the road. Mr. Paul called on this neighbors and community. Soon, people gathered to the number of twelve or fourteen...among them many of the most respectable citizens of the county. This posse set off after the thieves, and while the soldiers had a considerable lead, they had no knowledge of the terrain. When the townsfolk caught up to the criminals, the soldiers opened fire, receiving a volley in kind from the assembled citizens. The soldiers ran, but did not make it far. One fell dead from his horse. The others, wounded and staggering, abandoned their horses and escaped into the nearby marshes. Paul recovered his property, excepting one bullet-ridden mare. The townsfolk reported the matter to the military government the next morning, who passed the investigation down the chain of command and eventually simply accepted the townsfolks' version of the events. The lieutenant in charge issued orders to commands around the city to arrest the escaped soldiers and to send someone from each command to identify the dead man.","     The military government's leniency in the matter differs greatly from the harsh, authoritarian rule of occupation armies in other parts of the South. Perhaps the military presence in and around Macon was too small to enforce order and welcomed the aid of civilians. Regardless, in the unrest and turbulence that followed immediately after the war, the occupation government in Twiggs County seems to have been remarkably willing to work with the local community, even to the extent of accepting dead soldiers. ","     In the immediate wake of being robbed, Mr. Paul did not seek the military government's aid in arresting its wayward soldiers. Rather, he resorted to a very common solution to crime and unrest in the 19th-century South - collective, vigilante justice. Despite the criminals' head start, the citizens of Twiggs County were able to spread the word, arm, organize, and catch up in only a few hours' time. This sort of call-to-arms, then, must not have been terribly rare. Indeed, even the most respected citizens of the county took part in the excursion - it seems that joining such a group was an honorable decision. Vigilantism, arguably native to America, was certainly engrained into this quiet Southern county. Long before lynching was synonymous with racial violence, communities in the Reconstruction South used collective violence to battle disturbances to the peace."],"display_date":"July 9, 1865","search_date":"1865-07-09","locations":[{"id":2289,"lat":32.670645545,"lng":-83.4297608837,"zoom":9,"place":"TWIGGS, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2039,"title":"Bold Burglary Blamed on Blacks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-07-14","end_date":"1868-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of July 9, 1868, the bustling town of Milledgeville, capitol of Georgia, witnessed a daring burglary.

Dragging the safe (so-called) from the backroom into the common area, the burglars forced it open, stole 500, and left without any real identification.","Police, combing the scene, had few real leads.

The exploits of these Northern armies quickly became propaganda for Southern newspapers. The Milledgeville, Georgia Southern Recorder, hearing of the Union capture of Barnwell, South Carolina, reprinted a sensational letter from its correspondent, The Constitutionalist. The article, full of rhetoric and exaggeration, recounts Union troops bursting into homes, where the privacy of ladies apartments...was not respected while searching for gold and valuables. After stealing everything worth taking, the troops spoiled the remaining food, assisted throughout by the faithlessness of negroes. The Recorder quotes the men as saying, We cannot whip your men and are determined to make the women and children suffer. After burning much of the town to the ground, General Kilpatrick arrived and put a stop to the attack, though the Recorder's letter insists that he gave secret orders to burn the town after dark.","Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas focused on destroying infrastructure and demoralizing Confederate troops. With most of the Southern armies in Tennessee and Virginia, Sherman faced few troops until near the end of the march. In the meantime, he burned and pillaged his way through the heart of the South, focusing special attention on South Carolina, first to secede and thus a potent symbol. Before General Sherman began his march through South Carolina, he received a telegram from Chief of Staff Halleck noting that he hoped that upon Charleston, South Carolina's fall, by some accident the place may be destroyed, and if a little salt should be sown upon its site it may prevent the growth of future crops of nullification and secession. Barnwell was not a particularly important county for the war effort, lacking major cities, fantastic wealth or even a particularly large population. It, like much of South Carolina, was burned as an example to the South as a whole.","     Historians have long debated the role that public morale played in the conclusion of the Civil War. Through articles such as the Constitutionalist's, the Confederate press attempted to turn Sherman's efforts at demoralization into public resolve to continue fighting. The Confederate government, through limited censorship and influence, used the press throughout the war as a tool for propping up continually-declining public morale. The letter reprinted in the Southern Recorder has the subtlety of a lead brick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of the Confederate press' efforts at morale-building were ultimately unsuccessful. While the importance of public morale in ending the war remains open for debate, this loss of popular confidence was certainly a serious problem for the South by 1865."],"display_date":"March 1, 1865 - March 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-03-15","locations":[{"id":11438,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2054,"title":"Battle for the Chesapeake Oysters\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-12-06","end_date":"1883-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Lieutenant Dryden was furious. The Award of 1877, which defined the boundary between Virginia and Maryland through the Chesapeake Bay, was bad enough. It ceded many of the most bountiful beds in the Pocomoke Sound to the dredgers of Virginia, but the Virginians refused to respect even those boundaries. Dryden and his fellow watermen decided to respond with force. For three weeks, his men riddled Virginia poachers with rifle fire. However, when Dryden and his men renewed their tonging, they found that only trashy-looking oysters remained. The Virginians had licked the bar with their destructive dredging practices. In revenge, Dryden and the other oystermen raided the Virginia beds. The Tangier, a Virginia police schooner, attacked them, and chased the tongers back to Smith Island. There, Dryden and the Maryland oystermen fired over 500 rounds on the Virginia police. The captain of the Tangier, A. J. Read, returned fire with his cannon. The Smith Islanders threw up barricades on the island, and dared Read to try to beach his craft. The Captain was unwilling to storm the beach, though, and the Tangier retreated back to the other side of the line.","Southern states increasingly regulated and defended their economic interests in the years after the Civil War. The War devastated the economies of many parts of the South, and these states sought to recover stability and growth through an active role in economic affairs. Maryland and Virginia fought over their boundary line through the Chesapeake Bay because each had economic interests in the Bay's valuable oyster fields. After a complex survey, the Award of 1877 settled the issue. Oystermen were notorious for not respecting the boundaries: many dredgers trawled at night in boats painted black with mud-covered sails. In response, each state created police forces to secure the boundary and the oysters. Open gunfire between the police boats and the oystermen was common throughout the 1870s and 1880s.","The police vessels also tried to limit the more destructive oyster industry practices, such as dredging. Many reports in the Baltimore Sun detail cases involving dredgers exceeding their tonnage limit without the proper license. The police forces regulated dredging because Virginians and Marylanders increasingly saw the oysters as an economic asset belonging to the state. A Marylander named Howard Hamans proposed leasing the bay bottom to dredgers instead of letting them take what they pleased. The money from this plan could be used to fund state projects like road construction. Hamans believed that dredgers squandered a precious natural resources belonging to the citizens of Maryland.

Crews received one third of the gross income, with the other two thirds going to boat maintenance and to the captain. Bradshaw helped push a windlass that scraped the bottom of the bay. According to those in the trade, it was like pulling in anchor while the boat was sailing. His shabby clothes froze to his body out in the frigid ocean surf. Bradshaw knew men who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. Others were plagued with oyster hand, an infection that developed if one cut one one's hands while culling oysters.","Crisfield was an oysterman town, and to the town the oystermen bought prosperity as well as debauchery.

While Bradshaw's religious faith was dear to him, the dangers and tension of the oyster season caused him to lapse into drinking. Bradshaw chose Burgess's Saloon, which featured a boxing ring for the customers' enjoyment. Bradshaw wasn't planning on fighting, but then he saw a Virginia waterman who had insulted him earlier, saying, Hey, ain't you one o' them dumb Smith Islanders? In a second they were in the ring. Bradshaw clocked him and the drunken crowd cheered raucously. When the Virginian's friends came to his aid, Bradshaw bloodied them too, one after the other.

In each, the living conditions could be atrocious, with poor clothing, poor quarters, and poor food. In each, the work could only be done by forced labor provided by traders. For the oyster industry, the crimps in Baltimore were responsible for delivering the men to the captains, who paid them off for their services and then kept the men at sea for as long as they could. Slaves were usually not paid for their work, and oystermen were sometimes only paid off with the boom: knocked overboard into the freezing waters by the captain at the end of a voyage. Many laborers, such as Bradshaw, looked to alcohol to cope with the dangers. Tough labor conditions were found throughout the South and in many other forms than those in the oyster industry.

The majority of the court petitions in Marion County and throughout eastern Florida consisted of requests to divide, rather than to consolidate, ownership of slaves amongst kin or to sell the slaves at public auction. More often than not, economic interests drove masters' decisions and led to the dehumanization of slaves. The Florida slave was often separated temporarily, and sometimes permanently, from those he or she loved. The abnormality of Willis trial shows that there were probably fewer hard plantations and mean slave drivers in Eastern Florida than there were in Mississippi, Alabama, and in other places where the plantations were great in number and size."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":1420,"lat":29.0561754463,"lng":-82.0448605922,"zoom":8,"place":"MARION, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2107,"title":"The Burning of the Andersons\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-10-09","end_date":"1877-10-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Hal Anderson lost everything on October 9, 1877. Ander son's house in Braden's Station, Tennessee, just outside of Memphis, was burned, and three of his children perished in the flames and a fourth was so badly burned that is life is despaired of. The news bulletin about the story in the Jackson, Mississippi Weekly Clarion was cryptically brief. The parents had left the children alone in the house, it ended, but there may very well might be more to the story. There was no explanation for why the children had been left alone, nor any reference to the cause of the fire. A clue might lay in the following fact: Hal Anderson of Braden's Station, Tennessee was a black man."," Read in this context, the burning of the home and children of Hal Anderson might have been another example of the sort of violence that exploded in the South in the decades immediately after the Civil War, a milieu that Ed Ayers describes as the turbulent South of the 1880s and early 1890s, when politics and economic turmoil constantly threw people into conflict. Suspicion between newly freed blacks and their former slaveholders- or, more often, between former slaveholders and transient strange niggers, as they were called- meant that racial tensions were always running high. Newspapers featured daily stories about blacks committing one crime or another, and prisons filled across the South with black men accused of all kinds of grievous misdeeds. A sense of vigilante justice, coupled with a deep fear of what blacks might do out of vengeance for a more than century of dehumanizing oppression, lead to brutal lynchings of black criminals in Southern prisons. "," While black drifters without roots in a town proved the easiest target for such violence, the constant threat of reactionary whites affected all blacks, especially in areas like the Mississippi cotton uplands and the mountains of Appalachia, where the impersonal and transient nature of work in lumber camps and large plantations prevented the establishment of roots or interconnectedness among black and white workers and families, even among those who had lived in the region for years. Ayers characterizes this inescapable fear, noting that it was a poisoned atmosphere, one that permeated life far beyond those counties where a lynching had actually taken place, one that pervaded all the dealings each race had with the other. Intimidation and terror colored life for most Southern blacks, and the burning of Hal Anderson's family and property- made suspicious by lack of detail or explanation- might have been no exception.","Episode Date: October 9, 1877"],"display_date":"October 9, 1877","search_date":"1877-10-09","locations":[{"id":12371,"lat":35.182488505,"lng":-89.8964012565,"zoom":9,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2125,"title":"Runaway Slave Advertisement in Richmond, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-09","end_date":"1835-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Walk down the streets of any major city in America today and it is hard to miss the fliers. Leaflets advertising a lost dog or runaway cat grace lampposts and telephone poles on every street corner, many including descriptions, names, and last known whereabouts of beloved family pets. Like modern neighbors across America, slave owners in antebellum Richmond, Virginia advertised for the return of their lost property as well. Only in these cases, that property was a human.","A typical runaway notice appeared in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser in January, 1835 describing a fugitive slave named Billy and where he could be returned to if found. The advertisement included a reward (20), and a physical description. At the time of his escape, Billy was about twenty years old, stood six feet high, and was a skinny boy with a dark complexion. He also spoke with a slight stammer and had a scar near the corner of his right eye from a horse's kick that had barely missed blinding him. Billy's angry owner, Eliza S. Perkins, listed every one of these characteristics in her runaway notice and demanded that her slave be returned to her son in Richmond, or at least committed to jail. Ms. Perkins even speculated on where her fugitive might hide, explaining that Billy might be, lurking about Rocketts, in the city of Richmond, or in the town of Petersburg with the hope of leaving the Commonwealth, as his father is a sailor on some sea vessel which frequents those ports...Masters of vessels, she warned, are cautioned against receiving said boy on board.","Even though slaves of all types ran for freedom in antebellum Virginia, historians have found that 80 to 90 percent of runaways were male. Like Billy, most of these fugitives were young, single men in their twenties. The majority of these escapees made a run for it in the summer months. Ms. Perkins' advertisement made it clear that Billy had, left the plantation of my late husband in the month of July last. After the initial escape, fugitive slaves had to elude local informants, slave patrols, and bounty hunters. The Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser was hardly unusual in publishing notices of runaways like Billy. Newspapers all over the South ran advertisements for the capture and return of fugitive property. If, and when, these runaways were found, every city in the South also had jails in which to hold slaves until their owners arrived to reclaim them."],"display_date":"January 9, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-09","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2139,"title":"The Tragedy of Slave Trade\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-09-01","end_date":"1852-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It was a grave tragedy. An enslaved African American woman of Polk County, Tennessee put an end to the lives of her children and then took her own life one September night in 1852. Authorities confirmed that the woman killed all four of her children by slitting their throats while they slept. After the gruesome deed had been carried out, she too ended her life in the same manner. When questioned about the possible basis for the woman's actions, the slave's master, George M. Garrison, alluded to the possibility that the woman may have overheard him discussing the potential sale of herself and two of her children while keeping the others in his possession. Beyond this, the owner could think of no other impetus for such an act.","Only the woman ever knew for certain the rationale which drove her to take her own life and the lives of her four children. The insinuation of her master, however, that the slave woman had knowledge of his intent to break apart her family, offers valuable insight. When viewed from this vantage point, it appears that for this mother, the possibility of a life without all of her children was just too much for her to bear. It is probable that after overhearing her master's plans to divide her family, the woman decided that ending the lives of her entire family would be less painful than separation. Based upon this speculation, it can be inferred that this heart wrenching act was committed out of desperation. ","This incident underscores the adverse impacts that the slave trade had on the African American family. The breaking up of families was not at all uncommon in the Antebellum South. Husbands and wives, parents and children were all constantly faced with the threat of separation. In his book <em>Soul by Soul</em>, historian Walter Johnson claims that 50 percent of interstate slave trades tore apart nuclear families and therefore, the strength of family ties was never certain. Through examples similar to the episode above, Johnson argues that self destruction or the threat of self destruction was a common method utilized to avoid trade. According to Johnson, these instances portrayed the dark side of slave trade and served as a foundation for its opposition. In effect, this tragic account along with many others brought to light the horrors of slavery. In the bigger picture this increased awareness spawned anti-slavery reactions and eventually influenced the American abolitionist movement."],"display_date":"September 1852","search_date":"1852-09-15","locations":[{"id":12302,"lat":35.1199101303,"lng":-84.5233135097,"zoom":10,"place":"POLK, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2151,"title":"The Duel\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-02-24","end_date":"1838-03-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William Graves and Jonathan Cilley were men of honor. Both were members of the twenty-fifth congress of the U.S. House of Representatives. Graves represented Kentucky, while Cilley was from Maine. The two men certainly were not enemies, so the nation was shocked when Graves killed his fellow congressman. The conflict arose when Graves delivered a letter to Cilley from Col. James Watson Webb, a newspaper editor. Cilley refused the letter and made disparaging remarks about Webb's character. Graves objected to Cilley's comments. He declared that he would never deliver the note of a man who is not a man of honor, and not a gentleman. "," In the early nineteenth century, honor was essential to privileged men, particularly in the South. An honorable man possessed all of the characteristics needed to be a great leader. An understood code guided the daily conduct of men who considered themselves gentlemen. This system also set elite men apart in a nation centered around egalitarian values. An attack on a man's honor was not only an enormous insult, but could also be ruinous for a political career. Graves took personal offense to Cilley's ridicule of Col. Webb. To defend his honor, Graves challenged Cilley to a duel. On February 24, 1838 the two men met at Bladenburg, Maryland. They loaded their rifles, assumed their individual positions and proceeded to each fire one shot at the other. Both men missed. Cilley asserted that by refusing the letter he meant no disrespect to Graves. He simply did not want to correspond with Col. Webb. Graves would not accept this explanation. The men resumed their positions and fired again. Again, both men missed. At this point the duel should have ended. However, Graves' second, Henry A. Wise, convinced the men to fire another round. After the third shot Cilley fell to the ground. He was dead. "," The <em>Vicksburg Register</em> gave a detailed account of the event on March 16, 1838. The newspaper claimed to make every attempt to give an unbiased depiction of the duel, providing both sides' versions of the story. Politicians often used articles such as this one to emphasize their impartiality. However, they undeniably used newspapers to influence their constituents. Historian Joanne B. Freeman notes, When a duel was particularly controversial - when a duelist died or a chief was involved - politicians capitalized on widespread public interest with contending newspaper accounts, both sides attempting to win public approval while dishonoring their foes. The reputation of a politician involved in a duel often depended less on the duel itself and more on the media hype surrounding the event. The mild account of the Graves-Cilley duel in the <em>Register</em> depicted Graves and Wise as honorable men. Perhaps the <em>Vicksburg Register</em> supported Graves and Wise, or perhaps the article simply reflected the popularity of dueling in the South. The <em>Register</em> portrayed the duel as a respectable affair, but Cilley's death stunned the rest of the nation. According to historian Robert V. Remini many Americans viewed the duel as a barbaric slaughter. Americans considered Cilley's death a murder, and Congress soon passed legislation prohibiting dueling in the capital."],"display_date":"February 24, 1838 - March 16, 1838","search_date":"1838-03-05","locations":[{"id":7310,"lat":32.3603831169,"lng":-90.865936974,"zoom":9,"place":"WARREN, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2161,"title":"Elick&#39;s Escape Plan\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-03-11","end_date":"1860-03-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Alden Spooner Forbes, a planter and merchant in Port Gibson, Claiborne County, Mississippi, wrote in his diary on March 11, 1860, that this was the night that he first discovered his slave Elick's plan of running away. He realized Elick's plan when he could not find him at night and immediately, the following day, March 12, put Elick in jail for safekeeping and to ensure he could not escape. Two days after this, on March 14, Forbes gave Elick a severe whipping in hopes of finding out all of the details about his plan of running away, but was only able to confirm that the slave did truly intend on escaping. Placing Elick in jail again on March 15 after another unsuccessful attempt at literally beating the information out of him, Forbes released him on March 21, only to send Elick away on an errand, fearing the whole time that he would attempt to run to freedom at any moment."," Whether or not Elick did eventually run away is unknown, but his plan to escape was not unique. Many slaves entertained the idea of running away to the North, prompted by news about freedom for blacks from northern abolitionists that was creeping into southern territory. The southern belief that the Republican Party was out to destroy slavery caused animosity towards the North and during the year before the start of the Civil War in April 1861, tensions reached an all time high between the northern and southern states. The controversial election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted southerners to begin considering the idea of succession much more seriously. The northern abolitionist's rhetoric of freeing the enslaved African Americans did nothing to please white southerners like Alden Spooner Forbes who depended on the labor of enslaved people to earn a livelihood. The thought that this very same rhetoric of equality and freedom was reaching the ears of their laborers intensified the white southern secessionists' hostility towards the northern abolitionists. The fear of new ideas of freedom formulating in their slaves' minds provoked many, like Forbes, to be especially harsh on their laborers in an attempt to keep them from trying to escape."," Mississippi did indeed secede from the Union on January 9, 1861. People like Forbes who depended on the labor of slaves drove this secession because they could not imagine a world without slavery, like the one they thought northern Republicans would try to create. The thought that slaves would internalize the ideas of the abolitionists regarding their freedom from bondage frightened those who depended on their labor. It was this fear that prompted many of them, in Mississippi and the rest of the South, to use cruel methods, such as whipping, to try and convince them that life as an enslaved laborer was the only life for them.

The policeman said he would take them to the local jail where they could sleep, and then release them the next morning. Instead, the three men were detained for six days and made to dig post holes around the jail. After they were finally released, they complained to the mayor and he responded to them that they were lucky they were not sent to the state penitentiary. The Assistant Commissioner for the State of Mississippi, Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands made an entry to the record regarding this incident, and also when he called upon the mayor about the situation. The mayor claimed it was common practice to arrest both African Americans and white people for what he termed vagrancy."," These were not the only three men local police detained after the Civil War. There were many instances in which local authorities attempted to undermine the Bureau's attempts at racial reform. Between 1865 and 1868, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution were passed. They granted African Americans freedom from slavery, citizenship rights, and the right to vote, respectively. In Mississippi, the state set about registering black voters, and the new state legislature even included some African American members. However, the Mississippi Black Code of 1865 vigorously sought to control the former slaves. Passed by former slave owners, it provided that blacks had to have special licenses if they were not regularly employed. The acts were used as justification for detaining the three men in Jefferson, County, because they did not have these special papers, and were thus subject to the fines and jailing that happened to many like them. "," The former slaveholders sought to control the newly freedmen in a legal fashion through these black codes. The formation of the white supremacy group, the Ku Klux Klan, sought to force blacks to do certain things through the use of terror. The Klan first actively showed itself during the 1868 elections where they used violence and intimidation aimed at African Americans to deter them from the voting polls. Their hatred spread to black schools, teachers, and churches. The federal government stepped in with the Enforcement Act, which allowed that Klan members would be tried in federal and not local courts, but this had little effect on decreasing their activity. So, while attempts were made to give the newly freed blacks the rights they deserved, an underlying hatred still existed towards them from their former masters and other white southerners.

In this segment readers found many lighthearted topics including a sequence of imaginary situations reflecting both the political and social atmosphere of the era.  In addition to jokes about the fancies of women, the life of the theater, and medical issues, in 1830 a series of these verbal caricatures depicted trite Irish figures. While the jokes of <em>The Virginia Advocate</em> did not overtly display strong nativist doctrine, their obvious use of stereotypes portrayed the Irish in a very discriminatory manner.  ","Some jokes attempted to discredit the Irish as simply stupid and absurd while others furtively attacked their character, principles, and culture. The Irishman's War, published on March 12, 1830, subtly ridiculed an Irishman for his discourse and ignorance of geography.  From his rough, uncultured speech and lack of basic knowledge, this joke depicted the Irishman at an everyday laborers' task - a low-paying, unskilled job for an unskilled laborer. Another joke from April 16, 1830 crafted a crude, nonsensical analogy into an Irish priest's sermon in order to ridicule the Roman Catholic Church.  Through the absurdity of this sermon, the joke attempted to discredit the parish priest and the Roman Catholic Church, which endorsed such men in its pulpits. While the message was subtle in both of these jokes, the Virginian audience would have recognized the subliminal messages in both situations.  ","The Price of a Milkmaid in Ireland, published on February 12, 1830, stealthily commented on the moral nature of the Irish people.  The joke read: A young gentleman of Kilkenny, meeting a handsome milk maid, near the parade, said, 'What will you take for yourself and your milk, my dear'  The girl instantly replied, 'Yourself and a gold ring sir.'  While not obviously discriminatory, this joke implied an inherent impropriety within Irish culture, the predatory nature of Irish men, and finally, the easy, indiscrete manner of wooing Irish women. A joke published the following week took greater pains to criticize the Irish more overtly: An Irishman walking along perceived a receipt book fall out a gentleman's pocket just before him. Paddy picked it up, and observing a note sticking between the leaves, he took it to himself, and then called very honestly after the owner, 'Now, halt a bit, man See, here's your book that ye dropped on the pavement - but somebody has stolen a fifty dollar bill out of it'  This joke attempted to undermine the moral values of the Irish by insinuating that Irishmen could not be trusted.  The word Paddy, a common term for all Irishmen, also reflected the racial culture of the South; in using this word, the joke attributed dishonesty to the nature of all Irishmen.","In all, the Irish unnerved the South because they were unfamiliar incomers. Ironically, southerners discriminated against the Irish - fellow white men - and subjected them to harsh, public stereotypes while, as Melvin Ely notes, they were able to live with blacks. The massive wave of Irish immigrants around this time heightened the nerves of some southerners who resented the increasing numbers of foreigners usurping jobs and opportunities; thus, by 1830, the Irish had become a controversial ethnic group in society, inciting strong nativism and discrimination that eventually culminated in the bloody riots of 1844 in Philadelphia and Baltimore.  David Gleeson maintains the controversial opinion that while the South still maintained its usual social obstacles, in comparison to the North it did not show such intense resentment and hostility toward the Irish because they constituted such a small percent of the population and were appreciated as another source of labor.  Yet, even if his analysis is correct, as a border state Virginia was much more exposed to the fierce nativism growing in the North and would have thus been more susceptible to internal discrimination against the Irish than perhaps other states of the deeper South. Furthermore, the jokes of <em>The Virginia Advocate </em>suggest that in Albemarle County a lingering uneasiness toward the incomers persisted, making southerners uncomfortable enough to try to discredit them in jocular situations."],"display_date":"February 12, 1830 - April 16, 1830","search_date":"1830-03-15","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2182,"title":"Albemarle Women Hold a Fair for Colonization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-05-14","end_date":"1830-06-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 14, 1830, after months of anticipation, <em>The Virginia Advocate</em> celebrated the triumph of a grand fair held in aid of the American Colonization Society by the Female Association of Albemarle County.  The newspaper proudly proclaimed that it went off with a success, which we believe has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations of its friends.  Despite the heat of the day the decorated hall attracted great crowds with its cool refreshments and informative exhibits about colonization. Although the paper did not report the total amount of money raised, it praised the women's philanthropic motives to help black colonists overcome the disease, famine, and...hostility...[that] threaten [a new colony's] feeble and precarious existence.","This altruistic effort by women was not unusual in the antebellum South; women commonly managed associations for the sick and poor, but it was their desire to assist free blacks that distinguished these women from later women of Virginia.  The women of the Female Association of Albemarle County were largely upper class women who lived in a slave-based society and yet, because of their fear of violence and desire for missionary activity, they staunchly supported colonization when they might have considered themselves above such a concern.","The recent slave rebellions led by Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Denmark Vesey in 1822, and Nat Turner in 1831 were only too recent in the minds of southerners and had generated great social fear, particularly for Virginians.  In these revolts, slaves had revolted against the rule of their white masters and free blacks had violated the privilege of their freedom, labeling themselves as a threatening group of people who endangered the property of the South. The violence of these revolts particularly endangered white women and children who had been among some of the blacks' first victims.  As an act of self-defense therefore, Albemarle County's women joined in the intensified protests on behalf of African colonization to reduce the unnecessary and dangerous amount of blacks in the South.","Other Virginian women hoped that colonization would spread Christianity in Africa. The women of Albemarle specifically praised the American Colonization Society for its desire to plant a germ of christianity and civilization, which will spring up to bless Africa, whose fruit will sustain the principles of Liberty in unborn generations.  As Robert Johnson, Jr. discusses, these women, along with many other southerners, credited slavery as the institution that had introduced Christianity to blacks; for this reason, they hoped that the free blacks who emerged from the system of slavery as Christian, civilized beings could spread these virtues to all of Africa.","On June 1, 1830, only a few weeks later, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>published a brief letter addressed to The Reverend Mr. Gurley of the American Colonization Society concerning the funds raised from the Albemarle County fair.  The Female Association offered the Reverend a gift of 500 dollars to aid the Colonization Society and requested that a lien be retained on the funds contributed by this association, by which, at any future period, any free people of color from this county, who may wish to go to Liberia, shall have the precedence of all others in any embarkation, at least to the full amount of the funds contributed by this association.  The <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported this news because the state of Virginia had one of the largest networks of colonization chapters in the United States and many would have been encouraged by their efforts.","Other states would have also been interested because during this era similar support for colonization was prevalent throughout the South.  Johnson contends that while some in the South displayed a genuine humanitarian concern for the well-being of blacks, the majority of southerners advocated colonization on account of their fear of black rebellion, the uncertainty concerning the future of free blacks, and the lagging economy. In Johnson's view the South believed colonization would protect the value of the slave property and remove those Africans who were an economic drain upon the plantation system. Thus, the American Colonization Society became a popular cause in the South but for a variety of different motives."],"display_date":"May 14, 1830 - June 1, 1830","search_date":"1830-05-23","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2187,"title":"Courtroom Drama in Black and White at Cumberland Court\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-09-02","end_date":"1834-09-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After a long day of riding through the rain to Cumberland Court, Carter H.

In rural counties of Virginia similar to Albemarle, Melvin Ely notes that often times white juries had personal contact with those involved in the cases and thus, jurors tended to judge them as individuals whom they knew, not as appendages of that abstract, aggregate free black category against which legislator and editorialists aimed racist laws and rhetoric. The court juries thus ironically treated free blacks similarly to other free white men of similar social and economic standing; Ely comments on this unforeseen pattern by remarking a slaves' status as a free man, more than his color or previous condition, governed his treatment by the legal system.  The Virginia courts therefore affirmed the free black man's status in society as higher than that of a slave but failed to record exactly how he should be treated; thus, for many years, free blacks enjoyed moderate courtroom equality based on their undefined role in society and were able to benefit economically from their freedom.","If the negro that Harrison acquitted were a slave, that individual was very fortunate because slaves, in contrast to free blacks, lived in a brutal system of dominance and submission that also transcended the legal system.  Courts in rural, agrarian counties such as Albemarle had little sympathy for slaves who committed crimes against their white masters or neighbors and often issued harsh punishments such as death or exile. The courts did however, try to protect slaves who experienced excessive violence at the hands of their masters but juries hesitated to legally ascribe a slave's death to a beating for fear it would jeopardize the owner's dominance over a slave.  Therefore, courts extended minimal protection to slaves but were always mindful of their primary duty to protect the dominance of the white man and his property.  ","Often times Virginian slaves were made to appear before a called court - a court-like panel specially designed to hear slaves' cases within ten days of their apprehension. Five men sat on this panel and had the power to determine guilt and fix a permanent sentence that could not be appealed.  But the slaves were not helpless in these courts because the panel provided them with a defense attorney and required a unanimous decision in order to convict.  If a defense attorney could not be contracted before the trial, the panel postponed the date because it wanted to reach a fair decision. Although defense attorneys were often assigned minutes before the trial, they often times reduced the charges and could even exonerate the slave.  In 1832, a new Virginian law expanded the jurisdiction of the called courts to include free blacks' cases as well so the negro that Harrison defended could have been a free black or slave whose trial may have also occurred before this type of panel-court.","In his diary, Harrison expressed some disgust at the thought of having to defend people below him when he reflected upon his reasons for never seriously pursuing law as a profession.  He explained that the profession had rendered [itself] odious...by too close a contact with the vicious and illiterate classes of society.  Therefore, although he successfully acquitted a black man in court, by 1834 whites like Harrison challenged the black man's privileges because of his inherently inferior nature. But despite these existing tensions, the courtroom was ultimately a place where blacks could attempt to protect their dignity as well as a realm in which black and white interacted together, albeit unequally."],"display_date":"September 2, 1834","search_date":"1834-09-02","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2189,"title":"Frank Ruffin&#39;s Duel: a Defense of Honor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-06-19","end_date":"1834-06-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On June 19, 1834, Frank Ruffin wrote a letter to George W. Goode and William Roane informing them that he had participated in a duel in which he emerged untouched as has not the other party.  A personal insult incited the duel because another man had lied most grossly about Ruffin's conduct in [an]...affair. In order to defend his actions, Ruffin justifies the duel as a battle of honor by saying he would have been a most craven, spirited, contemptible man, forfeiting every claim to the respect of gentlemen...if [he] had permitted another gentleman to fight through a difficulty which originated on [his] account.  He, like many southern gentlemen, prized his self-respect more highly than the good opinion of anyone and in a society that championed honor, respect, and chivalry, a man had to protect his personal dignity to survive.","Though southern cities such as New Orleans were famous for their high numbers of duels because of their crowded atmosphere, the agrarian society of Albemarle County was also very familiar with the art of dueling in defense of honor. In fact, John C. Willis argues that as the oldest parts of the South, Virginia counties such as Albemarle had perhaps the strictest definition of honor in the South: To be honored is to be temporarily distinguished among persons sharing common values and concerns. Conversely, to be denied honor or to be shamed is an accusation of aberrance and an assertion of inferiority...A society's code of honor thus acts to guide, sanction, and reward the behavior of its members and illustrates, for outsiders, the culture's values at work.  Virginian gentlemen therefore, recognized the inherent importance of honor as a way of asserting one's individual superiority and would have readily fought to defend their honor. ","The South championed the duel as a physical manifestation of its society's unique emphasis on honor. As Jack K. Williams observes, the duel resulted from rigid class structure, exaggerated sense of honor, lingering classic romanticism, and reluctance to be confined by the letter of the law.  Based on such fundamental aspects of southern society, duels were not rarities but relatively frequent methods of addressing conflicts between gentlemen.  But it cannot be over-emphasized that duels were inherently a mark of one's social rank and identity within society - only gentry could participate. Professional men, bankers, military officers, ministers, and planters were recognized as gentlemen while laborers, businessmen, merchants and farmers were only rarely recognized as such. Gentlemen resolved conflict by duels but they forcibly subdued their inferiors by caning or beating them.  It was a sign of social respect and recognition of one's rank to challenge another to a duel and thus, the practice remained exclusive. ","Duels were as much a display of honorable conduct as a battle to preserve one's honor because a duel had many accompanying rules and standards. In fact, the drama of Frank Ruffin's duel hinged upon his conduct in his duel.  During the second round of shots, Ruffin fired his shot after the word stop, claiming that he had not heard the command. By this mistake, Ruffin forfeited his life because he had violated the rules of conduct and the second had the right to shoot him on the spot.  Although Ruffin stepped forward...and called on them to shoot [him]...three separate and distinct times, the second himself was uncertain of the timing of the shot and therefore acquitted Ruffin of all guilt. But, to maintain his reputation Ruffin decided to remain in the area six weeks longer to meet any misrepresentations which might have been rumored concerning the affair.  Thus, ironically, Ruffin's duel to protect his honor actually could have given others reason to question it again, although there is no suggestion of such an event occurring.  ","Frank Ruffin's account of his duel lends support to William's assertion that the duel was a defense of individual honor that, while an intangible concept, was no less real than any physical possession.  Southern men reviled cowardly behavior and refused to associate with men of tainted character.  Clearly, honor was undoubtedly the principle reason for the enduring tradition of the duel in the antebellum South since it established a man's dignity and reputation within his society."],"display_date":"June 19, 1834","search_date":"1834-06-19","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2205,"title":"Youthful Misconduct in Celebration of Christmas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-12-24","end_date":"1879-01-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The members of the City Council of Staunton, Virginia voted against the suspension over the Christmas holiday of an ordinance that forbad the use of pop-crackers in the streets.

George Green, a sturdy young man of around eighteen years, attempted to kiss the little bronze beauty Roberta. When Professor Thomas Henaforth discovered what had transpired outside of his school, he set out to punish the mischievous youth. At four o'clock in the afternoon, the Professor found Green and hit him over the head with a heavy cudgel, inflicting several open, bleeding wounds. The battle seemed to be a clear victory for the Professor until later that day when Green attacked him as he exited the building. Green triumphed in this round, beating Professor Henaforth until he yelled Nuff.","R. E. Porter, the Staunton Spectator's editor, drew four conclusions from this incident. Young darkies should take care in their efforts to kiss girls at school, as only the professors may claim this benefit. Schoolteachers should mind how they try to discipline the older male students since the stronger will win out in the battle. Women are responsible for all disobedience as they lead others into temptation. Finally, Porter suggested that if it had been a white professor assaulting a black student the incident would have gained much greater publicity, but since it occurred among individuals of the same race, it is not as notable."," Implicated in this incident are the state of the school systems in the Reconstruction South and the quality and character of race relations. The historian Eric Foner describes how public education collapsed during the Reconstruction as a result of widespread tax cuts, sinking to the point that a state governor considered it a luxury. Black students endured the worst of this educational ruin, but their situation was markedly better than it had been during slavery when education was altogether forbidden. The difference in the quality of education and the creation of a Colored Academy to separate the races revealed the tension between the black and white populations. The language used by Porter to describe those involved in the fight supports Foner's argument for the beginnings of the system of racial subordination, especially in Porter's description of Green as the brawny young Buck whose muscles have been developed at the plough handle and the anvil. White southerners still saw African Americans in terms of their roles during slavery, despite the new constitutional amendments guaranteeing equal rights. Although positioned as a professor at an educational institution, Porter impugned Henaforth's qualifications by suggesting sexual relations between a teacher and his students and placing Henaforth's title in quotations (Professor). Though the fifteenth amendment said it must be so, blacks were still not equal to whites in the eyes of the inhabitants of Augusta County."],"display_date":"January 10, 1873","search_date":"1873-01-10","locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2210,"title":"The Trial of John W.

Guiteau was delivered at the courthouse on the morning of the twenty-third of January. Although the court officers continually shouted for silence, Guiteau never ceased his criticisms of the court and Judge Porter even as the judge read off the charges against him. Judge Porter compared Guiteau to John Wilkes Booth, suggesting that the murderer of Lincoln shared with Guiteau a desire to win notoriety at any cost. Guiteau was accused of the assassination of President Garfield, with his only real hope of defense lying in a plea of insanity. The jury declared Guiteau guilty as indicted, followed by applause from the crowd and Guiteau's statement that the verdict was an outrage upon the American people.","   The Valley Virginian described the popularity of this trial that enthralled the entire public for the entire eleven weeks of its duration. Though guilty, sympathy often awaits the condemned as the consequences of the verdict come to be considered. However, the case of John W. Guiteau evoked less public sympathy than any crime resulting in capital punishment before it. The desire for a guilty verdict was universal as the nation felt that its own character, as well as the fate of the miserable assassin, was on trial. ","   The Virginian's editorial on the verdict of the case spoke to the faith of Augusta County in the legal system and its desire to protect the president of the nation. Though a national event, the Staunton newspaper published its own thoughts on the outcome of the trial, trying to reconcile the pity felt for those sentenced to a public execution and the outrage of an assassination. The strength of the public outcry upon Garfield's assassination is ironic considering he won the 1880 presidential election against Winfield Scott Hancock with a plurality of only ten thousand out of more than nine million votes. Garfield was the Republican candidate carrying most of the Northern states and none of the former slave states, including Virginia. James Garfield was not installed in office for much time before his assassination; historian James M. McPherson details how he was consequently unable to fully enact his plans to form coalitions between the Republican Party and the newly forming independent parties in the South. The outrage of Guiteau's actions described by The Virginian was not due to admiration for Garfield, but for the office he held. Though the South was often suspicious of Northern attitudes, they were bound enough to the Union to have an emotional investment in its commander-in-chief.

Andrew Jackson Kearney, supposedly of Loudon County, had been drifting from city to city, traveling from Harrisonburg to Staunton to spread his religious fervor. A curious crowd gathered to hear the sermon that followed his public singing and praying, eloquently speaking to answer the question, Why is a man better than a sheep?.","   The following week, Kearney appeared in Charlottesville where he was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. Upon an accusation of being an imposter, Kearney pulled out a pistol and threatened to fire into the group of onlookers gathered in front of him. It seemed that Andrew Kearney had previously been imprisoned in Maryland for seven years. The Staunton Spectator suggested, in the spirit of his sermon in Staunton, that Kearney should feel sheepish for his deceit of the public regarding his criminal record.","   In the South, preaching has been preferable to other forms of religious expression because it focuses on the style of faith most applicable to the region's enthusiastic character. The preacher is one of few figures in the South able to overcome racial and religious boundaries due to his centrality to religious life. One of the roles played by the preacher is that of sage, placing him in a role of mediation between political and religious life. James M. Dabbs argues that Southerners have a propensity to substitute religion with politics, politics with religion, and to unite the two under morality. The combination of politics, religion, and morality presided over by a preacher is the same grouping of elements which Andrew Jackson Kearney tried to appropriate, thus supporting Dabbs's claim. His decision to preach on the steps of the courthouse in Staunton showed both his desire to make his message public and to unite religious thought with the law. He asserted that his doctrine was lawful with his position, following the traditional Southern pattern of enforcing religion as an official system of belief. Kearney's violent reaction to the questioning of his authority showed the power inherent in the position of preacher. He believed himself to be a religious leader, and as such, beyond public criticism. The newspaper's mockery, however, revealed that those witnessing his sermon refused to grant such an important role in the community.

Middlebrook accused Brown of being overly familiar with his wife, showing jealousy to be the source of the conflict that emerged. Wilson Goings, after listening to the quarrel outside his home, asked Brown inside. Middlebrook's wife was in the house and when Middlebrook was denied entry to the residence he became furious and tried to force his way inside. He managed to open the door enough to fire his pistol and hit Goings, resulting in a severe arm wound. Middlebrook then made his way to another door, gained entrance, and fatally wounded Brown.","   Elzy Middlebrook was arrested on Sunday morning without any attempt at escape. He was indicted on Monday for murder and malicious maiming, all a result of his suspicious love for his wife, barely mentioned throughout the article. The Valley Virginian specifically indicates that all of the parties involved [were] colored.","   The newspaper's report on the race of the individuals involved in the crime is essential to understanding its significance. It is an assertion that violent actions of this sort occur only within a certain set of people, implying that white Americans could rise above such crimes of passions. While under slavery Middlebrook was obliged to accept his wife's sexual contact with men other than himself due to his subservience under his master, his new freedom granted him the liberty to defend what he believed should be rightfully his. The wife becomes a question of property, evident in her absence in the reporting of the incident, and Middlebrook had a right to his property. Steven Hahn contends that the South following the Civil War was formed out of black struggles such as this one, illustrating the nature and complexity of race relations in the nineteenth century. The racial identification is indication of a level of racial prejudice, but the Middlebrook's indictment and trial indicate the due process of law given to every criminal regardless of race.

At six o'clock on June 30, 1883, Mr. Elam and Mr. Beirne met one another to settle the score as gentlemen always had before - with a duel. The procedure was decided in advance, specifying the use of Colt's six-shooters at eight paces. All men not directly involved with the business were asked to leave and the location was clear of lawful authorities due to the early hour. Once the physician questioned the two men for readiness, they had to discharge their weapons between the yell of Fire and the count to three. As soon as the physician called out one the gentlemen fired, but no one was hit in this first round. Mr. Beirne requested a second opportunity and so the process repeated itself.

Once Mr. Elam realized that his wound was only in one leg, he wished that he had demanded a third shot. Though not fatal, Elam's injury to his upper right thigh would be dangerous to repair because the bullet had embed itself in his flesh. Following the duel, both parties appeared calm and collected, content that the shots had not proven fatal. There had been no attempt to arrest or even investigate the battle after its occurrence, though their original meeting had been delayed due to three attempts to arrest Beirne.","  Antidueling laws rarely functioned to stop the duel because most law enforcement officials acknowledged that the men of honor fighting in such battles were held to a different code. Historian Kenneth Greenberg claims that men of honor valued their words and their views of the truth above all else; consequently, they were willing to fight to defend a public appearance. However, after the Civil War dueling began to be replaced by shooting-on-sight, promoted by the fact that in some areas of the South almost everyone kept a pistol. Immediate shooting lacks the equality of opportunity provided by a duel, revealing an act of vengeance based on impatient emotion. Mr. Elam and Mr. Beirne chose not to publicize the reasons for their duel, but the choice of method clearly demonstrates that it was a question of honor, thus supporting Greenberg's contention. Following the bloodthirsty violence of the Civil War, anything less than honor would be settled with an informal shot at one's enemy.

Going by the alias, Westerfield, Butler was in possession of lithographed letterheads with the name of a former post-master general, W.S. Bissell, and forged the name Westerfield as Secretary. He had them illegally lithographed so that he could use the letterheads to order books without paying for them because they would be charged to Bissell. When Butler was arrested, he pleaded guilty to the charge, claiming that his actions had been on account that he had a consuming desire for knowledge. Although his jail term for that particular incident ended on December 3, 1897, he repeated the offense while incarcerated, and needed to be judged again accordingly. United States Judge Adams who was assigned the case, thinks that Butler is not a criminal, but simply wants learning, and is too poor to pay for it. Judge Adams, because of this view, was reluctant to sentence Butler a second time; however, the final outcome to the trial was not reported.","Poverty was a large problem in the post-bellum South. Historian C. Vann Woodward notes that poverty was a continuous and conspicuous feature of the southern experience. Historian David Potter found similar trends of southern poverty: If Americans have been a people of plenty, southerners have been a people of poverty. By 1880 not one southern state ranked in the top thirty for American income. The South was stripped of their labor force with the end of slavery, and wealthy plantations and fertile land were ruined in the destruction of Civil War battles fought in the South's backyard. Charles Wilson and William Ferris noted that this combination created poverty among southern whites that lasted through the century: The sharecropping-tenant system trapped increasing numbers of blacks and whites in the nineteenth century, keeping them at poverty levels. Even in cities like St. Louis, the poverty demographic was immense, because, industries paid such low wages that most southerners remained poor by any definition of that word.","Butler's incident demonstrates the common link between education levels and economics in the late nineteenth century South: they were kept at very poor rates. The trend reached far beyond Missouri. In 1879, Virginia was denied its fair share of educational financial support, when a million and a half dollars were diverted from the school fund. Although poverty was a prominent factor in many states, education was trying to rise in other parts of the South in the 80s and 90s; the southern government tried to spend more on tangible elements like education. North Carolina, under governor Charles Brantley Aycock, championed white education, and saw, dramatic changes in [its] schools. North Carolina birthed a whole new wave of educational values in the 1890s and men like Edwin Alderman and Charles McIver began to stage public rallies and organize teachers' institutes around the state. But even with these valiant attempts, southern education was still behind the North considerably, and many of the region's citizens struggled. As Historian Edward Ayers commented, The region lagged far behind the rest of the country in literacy and school attendance. Ayers blamed the high birth rate combined with high levels of southern poverty meaning the South had twice as many minds to educate and half as much income to do it with."],"display_date":"September 3, 1896 - December 3, 1897","search_date":"1897-04-19","locations":[{"id":8037,"lat":38.6358212793,"lng":-90.2450510752,"zoom":11,"place":"ST LOUIS CITY, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2239,"title":"Ignoble and Impotent\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-03-04","end_date":"1895-03-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of Monday March 4, 1895, the Fifty-third Congress came to an end. The headlines that ran in the New York Times that day took the opportunity to let lose a harsh critique on that particular Congress. They read: A DISGRACE TO AMERICA, FAITHLESS TO PARTY AND COUNTRY, and, NO ONE REGRETS THE DISSOLUTION. The prestigious newspaper commented on the corruption and ineptitude of the political leaders in the Congress. After discussing several missed opportunities that the Congress failed to take proper action on, the New York Times listed the worst offenders in several states. Arkansas, along with several other southern states, had eight of its representatives' names appear on this list including James K. Jones, James H. Berry, Philip D. McChulloch, Jr., John S. Little, Thomas C. McRae, Willaim L. Terry, Hugh A. Dinsmore, and Robert Neil. Historian Dallas T. Herndon recorded each man's election to that disgraced Senate in 1922, The election for representatives in Congress was held on November 6, 1894. Those elected from the six districts in order were: P. D. McCulloch, John S. Little, Thomas C. McRae, William L. Terry, Hugh A. Dinsmore, and Robert Neill, all Democrats."," The New York Times seemed to be specifically attacking the Congress for its democratic majority. It suggested that the South's overarching democratic political sympathies and politicians were responsible for the problematic congress, not the North: the performance of the Democratic majority, coming into complete control of the government, entrusted with the power to embody in the laws... responsible for the prudent management of affairs, has been so lame and impotent that it may be said without offending Democrats, that nothing in the life of the congress became it so much as its taking off. The paper went on to accuse Democrats of being, stupid and, ignorant in their being out of sympathy with the conservative president of the time, Grover Cleveland. Jones, specifically, was accused of being, a rather narrow, weak, gullible, man who had, an unmitigated aversion for anything that smacks of sound money or loyalty to the president. He was held accountable for swaying the congress with those notions. "," The paper reported glumly that his term did not expire until 1897. In fact, James K. Jones stayed far past 1897, even though his name appeared first for Arkansas on the list of Those Who Have Betrayed the People in the 1895 edition of the New York Times. Jones's continued political career suggests that the political tone against Arkansas Deomcrats was not as hostile toward the end of the 1890s. The six representatives of the congress for Arkansas were then listed in order as, McCulluch a bullion coiner, Little who was willing to pay gold loans in silver, McRae whowould starve the commission out of office, Terry who voted against the silver repeal, Dinsmore who has been all the objectionable things in legislation on finance, and Neil, a starver of the merit system."," Although political tensions between the North and South lessened from the height they had been during Civil War, it was not all together gone, particularly in government. The two different parties came head to head with different ideals and ideas for the administration of the country.

Lynching occurred over whipping and beating when the social order of white society was attacked. The example Brundage uses to support this is the assault of a white woman. Bigus' case shows how such an act would not be permitted. The perpetrator of the act was in question. Three different men were implicated throughout the ordeal: George Parish, John H.

Jones, a former Sheriff of his home county of Yadkin, a Republican, and a member of the Constitutional Convention of 1875 know of these illicit distilleries without any involvement himself in the illegal activity? The police, the Internal Revenue Service, and the wider public would soon find out that Jones was not the upstanding citizen he appeared to be. ","On October 24, 1887, Revenue Agent Wagner uncovered some fourteen illegal whiskey distilleries-all fourteen owned by Jones. While Jones did not participate in any of the illegal distilling himself, he hired men to run the distilleries, all within one quarter mile of each other in the mountains of Wilkes County, for his own profit. When Jones had a falling out with some of his employees in early 1887, he leaked information to the authorities about their occupations. Little did he know that he would meet the same fate. As information leaked about Jones's own involvement in the illicit distilling he reported to the authorities, his remaining employees, still suspicious of the arrest of their coworkers, confirmed that Jones was the ringleader of the men he reported. Authorities raided Jones's distilleries in Wilkes County, arresting Jones and fifty others, and disposing of fifty-three barrels of whiskey.","Wilbur Miller argues that historians who cite the inability of Republicans to protect black citizens during the Klan's post-war resurgence as evidence that Republican Reconstruction efforts failed as only temporary and limited expanded national power disregard the power of the internal revenue service as a source of national power during the post-war years. Southern mountain men of both parties, such as Republican B.F. Jones, resented the implementation of a new tax on distilling whiskey and became known as blockaders for selling their whiskey without paying the excise tax. Miller's argues, however, that despite Southerners' efforts, the federal revenue agents were able to establish control in the mountainous regions of the South throughout the latter part of the nineteenth century. As the story of B.F. Jones demonstrates, the federal agents were able to limit moonshining activity to individual, local activity, proving that increased national control did in fact result from Republican Reconstruction efforts."],"display_date":"April 1, 1887 - October 30, 1887","search_date":"1887-07-16","locations":[{"id":9887,"lat":36.2078794431,"lng":-81.1627366142,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKES, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2290,"title":"The Murder of Mrs. Harris \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-12-25","end_date":"1854-12-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["n the day of the murder, Ben Small kept watch in the yard for Isidore. Isidore knew that Mrs. Henry would never let Small in the house, so he had to commit the crime. After the murder, one of the men set fire to the house. Ben worried about the children who were asleep in the house at the time. ","This won't do, the children will be burned; let us wake them or put the fire out, Small reportedly said. ","No, Isidore replied. So much the worse for them. Let them burn, they will tell no tales. ","H.B. Trist of Bowden Plantation wrote to his daughter Willie in New Orleans on Christmas Day, telling her of the incident. Small had confessed to being an accomplice in the premeditated murder of Isidore's white mistress Mrs. Henry, and Trist's account of the murder came from the confession. This accounts, perhaps, for the story of Small's attempt at heroism when he reportedly wanted to save the children; it is possible that Small lied in order to save his own neck. It is unlikely he was capable of much heroism as he was also mixed up in the murder of two white whiskey sellers in the area. It is unclear if Small was a slave on the Marchand plantation or another plantation or if he was a free man. ","Trist found Isidore's betrayal of his mistress with whom he had grown up the most disturbing part of the confession. He thought that since Isidore had been raised together with Mrs. Harris and since she had always been kind to him this made his villainy even worse than Small's. ","In expressing his distress that Isidore could murder a woman whom he had grown up with and who had apparently always been kind to him, Trist was showing that he, like slaveholders throughout the South, subscribed to the doctrine of paternalism. Paternalism was a defense of slavery in which slaveholders claimed that they treated their slaves well and took care of them by providing them with food, clothing lodging, and religion. Slaveholders thought slavery to be a type of parent/child relationship where the slaveholder took care of the slave and the slave was grateful and content to be looked after. ","But Mrs. Harris' murder shows an instance where African Americans were obviously not content and thus showed an active resistance to their enslavement. According to historian Kenneth Stampp, slaves thought of their enslavement in terms of labor extortion and a lack of control over their own time and labor. They would play along with the slaveholder's illusions that they as slaves were helpless, because not to do so might anger their owner and end in some form of punishment by the owner. Slaves struggled against their forced servitude in many ways. Some were careless in their work. Some slaves sabotaged themselves to make themselves unfit for work. Stampp reports on one Kentucky slave who would purposely make himself sick by overdosing on medicines he found in his master's medicine chest. One of the more extreme steps a slave could take to resist enslavement was to run away. This was a dangerous step; runaway slaves usually were caught and brought back to the plantations where they were usually publicly punished as a warning to other potential runaways. A most extreme form of resistance was murder. Slaves murdered both overseers and owners for different reasons. Usually it was because the slave felt he had been treated badly or punished unfairly. According to Stampp, violence was usually only adopted by the most extremely discontented of the slaves. Many states had Black Codes to deal with slave violence. Louisiana's Black Code ordered that a slave be given a trial; if convicted, the slave was either sent to prison or, as was most common in the South, executed.

J. Parliament tried to pay fifty Italians hired to work on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Aberdeen with 750 instead of the 1,500 they were owed, he was seized by the workers and locked up. They told him they would not release him and threatened to kill him unless paid the full amount. When Sheriff Walker and his Deputy came to investigate at around midnight, they too were captured and detained. The Italians talked of killing them as well.","The next day, Reverend Steele got the Italians to agree to release the Sheriff and the Reverend and Parliament signed a statement saying they would be paid in full in a couple of days. When citizens and police from surrounding towns showed up, however, the Italians got spooked and ran to get Parliament. The police and citizens ran after them and fighting ensued. The police fired upon the laborers. By that evening, most of the workers had been captured and taken to jail. Some of the Italians were shot but not seriously injured; the Sheriff, on the other hand, received a severe wound. The people living in the area, who had supported the Italians over the previous weeks, had much sympathy for them. Fearing there would be more fighting, extra police were stationed in the jail.","Immigration of Italians during the mid-eighties in Maryland seems to be studied less than later immigration. Not that many Italians lived in nor were immigrating to the United States between the Civil War and the 1880's. Between 1860 and 1880, 68,000 Italians came to the United States. After 1880, there were only 45,000 Italians still living in the country. In the two decades following 1880, 1,000,000 Italians came to the United States. Therefore, Italian immigration was not yet a large phenomenon during the time of the riot. Historians Richard Walsh and William Fox also focus on the immigration increase after 1900. Perhaps historians' lack of interest also reflects the apathy of Marylanders at the time. In Harford County, the Italian immigrants were denied their due. They had to rise up and threaten to kill their contractor and policemen to get noticed. Immigrants seem to be thrust into the background of Maryland 1880s history, having been a minor part of the population; the riot of Italian workers in Harford County suggests that during this point in time, they were equally ignored."],"display_date":"February 15, 1884 - February 16, 1884","search_date":"1884-02-15","locations":[{"id":6005,"lat":39.5358347431,"lng":-76.0898051386,"zoom":9,"place":"HARFORD, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2300,"title":"A Black Girl Robs another Girl of Fifteen Cents\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-01-24","end_date":"1878-01-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Elizabeth Burley, a twelve year old black girl, was charged on the twenty-third of January with robbing Louisa Kerling.

The arrest of Burley, a relatively young girl, for fighting with and stealing the small sum of fifteen cents from Kerling, seems an overreaction. Historian Edward Ayers says that whites believed blacks held white law in contempt and that black crime was on the rise. In the late eighties, arrests and sentences of black men went up. Not only did whites perpetuate the belief of the dangerous black man but so did newspapers. Although Burley was young and a girl, this does not mean she would not be implicated in the increasing suspicion and fear of blacks. While the reaction to Burley's theft may be explained by a heightened fear of blacks committing crimes, it may also simply be a normal reaction to stealing.","The Sun published other articles of thievery in January of 1878.

In this case, both of the people involved were presumably white (because the article did not mention color) and what was stolen had a higher worth; the young man, however, was still arrested.

McNeilly had boarded with the Jenkins's family while also working for them, and had fallen in love with Jenkins's seventeen year old daughter.  The teenage girl, however, did not have reciprocal feelings for McNeilly and did not appreciate his advances.  ","As Jenkins drew his knife of McNeilly in the government warehouse, he cursed at him and accused him of undermining his family.  McNeilly asked Jenkins to leave the warehouse, but he refused.  McNeilly drew a pistol in his own self-defense and fired two shots.  The first shot missed Jenkins, but the second struck him in the left arm, the bullet breaking it and becoming lodged in his body.  McNeilly was acquitted on the grounds of self-defense against Jenkins's raging, drunken threats.","While any jury today may have acquitted McNeilly on the grounds of self-defense, according to Edward Ayers, violent crime in the South remained largely unpunished compared to violent crime in the North in the post-war years. White southerners seemed particularly prone to violence, with whites appearing in court far more often for violent crimes than property crimes in the years following the Civil War, and the percentage of homicides in the south increasing by nearly forty percent between 1880 to 1890.  Ayers argues that after the Civil War, the Southern notions of social order and honor outlived Southerners' toleration of dueling as a way to maintain and defend these notions. By the 1880's, however, Southerners had not successfully transitioned from using dueling to using the legal system as a way to solve issues they believed regarded personal honor, and men such as Jenkins resorted to street fighting instead."],"display_date":"January 8, 1890","search_date":"1890-01-08","locations":[{"id":9622,"lat":35.2468169924,"lng":-80.8327861056,"zoom":9,"place":"MECKLENBURG, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2310,"title":"Arson Terrorizes Leesburg\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-02-03","end_date":"1851-02-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the winter of 1851, the town of Leesburg in Loudoun County, Va, was hit by an epidemic.

While it was already illegal to sell alcohol to slaves, the residents of Culpeper apparently were having trouble enforcing the law.

Therefore, it was up to the white citizens of Culpeper County to curtail the economic activity that encouraged the disorderly conduct and upsetting the balance that so delicately permeated life in slave holding society. The conduct of the slaves in drunkenly disturbing the worship service reveals that the white residents of the county did not have as much control over the behavior of the black members of the community as they might have wanted to believe.

One morning during the war, Woods was standing guard as a picket. As the sun rose, one of his fellow soldiers kindly offered to fill his post, while the hungry Woods made breakfast for himself. While he was cooking, an officer approached him and asked him to help with the removal of trash and animal bones from the encampment. After politely declining, saying he was standing picket, the officer proceeded to vociferously curse the boy out, drawing the attention of many in the camp, including General Jackson. The temperamental General ordered for ten balls to be blown through the d----d rascal. When none of the soldiers would comply with this order, Jackson court marshaled the boy on charges of mutiny and desertion, found him guilty, and sentenced him to be shot.","Soon after the end of the war, the United States Senate, prompted by rumors of multiple events like the death of Woods, launched an investigation into the conduct of General Jackson during the First Seminole War. Abner Lacock, a member of the investigation panel, personally came to the conclusion that General Jackson had an innate love of 'blood and carnage' and felt the need to tell the nation about his misconduct. Lacock authored A Letter to the People of Pennsylvania detailing General Jackson's misconduct. In this letter, he narrates the events leading up to the death of Woods, among others, and claims that Jackson deliberately lied time and again to explain his brutal and unwarranted actions.","The First Seminole War was conducted on one of the frontiers of America, and one that was characterized by nearly constant violence. It was a war easily won, but with questionable goals. The end result was the sale of Florida to the United States, a result to which the United States denied aspiring; rather, Secretary of War Calhoun sent General Jackson to Fort Scott in 1818 to wage war on the Seminoles as retribution for attacks against whites-soldiers and civilians alike-in retaliation for General Gaines' sacking of an Indian town. General Jackson had public designs from the outset to rain punishment on the 'savages' inhabiting Florida.

As he was sitting in the Clark County Jail in Alabama on January 7, 1836, the Mobile Commercial Register published an announcement about his capture and arrest as an escaped slave. This was problematic because he swore in vain that he was a freed person. Nevertheless, the paper reported that if his owner would not come to reclaim his property, he will be delt with as the law directs.","If this young mulatto boy was currently or at any point a slave, that means he was the child of a sexual relationship across the color line in which an enslaved mother was the partner of some white male. This is evident because southern state laws established that children of any mixed relationship would follow the status of their mother, regardless of who their father might be, keeping them enslaved on the plantation. Of course, this gave white male slave-owners the opportunity to freely engage in elicit sexual relations with their female slaves without fear of the repercussions of unwanted, illegitimate children as these children would still be classified as their slaves. According to Joshua Rothman, such occurrences fed to the complexities and contradictions of a southern society founded on racial domination-which some sexual relationships could only serve to reinforce-and alternately undermined by interracial sex.","On the other hand, it is possible that this young boy was not a slave nor was enslaved ever in his past. Because of the maternally-inherited status-which meant slaves who had a white father were still born as slaves-on which the southern plantation functioned, some mulattos were free while some, born of enslaved mothers, were still slaves. In other words, an individual's physical appearance essentially gave no indication of being free or enslaved. Therefore, many slave traders kidnapped and sold free blacks who were not slaves at all. Notably during the fall months, when planters had money from the sale of their crops, slave traders in Alabama took such illicit action in order to make their own profit. Within the interstate slave trade, numerous free blacks and mulattos were arrested under the assumption that they were escaped slaves and then allowed to be sold simply because traders could presumably legitimize this through the color of their skin. As John waited in his prison cell in Clarke County, his fate was more than likely to be sold in order for the county to pay for jail fees-an embodiment of unpredictable and often times tragic outcome of sex across the color line."],"display_date":"January 7, 1836","search_date":"1836-01-07","locations":[{"id":77,"lat":31.6619891322,"lng":-87.8428758708,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2341,"title":"Sylvia, the Runaway Slave","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-09-30","end_date":"1836-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1836, Sylvia, about twenty years of age, of common size, very likely and almost black, was sold from her plantation in Conecuh County, Alabama to the plantation of Thomas L.

After several months with no sign of Sylvia, her owner finally decided to make a more public announcement. On September 30 of that same year, the Mobile County Register published a 10 reward pending the return of this runaway slave. Sylvia's rightful owner expected her to return to her former plantation in Conecuh County and whomever she missed there.","Across the South, the domestic slave trade daily uprooted slaves from their homes and dropped them into some foreign land without regard for their personal well-being. Of all the interstate slave sales leading up to the Civil War, twenty-five percent destroyed first marriages and fifty percent destroyed nuclear families. Essentially, slaves were property, and property could be bought and sold at will-whatever was economically profitable. With this in mind, the families of slaves were always in danger of being separated.","Sylvia's new master, Thomas L. Stark, valued the young girl enough that he provided a reward for her return. Slaves were vital to the livelihood of the southern plantation owner. As William Rogers explains, slavery was a crucial part of the Cotton Kingdom in Alabama and inherently tied to the economic success of planters as their most valuable asset. Therefore, Mr. Stark valued Sylvia as one of the highest commodities in his fortune-one that he could not let run away.","Surely, Sylvia knew that punishment was awaiting her upon her return. In Alabama, most small infractions were handled on the plantations, while more serious crimes were handled within the legal system. Essentially, corporal punishment was a way for white southerners to demonstrate their power and keep the system of slavery functioning to their advantage.

Porter was an important individual around Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Not only was he a practicing lawyer, but he owned a large crop of cotton and produced valuable gin. However, someone apparently had a problem with his extracurricular activities. On February 21, 1842, the Mobile Commercial Register reported that Mr. Porter's gin house, along with his entire cotton crop, went up in flames only a few days before. According to the paper, the fire appeared to have been intentionally set. From this article, it is unclear as to whether Mr. Porter was the victim of an enemy seeking revenge or a dogmatist attempting to make a statement for the temperance movement. What is clear about this time period is a great difference of opinion when it came to alcohol consumption. In the antebellum South, Charles Wilson explains that alcohol was a basic part of life in which isolated farmers, as Mr. Porter may have been, utilized distilling to retard spoiling, reduce bulk, and enhance the marketability of their crops. Even though the temperance movement had begun to gain speed in the nineteenth century, it was not yet able to get a foothold in the South. This was due to the economic circumstances of farmers like Mr. Porter and the perceived link between abolitionism and temperance. In Alabama specifically, the temperance movement took form prior to the Civil War but only strengthened along with the other reform movements during the twentieth century.","Nevertheless, the 8 percent of antebellum southerners who did make temperance pledges were adamant and extreme in their views. Alcoholism brought a great number of dangers to southern society, including violence, economic insecurity, and even suicide. Therefore, the temperance movement was able to build a small base of support despite the customary position of alcohol in society. This small percentage was undoubtedly the most radical of the population, and their extreme views led to extreme action.

According to Fannie, Susan's older sister, some white men, who had no business about the place, had come in the night and hidden away. Susan wanted to know more but Fannie refused to say anything else about that night. Due to the uprising in that night, Dr. Eppes did not accompany the family on their trip. Instead, he remained at the family plantation to keep watch. It was not until three days later when Susan pretending to be asleep on a couch, learned more. Her mother and uncle, having not seen her in the study, began to discuss a letter just received from Dr. Eppes. The men in the abolition crew had been on horseback, and according to Dr. Eppes, would be severely dealt with if they returned. Susan's Uncle Daniel stated in a serious tone that these abolitionists are everywhere through the South. Sooner or later they will make trouble for us. It was at that moment that Susan cried out in a voice full of concern and curiosity, Oh, Uncle Daniel, please tell me all about it? However, before Susan could glean any more information on the subject Fannie escorted her to bed. ","By 1855 the possibility of a plantation raid by an abolitionist crew had become a real fear for many large slave owners throughout the south. This episode is a prime example how abolition groups were growing increasingly bolder in their actions across the South. Vanished were the days when only those in the upper South had to be wary of such people. Abolitionists by 1855 were venturing deeper south into such states as Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Rather than relying on mass mailing antislavery materials to plantation owners, abolitionists were penetrating the South seeking to directly aid slaves in escaping their masters. Encouragement for this kind of action was perpetuated by abolitionist orators like Gerrit Smith and Henry Highland Garnet. In his speeches Smith urged Northern abolitionist to go south and help them. Many Northerners agreed that helping slaves escape would play an important role in the attack and eventual crumbling of slavery. However, proslavery southern whites saw these rescues in a different light. While abolitionists saw slave owners as stealing slaves' very lives, slaveholders saw abolitionist crews as stealing their property. From the southern perspective slave rescues were an outlet of violent northern aggression against the peaceful South. Proslavery advocates saw northerners who participated in slave raids as vile fiends, emissaries of mischief and worse than thieves, robbers, or murderers. In response, whenever a slave rescuer was captured, agitated mobs would gather and insist that the captured parties be punished severely, whether legally or illegally. Outspoken southerners asserted that if northerners continued to interfere in the affairs of slave owners there would be violence. This increasing fear of abolitionist parties added to southern sectionalism further driving the country apart."],"display_date":"June 6, 1855","search_date":"1855-06-06","locations":[{"id":1395,"lat":30.4456509268,"lng":-84.292206157,"zoom":9,"place":"LEON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2385,"title":"The Alston-Ward Duel\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-01","end_date":"1837-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["At long last George T. Ward would have his satisfaction. Ward blamed his younger brother's death on Augustus Alston. Ward's anger had been building for months but soon he would have a chance to quench insatiable desire for revenge. The venue was none other than Tallahassee's unofficial dueling ground Houston's Hill. For Ward, Alston's actions disrespected his family and violated his honor. This merited only one outcome in his mind, and so the fight was to be to the death. The princpals were placed 30 yards apart. A small barrier marked the middle, a point to which they could advance but not cross. Alston and Ward's exposed forearms revealed their sun darkened Floridian skin. Clutched in each participant's hands was what each considered the means to their adversary's death. In addition, wrapped around their waists was a silk scarf which held two more pistols, bringing the total to eight: four shots per person. The rules were simple and well known to both. After each shot they were to advance and fire again until one or both were dead.","As soon as the signal was shown, the two adversaries rushed at each other. Alston, having been on crutches several months before the duel due to an unhealed gunshot wound, sauntered forward awkwardly. Within seconds the two were less than ten paces apart. Firing initiated. Ward got off the first shot. The bullet found its way into the Alston's pistol belt. Alston's first and second shots followed in quick succession but both missed. Frustrated and coming closer to Ward with each hobbled step, Alston pulled his third pistol to fire, but nothing screamed forth from the barrel. Having failed with his first three, Alston frantically fired his fourth.

The much relived Alston cried out in jubilation, I have killed him Ward, concentrating all his remaining will power and strength, slowly rose from the ground. Patiently taking aim, Ward fired at Alton, hitting him in the arm. Ward having fired his third, fell to the ground, too tired to fire his fourth.

However, before such a time, Alston was killed in another duel.","Though duels occurred above the Mason-Dixon Line, dueling was slower to die out in the antebellum South. Whether arising from a need for revenge, political disputes or the defense family reputation, all duels could be traced back to one thing: honor. To antebellum southerners, life itself was less precious than honor. President Andrew Jackson himself believed slander a worse crime than murder because murder took only life, while slander took honor. Since honor was a system were one's value was based upon others' opinions of him, oft quoted community leaders like politicians and newspaper editors participated in a large proportion of duels. Though some southern states passed laws prohibiting dueling, North Carolina first in 1802, and others to follow, these laws were easily circumvented by blood thirsty duelists. Duelers would travel across state lines, fight in the middle of rivers that acted as state borders, journey to uninhabited islands, or when all else failed, travel to a deeply secluded spot. Eventually, as members of southern society began to realize the costly loss of influential community members, dueling stopped."],"display_date":1837,"search_date":"1837-07-02","locations":[{"id":1393,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"LEON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2390,"title":"Interracial Shootout Leaves Two Dead\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-12-28","end_date":"1881-12-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Joel Johnson, a well-known citizen of Baldwin County, Alabama, was riding quietly along a public road near Sibley's Mill. Unexpectedly, an African American hiding behind a tree shot Johnson in the head, stunning him and throwing him from his horse. The black man then shot him twice more, first in the wrist and again in the side. Taking him for dead, the assailant dragged Johnson three-hundred yards to a nearby pond, dumping his body in the water. The African American then mounted Johnson's horse and rode off to a party in the neighborhood nearby. Unfortunately for the shooter, the night air somehow revived Joel Johnson and the injured man was able to drag himself back to his home, half a mile away. Johnson related the story to his brother, Abe, who happened to be the Baldwin County Deputy Sheriff. Abe Johnson heard reports that the black man had been seen on his brother's horse, so he set off to arrest the attacker. The sheriff found the man at Jim Malone's home, within the county, and when he tried to arrest the black man, he drew his pistol. Deputy Sheriff Johnson then shot him, whereupon the African American shot right back, the bullet piercing Abe Johnson's chest. The black man then ran, and the sheriff attempted to run after him, shooting once more. The shooter managed to escape, and Abe Johnson perished fifteen minutes later. The black assailant was found dead at four o'clock the following afternoon by onlookers who had developed a search party. He had been shot through the breast and the wrist, and had managed to run half a mile alongside a creek, until he fell into a swamp and died.","After emancipation and during the early years of Reconstruction, there were frequent instances of interracial violence in the South. Episodes like the Johnson men's encounter with a black criminal were especially common in rural areas of the South, where law enforcement in the tumultuous post-war atmosphere was particularly difficult. Some accounts of the Reconstruction years have emphasized the presence of black militiamen and created a false sense among Americans that blacks were out looking to start conflict with whites. There were some blacks who used theft or arson as a means of protest against white oppression, as the black thief in Baldwin County may have intended to, but this was not the norm. Rather, African Americans were usually trying to build new lives as freedmen, not avenge the masters of their pasts. In fact, most of the violence during Reconstruction came from bitter, defeated white Southerners who clung to their support of black enslavement. The concept of white supremacy versus black criminality and inferiority was pervasive in regions like the Gulf Coast. A large Southern crime wave in the late nineteenth century contributed to the tumultuous racial climate, causing an increase in the frequency of lynchings and other forms of interracial violence. Since there were so many African Americans in jails, whites felt there was no doubt that blacks were responsible for the increase in crime rate. This justification further added to the number of violent encounters between the races, such as the shootout between the Johnson brothers and their black assailant.

The warden of the jail posted in the Nashville Union a 50 Reward to anyone who could find him. Though Reddick found a way out, Jail breaks actually were not common in the Nashville penitentiary. The economical statistics 1861 in the Nashville Annual Almanac recorded only one escape in 1857, and Reddick was the only escape in 1859. The Nashville penitentiary worked hard since the beginning of the nineteenth century to reform their jail system. In 1829, the legislature approved of a new jail in Nashville that opened in 1831. It consisted of two hundred cells, hospital, storage and warden's room. Upon opening the prison, the legislature put a new code reform into effect that abolished whipping, branding, the pillory and the use of stocks, as well as any other unusual crimes. From the time of its establishment until 1859 there had been a total 2,052 convicts. "," Convictions ranged from a multitude of crimes, the majority being grand and petit larceny, counterfeiting, and horse or slave stealing. Shootings convictions made up only 22 of those 2,052 convicts. Reddick's crime was not common, and neither was his escape.

The townsmen that entered requested that Sterne issue a warrant for the arrest of William Simons. They informed Sterne that Simons had tried to kill a free African American blacksmith named William Goyens. Sterne did as the men asked and then did not hear about Goyens or Simons for the rest of the evening. The next day Sterne learned that the gunshot wound Goyens received had not been fatal and that he was expected to recover. This episode related in Sterne's diary over a two day period is interesting because of the editorial inserts Sterne made. On August 27, 1842, when he first heard about the attempted murder, he interjected, Several People in Town all very merry. Then on August 28, he said that the wound Goyens received was not enough to do any good. These comments Sterne made are telling of the mindset toward Goyens. Sterne made no record of any personal grievances with Goyens, but it is clear that he was not on good terms with him, nor was he popular in town. This attitude may have stemmed from Goyens's position as a free black man and slave owner.","The feeling of Texans toward free blacks during the Texas Republic was one of fear and distrust. According to Clayton E. Jewett and John O. Allen, Many Texans feared that the existence of a free black population would undermine the institution of slavery. To guard against free blacks living in Texas and being a bad influence on slaves, Texas required free blacks to obtain permission from Congress to live in Texas. During the early 1840s measures to prevent free black occupation of Texas increased. President Mirabeau B. Lamar gave the order that all free blacks had to leave Texas by January 1, 1842. Luckily for the free black population, Sam Houston repealed this law upon his reelection in 1842 and allowed free blacks to remain in Texas. ","The shooting of Goyens occurred right in the time period of the early 1840s when Lamar had decided to crack down on the free blacks in Texas. The bad feelings of white Texans toward the repeal of Lamar's law could be the reason for the joy of the townspeople at the shooting and Sterne's disappointment at the murder being unsuccessful. To add to their dislike was that Goyens owned some slaves himself. The presence of a free black man was bad enough, but the presence of a free black slave owner would have been too much for some. Goyens showed that there were opportunities for blacks outside of slavery, a notion dangerous to a society built on the enslaving of black men and women.

Wesleyan Methodist preacher Jesse McBride had stirred too much controversy among whites and slaves in Guilford County.  Intending to run McBride out of the county, about two-hundred men gathered on May 23, 1851 outside of the church where he would preach that morning.  For six hours McBride had been on the road, not finishing the 18 mile journey to his Liberty Hill congregation outside of Greensboro until a few minutes before noon.  Accounts of the exchange between McBride and the disgruntled locals vary according to source.  The mob leader and slave-owner Hoover blocked McBride from entering the church.  McBride appears to have kept a cool head in the confrontation: he drew upon scriptural resources, he induced his congregation to sing hymns in front of the increasingly frustrated mob, and he conducted his congregation in prayers. Without personal violence or abuse according to the local <em>Greensboro Patriot</em>, but with considerable, drunken man-handling according to McBride's personal account in the abolitionist <em>Liberator</em>, the mob shoved McBride into his carriage.  He rode away.  Sometime immediately thereafter, local powers obtained his pledge in writing to depart Guilford County within a week.  McBride returned to Ohio.  The <em>Liberator</em> published his first account on June 20 and then a more elaborate version on August 15.  The <em>Greensboro Patriot </em>expressed relief and anticipated a return to tranquility in its brief account of the incident.  ","The creed of Wesleyan Methodists involved an antislavery stance, and for this reason many whites no longer tolerated McBride's growing influence among the Christian circles of Guilford and Stokes Counties.  On May 18, Reverend Hines of the Methodist Episcopal Church had stated the deleterious effects of McBride's sermons in a meeting.  Local officials held another meeting in Greensboro on May 20 for the purpose of suppressing abolition agitation.  During the meeting, McBride was implicated directly for interfering with the property rights of local slave-owners.  He had created enemies among nervous slave-holders and among vexed preachers whose congregations were splintering over slavery.","Beginning with zeal in 1831, when William Lloyd Garrison began publishing the <em>Liberator</em>, and gaining controversial attention in the wake of Nat Turner's 1831 rebellion, the Abolition crusade began making its presence felt among slave-holders.  Because Southern churches' policies accommodated slavery, the Methodist Church split in 1844, and supporters of slavery established the Methodist Episcopal Church.  This episode in McBride's career strengthens Donald Matthews' description of the brave extension of the Evangelical ethos beyond the internal life of the believer and into social relationships. McBride's<em> Wesleyan</em> sect of Methodism, which threatened excommunication to those who would not emancipate their slaves within two years, scared slaveholders with its judgmental views.  McBride's brave efforts to nurture an anti-slavery parish illustrate both the active efforts of anti-slavery ideology and the physical resistance these efforts met from pro-slavery interests."],"display_date":"May 18, 1851 - August 15, 1851","search_date":"1851-07-01","locations":[{"id":9489,"lat":36.0793885003,"lng":-79.7889995015,"zoom":9,"place":"GUILFORD, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2439,"title":"Kidnapped African American Girl Returned to Missouri\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-01-01","end_date":"1871-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" In 1868, a young African American girl was kidnapped from her home in St. Louis, ","Missouri and sold into slavery in Cuba.

The alleged acts of fraud were investigated by the House Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Justice as early as July 1, 1870. The purpose of the investigation was the look into discrepancies of the district's expenses and general management. The House Committee on Expenditures found that the expenses of the Western District were quite large and not all of these expenses were supported by the proper expense vouchers. A clear example of creative accounting was present in the expense report for the year ending June 30, 1871. There were disbursements of 137,958, with 95,195 going to William A. Britton and the other 42,763 going to Logan H. Roots, a marshal with one months experience. At the end of the next fiscal year, the expenditures for Root managed to climb up to 321,653. Not only had the western district over paid several deputies and marshals but the committee also discovered that there were payments going out to fraudulent deputies as well. The total expenditures for the three years of the investigation of the western district totaled over 750,000. ","In order to attempt to fix the stench in the nostrils of the community, the House Committee on Expenses recommended that the Western District of Arkansas be dissolved and annexed to the Eastern District so that there would be one federal district and one judge for Arkansas. Corruption problems plagued many other areas in the South besides Arkansas courts. In the Supreme Court of Missouri case The State of Missouri vs. Collier, Collier was guilty of bribing an election official 2,600 (of which he took 1,200) to take out 200 of the votes that would have been for Collier's rival in the race for county Probate Judge. After the western district's own corruption scandal under Judge Story, the court continued to function. During Judge Isaac Parker's term from 1873 to 1896, the western district was known as one of the most criminal and violent districts. During this time, no less than 65 deputy United States marshals were killed in the line of duty. The violent elements of the crimes committed in the early stages of the western district also led to violent consequences for the offenders. As Herndon writes, the western district came to have the reputation as having convicted and executed more murderers than any other court had ever done in the history of the world in a like period. These harsh punishments were eventually able to improve conditions in the state as there was a great improvement in the crime rate in the western district by the turn of the twentieth century."],"display_date":"July 1, 1870 - July 1, 1873","search_date":"1871-12-30","locations":[{"id":662,"lat":36.0043370055,"lng":-93.7250552918,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2444,"title":"Jesse James Killed\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-04-03","end_date":"1882-04-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Jesse James, the wanted bandit and train robber, was killed in his home in St. Joseph, ","Missouri the morning of April 3, 1882.

The case stated that in St. Louis, Missouri in January 1862, the defendant had trespassed on the property of the plaintiff while the defendant was a soldier in the Union Army during the Civil War. Though the plaintiff sought damages for the trespassing, the defendant claimed that he was protected under Section 4, Article 11 of the Constitution of the State of Missouri. According to court documents, Section 4 of the Missouri Constitution exempts persons from liability for acts done during the recent civil war, by virtue of the military authority vested in them by the government of the United States, or in the pursuance of an order received from any person vested with such authority, is valid, and protects from prosecution or actions for all who can show for their acts the authorization of a military officer, acting under the command-in-chief of the army of the United States. The defendant claimed that at the time of the trespass a state of civil war existed, martial law had been declared, and his actions were assessments of orders given by the general of the army of the United States who was in charge of Missouri. Finally, the defendant insisted that he was under the protection of the Act of Congress of 1863 which instituted a two year limitation clause on cases arising from the Civil War. The opinion of the court, written by Justice Miller, stated that the defendant was indeed a Union soldier and would be protected under law as such. In regard to the Act of Congress of 1863 which set the two year limitation, the court stated that it cannot be assumed that Acts of Congress only apply to the federal courts. Its final ruling decreed that all cases involving the legitimacy of the limitations placed on such cases by Acts of Congress be decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. "," In 1861 and 1862, the United States Congress and President Lincoln instituted the First and Second Confiscation Acts. The First Confiscation Act stated that while there was a state of insurgency against the United States, Union soldiers were allowed to seize property of known Confederates. During this time, Parrish states that Union officers, such as General Halleck in Missouri, would underwrite costs, by the charity of men known to be hostile to the Union. The Second Confiscation Act was one of the first enforcements of emancipating slaves as it said that any Confederate who did not surrender within 60 days would be punished by having his slaves freed by Union forces.

The city's two main roads were still, the farms and fields hot with the summer sun; the rural environment uninterrupted. The only sound for miles was that of a train barreling down the Rome and Dalton railroad.","The events both inside and outside of the train did not reflect the peace and quiet that lent itself to Patona. Earlier that morning, a fight had erupted inside the train between a white boy and a black man. The assault escalated when the train came to a stop at Patona/Cross Plains and others joined in on the fray. It was not until later in the evening that Green Little, a former slave mustered up a small army of men to continue the day's events at Cross Plains. William Luke, an Irishman, an immigrant and a Methodist minister did his best to persuade Little not to settle the score. The pistol-touting Little refused to listen and continued on as the night grew dark and sticky with the evening heat. ","Hearing the news of an imminent attack, members of the local Methodist Church began to flee. Commotion ensued, bullets whipped the wind and gunfire could be heard for miles. For 48-hours Cross Plains was in distress. Women and children sought safety while their men combated neighbors in the streets. The chaos was quieted by Major Bailey, a confederate veteran and a current administrator at the local school house. Bailey took measures to turn the prisoners over to the sheriff and the men involved in the conflict were then escorted down the tree-lined streets of Cross Plains. They were quarantined and questioned in the schoolhouse. The instigator, Green Little was no where to be found. ","The local sheriff started his questioning about the incident with William Luke who immediately admitted his role. Luke had sold the pistols to the black men of Patona, making him liable for the incident. Witnesses gathered and a disorganized trial commenced. The evening grew dark and the hour late, accordingly the trial ceased and was scheduled to resume the next day. It was at this late hour, when bystanders had returned to their homes, that local members of the Klu Klux Klan executed a vicious plan. The Klan, known for their racial hatred and violence, hid armed in the shadows as the prisoners settled in for what would be, unbeknownst to them, the last night of their lives. ","The Klansmen attacked the prisoners, hitting and dragging them down the street and well across the railroad tracks. The mob stopped upon reaching the edge of town at Prior's Station. Torches lit, ropes in hand, the Klansmen prepared to exterminate Luke and his black counterparts. Three blacks hanged first, followed by two more. Luke was allowed enough time to write his wife. In his letter, he claimed he his death was deserved and God would certainly forgive him. The executioners had been quick to kill the black men, but one of their own, Luke, white male, took consideration. Luke was hanged in a different fashion and even in death received better treatment than the black men around him. On the morning of July 12, 1870, the day following the attacks, all was reported as quiet at the Plains. ","The incident at Cross Plains exemplified the deep-seeded hatred that continued to plague certain sections of southern states. Calhoun County, Alabama was no exception. Factions of the Klu Klux Klan could be found in every former confederate state. Similar incidents, like that of Cross Plains, occurred with regularity in other areas.

Prior to the Civil War, women were keepers of the home. The average, middle-class women raised the children, kept the home and prepared the meals. Both before and after the Civil War, women were subservient to men and their marriages were entirely patriarchal.","Of course, there are exceptions to every rule - George Fulgham's wife was one of them. In October of 1871, a verdict was handed down in the Fulgham vs. the State of Alabama. In this case George Fulgham's privileges and rights as a husband were in question despite his race and status. ","It was early 1871 when George Fulgham, an emancipated slave, was discovered beating his children. The discovery was made by his wife, another emancipated slave. The wife interrupted midway through the flogging. When she voiced her distress over the excessive punishment, Fulgham turned the whip on his wife, striking her twice on the back. Fulgham's wife bravely reported the incident and once in court lawyers for both the complainant, Mrs. Fulgham and the accused, Mr. Fulgham, argued a number of different points. The case focused primarily on the right of chastisement. The right of chastisement refers to a man's limited ability to discipline his wife and family. Prior to Fulgham, a husband not only had the ability to physically reprimand his spouse but he also acquired the rights to his wife's person, the value of both her paid and unpaid labor, and as well as any property that accompanied their nuptials. ","Sex and class equality certainly served as social landmarks for what was acceptable and unacceptable behavior. However, incidents in the home blurred the line between private behavior and public record. Accordingly, justices hearing the case were asked to take into account what qualified as appropriate both in and outside the home. What could be questioned about the closed-door occurrences in private quarters? The significance of class was also questioned. Citizens of lower classes, who simply did not know better, could possibly be exempt from the law due to mere ignorance. Fulgham not only recognized class and gender but race as well. Justices in the case were asked to consider whether or not black relationships were inherently different from white relationships.","The case was on appeal in the Alabama Supreme Court when it reached its final verdict as to the validity of the right of chastisement. The verdict came down on October 6, 1871, essentially in favor of the woman, Mrs. Fulgham. The court claimed that the rule of love superseded the rule of force by denying the privilege of brutality against women.","The Fulgham case, while significant for its time, proved to serve as precedent for later and similar cases at the turn of the century. The verdict provided precedent for gender equality in male and female marital relationship cases to come.

An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was excessive amounts of laudanum in their stomachs. The town was outraged and astonished. Who would commit such a heinous crime? The members of the community greatly respected the Braden family, and mourned their loss. A carpenter who was in the house that morning remembered seeing a seamstress, Mrs. Gray, preparing coffee for the family. After the carpenter left the house, he saw Mrs. Gray hurriedly walking down the street. Later that day, the neighbor found the bodies. The town formed search parties, and soon they found a frail, terrified woman in the woods surrounding town. Portsmouth had found its murderer.","Mrs. Gray was actually Maria Black Thorn, a woman who led a very troubled past. Maria was traveling on a boat to New York City when it stopped for repairs in Portsmouth. In ill health and lacking money, Thorn stayed in Portsmouth, and found a job working for the Braden family. During the trial, Thorn revealed that the Bradens' deaths had been unintentional. The night before the family was found dead, she had stolen 500 dollars from the house. With this money, Thorn intended to leave Portsmouth and make her way to New York City. Thorn deposited laudanum in the coffee to put the family to sleep during her getaway, not kill them. Nonetheless, the jury of Portsmouth sentenced Thorn to death. Thorn became very ill after the trial, and stayed in her prison cell for months awaiting her execution. The town never received a chance to hang Maria Black Thorn though, as a guard found her dead in her prison cell on March 20, 1855. She had committed suicide.","Bizarre murders like the Thorn case rattled the security of a community. The fear and confusion that arose left the town in an unsettled state. People grew suspicious of each other, and the citizens lost their mutual trust. Thorn's trial reveals the necessary actions taken by a local court to stabilize the community after such an event. Ill and poor, Thorn had no intentions of murdering the family. Nonetheless, the court gave the only sentence that could possibly compensate for the death of Portsmouth citizens-death. Though Thorn was a woman, she was an outsider to the community, and the court's objective was to restore peace and trust within the town. Therefore, no lenience was shown. ","The Thorn case correlates to a situation that Rothman examines in Notorious in the Neighborhood. In the case of Peggy, a sexually abused slave who was an accomplice in her master's murder, similarities arise between the two situations. Constantly raped by her master, Peggy lived a harsh life, and probably deserved to murder her master. However, the testimonies of the involved slaves leave uncertainty surrounding Peggy's role in the murder. Similar to the Thorn case, doubt surrounds the motive of the murder, and the woman's lifestyle is almost unbearable. After her sentencing, many citizens petitioned for her acquittal, citing her living condition and uncertain role in her master's death. Nonetheless, the court of New Kent County, Virginia hung Peggy to restore harmony to the town. Both cases reveal a local court's social duty to re-establish order in the community. In tight-knit communities, it was the court's role to maintain justice and stability within society. Violent acts of crime weakened people's feeling of security, and increased their suspicions of outsiders. In Thorn's case, the people of Portsmouth were more fearful of outsiders to their community; in Peggy's, her master's murder brought slave owners' fears of slave retaliation to reality. Citizens had sympathy for both women, but the death sentence was the only option-lenience was not. Though the accused were both women, the community took precedence. In order to uphold the safety and security of the society, both courts took the necessary action by issuing death sentences to the women.

The captured Irishmen werent jailed for long because a force of nearly 400 marched through the town to rescue the captured men.

The regions mail carrier, Mr. Hipps was making his route towards Georgetown on a Saturday afternoon when his mail carriage was robbed and he was murdered.  When members of the community noticed that the mail carriage hadnt arrived, a number of men went out on their horses to check on the delay.  These men encountered wheel tracks and followed them, promptly finding the upturned carriage.  The letters it once carried were strewn across the ground and torn apart.  Nearby, laid Mr. Hippss corpse.  The incident greatly upset the town.  Mr. Hipps had garnered tremendous respect in the short time he resided there and was sorely missed. The antebellum South, and South Carolina in particular, was a region characterized by crime and lethal violence.  Assault crimes were the most common in eighteenth and nineteenth century South Carolina while the instances of property crimes were strikingly low, thereby conforming to the stereotype of Southern violence.  During the first half of the nineteenth century, South Carolina indicted one out of 334 people in the state.  Law enforcement was in effect, however, few legally appointed officials resided outside the Charleston area, leaving regions such as Georgetown particularly vulnerable.  Kenny Williams investigated the consequences of the absence of legal authority throughout the state.  Some South Carolinians took police duties upon themselves.  This was especially true in areas outside of Charleston, where there were few law enforcement representatives protecting the area.Whenever a demand for authority existed but was not satisfied by existing legal structures, extralegal forms were likely to emerge, justified by the claim that they provided a remedy not given by law.  Notions of honor, class deference, and race control all encouraged the growth of extralegal and informal action.

He needed to make a few purchases, namely tools and home goods. While in town Pitts noticed a few stores had closed signs in the window. Upon returning home to his plantation, Pitts entered in his diary, Thursday Holy day among the Jews - All places of business closed among them this day...and this is new year with them... While it remains unclear whether Pitts referred to the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, or Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish days, his observance of this Jewish tradition positively identified a Jewish population living and working in Perry County, Alabama in 1882. Pitts concluded his diary entry by listing the various goods he purchased including a brass handle and a monkey wrench. ","Jewish immigration into the South was divided into four phases from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century. Jewish immigration to Alabama began in the late nineteenth century during the third wave of Jewish settlement in the South. Abraham Mordecai was the first European Jew to travel further west of the early centers of Jewish life in Savannah and Charleston. While the exact date of his arrival is unknown, he settled in what would become Montgomery, Alabama in 1880, pushing the Jewish population further into the South. ","As Jewish immigrants continued to settle in the South, they progressively gained economic influence in society. According to social historian Ralph Melnick, the collapse of the rural plantation system transferred economic and political power to southern cities and townships. With this economic shift, the Jewish population began to earn clout working as professionals, businessmen, mill operators, commodity brokers, and farm owners. In these roles Jewish workers increased their economic status in times of relative instability throughout the South. Reconstruction and the depression of the 1890s further increased Jewish wealth as they continually offered incentives over gentile competition. Jewish business transactions were strictly cash-only, eliminating the vicious cycle of debt for the consumer and decreasing the merchants' risk of financial loss. The economic prosperity enjoyed by these southern working Jews unfortunately led to an increase of anti-Semitism and resentment across the South. ","  Between 1848 and 1980 Alabama lost half its Jewish population to bigotry and hate crimes. In 1868, the Ku Klux Klan was founded in Memphis, Tennessee and formally began its reign of terror throughout the South. In 1871, the KKK publicly murdered a Jewish shopkeeper in Memphis and established the Jewish population as a target of the organization. Though many Jews fled both Alabama and the South others remained. Despite anti-Semitic sentiments in the South, many Jewish families lingered in the region of their American roots.

J.M Neal purchased a large amount of corn from Trice and stayed at the store until 1A.M. when he boarded a train for Pulaski, Tennessee.  Authorities suspected that Warren and his accomplices entered the store at 2 A.M and killed Trice in order to rob the store of money and dry goods. Locals discovered that a  rainy night left footprints leading to Warren's house.  Before authorities could question the African American community, a mob took Warren a mile down the road and hanged him.       Despite the circumstantial evidence facing Warren for the murder of a white man, blacks rarely experienced justice in courtrooms when the crime involved a white man.  Southerners who favored lynching worried that a lengthy jail sentenced prolonged death and allowed African Americans to seek divine forgiveness. Warren's case was just one of several thousand lynching cases after the Civil War.  In many cases, angry mobs grabbed the first black man a bloodhound came across. Before trials could occur, mobs stormed jails and grabbed black men.  Local  judges and police were either involved or submitted to  mob  justice.       With the promise of racial equality created by voting rights, lynching attempted to create the same racial order that existed under slavery. Lynching was rare before the Civil War because slaveholders did not want to destroy their own property.  After Emancipation, Southern whites feared that the younger generation of African Americans born outside of slavery had not yet learned the code of deference and submission in the South. One black observer believed that lynching set an example, knowing full well that one Negro swinging from a tree will serve as well as another to terrorize the community.        Rural areas such as Warren County in Tennessee typically had the highest numbers of lynchings in the South.  There were strong racial tensions in rural areas where there was an influx of new African American settlers that the white community was unfamiliar with. These strange niggers, as they were labeled, did not have anyone in the white or black community to vouch for their character.   Southern Kentucky, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas were rural states  that also had the highest lynching rates in the South.    In Warren County, it would have been difficult for law enforcement to protect Wesley from a furious mob.  Since the majority of lynching occurred in secrecy at remote locations in the South, historians will never know the exact number of lynching victims, but they estimate that it was around five thousand.

The Union troops arrived at her home and stole guns, clothing, bonds, and the watches from two slaves, Sue and Mammy E. Louisa was so alarmed at their behavior that she was afraid for her safety. She found Union officers who protected her, but the threat of violence from Union soldiers was real. Louisa Minor experienced fear that day felt all over the South as Union and Confederate troops passed through widespread communities. Like others, Louisa Minor remained defiant.","The destructive force the war had for civilians surfaced as early as in Fredericksburg, Virginia between December 11 and 15 1862. Fredericksburg had been occupied by Confederate sharpshooters slowing the Union advance, so the Union troops probably felt justified in their action. Looting in the town occurred to a severe degree as the entire contents of houses was thrown into the street. The greatest loss felt by southern women like Louisa Minor was the loss of loved ones on the battlefield. Among Virginians alone, 20-30,000 men died in the war, while by 1862 alone there were 42,000 claims for back-pay by families of deceased soldiers. The suffering and fear felt by Louisa Minor and her family in Albemarle County was just a small part of the broader suffering the war brought to American civilians.","Louisa Minor's personal humiliation at the hands of Union troops repeated itself all across the Confederacy, as the movements of Union and Confederate armies initiated destruction of civilian property from Virginia to Louisiana. In Virginia, Gen. Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864 devastated that area's ability to provide food for the Confederacy. Sheridan waged war on the ability of the Confederate population to resist, a method emulated all over the Confederacy by Union forces. Significant resistance by Confederate guerillas forced Sheridan to be even more extreme. Between late September and late October 1864 Sheridan systematically destroyed the Shenandoah Valley's ability to feed Confederate troops. Far from Virginia Benjamin Butler brought the war to the doorstep of Confederate civilians early in the Civil War by confiscating private property in New Orleans after the Union took that city in 1862. Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson's offensive into northern Alabama in 1864 was actually more severe than Sherman's in Georgia though it achieved less renown. Confederate units and deserters from both sides also inflicted severe hardship on the Confederate civilian population. When Louisa Minor's property was taken from her in early 1865, she became one more of the many thousands like her who had experienced the full destructive force of the Civil War.

Republicans charged that the Ku Klux Klan intimidated both white and black voters on behalf of the Democratic Party.  In that election, C.A Sheafe won close election 44176 to 3810, but the Republicans should have won a landslide with 7,800 newly registered black voters.  The House of Representatives agreed with the conclusion of widespread voter intimidation and passed a resolution that gave the seat to the Republicans.","To verify the Republican's claim of voter intimidation, officials interviewed numerous voters representing both parties and the evidence showed the KKK did prevent Republicans from reaching the polls. George McMichael, a former slave from Coffee County, reported that he returned home after voting for the Republican ticket and found the Klan waiting for him.  They tied him down on a log and whipped him two hundred times.  An African American by the name of Washington Ore testified that The Klan surrounded his home, but he escaped by jumping through his window. He said, they shot two shots at me, but did not hit me at that time. When he returned to his house, his crops were torn to pieces in retaliation for his Republican vote.  Although the Klan was a small organization that was unpopular in the early 1870s,  the organization gained strength and helped the Democrats win back the state government  by the late 1870s. ","Horace Maynard and the Republicans' effort to secure black voting rights in Tennessee was a political struggle in a divided region. The emergence of seven thousand new black voters threatened to break the even division between Republicans on the eastern part of the state and the agricultural interests of middle Tennessee.  Tennessee had a history as a moderate state before the Civil War when it voted for the Constitutional Union Party candidate John Bell instead of the Democrats. The same radical group of Democrats that pushed the moderate state of Tennessee into the Civil War, turned to violence in the postwar years to prevent a Republican advantage. Each party tried to forcefully keep the other away from the polls.  George Brunlow disfranchised the old Democrats until 1867. Once the Democrats, returned to the polls, Brunlow reluctantly gave African Americans the right to vote in order to solidify Republican power.  Tennessee was the first state in the South to take the monumental step to allow African Americans to vote.  When the Klan desperately resorted to violence and intimidation to gain a political advantage, Governor Brunlow, refused to certify the results in Tillman vs. Sheafe election.  He stated,  the votes cast for a candidate are illegal and his election void and that the KKK have used violence and other means of intimidation to deter legal voters from exercising franchisement.  With a slim majority threatened, Republicans fought to secure black voting rights for political reasons rather than the moral cause of equality.  Similarly, the Klan showed that they were not primarily motivated by race when they attacked large numbers of white and black Republicans.  Tennessee Republicans were more concerned with building new industry than the impoverished condition of African Americans that did not improve under their administration.  Republicans knew that the Party of Lincoln did not need to help African Americans to guarantee their votes on election day.

The slave did not deny his crime and appeared to show no remorse at the time of his execution. The only excuse offered by Dave for this gruesome act was that he had been drinking before the time the act was committed. Those who were there to witness his hanging claimed that his demeanor was indifferent towards his fate, and that he even dared to smile at times. Between the daytime hours of twelve and two, Dave was publicly hung by the town sheriff. The body dangled for thirty minutes before it was cut down and buried. Upon his burial, many physicians from neighboring towns rushed to his grave site to be the first to claim the body for dissection. ","We do not know anything of the events that induced Dave to murder his master. Since Dave offered no excuse for his crime, one can only speculate upon his possible stimulus. Dave could have murdered him for any number of reasons. A sexual advance on a loved one by his owner, persuasion by another white man, or any other perceived injustice brought upon him could have provoked Dave to commit this deed. ","However valid the crime's impetus, the murder of a white man at the hands of a slave or person of color was considered a serious offense punishable by death. Historian Joshua Rothman argues that although most African Americans who murdered their masters were sentenced to hang, many were not forced to endure this harsh sentence due to the intervention of other whites in the town who could vouch for the particular slave's character. In the instance of Dave, however, this intervention did not occur. From the tone of the article announcing the hanging, Dave showed no remorse for what he had done. His indifferent attitude, the lack of significant reason for the crime he committed, and the apparent lack of respect received from the members of the white community most likely did not lend itself to an appeal for a more lenient sentence."],"display_date":"November 17, 1848","search_date":"1848-11-17","locations":[{"id":12441,"lat":36.2251619225,"lng":-82.4967689306,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2574,"title":"The Pains of Being a Democrat in Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-11-01","end_date":"1856-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1855, John Sergeant Wise, the young son of the newly elected Governor Henry Wise, was desperately trying to adapt to his new home in Richmond, Virginia.  Having previously come from a rural town, John Wise was mocked by his schoolmates for being a provincial bumpkin.  However, most of the abuse from his fellow students was due to his father's political persuasion as a Democrat.  In one particular passage of his writing, he recounted how his days as a schoolboy in Richmond were comprised of deflecting taunts, and fighting off bullying from the sons of Whig and Know-Nothing citizens who were instilled with a hatred of all things Democrat.  At this time, the Whigs had essentially joined forces with the new American, or Know-Nothing Party, against the Democrats.  Many of Henry Wise's votes had come from the rural Virginia farmers and yeoman, while Richmond itself was a stronghold of Know-Nothingism.  "," The American Party, also known as the Know-Nothings, began in 1855.  It was founded along the lines of a secret society with elaborate initiation rituals, and a series of secret passwords and coded communications between its members.  Its platform was essentially radical nationalism that included anti-immigration and anti-Catholicism stances.  As the Whig party began to slowly loose strength in the United States, members often threw their allegiance to the Know-Nothing Party in an attempt to continue fighting the Democrats.

The Tennessee Historical Society hoped  that the exposition would show the future of the South and respect or a proud military history.  Local businesses shut down as a military and civic parade marched down the street.   The most popular exhibit was an exotic Egyptian mummy display and a collection of other antiquities which furthered the description of Nashville as The Athens of the South.  Despite this show of progress and innovations, the conception of The New South was mired in the hypocrisy of lynching.        Southern Industrial Expositions  were intended to show a balance between innovation and a reverence for traditional values.  Former editor of The Atlanta Constitution, Henry Grady, illustrated the balance between the two seemingly contradictory values.  He believed that the South could embrace industry while being proud of its military and agricultural history.  He acknowledged that decades of slavery prevented southern industry from developing.  He and many other southerners believed that racial problems improved since emancipation. The goal was to portray a stable environment that would attract northern investors to capitalize to the large labor force in the South.   The reality was that beneath the pomp and circumstance of the military and industrial parades was the same underlying problem of terrible race relations of the slave South.       Textile mills, sawmills, cotton processing, and other industries developed faster than the North, but the region remained predominately agricultural in nature.   Despite new innovations, southern cities were nowhere near as technological as northern cities.  Nashville was one of the first southern cities to have streetlights by 1880. Most of the area around Nashville remained reliant on the typical  commodities of the Old South  such as cotton and tobacco.  New industrial farming technology actually hurt the cotton economy by creating overproduction and, consequently, lower cotton prices.  Despite industrial expositions in Nashville proclaiming change in the South, the region was still plagued by the same racism and agricultural economy of the Old South.  The Steubenville Daily Herald from Ohio highlighted the contradiction that lynching represented in the  plan for the New South.  In the ideology of the lost cause, southerners fantasized that the Confederacy failed because they lacked the industrial capabilities of the north.   The acceptance of widespread segregation and violence beginning in the early 1870s showed that white southerners were not interested in changing every aspect of the  South."],"display_date":"September 10, 1874","search_date":"1874-09-10","locations":[{"id":12005,"lat":35.1672648222,"lng":-86.1060239614,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2583,"title":"The Gruesome History of a Wartime Steamboat\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1864-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The Civil War diary of John L.

Creek fatally shot Thomas Lyons after refusing to surrender to the prowlers who attempted to burn down his cabin.  The Williamson County Journal's editor reacted with rage at what he viewed as intolerable lawlessness on the part of the band of young prowlers.  Although the white man Lyons was killed, the editor argued that Isaac Creek deserved the same right to protect his property from criminals that the law guaranteed regardless of color.  The editor proclaimed that the  whites who perpetrated the crime  disgraced the soil of our good county.         The editor of the Williamson County Journal felt that Isaac Creek's property rights were more important than upholding white supremacy.  Only six years earlier, Tennessee lost thousands of men fighting to preserve the property rights of all southern slaveholders.   Regardless of color, most whites supported anyone's right to self-defense from lawless criminals in the unpopular Ku Klux Klan. In the 1870s, the fact that Creek was a black who murdered a white man did not define the editor's opinion. The decade following the Civil War was before disfranchisement and legalized segregation made race the defining issue  southern justice.  Unlike The Atlanta Constitution that glorified racial violence, newspapers around the state of Tennessee condemned the  emerging Ku Klux Klan.  A large segment of the population of Tennessee were former Union loyalists and Republicans who were equally threatened by attacks from the Klan. The editor of the Williamson County Journal applauded Isaac Creek because the local community valued property rights and legal order more than upholding the racial order.         Stories such as Isaac Creek's show that race was not the defining issue of southern legal rights in the 1870s. During reconstruction, African Americans voted and gained representation in most southern states.  Tennessee was the first state to allow African Americans to vote in 1867.  Once union troops left the South in the late 1860s, former Confederates once again seized the power in the government.  Democrats ushered in a violent period of segregation and lynching that lasted until the Civil Rights Act of 1964.   Cases where African Americans had the same legal rights show that segregation and disfranchisement  were not  inevitable outcomes of emancipation.   Southerners defended the long historical emphasis of property rights regardless of color.

It detailed the departure by rail of elements of Richmond's volunteer militia regiment, men who were being sent to suppress the insurrection that was taking place. The readers were also stunned to read that the governor of Virginia had ordered the men to Harpers Ferry himself; they were not called up by the federal government, which had already dispatched its own troops, US Marines under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee.  Furthermore, Governor Henry Wise accompanied the vanguard units on a commandeered mail train to the scene of the action, with the remaining companies of the militia to be sent the next morning when more trains would be available. The citizens of Richmond could only guess how tumultuous the situation was if their own governor was personally leading the military effort. The bulk of the passage detailed the sad sight of the departing troops.  It described legions of young men and boys going off to fight in the war, not knowing if they would return in good health, or at all.","This editorial is interesting because on the one hand, it demonstrates the capabilities of the state run militia.  Governor Wise was able to call up and deploy the men in order to deal with a situation in his state without any input from the federal government. However, the true importance of this editorial lies in the southern perception of the events surrounding the Harpers Ferry raid.  The wording and tone of this passage made it very clear that people saw this event as a grave threat to state stability and peace.  One also gets the sense that there was a widespread belief that there was a major battle occurring in Harpers Ferry. There is no doubt that much of this misconception was due to the slow travel of news; the common citizens in Richmond would have no way of knowing that Brown only commanded 18 men, half of whom were dead by this time. However, even if they had known this, the principal behind this raid was what disturbed so many southerners.

Opponents of the newly praised penitentiary system believed that the new institution violated the inalienable republican right of freedom of movement. The opponents to the implementation of the penitentiary system advocated the use of fines, branding, temporary imprisonment in local jails, or hanging to punish those in society.

William, convicted circumstantially of killing his father, was held in the penitentiary for seven years prior to his death. The cause of William's death in prison remained unknown but many attributes about prison life in the nineteenth century South may have contributed to his death.

One visitor to the Maryland Penitentiary found that the prisoners sang songs of obscenity and mirth, and their curses and imprecations resound from the gloomy walls ... This quote demonstrated the mental and physical fatigue that prisoners endured. Although the exact cause of Stewart's death remained unknown, many factors such as disease, suicide or homicide could have lead to his death.

In the cavalier lifestyle, honor was central to a man's standing and level of respect within the community.It was entirely acceptable, and in fact expected, that a man would be willing to put his life on the line in order to defend his own honor. While dueling was never particularly popular in the United States, there was a massive public outcry against it in the wake of the 1804 death of Alexander Hamilton in a duel with Aaron Burr.Therefore, while Mr. Reynolds would certainly like to restore his reputation through a duel to the death, it is highly unlikely that these two men would come to deadly blows; rather, upon meeting to duel, they would reach a verbal agreement, as was the common practice at the time.Nevertheless, this illustrates the ferocity with which southern men were willing to defend their honor, opinions, and reputation."],"display_date":"October 29, 1845","search_date":"1845-10-29","locations":[{"id":14217,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2615,"title":"Violence in Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-07-15","end_date":"1835-07-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the summer of 1835, violence swept through the Mississippi landscape. A Mississippi man's letters include harrowing murders, vigilante activity and a purported slave insurrection.  Rattled by the violence, the Mississippian, James Carlson, in a letter to his former schoolmate, Virginian Robert Whitehead, detailed the events with fear and warning.  Lawless men brutally murdered a mutual friend on his plantation. In the wake of the violence, white vigilante groups raided and hung gamblers in Vicksburg, while others uncovered and hung slave conspirators planning a massive insurrection.   ","      The Vicksburg Volunteers, as the self-selected white male Mississippians called themselves, did not wait for the slow and uncertain arm of the law rather, they hung the villains who upset social order.  Vigilante groups, as characterized by Richard Brown in <em>A Strain of Violence</em>, developed in the absence of effective law and order in the frontier region. According to Carlson, vigilante violence continued in Madison County, where an insurrection movement among Negros was discovered...and by all accounts...12 Negros and two white men were hung in the manner of Vicksburg. [After they were hung, the insurrectionists were left hanging for 24 hours as an example.]  Many more both Negros and whitemen (who were at the head of it) have been taken and put in prison.  These are harsh measures but the times require them.  In Madison, Hinds, Warren and Yazoo, the greatest excitement prevails and armed patrols are moving in every direction. Armed patrols were not site-specific to Mississippi. ","      Brown argues, vigilante groups, in this case the Vicksburg Volunteers and the armed patrols, fit into an American doctrine of vigilance, used in early 19th century crises of war and expansion.  Recalling historical precedent (in the 1810's vigilante groups formed in Virginia as a home guard during War of 1812 and in 1817 Florida when threatened by a Spanish-Mexican navy) and propagating a democratic ideal of popular sovereignty harking back to the American Revolution, vigilante groups saw themselves as uniquely American--lawless but justified. ","      In Mississippi, the vigilantes were as Brown described, upright and ambitious frontiersmen who wished to re-establish the values of a property holder's society. Subversive behavior, especially among slaves and poor white men, disquieted the social order and pushed Carlson to lament: the times are indeed alarming.

In 1881, Walter Rountree took a walk one day from the University of Georgia with his brother and some of his friends. They encountered two African American men at the town courthouse and a conflict ensued. All the men drew their pistols against one another. In the shooting that followed, Walter Rountree was shot and later died after being carried back to his home. There was almost a riot in the town because the students were upset with the African American men. An examination of the pistols used proved that the gun that killed Rountree belonged to his own brother. However, the African American men involved in the conflict were tried for assault with intent to murder [and] found guilty. ","Georgia's society in 1881 had a guideline for social interactions between blacks and whites that were regulated by strict laws and customs. Because African Americans and whites were living in areas very close to each other and there was still animosity among these southerners, whites felt that it was necessary to have these laws to prevent conflict. The research of Edward Ayers shows that southern whites thought that blacks were to blame for the violence and that black men were...inclined toward...crimes of passion. The laws would help to keep their passions under control and prevent violence. Ayers discovered that some of the social customs that blacks had to observe were that African Americans could not address whites by their first names and could not socialize with white members of society. Since Rountree's community in Athens, Georgia was composed of blacks and whites, it is not unusual that a conflict resulted between him and his white friends and the African Americans in their town. ","African Americans were in a disadvantaged position in Georgia's society, especially concerning the law. The account of this event puts the blame for the conflict completely on the two African American men involved, although there was probably much confusion among all the men. Then the two black men were found guilty for assaulting the white men, but there was no mention of any punishment for the white men. Professor Ayers found that there were many laws created that discriminated against African Americans in society, such as vagrancy and labor laws.

Regardless, Penn was successful in covering up his actions and destroyed any way of himself being accused of such a violent crime.

Some were voluntary actions of both parties, while some, such as the story of Lina Hanna, were rapes. ","Beginning around the 1890s and continuing on throughout the decades, interracial sexual relations and marriage became less prevalent. Whites opposed interracial relations because they believed that venereal disease was widely spread in blacks; this discouraged white men from approaching black women.

The first lynching happened just five days into the new year. Each week the names, race, alleged crimes, place lynched, and date of the lynching were listed for all those who had been lynched during that year. Each week someone picked up the newspaper to see if anyone had been lynched since the previous week.

Lawrence Brown, an African American, accused of arson near Cranbury, South Carolina, was the first one to be lynched in 1897. At least one out of the 28 lynched were white. Two of the 28 were women, Mollie Smith and Amanda Franks, both from Jefferson, Alabama. They were accused of using poison and as a result were lynched. Out of all 28 of the people who were lynched, only one survived, William Clement, a black man of Cambell County, Virginia, who was accused of striking a white man.","Lynching increased in the late 1800s at a steady rate. During the 1890s, according to William Brundage, a growing number of conservative whites, concerned that lynching threatened the social tranquility and economic future of the state, agreed that lynching must end. They discussed whether certain crimes deserved mob vengeance or if they should be handled at the courts' discretion. Lynching affected the region, the state and the south as a whole, as it disrupted the economy. "," During the early 1890s, African Americans debated how to protest using appropriate measures and desperately searched for a way to protect themselves from violence. A picture depicted a few lynched men in the Richmond Planet, the question is posed: Shall this barbarity continue until the God of retribution marshals his strength against the barbarians? The idea growing in Virginia was that lynching was unnecessary and need not be tolerated. Some whites also hoped to end lynching and the violence, believing that it hurt their economy. Many blacks and whites did not want lynching to continue, and yet the there was an increase in the numbers lynched in the 1890s. "," Lynching increased in the south after 1880 through the 1950s, where 80 percent of the nation's lynchings occurred. The number lynched each year did not drop below 100 until several years after the turn of the century. Lynching was a community event, in which mothers and children watched, and the lynchers were very rarely arrested. According to William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E. Terrill, lynching was community-sanctioned murder, and death was usually accompanied by torture and mutilation. Lynching did not start to decrease until the 1950s.

He was brutally shot in the head with a pistol and stabbed. He was also robbed of a reported 1600. The notes were from the Bank of Virginia. His body was found dumped near a road. According to witnesses, Simpson and the man later revealed as his murderer, William F. Hoose, spent two days together in the same tavern. They did not know each other before this encounter. Simpson was in the area to conduct business. They had lunch together because Simpson took a liking to the young Hoose. After lunch, the witness reported that Simpson and Hoose left the tavern together. Soon after that, Hoose returned back to the tavern by himself and kept pacing back and forth. He asked the landlord about buying a horse from him and the price. He went to Leesburg, where he was arrested for the murder of William Simpson. He was thrown in the Leesburg Jail and held there until his execution. He stole the money for gambling purposes. Historian Henry P. Lundsgarde argues in the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture </em>that, during this time period, the South lead the nation in violent offenses against persons.

As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men. The element that stands out here is that the leaders of the town took the time to investigate Andy Blount?s claims of innocence; more importantly, they concluded that he was in fact innocent. However, their conclusion did little to sway Andy Blount's ultimate fate."],"display_date":"February 14, 1893","search_date":"1893-02-14","locations":[{"id":12056,"lat":35.2006308637,"lng":-85.2180291091,"zoom":9,"place":"HAMILTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2718,"title":"Feuds Between the North and South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-26","end_date":"1895-01-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Judge M.L. Buchwalter lived in Cincinnati, Ohio. He convicted a prisoner and sent him to Kentucky. Once he arrived in Kentucky, not long after he got off the train, the prisoner was lynched. This greatly disturbed Judge Buchwalter, and the next time Kentucky asked him to send his prisoner to their state, he worried about what would happen to the prisoner. He first contacted Kentucky and pleaded that the prisoner, before being harmed, be given a fair trial."," Reverend A.H. Hampton, Buchwalter's prisoner, was accused of shooting and wounding a white man with intent to kill. Kentucky once again asked Judge M.L. Buchwalter to send the prisoner to Kentucky for the decision of what to do with him. Buckwalter hesitated in sending this man to Kentucky. He first wanted to make sure that the prisoner would be protected until the court made a decision, and that he would be guaranteed a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the United States. Judge Buchwalter did not want to send the charged man to Kentucky and have him lynched before he even had a chance to defend his life. "," When Kentucky could not guarantee such a request, Judge M.L. Buchwalter discharged the prisoner. In this case, Judge Buchwalter represented the beliefs of Ohio as a state. According to The Richmond Planet, Ohio refuses to act as an agent for murderers and will not deliver a black man into the hands of lynchers. "," This article, published in Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, showed the North's beliefs on lynching without a fair trial. It also showed the difference of opinion in Virginia and the South as well. The disapproval or support of lynching seemed to have reached a peak in the 1890s and newspapers all over the nation, such as this one, stated their opinion on the situation. "," Southerners, however, maintained the argument that the lynching was not unwarranted or unexpected. They wouldn't lynch a black man for something that was not harmful, such as communication with a white woman. According to William Brundage, that was only a trivial infraction of racial etiquette. But there were different levels of what was deserving of lynching. Mob vengeance was incited by more serious infractions. Theft was more serious, although it did not elicit mob violence. Minor and implicit sexual crimes incited mobs sometimes. Murder, however, got whole white communities together to lynch blacks. "," The emotions derived from each crime determined the severity of the actions. Rev. A. H. Hampton's actions would probably elicit a strong emotion from a group of whites in Kentucky, and thus he would probably be lynched. Judge M.L. Buchwalter was probably right then, to have not sent him back to Kentucky, because he would not have received a fair and impartial trial, as the Judge had wished he would, before the mob decided that he was undeserving of such a trial.

Palfrey included the memorial poem in his plantation diary.The poem contrasts the North and the South, the robings of glory (the North) and the gloom of defeat (the South), and the dead and the living.Images of death and the grave beneath the sod and the dew run throughout.The poem also paints the vivid, gory picture of warfare, describing the flow of inland river where the iron fleets had once traversed and the grass beneath which soldiers lie in their graves.The rivers are no longer sullied by the red flow of soldiers' blood, and now flowers bloom around the scenes of battle.The poem shows life after war: it transitions from the gloom of defeat into a sunny spring day full of blossoms blossoming for all.While the seasons change and the weather varies, the Love and tears for the Blue, Tears and love for the Grey remain."," The poem memorializes the soldiers who fought and died for both sides; sentimental poems remember these fallen heroes.Yet, The Blue and the Grey challenges the pointlessness of the war itself, probing, Sadly, but no with upbraiding, The generous deed was done, In the storm of the years are fading, No braves battle was won.To Finch, little honor came from the Civil War, merely death for soldiers fighting for their causes.The poem paradoxically and simultaneously eulogizes and glorifies the Civil War in its pointless destruction and its grandiose battles. In memoriam of these soldiers of both the Union and Confederate armies, Finch paints a picture of common loss, equal splendor, and the remembrance of soldiers by visiting their graves."," Finch's poem was written to honor the universality of mourning in the North and South in the years preceding the war's end.Through the acknowledgment of mutual sympathies, he epitomized the new national tradition of memorializing the soldiers.According to David W. Blight, the poem was published in<em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> in Boston, and was very popular. Recitals of the poem continued for years to come at Decoration Days and Blue-Gray reunions.At these events, men and especially women commemorated the lost soldiers by visiting and decorating gravesites, convening at graveyards, and holding communal memorial services to honor those who fought for either side.Thepoem reflects the emerging reunionism that these events created.By 1866, southerners had founded memorial associations, with a majority of their constituents being women.These Memorial Days, described in detail by Blight, grew in popularity, and the North soon had their own."," Memorialization intertwined with civic life.Blight reveals that the memorial days were a means of coping with Reconstruction and its debilitating consequences on the South.In a different way, memorial days were a small tie to the ideals white southerners had been forced to desert in their defeat and in Reconstruction.Not only had slavery ceased to exist, but also the Confederacy, their nation of four years, faded with Robert E. Lee's 1865 surrender.According to Charles Vincent, the end of the war saw the end of the world as they knew it.Demoralization and social dislocation encompassed many white southerners' post-war lives.Some southerners still held on to their unique southern identity.Blight narrates that in John A. Bilmer claimed, The world had <em>conceded</em> to Southern courage, Southern devotion, Southern skills, and Southern power, as displayed in that war.Southern citizens still lived under the reign of Reconstruction and felt the aftermath and destruction caused by the war.Memorializing dead Rebel soldiers was a way of channeling this grief into a positive source, visiting the graveyards and battlefields in order to move forward, like Finch challenges his readers."," The North, too, began eulogizing the dead Union soldiers in much the same way.According to Blight, in May 1868 and 1869, General John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, asked for all Union veterans to honor the dead soldiers by conducting ceremonies and visiting gravesites.Northern memorials grew to encapsulate fallen southerners as well as black and Union soldiers.Finch's poem was a stepping stone to a reunified nation.","--J.R."],"display_date":"September 14, 1867 - December 31, 1873","search_date":"1870-11-06","locations":[{"id":5519,"lat":32.1808059275,"lng":-91.7158468561,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2729,"title":"Guilty Until Proven Innocent?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-01-20","end_date":"1880-01-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Arthur Jordan, a large, bull-necked, thick-lipped Negro worked for the Corder family and began having relations with one of the daughters, Miss Corder. It is unknown whether Miss Corder consented to Arthur Jordan's advances. However, many people in the town were suspicious that she was being taken advantage of. Once word got out that a black man was having a relationship with a white woman, the people began to speculate that he must be forcing Miss Corder to have sexual relations with him. Arthur approached Miss Corder and convinced her to run away with him. Whether she did it willingly or not, it was to no avail. The Corder family and neighbors pursued the couple into Maryland where they were caught and brought back to Fauquier. Arthur was put into jail to await his sentencing, and Miss Corder was returned to her family."," While Arthur was in jail, many of the community became enraged and decided to lynch the black man they felt posed a threat to their community.

"," This incident reflects the Southern and racial phenomenon of race hatred which was based on the idea whites had that Negroes were inferior to them. The transition from the slavery system to this kind of caste system, as C. Vann Woodward refers to it, caused both whites and blacks to harbor feelings of suspicion, uneasiness, and mistrust for the others. Woodward mentions that it sometimes seemed that race relations at this point had deteriorated since the time of slavery instead of improving. It is unknown in this particular instance whether Arthur Jordan was guilty of raping Miss Corder and forcing her to do things against her will or if she willingly engaged.

The doctor had no obstetrics tools with him and had no other choice than to do the best he could with the limited tools he had. Richards cut a piece of tissue on each side about an inch wide and two inches long on the scalp. He pulled on this piece with his finger until it broke, pulling a large piece of tissue off the child's head. This initiated the birth and the child lived with a scar on the scalp. "," Stories such as these were reprinted in order to educate and for other doctors to understand the history of medicine and its procedures. The development and understanding of medicine soared during the late 1800s. In 1892, the Southern Medical College Association was founded with the intentions that the improvements it endorsed was to make medical education in the South conform to the superior standards of northern schools, according to John Harley Warner. The reputation of the medical education in the South according to many was inferior to the North's development in the postbellum time. "," In the years following the Civil War, the South could not delve themselves out of the poverty and stagnation. Consequently, as the New South era drew to a close in the opening years of the twentieth-century, the South was mired in backwardness and misery. Nowhere is this better seen than in science and medicine. The North trumped the South in medicine and technology. Even as the South tried to regain supremacy, the North excelled. The focus of the South was no longer to compete with the North, but instead to regain the pride and prosperity it had before the war.

McConnell, 647 black men chose to enlist in the First Arkansas Infantry and their Union patriotism is evident in this song.Black soldiers fought in the same war, and they deserved the same respect.The Song of the First Arkansas recognizes their patriotism, bravery, and desire to end slavery in order to attain rights and equality in their nation."," The enslaved people were eager to end slavery, recognizing that the myth of the patriarchy of slaveholders was false.The song illustrates how incorrect the pro-slavery argument that slaves benefited the most from slavery.The lyrics show white slaveholders' oppression of black emancipation, describing When we heard de proclamation, massa hush it as he will.Yet, these black soldiers took the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 literally and wanted to fight to emancipate the slaves of all the southern slaveholding states.According to McConnell, songs in the Civil War evoked enthusiasm and motivated soldiers to fight.The black soldiers remembered the oppression of their fellow blacks and had even more reason to stand up for the abolitionist cause.According to John O.

Cooper points out that in this time period, with all of the economic reconstruction going on, the land generally remained in white hands but with the difficulty of the times, a lot of times these landowners were not able to maintain their land and lacked the resources for diversification so they were unable to keep their property sometimes. In these cases, they would make agreements among one another or establish written agreements and they would sometimes even take on tenants. Furthermore, Cooper paints the picture that this was one of the largest deflationary periods seen yet in the United States where prices fell by one half between the years of 1865 and 1898. This is much of the reason for the suspicion of corruption in the courts across the South. The people were caught up in the exchange of land and especially someone like Judge Nicol who would have presided over many of these kinds of cases became a target because of his possible ability to exploit the system to his own benefit."],"display_date":"1876 - 1877","search_date":"1876-12-31","locations":[{"id":14190,"lat":38.5089863052,"lng":-77.2972733849,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE WILLIAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2738,"title":"One Family&#39;s Tragic Loss and Wartime Poverty\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-01","end_date":"1865-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While aboard a steamer ship headed from Alexandria, LA for Shreveport, LA, J.M. Bundy, a northern soldier, witnessed human cruelty and the outrageous poverty encompassing much of the South. Bundy and his Union comrades were invited to ride up the Red River to Shreveport on the Confederate flag-of-truce boat before a conference with southern officers about terms of surrender. Flying towards this vital meeting, the steamer ship needed more fuel, and deck hands began tactlessly tearing down fences along the banks of the river. Suddenly, a poor, woebegone, wretched looking old man came rushing down with his children...all crying together, imploring that the northern steamboat spare his fence. This poor white man complained that his crops just began growing, but he was too poor and weak to fix the fence, whose destruction meant starvation for himself and his family."," Both Bundy and a Confederate officer felt sympathy for this man, saying so to the men stealing the wood. The Confederate officer explained the problematic nature of this situation, professing, Our people only know one part of making war. They known how to fight, and that's all. The southern men have no business faculty. Although this officer requested supplies many times, his soldiers were naked and starving in their own homeland, the South. Bundy and the Rebel officer agreed upon the injustice of taking from an impoverished family. The two men were alarmed at the desperate state of affairs in these closing days of war."," Before the Civil War began, the poor white southerner felt the hardships of the plantation economy as a yeoman farmer or a tenant farmer. Expectedly, his situation worsened during the years of economic decline of in a nation at war, as John B. Boles describes. The extreme poverty suffered by a large portion of southerners during the Civil War was horrifying to this northern man. He and his enemy, a Confederate officer, shared the same opinion on the poor white southerner's situation: it was unfair for a quartermaster to destroy a family to attain a few pieces of wood. According to Boles, towards the end of the war, however, conditions worsened for soldiers and civilians alike, as the economy continued to deteriorate through a lack of Confederate economic policy. Boles illuminates families' struggles with starvation, and conquering Union troops, embittered too by the continuing war, made fewer exemptions for civilians, feeling less guilt at taking fence rails and other amenities. Bundy and his comrades were en route to finalize surrender by the Louisiana armies and still civilians suffered at the hand of apathetic officials. Bundy, unable to forget the unfortunate fate of this family, witnessed a typical tragedy throughout the poverty-stricken South, a family unable to sustain itself and apathy of exhausted officials.

In 1881, Talladega  County proposed a vote on the outlaw of alcohol consumption and the African American population allegedly voted in a bloc against the prohibition. The article blamed the African American population for the failure of passing prohibition in the county.  As the surrounding counties of Clay, Calhoun, St. Clair, and Shelby had previously outlawed the sale of alcohol, the Christians of Talladega County feared their county would be overrun with the scum and scuff of the other counties if they did not enact the same prohibition.  The Baptists of Talladega County greatly feared the community would become a cesspool of drinking and crime, as the only county in the area to permit alcohol sale and consumption.  Thus, the Baptists of Talladega County beseeched the community to protect their region from alcohol consumption and its consequences by outlawing alcohol trafficking in the county.","The <em>Christian Index</em> emphasized the depraved nature of drunkenness and the tendency for indulgence in spirits to encourage crime and lewd behavior, suggesting that those who consumed alcohol were depraved criminals and delinquents.  Thus, the article's accusation that the African American community voted in a bloc against the prohibition measure suggested that African Americans were depraved for their desire to drink alcohol or protect the right to do so.  As they vehemently condemned alcohol consumption, the <em>Christian Index </em>rebuked the African Americans in Talladega County for their part in the prohibition's failure.","The Baptists' fear of Talladega County's inevitable degeneration through alcohol consumption supports historian Robert Handy's argument that nineteenth-century Baptists believed that drunkenness was the cardinal sin of the land.  According to Handy, total prohibition was the primary and ultimate Southern Baptist position by the 1880's.  Historian Edward Ayers also argues that whites believed blacks were swing voters on the issue of prohibition, but black voters did not actually vote consistently against prohibition. The article portrays whites' view of African Americans as swing voters, as the writer condemned the African Americans for altering the outcome of the election.  Ayers argues that whites gave black voters a great deal of credit when dry forces won because of their perception of blacks as swing voters.  Nevertheless, the black voters were also held responsible when the dry forces lost.  In Talladega County, African American voters were blamed and denounced for the failure of the prohibition statute."],"display_date":"March 29, 1883","search_date":"1883-03-29","locations":[{"id":373,"lat":33.3761980073,"lng":-86.1510233984,"zoom":9,"place":"TALLADEGA, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2745,"title":"Calvin Gray&#39;s Murder\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-12-24","end_date":"1882-12-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the night of December 24, 1882, near the town of Mooresburg in Hawkins   County, Tennessee, African American Calvin Gray was accused of stealing hogs on Mrs. Joseph Gill's farm. He was later released for lack of evidence. On the following Saturday, December 30, an unknown group of people sought retribution for the alleged robbery and bombarded Gray's home, pounding violently on the door and walls of his house. No serious outcome resulted from that night's altercation, but the party returned to Gray's home on the following evening, repeated the hostility, and demanded that Gray come out to discuss his thievery. Gray refused to appear, and members of the group tore a plank of wood from Gray's door and repeatedly shot into the house through the hole. Gray received bullet wounds in the arm and stomach and died from his injuries. A man named Jim Williams also received serious wounds in the gunfire, as a shot in the forehead resulted in his death five days later. Calvin's stepson received a bullet wound in the leg, but was not fatally injured. Nine or ten people were arrested for their involvement in the bombardment, but all were released for lack of proof of their involvement. ","Gray's story reveals the disparate attitudes that whites possessed toward African Americans in Hawkins   County, Tennessee in the nineteenth century. The Hawkins County legal system treated Gray fairly, dismissing his crime for lack of proof and releasing him even though he was black. However, Gray's murderers did not grant him the same respect, as they violently assaulted him for unproven petty thievery. Gray's death displays the duplicitous nature of many southern whites in the late nineteenth century, as Gray's killers repaid an apparent legal injustice with an even more repulsive injustice. While Gray's killers believed his alleged robbery required retribution, they defied the legal system by punishing Gray outside of the system and by enacting a punishment egregiously disproportionate to the crime. ","Gray's murder served as an informal, citizen-organized judicial system, fulfilling historian Edward Ayers' argument that whites lynched alleged black offenders in the nineteenth century to uphold their perception of justice and to terrorize blacks into acquiescence. While the white mob did not lynch Gray, they terrorized him and might have lynched him if he had succumbed to their demands to exit his house. Instead, he was killed by gunshot for allegedly stealing a few hogs. Ayers argues that the majority of lynched African Americans in the nineteenth century South were tortured and killed for charges of murder, rape, or violation of white womanhood; however, Calvin Gray was hunted down, terrorized, and killed for the alleged robbery of a few hogs. Such disproportionate punishment suggests that some whites in the late nineteenth century possessed an even more severe hatred for blacks than previous accounts indicate.

On the night of his execution, Pratt was provided with spiritual advice in preparation for his execution.  While get readying himself for death, Pratt confessed to the crime for the first time.  At 12:00 a.m., thirty guards escorted Pratt out of the jail to the gallows near downtown Marietta.  The guards allowed Pratt to smoke a cigar, and they talked pleasantly amongst each other.  When Pratt arrived at the gallows, 8,000 people were waiting to witness his execution.  After an African American minister recited a prayer, Pratt publicly confessed his crime and expressed a willingness to die.  At 12:45 a.m., the drop fell, his neck broke, and he completely stopped moving thirteen minutes later.  The guards cut down Pratt's body, giving it to his father, brothers, and sisters who witnessed the execution.","Pink Pratt's execution demonstrates an uncommon instance when a nineteenth-century southern judicial system legitimately accused, convicted, and punished a black man according to the law, even though he committed a violent crime against a white female.  While a white perpetrator may have received a lighter punishment, Pratt was treated in a reasonably fair manner, considering the usual treatment of black offenders in the late nineteenth-century American South.  Pratt was executed as a criminal who committed a heinous offense, but the legal system fairly granted him the traditional religious rituals that it granted white offenders upon their execution.  The nineteenth-century Cobb County judicial system deemed a black criminal worthy of humane treatment, despite the horror of his crime.  ","Pratt's story challenges the traditional account of white reactions to black violent crime against whites.  As historian Edward Ayers argues, southern whites in the post-Civil War era were convinced that blacks were more dangerous than whites and that black men were more inclined to commit crimes of passion.  Nevertheless, the <em>National Police Gazette </em>did not portray Pratt as an atrocious creature, but depicted him talking pleasantly to his guards and expressing a willingness to die for his crime.  He was not portrayed as the brutal, dangerous monster that many southern whites declared blacks to be.  In addition, the public allowed his execution to occur through the legal process.  Ayers argues that black criminals were frequently kidnapped from jails, tortured, burned, and hanged by white mobs because whites believed such blacks were unworthy of legal execution.  However, Pratt was allowed to die through legal execution even though he raped a twelve-year-old white girl.  According to Ayers, whites often justified a lynching simply because the black offender committed the usual crime of sexual assault upon white women.  Whites assumed that black men lusted after white women and they even justified lynching blacks when they committed a minor violation of white womanhood.  Nevertheless, despite Pratt's severe violation of the dignity of an innocent white child, he was permitted to die through formal execution.

Sharp concealed her pregnancy until the birth, attempting to protect her reputation for as long as possible. When her father discovered her secret, he erupted in anger and demanded vengeance upon the man who impregnated her. She initially refused to reveal the name of her child's father, but eventually revealed that her impregnator was Thomas Nation, a Mormon convert who was her sister's husband. Mr. Sharp rushed to Nation's house, threatening to kill his son-in-law and then himself. Upon arriving at Nation's residence, Sharp discovered the dead body of his other daughter, as she had perished that same day in the delivery of her own child. Meanwhile, Nation realized his adultery had been discovered, and he fled from his home and his wife's corpse. After the funeral of his daughter, Mr. Sharp offered a 100 reward for Nation's arrest and the entire community joined in the hunt for the villain. Nation was eventually discovered with two other Mormons on a train going to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The sheriff of Catoosa County sent a deputy to pursue Nation, and they arrested him as he stepped off the train in Chattanooga on August 13, 1880.","It is impossible to determine whether Martha Sharp's intercourse with Thomas Nation was forced or consensual. Nonetheless, Sharp possessed much shame about her pregnancy. Her father's reaction to the incident reveals the severity that nineteenth-century southern society bestowed upon such a scandal. The fact that Mr. Sharp was willing to kill his son-in-law and then end his own life, suggests that Sharp lost all desire to live because of his family's disgrace. However, the community blamed Nation's membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as the reason for the scandal, accusing Nation's religious associations as the cause for the Sharp family's problems.","The <em>National Police Gazette'</em>s article on the scandal supports historian Sarah Barringer Gordon's claim that most Americans of the nineteenth century believed the Latter Day Saints were an uncivilized and barbaric religious group. According to Gordon, anti-Mormon and anti-polygamy Americans argued that no civilized group could disagree about the fundamental question of domestic relations, declaring the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to be an inhumane, undemocratic, and un-American church. The article supports Gordon's argument, as the story castigated Nation more for his Mormon affiliation than for his adultery. Nation was, in fact, practicing adultery with his wife's sister and was not practicing polygamy. However, the article and community emphasized Nation's crime as a Mormon polygamy problem, rather than a problem of morality in general. The article's attack on the Latter Day Saints displays the Protestant community's desire to frame the incident as an isolated Mormon problem, rather than a moral problem that breeched religious divides.

On account of his political principles, Stephens was stabbed, choked, and left dying on a woodpile in a rear room of the courthouse. Prior to his murder Stephens had been advised by Victor Barringer that his life was threatened by the KKK, however Stephens ignored the warning. When the lynching of four blacks did not catch the attention of the citizens, the Klan was determined to take the life of a white man. Stephens supported the Freedmen's Bureau and the Union League, and helped to politically organize the black population of Caswell County. The Freedmen's Bureau not only intervened in white Southerners economic relations with black laborers, but it also helped to mobilize these laborers into the Republican Party. As a result, Senator Stephens became an enemy to the white Democratic Party. Governor William W. Holden responded to the challenge of the KKK, by illegally declaring martial law and sending troops into Caswell County. Local law enforcement could not cope with the hit-and-run tactics of the Klan, and Holden knew that nothing short of martial law would suppress them.","The function of Klan violence was to socially and economically curb Republicans and control the black population. After the Democrats gained control of the legislature in 1870, they impeached and convicted Holden for illegally declaring martial law. As historians Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris emphasized, the Klan?s use of violence was temporarily effective in securing political power.

Upon surveying the prison, the committee confirmed that the prison keepers did in fact torture and whip the prisoners, so much that the doctors frequently had to visit to treat their wounds. They also starved them and worked them like horses. They lived in dungeons as dark as death that were kept at practically freezing temperatures.

In 1834, a referendum in Alabama on prisons reported that voters were overwhelmingly opposed to the system. Nevertheless, the southern penitentiary system continued to expand.","Once created, local governments did not like spending money on prisons. Therefore, imprisonment could become an agonizing ordeal, as it was for the prisoners at Auburn. To raise the funds for upkeep, prisons leased out the prisoners to work in harsh conditions. The prison officials at Auburn were much like the ones all over the South, dealing out severe physical punishments, providing poor food, and focusing more on how they could profit from leases themselves. Even though many citizens were outraged at the conditions seen in Auburn, they did not take any progressive action. In fact, no action was taken in regards to the prison at Auburn until 1862.

The masked men took the accused and slaughtered each and every one of them. While the law enforcement had not yet decided whether to take action or not, blacks in the community felt the incident was critical enough to call a town meeting. They intended to discuss plans of a mass emigration from the South Carolina county in order to avoid further racial intimidation and discrimination.","At the end of the nineteenth century, race relations worsened as racial violence replaced efforts to harmonize blacks and whites in the South.

Among the most frightening to white travelers was the possibility of coming into contact with Indians. In the 1830?s, the threat of Indian attacks was heightened as a result of President Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act and the treaties that followed.  During this period, Jackson used treaties to try to force Indians of the five nations that resided in the southeastern United States - the Cherokee, Creek, Choctaw, Chicasaw and Seminole - to migrate west. While some Indians agreed to move, others resisted Jackson's efforts and chose to stay. Most of the population of both the Creeks and the Cherokees would have remained in Georgia and Alabama in 1835 when Davis was traveling. Without protection against land hungry white settlers, though, the Indians that stayed often lost their land and were left destitute. Frustrated with their situation and angry with Jackson and their white neighbors for trying to force them off of their land, Indians were known to steal from and attack white neighbors and passers-by. ","In its report of this incident, the Athens' <em>Southern Banner </em>implied that the Indian attacker was unprovoked in the outrage he or she committed. The article did not consider the probable outrage the Indian felt at the marginalization and poverty he or she faced. In hindsight, the title of the article, Indian Outrage, might be read as an outraged Indian taking out his frustration over the actions of President Jackson. As this article's perspective shows, white southerners at this time lacked such sympathy for the Indians. The same lack of sympathy was visible in the incident of the Trail of Tears, when Indian nations were forced to migrate and walk across the South to new homes. ","The aggression that existed between white southerners and the Indians was both a result of and a contributor to the theories of rationalizing the forced migration.  President Jackson argued that the Indians would be better off in the Western lands where they would not have to face attacks from white southerners.  This theory that it would be better for the Indians if they moved, created even less sympathy in white southerners towards those who chose to stay."],"display_date":"January 15, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-15","locations":[{"id":1654,"lat":33.8831653504,"lng":-83.4095667489,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2788,"title":"Battle of Monroe&#39;s Cross Roads\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-03-19","end_date":"1865-03-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1865, Union Major General William Tecumseh Sherman advanced North from Georgia, through the Carolinas, with the intention of regrouping with Northern forces in Virginia.

The Federals' counterattack on the Confederates killed sixty-eight of Hampton?s men and forced them to withdraw.","Sherman's campaign left 425 miles of desolation that would never again support a Rebel army. Unlike in South Carolina, Union troops did relatively little damage to the civilian infrastructure in North Carolina. This was a result of the animosity between the Union soldiers and South Carolina. After the Battle of Bentonville, Union troops marched on to Goldsboro to rest and refit after seven weeks of fighting.","The effect of Sherman's Campaign on the Confederacy was devastating; Confederates were no longer united. With an army of 60,000, Sherman made the entire South feel the weight of war. Sherman's campaign, as historian Charles Edmund Vetter noted, triggered a significant amount of suffering throughout the South, in the form of economic depression, psychological disturbance, and material destruction. Even though Sherman's march through the Carolinas did not directly influence Lee's surrender, the march devastated Confederate logistics. The despair of North Carolinians threatened to break up Lee's army. They were tired of the war.

The State had found Nobles guilty of murdering her husband three years prior, and sentenced her to death by hanging the following day. Yet the Twiggs County facility where Nobles was being held received a last minute notice to cancel her execution. Georgia Governor William Atkinson, the only body left with the power to pardon her death sentence, sent the notification that afternoon reducing her punishment to serving life in prison. The governor came to this conclusion after immense pressure from women across the state. Once the Pardon Board had declared that it could do no more for the accused, individual women as well as organizations sent numerous petitions and requests on behalf of Nobles to the governor. Women's growing power to influence politics and social matters was realized as their efforts proved to be successful in Nobles' stay.","Around the turn of the twentieth century, women's issues and rights started to take center stage, especially on the political level. By the time of Nobles' scheduled execution, women across the South had already secured property and age of consent rights, fought for higher education opportunities, and even battled for suffrage. Certain territories in the West had even granted suffrage for all women by this point. Although Georgia had not yet permitted women to vote, women still held power and exerted their influence over everyday affairs. They formed committees and organizations concerned with reducing social ills such as illiteracy, child labor, and the consumption of alcohol. They joined preexisting groups such as the National American Woman Suffrage Association in order to further their own desires to win political recognition. But most of all, they became a presence in society, fighting and lobbying openly and relentlessly for the political and social causes they believed in.

On Wednesday, October 6, 1897, North Carolina Governor Daniel L. Russell dismissed Otho Wilson, the railroad commissioner, for conspiring with the Southern Railway Company to promote his own economic interest. Wilson did this by appealing to the railway company to stop at his hotel in order to increase the eating-house's business. According to Russell and the witnesses gathered by him to testify against Wilson, this had a negative impact on many businesses in Hickory, North Carolina, the stop that was replaced by Wilson's hotel. The town's only restaurant was forced to close when the train ceased stopping there. Others faced difficulties in transporting or receiving merchandise, and many were inconvenienced by the extra travel now required to reach the closest railroad station. Not only did the effect Wilson's actions had on the town of Hickory warrant his dismissal, but Russell argued that by placing himself under obligations not only to the Southern Railway Company it disqualified him to act as a fair, impartial judge and juror in any controversy that might arise between such corporations and individual citizens. "," A few years later on January 25, 1899, a group of people decided to contest this decision and wrote an appeal to Governor Russell asking for an explanation, as they felt Wilson's dismissal was unjust. Russell responded with a lengthy document that described Wilson's misdeeds and explained how severely he had affected the town of Hickory solely for his own monetary gain. Russell, the first Republican Governor of North Carolina since the end of Reconstruction and the last until 1973, was chastised relentlessly by the Democrats, who took Wilson's indictment for bribery, as well as that of Dr. Moss, the Chairman of the Commissioners of Vance County, to reflect personally upon Russel's legislature since he had originally appointed them to those positions. The Democrats argued that those officials' effects on North Carolina politics and the economies of local towns was unforgivable, and must be corrected with a new Democratic governor. "," This scenario reveals a great deal about both the importance of transportation in South at this time and the politics involved with that institution. At this time, the railroad was the most effective means of transportation throughout the South. As the railroad tracks quickly lengthened, so did the population and industry of places with train stations. Therefore, a railroad commissioner usually made decisions about stopping points with great deliberation because their impact on towns would be considerable, which explains why Wilson's crime was so grave. Also, since railroads were the primary mode of transportation, the politics surrounding them were intense, and as historian Leslie Decker claims, often involved conflicts between political and economic interests. This can be seen in Russell's dilemma and in the reasons cited by the Democrats for his incompetence.

Upon his entrance, the owner W. S. Simmons refused to serve him on the basis of his race. Kempin, upset over the discriminatory policy, had an altercation with Simmons' brother and then angrily left the establishment. Later he returned with a group of fellow soldiers and continued the heated argument, creating a violent scene. As the altercation grew more out of control, Simmons shot Kempin in defense of his brother. It was unclear whether the wound was fatal, but Simmons was still arrested by authorities. Word finally reached back to Kempin's camp, and on November 29, a rumor spread through the city that the regiment was planning to escape the encampment in order to riot in retaliation for their fellow soldier's assumed death.","At first glance, this was just another story about how the reaction to segregation became deadly and the divided system did not serve as a resolution to the racial violence and struggles facing the South. Only two years before, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson, legalizing separate facilities for the races. This justified Simmons' refusal to serve Kempin, and to defend that right, yet not to the extent of murder. These altercations over segregation occurred over restaurants, railroads, and restrooms, among other locations. ","What set this story apart was the response to Kempin's murder. Whites paid little attention to Kempin's actual fate, but concerned themselves greatly over the soldiers' response to his death. The thought that a large group of black men would wreak havoc upon the city worried many of the citizens as evidenced by the paper printing a story about the potential riot. This imagined situation mirrored the whites' fear of slave revolts of the earlier part of the century. Because segregation prolonged the racist views of slavery, the idea of a violent uprising was still a great fear-especially since these were trained military men. So while whites still exerted legal, political, and social power over blacks, there was still a fear that the blacks would use their strength and discontent to reverse such power relationships."],"display_date":"November 29, 1898","search_date":"1898-11-29","locations":[{"id":1553,"lat":32.8067094598,"lng":-83.6980226314,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2815,"title":"Young Woman Dies Giving Birth to Illegitimate Child\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-02-13","end_date":"1896-02-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A young white woman by the name of Graves stumbled into a tobacco barn in Jerusalem township, North Carolina, one cold January night in order to give birth to her illegitimate child. Her parents had thrown her out of their house when they discovered she was pregnant, and while she had tried to seek refuge at several other houses, she was repeatedly refused, and the barn was her only option for shelter as she gave birth. The child, however, did not survive, and died shortly after its delivery. The young mother picked up her baby's body and tried to walk to a nearby house, but fainted on the way over, and was found by the family who owned the barn. They called in Dr. Martin, but he could not save the mother who suffered from hypothermia and an excessive loss of blood. She died the following day. Davie Times, a resident of the town where Graves died, heard this sad story and wrote the Salisbury Truth in order to comment on what he believed was the family's and neighbors' terrible and inhuman behavior. He was shocked that an event like this could take place in a Christian community. "," Whether or not the people Times considered responsible for Graves' death were apprehended and punished is unknown. What is known, however, is that Graves' premarital pregnancy reflected an issue in the South that provoked much controversy, particularly in the late 19th century. Patriarchal society was firmly entrenched at this time as well as the notion that all Southern women were pious, gentle, and modest daughters, wives, and mothers. North Carolinian law reinforced this concept, making a woman legally bound to reveal the name of her illegitimate baby's father. The local government would then force him to provide money for child support if need be, ensuring that neither the mother nor child would not become a ward of the state. The mother's punishment usually varied from a monetary fine to a damaged reputation, a simple notion with heavy penalties in a society that placed emphasis on the purity and innocence of respectable women. "," By the end of the 19th century, premarital pregnancy was steadily decreasing as the structure and sexual repression of the Victorian era began tightened. According to historians Daniel Scott and Michael Hindus, an upsurge in religious activity also lowered the number of premarital pregnancies at this time, especially in the South where the evangelical movement of the Social Gospel was strongest. A woman who was guilty of fornication and bastardy would have sullied not only her reputation but her family's as well, claims historian Victoria Bynum, and therefore it was not uncommon for people like the Graves to refuse to accommodate their daughter during a premarital pregnancy since they were regarded as social pariahs and outsiders. However, while a stronger religious presence in the South led to more stringent moral policies and a reduction in pregnancy out of wedlock, it also defined Christian morals and values more clearly. This new and strengthened Christian community made the Graves and their neighbors' actions look like sins as they failed to forgive the young woman and treat her with compassion that the Bible extols. The parallels between her story and the Biblical story of the birth of Jesus (Mary and Joseph being rejected from several inns, only to find shelter in a manger where she gave birth to the baby Jesus) only reinforced this notion. However, while Times' reaction to this event was supported by countless other people, many Southern communities continued to spurn and reject those young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.

Forty-nine Representatives were present at the voting, and a two-thirds vote was required to convict. ","In 1870, Holden had imposed martial law in order to combat the Ku Klux Klan (KKK).

Hall. No one expected that he would turn up dead hours later. ","Forsythe was shot through the window by a shoeless suspect. Officials initially suspected a burglary. What investigators later discovered was that Forsythe's participation in the Hall case was more involved than imagined. When Hall and four other members of Dodge's elite went to United States Court on December 8 for defrauding Norman Dodge, they also faced criminal charges of conspiracy to assassinate Forsythe. Two of the charged men confessed to their individual responsibilities in the plot and disclosed information about the hired black assassin. Their testimonies gave prosecutors ample evidence to convict each of the five accused men. ","While crime ran out of control across the South in the late nineteenth century, it was not limited to the racial incidents and lynchings that dominated the news. White men and women committed crimes too. Yet these cases were less prominent of an issue at that time because whites faced lesser consequences and publication of their crimes in comparison to blacks. Because racial tension was seeping through the South at this time, the felonies that received the most attention were those performed by blacks or white mobs in lynching. White crimes could squeak by without encountering harsh trials, severe punishments, or public lynchings. In Georgia only 19 whites were lynched in a fifty year span into the twentieth century. That was less than the total number of blacks lynched in Georgia in 1899 alone. While the public lynched blacks for a number of crimes, they lynched whites only in the cases of extreme violence. Class differences existed as well. Of the whites that were mobbed or harshly persecuted in the South, they tended to be vagrants and people without ties to the area and community. Therefore, wealthier citizens that had spent their lives in one place had the respect of their peers and were less likely to be forced into any unpleasant punishment for their crimes. ","Hall's assassination plot was cleverly designed to get rid of a key witness to his original trial without facing the severe consequences of this action. The hired assassin was a black man already wanted for a series of previously committed crimes. He would receive the brunt of the court's and the public's outrage because he was black, and because he was the physical killer. Also, being a well-known and respected lawyer in the area gave Hall the security that a jury of his peers would not be demanding in their sentencing of his trial.

Montgomery, eventually the only black representative at the convention, stood up for things taboo to many in their respective communities. The results of each man's stand not only affected them personally, but also shaped the future of Mississippi for many years to come.","Cook and Montgomery looked back at the years after the Civil War and preceding the 1890 convention and saw the same thing. In 1875, after ten years of Republicans in Mississippi joining forces with blacks, scalawags, and carpetbaggers, resulting in what many white Mississippians referred to as negro rule, it was apparently decided, according to Dunbar Rowland, that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Following an apparently very bloody revolution in which whites took back control (in theory), 15 years of intimidation passed, during which according to James George as printed in the Jackson Clarion Ledger, the method of preserving white supremacy was never entirely satisfactory. Isaiah Montgomery, in his speech during the 1890 convention, described these years in terms of every form of [political] demoralization [for blacks]-bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Although the convention took place under the pretext of, according to Rowland, eliminating ignorance at the ballot box, it was in fact a move to lawfully disenfranchise a majority of black voters by using a poll tax and a literary test in order to establish franchise qualification. According to estimates by Montgomery, the new State Constitution would disenfranchise 11,889 whites and 123,334 blacks in Mississippi. The Cleveland Gazette hoped the unconstitutional and un-American action would be prevented or at least delayed a few years, but it was not to be. ","For his part, and against what would perhaps be expected of a white Mississippian, Marsh Cook, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, took a stand against the principles of the gathering delegation and courageously challenged the Democrats for a seat to the Constitutional Convention in spite of death threats. Isaiah Montgomery did the opposite. As the only black representative to the convention, he took the opportunity to appeal to the good natures of the white representatives and their belief in a Supreme Arbiter, which supposedly would help the two races march together towards new and greater triumphs of progressive civilization. Montgomery apparently recognized the legitimacy of the white demand to rule for their [the whites] own protection, and he foolishly [in retrospect] hoped, by his support of the new constitution and its subsequent passing, that he and other black Mississippians would gain favor in white sight, thus bridging a chasm that has been widening and deepening for a generation He hoped his appeals would lead to the death of the constitutional movement or perhaps, if it passed, an immediate reversal of the new constitution.","Both men failed. Marsh Cook was ambushed and murdered, according to PBS, on a lonely road. The Cleveland Gazette hoped that his murder, being that of a respectable white gentleman, would cause the federal government to take the necessary steps to protect the American citizen at home, be his color what it may. It did not. Montgomery's hopes of racial cooperation also did not materialize. He was lambasted by the Cleveland Gazette, which called his defense of the monstrous franchise provision...a disgrace to the race and to our civilization, and wished he had never been born. For all of their objections, however, Mississippi, and the rest of the South, as many other states followed suit, plunged itself headfirst into a half-century of legal disenfranchisement and discrimination.

Lynching became a popular way for whites to threaten and maintain justice over black suspects and criminals. Rural areas with little law enforcement, and areas with transient populations, were subjected to the most lynchings in the South. Georgia housed both of these types of places, where there was an average of ten lynchings per year.","This lynching was just one of the many rape-inspired attacks that occurred in the South. Over 60 percent of the lynchings of black men corresponded to an alleged sexual assault against a white woman. A third of those also involved mutilation and castration of the offender. The pretense for this common occurrence was the need to preserve the honor of whites. The code of honor in the South was heavily adhered to by white men at the time. This involved carrying out the duty to protect and uphold the honor of the women of their race and defending against black men who would denigrate that dignity. Any relations between a black man and a white woman were seen as immoral and a threat to white male dominance in the area. White men viewed the relations as the blacks' infiltration into white's territory and property and took whatever means necessary to protect it. Lynching was the most drastic and public manner in which white men could reassert their power and status in the racial hierarchy of the South."],"display_date":"September 12, 1897","search_date":"1897-09-12","locations":[{"id":1553,"lat":32.8067094598,"lng":-83.6980226314,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2845,"title":"Rambunctious Black Soldiers Kill Macon Boy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-03-08","end_date":"1899-03-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The soldiers were finally leaving Macon. Little did the surrounding area know that they would be celebrating throughout their entire journey-in a destructive and fatal way. On March 8, 1899, the black men of the Tenth Immunes boarded their train with hidden firearms in tow. As the train started along, and began coming along stations, the men fired multitudes of shots out of the windows at each platform. The shootings became more wild and unpredictable as the soldiers got more and more intoxicated. Evidently they concealed more than just guns as they boarded the railway car. By the time they had left the Macon area, one sixteen-year-old boy's life had been claimed by the soldiers. The commotion reached its heights after it passed into the outskirts of Macon, where the mayor and the Governor had to call upon the militia and armed citizens in order to maintain peace and retaliate as the train passed into Griffin, Georgia. ","It seemed unreasonable for a group of men to go on a shooting rampage from their railcar undisturbed when people knew that they were the source. But railroads were among the first places in which segregation was accepted and implemented. Therefore, the soldiers were in a car to themselves. They were also in a second-class car, where smoking and spitting and other related activities were permitted. Therefore it was not seen as a problem when the men pulled out alcohol and started drinking, or brought out their firearms. It was not seen as extremely out of the ordinary.","The situation was perpetuated further by the soldiers' consumption of alcohol. The temperance movement was in full swing by this time, with many of the prominent organizations such as the Women's Christian Temperance League, making their way into Georgia in the 1880s. In an effort to gain new supporters for the cause, this occurrence would have served as a headline story about the evils prompted by liquor. It had been consumed in public, caused political disruption, and killed an innocent boy. The real selling point of the incident was that blacks were the ones under the influence. The movement used blacks as a way to gain support, claiming that alcohol would make blacks, especially men, a greater danger than they were already assumed to be. Temperance was yet another way in which racial tension was continued in the South."],"display_date":"March 8, 1899","search_date":"1899-03-08","locations":[{"id":1553,"lat":32.8067094598,"lng":-83.6980226314,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2858,"title":"Petition for Mercy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-01-05","end_date":"1883-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Governor Cameron received a petition from a substantial number of Virginia citizens who were concerned with the injustice of a court decision in Virginia. The petitioners wanted a commutation of the sentence of the black man Preston Harris, who was sentenced to be hung for arson. Harris sent fire to the jail where he was housed, though no one seemed to know if it was accidental or purposeful. All of the prisoners housed in the jail were brought out to safety, and the conflagration was put out before too much damage was done. The court ruled that for this offense, Harris should be hung. The petition requested that the sentence be changed from hanging to life imprisonment since the prisoner was only 17 years old. It was obviously a clear case of guilt, but many people felt that it was too harsh for such a young man, even if he was black. "," There are many examples in Southern history of whites (and blacks as well) petitioning for blacks to be granted mercy in regards to very harsh sentences in the Virginia penal system. Historically, petitions were an important part of the American legal system, and citizens actively used this right to redress grievances and plead for mercy, especially with regards to criminals. This collective action allowed the general population to have a say in the specific roles of their government. However, it is not typical for whites to take such specific action for a black man. It was not unknown however, as can be seen throughout Virginia history. For example, in the case of Angela Barnett in 1793, Angela appealed to have her death sentence pardoned since she was with child. With this appeal and the help of petitions from white friends, that sentence was pardoned. While whites may find blacks dangerous as a whole, individual blacks were their friends. In this way, whites saw Harris as an individual person, who was unjustly sentenced, not as a part of the threatening black masses. While the specifics of the case are unknown, it is clear that whites in Southside Virginia saw the injustice of such a harsh sentence for someone so young.

The lynchers, according to the newspaper, would never be prosecuted. On March 27 of the previous year, the same newspaper reported that levee cutters would be properly cared for by the citizens of Bolivar county, as ropes and trees are plentiful up there. Thus it seems that lynching, for American Southerners, was simply an every-day fact of life; according to the Cleveland Gazette, the man in lynched in Texas was just one of 235 that year. Judging by later statistics, a proportionally large amount of those most likely occurred in Mississippi. ","Many if not all of those 235 lynching victims in 1891 were blacks, as African Americans were often the targets of lynch mobs . As the first blurb points out, it was common for whites of the South (and indirectly, by their indifference, the North) to simply let mob justice take its course, in order to, according to Michael Pfeifer, supposedly serve the purposes of local elites and other whites in relieving both economic and sexual anxieties. As white men saw it, the most overt kinds of opposition to their supremacy were frequently represented in these two forms. (Later, according to the Cleveland Gazette, white women of the south would take the take the charge in putting a stop to this mentality and to lynching). Thus the tensions in the South leading to lynchings were deeper simply skin color, although, according to Philip Dray, it was because of skin color that the accusations against those being sought out for lynching were often amplified and exaggerated by individuals in order to incite mobs.","During the late 1800s, according to Johnathan Markovitz, lynchings were carefully designed to convey to black persons in this country that they had no power and nothing else whites were obligated to respect. They were, in other words, used as measures of intimidation in order to prolong a society of white supremacy. Often, mobs of whites would turn lynchings into violent public spectacles, punishing one or two blacks to supposedly, as put by a Mayor of New Orleans, cause the others [to] trouble you no more.","Not all whites supported lynch mobs, however. Governor Hogg certainly did not appreciate the Law of the Mob. As Pfeifer points out, many others, such as Andrew Augustus Gunby, spoke out against lynchings and in support of law and order. They did so, however, often at the risk of their jobs and reputations, as Gunby blamed his stance on the lynching matter for his loss in the Democratic nomination for Congress from Louisiana's Fifth District in 1886. Additionally, Gunby, as many anti-lynching whites most likely did, spoke out in support of white supremacy; it is not as if he was anti-lynching because he believed in the equality of black men and women, he simply wanted the law to be upheld.","This is not the entire story of lynching in the South, however, as it seems things had changed by 1899. The Clarion Ledger, on September 14 and 21 of that year, published articles supporting the decision of the Governor McLaurin to call out the militia for the purpose of detering a lynch mob (an the militia followed his order), and lamenting the lynching of an innocent black man in Lawrence County, thus pointing out the wrongs of lynching. Although the paper still (somewhat paradoxically) supported lynching for rape, the evil [must] stop here. This seems to be, and is in a small way, a complete moral reversal of earlier values espoused by the paper (and supposedly therefore the average Mississippian). Unfortunately, there were some alternate motives.","Interestingly (and horribly) enough, economics played a large part in leading white supremacists to turn away from using lynching as a tool; according to Pfeifer, in the first decades of the twentieth century, an emerging urban bourgeoisie [in the South] wary of public disorder and threats to the accumulation of capital pressed for systematic legal methods for the sustenance of white supremacy. It seemed that by the early 1900s (and according to the Ledger, as early as 1899), the efforts of anti-lynching thinkers such as W.E.B. du Bois and Ida B. Wells, an African American woman who encouraged blacks to boycott, vote, and agitate against white oppressors were causing people everywhere to pay attention to what was happening in the South. Later, as Markovitz points out, efforts of organizations such as the NAACP (founded 1909) were paying off in bringing unwanted publicity to lynchings in the South, thereby threatening business by scaring off investors; influential white businessmen began to push more and more for writing white supremacy into law in order to legitimize the systems of white supremacy as well as maintain the flow of investments into the South. ","This is not to say that lynching stopped, however. The Cleveland Gazette reported episodes of lynchings in Mississippi into the 1920s. Furthermore, it seems white supremacy itself did not bother the aforementioned investors. Many across the country simply wanted to turn a blind eye to ways in which the system was being enforced. It's even questionable as to whether or not whites across the country objected to lynching as a process, as legal lynchings became popular in the early 1900s as a somehow more just and orderly answer to pure mob violence. Thus, it seems the September Ledger issues were merely protesting the evil of mob justice."],"display_date":"November 5, 1891 - December 31, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-03","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2873,"title":"Governor Mahone&#39;s Views on the Riot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-11-03","end_date":"1883-11-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On November 3, 1883, a black man refused to move off the sidewalk for a white man, and the ensuing violence caused a riot throughout the city of Danville as whites and blacks were attacked each other. One white man and five black men were killed. Each side blamed the other for starting the riot. Its repercussions sent shockwaves through the state of Virginia, especially with the November elections so close at hand. In response to the Danville riot, Governor William Mahone sent out a public statement on his views of the Danville riot. Mahone blamed the bourbon managers (referring to the bourbon democrats) for provoking the collision. He claimed the violence was done to intimidate black people and hurt the cause of his Readjuster Party. He explained how United States troops had been requested since the state militia was so biased against blacks in dealing with the violence. The statement was clearly political, as he blamed his political enemies for the violence. "," The late nineteenth century was plagued with political upheaval, especially in the South, as Southerners searched for a postbellum identity. The Readjuster Party was a third party that had an important influence in Virginia politics. The party gave substantial power to blacks and was based on equality for all. The party wanted to lift the state debt and therefore cut many civil service programs. It rejected the radicalism of both the Republicans and the Bourbon Democrats, who were an extreme wing of the Democrat that resisted the compromises that the Democrats were trying to make. With the November elections approaching, the violence in Danville was the result of frustration on the part of whites because of the increase political mobilization and power of blacks. The failure of a black man to show respect to a white man was the catalyst, and the violence caused the situation to spin out of control. This reaction of violence to the perceived arrogance of negroes was typical throughout the South, as the practice of lynching indicates. It also reflected an intense sense of honor that was prevalent throughout the South. Through violence, whites kept blacks in their place and protected a sense of order. Blacks were given little opportunity to express their grievances, since the law was so often on the side of whites.

It was suspected that Claytor was the same man who had assaulted Mr. Davis, but Mr. Davis failed to show up at the jail to identify him.

In many ways, this episode reflected the inferiority of blacks that many whites believed was inherent. While Claytor was a tramp, Burton only engaged in tramp-like activities. Black stereotypes were also enforced in this story, as social outcasts who were damaging to society.

The men included prominent clergymen, lawyers, bankers, and merchants of the city. They proceeded to march into the Negro Quarters to seize A.L. Manly's, editor of the Daily Record, printing office. They invaded the building, destroyed fixtures, and overturned kerosene lamps, starting a fire that spread and consumed the top floors. The news of the white mob quickly reached a cotton compress where approximately 300-400 African Americans were at work. These men immediately halted their work and went to the streets, creating mass chaos. It is unclear how trouble started but the whites opened fire on some African Americans on a street corner, killing three of them. Following that, the white men followed several other black men to their houses, dragging them into the streets, killing some and arresting others. By late afternoon, the twenty-five man committee marched to the City Hall and overturned the incumbent government, placing power entirely in the hands of the white Democratic Party. At the end of the day, white guards patrolled every street corner.","The tragic events of the day evolved out of the determination of white voters and taxpayers to take control of the city and county governments. The white Democrats had explicitly stated that they planned to manipulate the ballot boxes and enforce the resignation of the Republican Party from office and the removal of the republican county ticket, whether peacefully or by revolution if necessary. The day following the election, white citizens met under the leadership of Alfred Waddell and decided to take control of the entire city government, adopting resolutions that forced the Mayor and Chief of Police to resign and expelling A.L. Manly from Wilmington within twenty four hours. Manly had published an article in August denouncing white women in response to a speech given the previous year by a prominent Georgian woman where she condemned black men as white women's greatest danger. Manly's editorial rapidly became both a rallying point for white supremacists and a source of shame for African Americans. The committee had sent the orders of the resolution to prominent black leaders within the community and the directions told them to respond to Mr. Waddell by seven-thirty in the morning as to whether they would acquiesce with the removal of the printing press. Unfortunately, it was later discovered that they had mailed the response to Mr. Waddell in a letter that did reach the committee until three hours later than the designated time. In that letter, they had agreed to remove the press and expel Manly from the community, in addition to condemning his article.","In his study, David Cecelski agreed with other historians that Manly played a vital role in the Democratic and white supremacist victories in the election of 1898. Although, Cecelski concluded that Manly's article provided an excuse for the inevitable. In the wake of the growing black power, particularly in Wilmington, the Democrat machine had been advocating white supremacy and scheming to restore their political dominance for years. As neither the state nor the federal government stopped the rioting, the Wilmington Race Riot is the only successful violent overthrow of a local government in United States history. The newly elected Democrats immediately passed the first Jim Crow laws in North Carolina's history, reversing many of the rights that blacks had acquired since the Civil War.

Among these marshals were two or more black men, one of whom was Willis Tillman. As the crowd pushed its way out of the tent, Tillman became entangled with some white men and exercised his authority by hitting one or more of the men over the head with a heavy club.

As Huggins turned to flee, he was grabbed by two other black marshals who had come to Tillman's aid. Tillman again rushed at Huggins and began striking him repeatedly with the club while the other two marshals held him. He was then rushed to the hospital where it is unlikely that he survived as the pistol bullet was still lodged in his body. The marshals placed Huggins in jail where he also received careful surgical attention, although it is also unknown whether or not he survived the encounter.","At the center of this narrative is the continuing problem of race relations following the Civil War and Reconstruction. Incidents such as the one that occurred following the circus were characteristic of the constant clashes, sometimes violent, that occurred between blacks and whites in North Carolina. By 1895, although the blacks had received the freedom and opportunity to achieve certain esteemed jobs within the community, these jobs did not come with the respect from whites that they seemed to infer. North Carolina during the 1890s was a very hostile environment because whites believed that the blacks were trying to take over control of their government. Blacks had gained significant positions in both local and state government in the election of 1894. Authority exercised by any black man over any white man not only reminded the white southerners that they had lost the War and their property, but also that they had to live in an integrated society with these same people.","Huggins and Tillman's encounter reflects the increasing racial violence that occurred beginning in the 1890s in the South. In his book, Christopher Waldrup discussed the significance of boundaries in the nineteenth century southern society. He explained the developments of these boundaries and how they were constructed, contested, and violated as the uneasy relationship between race and law developed in the post-War South.

In The Commonwealth vs. Nat Turner, the defendant pleaded not guilty to the stated charges of making insurrection, and plotting to take away the lives of divers free white persons, &c. He explained his plea of 'not guilty' on the grounds that he did not feel so. The common belief at the time was that Nat Turner and the rest of the slaves in Southampton County were like spoiled children who, given too much in youth, grew up to think themselves worthy to rule all they saw. This sentiment, reified by the Southampton Insurrection, led to more stringent laws toward both slaves and free blacks across the South.

The current owners who had been trying to sell him wrote a letter to George W. Hamner, owner of Wyatt's family, informing him that Wyatt was for going off with you at all events - we therefore put him in jail - where we will keep him until we hear from you...we think he is too much a man of his own head to hire out anymore.

He writes that at the slave markets, consumers are often able to maintain a moral high ground in comparison to the traders, however misguided. However, in this example we see that even slave owners who are not engaged in the African slave trade often exhibit the same disregard for the needs or wants of their slaves. Thinly-veiled attempts at humane treatment are not enough to conceal the truly vicious nature of slavery. However, Johnson's book focuses mainly on New Orleans in the antebellum period, and this episode took place in Virginia in the midst of the Civil War. This may explain Wyatt's assertiveness - the Emancipation Proclamation had actually gone into affect four days earlier and many slaves pressed for their rights even when resentful masters and slave traders refused to grant them. In fact, in many states in the deeper South, slaves often did not even find out they had been emancipated until after the war ended. However, Virginia's proximity to the North and Washington, D.C. made it difficult for owners to conceal the news of emancipation.

","Branding runaways had long been a response used in the South. A 1696 South Carolina statute called for different levels of punishment for the repeated offense: First, forty lashes; Second, an R branded on the Right cheek; Third came forty more lashes and the loss of an ear; Fourth for a man was castration and for a woman was an R on the left cheek and the loss of the left ear; Fifth was death or the cord of one of the slave's legs to be cut off above the heel, the severing of the Achilles Tendon. Laws such as these were amended from time to time to better suit the ruling populace. In New York, the mode of execution for heinous offenses (intentionally broadly defined) was decided on a case-by-case basis. Maryland had a very ritualistic punishment for slaves who even committed petty treason or arson: Their right hand was cut off, then they were hanged, then beheaded, quartered, and put on display all across the county. Barbarous punishment for crimes denied slaves' humanity.

With sufficient evidence to investigate the situation, Chief Constable Fant and his men made their way down to the anti-Prohibition display.

As a state, South Carolina supported the regulation of liquor sales in response to the flux of alcoholism after the Civil War. According to Edward Ayers, liquor became an omnipresent beverage in the post-Reconstruction era as alcohol stores increased in number. Furthermore, the increase of liquor in society divided entire groups socially and politically. Developers pushed for an increased business pull for bars; they encouraged this as post-war economic growth. Also, whites, blacks, and women of both races found a large role in the prohibition movement as they rallied together to achieve the common goal of the prohibition of alcohol at bars and other similar stores. Janette Greenwood addresses the fact that, especially in the upper classes of both blacks and whites, race was discarded in order to push for social reform. It can be seen that Crawford Ballew?s demise can show how locally, Prohibition inspired an increase in organized crime in the Columbia area; however, across the south, the races and genders alike banded together to try and decrease the negative impact of liquor on their reparative society."],"display_date":"February 8, 1894","search_date":"1894-02-08","locations":[{"id":11641,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2973,"title":"Mistaken Identity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-02-14","end_date":"1893-02-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mrs. M.A. Moore, widowed mother of seven grown children, was alone in her home one morning. As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men. The element that stands out here is that the leaders of the town took the time to investigate Andy Blount's claims of innocence; more importantly, they concluded that he was in fact innocent.

Vermillion by a runaway slave sparked a manhunt in Fairfax County.  The slave, owned by Mr. William Brawner of Prince William County, had not gotten very far when Mr. Vermillion caught him near his house, Pleasant Valley, in Fairfax County. Upon apprehending the runaway, Mr. Vermillion was going to take him to the magistrate for a proper conviction and return to his master, as in due process. The slave, having had a small taste of freedom, could not bear the thought of returning to slavery, prompting him to murder Mr. Vermillion in an attempt to escape yet again.  As this attempt was successful, the slave became both a runaway and a murderer. Whether the runaway was ever caught is unknown.  If he were, he undoubtedly would have been executed for his crimes.  Slaves had very little voice in the judicial system.  Even if the runaway killed Mr. Vermillion unintentionally the likelihood of his conviction and subsequent execution was very high. ","At the center of this narrative is the psychological damage that slavery had on slaves.  They were stripped down mentally and dehumanized in such a way, that freedom was their only real option to a harrowing real life.  This slave was not the only one who cracked under the constrictions and hardships of slavery, which worked to bolster white supremacy. In his book Soul by Soul, historian Walter Johnson makes the point that slaves were no more than commodities.  The process of dehumanization that took place to turn them into objects rather than people was both mentally and physically destructive.  In addition to this, the disciplining of slaves was rarely punishable in court, regardless of how severe.  Courts were even reluctant to chastise abusive slave owners as long as their behavior did not affect the community. Thus, slaves themselves could not charge their master with abuse; someone else in the community would have to bring the case to court. While this directly shows the how little the law represented it also gives insight into how harmful owners could be to their slaves without punishment.  These things combined provided the slaves with a lifestyle that not all could handle.

In Fluvanna County, a black man named William Holly stole the bacon and other property belonging to a white woman named Beverly Haden. Haden pressed charges for the offense, and the accused stood trial for his crimes, and was found guilty. After emancipation, trials involving free blacks in the South were often conducted carefully to avoid the possibility of being accused of any impropriety due to racial bias. ","When writing the report of the trial proceedings, Captain Frank P. Cranton, Attorney General Manager of that district, made sure to emphasize the complete fairness of the proceedings: The evidence and the prisoner's confession were strongly against him. The examination was fairly constructed. Colored evidence properly taken into consideration and every point of law contested in the prisoner's favor but his legal adviser Thomas H. Tuttwiler, one of the most responsible and best lawyers of the county. The proceedings throughout were conducted with all fairness, and no white citizen could have had a more impartial hearing. ","Often in cases of theft or other relatively minor infractions with recently freed blacks as the defendants a certain amount of condescending leniency was granted. The officers of the court regularly assumed that because of the short time that had passed since the defendant had even become a citizen, they could not be expected to be cognizant of the laws of the land. In her book <em>Dixie After the War</em>, Myrta Lockett Avery writes that The new manners of the blacks were painful, revolting, absurd. The freedman's misbehavior was to be condoned only by pity that accepted his inferiority as excuse. However condescending this attitude was, it may have had some merit, although it could just as easily be argued that even former slaves were aware that stealing was against the law. Either way, it definitely worked in the favor of the free blacks who stood trial.","This obsession with propriety and fairness was belied by the still-racist nature of the courts. In the document, Holly is identified as col'd (or colored), while Haden, a white woman, needed no racial identification at all. In his dissertation, James Douglas Smith writes about the sense of responsibility that whites in Virginia often felt towards freed blacks when it came to helping them navigate through the systems to which they had not been exposed prior to their freedom. Although this is of course not overwhelmingly true, as violence and racial tension comprised a large part of post-Civil War society all over the South, examples of white southerners displaying degrees of kindness, understanding, and paternalistic attitudes towards the newly-freed blacks can be found.

The hanging was in retaliation for the brutal murder of several white individuals around Greensville County, including the 1898 murder of Charles Wyatt, a storeowner from Portsmouth, Virginia. After escaping from jail in Portsmouth, O'Grady and Cotton terrorized Greensville County, executing robberies and the violent murder of a farmer.

After Cotton's lifeless body hung from the tree like a scarecrow blacks who had witnessed the lynching turned on the whites and demanded the subsequent lynching of O'Grady. You have lynched the Negro, now lynch the white man. The biracial crowd then turned on the jail pulling Mr. O'Grady from his cell and hanging him on the Cherry tree next to the lifeless body of Walter Cotton.The violent lynching of a black man for the murder of a successful white businessman such as Charles Wyatt was not uncommon at the end of the nineteenth century. However the lynching of Walter Cotton is one of the rare instances in southern history were the participants of the lynching were of both black and white racial identity. The hanging of the two brutal murders shows a brief glimpse of racial equity among the public opinion of the citizens. While the lynchings were influenced by mob hysteria, and against the efforts of police, the participants nonetheless engaged in a public tribunal that blamed both the white and black men guilt of the crime they had committed. Had the racially mixed crowed not demanded the hanging of Mr. O'Grady, then the events of that day would most likely been perceived as yet another incident of an angry white mob engaging in a racially motivated lynching of a black man. Despite being nearly forty years removed from the fall of slavery, violence towards blacks remained prevalent.

Consciousness turned to darkness, emptiness, and then, it was all over."," Although hangings were a common sentence for serious crimes in the nineteenth century South, this particular scene that occurred in St. James Parish, Louisiana in September 1871 is quite unusual.  As the <em>New York Evangelist</em> reported, the two criminals, sheriff, executioner, jailer, and guards shared a surprising similarity: all six of these men were African Americans.  "," Reconstruction in the South is often characterized as a time of strict white repression and violence as whites tried to reckon with the freedom of slaves within their communities.  Especially in Louisiana where many parishes had large African American populations, violence committed by whites against free slaves was paramount.  "," However, this execution complicates the model of white supremacy that was believed to crush and control all African American actions.  This event in St. James Parish, Louisiana reveals an interesting instance that questions the role of African Americans in the maintenance of law and order in the South during Reconstruction.  The names of the African Americans, both the criminals and the law enforcement officials, were not mentioned.  This coupled with the brevity of the article reveals that there was little concern for such an occurrence.  There must have been some interest in this scene, though, or else it would not have even been printed, especially in a New York publication.  Even more interesting is that this event refutes the general view of Reconstruction characterized by brutal white law enforcement.  Whites were usually believed to exercise complete control over African Americans who broke the law.  But, this instance clearly refutes this notion.  That the sheriff, executioner, jailer, and guards were all African American is quite significant.  At least in St. James Parish, African Americans were afforded some autonomy in punishing criminals of their own race.  With a hierarchy that consisted entirely of African American officials, it can be concluded that not all Southern communities had solely white-dominated structures within the realm of law enforcement."," One explanation for this remarkable set-up of law officials can be found in Ted Tunnell's <em>Crucible for Reconstruction</em>.  New Orleans, the largest and most important city in Louisiana at this time, was only separated from St. James by one other parish.  This close proximity allowed ideas and practices to quickly reach neighboring localities.  Furthermore, between 1870 and 1872, with the reorganization of parish boundaries immediately outside the city, New Orleans' top officials were all Republicans.  This political control was greatly beneficial to African Americans.  Republicans were more sympathetic to African American needs than Democrats, and often provided them with the necessary help to secure positions of public office.  Whether or not these law enforcement officials were in office solely because of Republican political dominance in the area at this time, it is nonetheless noteworthy that these African American men were able to govern themselves in the face of harsh white backlash so soon after the war."],"display_date":"September 21, 1871","search_date":"1871-09-21","locations":[{"id":5681,"lat":30.0360710159,"lng":-90.7802066297,"zoom":10,"place":"ST JAMES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2987,"title":"Convict Standoff\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-07-13","end_date":"1886-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was already hot.

Forty-eight hours later, the convicts were still without food, and the residents of nearby Cole City were fearful of vengeful attack. Colonel Tower stood by the stockade with the inmates inside all night. He tried persuasion and threats, keeping a conversation going with the convicts. By daybreak, the rebels were hungry-and a few of them were hungrier than the rest. These few decided that they wanted to surrender, that they had had enough. Their fellow convicts immediately set upon them physically, upset with their actions. Despite this show of force on the part of the rebellion?s leaders, the sentiments of the few soon spread to the rest. By the end of that day, all save one of the rebels had surrendered the cause. ","This episode is indicative of the perils of the southern convict lease system in the post-war period. As historian Mark Carleton notes, this plentiful source of cheap labor was irresistible to southern state governments with prison management problems. Indeed all southern states used the system after the 1870s. This episode indicates the support politicians gave the system because the leases were a source of state revenue at the same time as they eliminated the drain on the state to house and feed criminals. As evidenced in the protests of these convicts in Dade County, the workers were poorly fed and cared-for and suffered physical abuse by those overseeing their work. Carleton makes the point that as convicted criminals, no one was concerned for their well-being. Thus, when conditions became unbearable, they had to speak up for themselves. Indeed, the terrible conditions described by the convicts here appear to historians today to been a very like those under slavery in the antebellum south.

While this petty incident of crime was relatively unnoticed, buried in the middle of the paper, the style in which the brief story was written illustrates the social opinions in this southern city. The story goes on to describe how the black man acted in a deceitful and dishonest way to hide the pocketbook and claim that he knew nothing of robbery. When question for his theft, the man stated that it was his belief that the women had misplaced the pocketbook and that he had not taken it. However, the end result for the black man was the dismissal of his services: he is now minus a home.What is important about this incident is that it demonstrated the fears of whites about what free blacks would do to the order of white communities. Since the days of slavery, the majority of blacks were viewed as dangerous and uneducated. The fears of whites were constantly perpetuated by stories of criminal activity by blacks against white communities. Furthermore, the expanding economic and social influences of the black community intimidated many whites.The Atlanta Riots of 1906 showed this tension in full force. While many Southern cities forced the close interactions of free blacks and whites, the growing economic competition for jobs led to the boiling over of much aggression. Additionally, poverty played a large motive for crime in the poor Southern economies after the Civil War. Furthermore white women being taken advantage of by their black male servants was perhaps the greatest fear in regards to racially motivated crime. Consequently the article proclaims through subtle word usage that the black man is undeniably guilty despite the unsubstantiated evidence. While the goal of the Virginian-Pilot was predominantly to sell papers, it is clear why a newspaper would not attempt to seem biased toward blacks in their articles.  Just as white business owners viewed the loss of customers as a disincentive to hire blacks, so too did newspapers see the disincentive to positively reporting blacks.

His illustrious military career included leading the Creeks against the British in the War of 1812, defeating the Upper Creek Indians against their Lower Creek foes in the Creek Civil War, and heading a national police force to continue the fight against the Upper Creeks.  Yet, these military conquests also created many enemies, especially among the Upper Creeks.","The final straw for the Upper Creeks was on February 12, 1825, when McIntosh, along with eight like-minded Lower Creek chiefs, signed the Treaty of Indian Springs relinquishing all of the Upper and Lower Creeks' land in Georgia for a sum of 400,000.  In retaliation for losing their land unjustly and because of their hatred for General McIntosh in general, 200 Upper Creek Indians set fire to McIntosh's plantation on April 30 and brutally murdered him in the process.  Little did the Upper Creeks know that they had also upset an entire state of white Georgians.","A few months later, editorialists in the northeast responded to the Creek's loss of land with disdain for the actions of the United States government.  On June 21, 1825, the <em>Southern Recorder</em> responded both to the actions of the Upper Creeks and the reaction of the Yankee editorialists furiously.  ","<em>The Recorder</em> began by mourning the fate of McIntosh, who, the paper claims, sacrificed his life for the Creek Indians.  In their view, he had devoted his life to the progress of his red brethren towards civilized life.  Sadly, their turbulence and treachery had rendered his cause unsuccessful.  ","<em>The Recorder</em> went on to find utmost fault in other newspapers that claimed that McIntosh sought to steal land for the United States from the Creeks by pushing them beyond the Mississippi River and leaving Georgia for the white man.  <em>The Recorder</em> editorialized that by defending the property rights of the Creeks, the eastern editorialists were also condoning the murder of their beloved McIntosh.  ","In fact, the <em>Recorder</em> argued, if the business [of aggression towards the Creeks] had been conducted more energetically on the part of the United States, McIntosh's murder could have been prevented.  In this way, the United States was actually doing the Creeks a favor by forcing the untutored and uncivilized Creeks off of their lands in Georgia.  The Creeks would have likely been better off if they had simply moved west unprovoked because they had no chance in their battles against their American foe.  An earlier withdrawal from Georgia without bloodshed would have saved thousands of Creek and American lives.","The focus of this narrative is the ongoing tension between American and Georgian expansionism against the territorial concerns of the Creek Indians.  Treaties between the Creeks and Georgia helped define the land struggles between the two peoples since late in the 1700s, but violence reigned supreme in the majority of the interactions between the two cultures.  The United States government, especially under the leadership of President Andrew Jackson, violently forced the Creeks out of the state, all while hiding under a similar veil of concern for the Indians that the Recorder showed in this article.  ","The Creeks consistently refused the repeated requests from the United States government that their peoples move out of Georgia without the force of the United States military.  Although in a less organized fashion than that of the United States, the Creeks persisted to fight the Americans over the contested Georgia lands.  While McIntosh's death defined the Indian people to the Recorder, his murder only served as a highlighted event in ongoing strife between the Creeks and the American government over land claims that eventually led to the Trail of Tears and the near extermination of the Creek Indians."],"display_date":"June 21, 1825","search_date":"1825-06-21","locations":[{"id":1522,"lat":33.0721732643,"lng":-83.2584220033,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3013,"title":"Creek Attack\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1825-05-25","end_date":"1825-05-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In late April 1825, with the murder of William McIntosh and his brother Samuel Hawkins fresh on his mind, Benjamin Hawkins carefully rode his horses back towards his hometown of Montgomery, Georgia, in the fear of suffering a similar fate on his brother.  Suddenly, he came upon a party of twenty Creek Indians within ten short steps of their horses.  Frightened, a cousin of Hawkins? abruptly fired a blank rifle shot into the air in the hopes of frightening the pack of Creeks.  The Creeks quickly responded, firing towards Hawkins as he wheeled his horse around to gallop in the opposite direction.  Fortunately, Hawkins was not hit.  In the melee that followed the unwelcome encounter, he tossed his plaid cloak aside, only to have it littered with Creek gunfire.  ","As Hawkins rode into the distance, the Creeks rejoiced, presuming from Hawkins? bullet-ridden cloak that Hawkins had either been wounded or killed.  Reports from the Creeks made it back to the Southern Recorder, who reported on May 8 that Benjamin Hawkins had both been murdered by the same pack of Creeks who had killed McIntosh and his brother.  ","Yet, good news somehow remained.  On Saturday, May 13, nearly one week after the Southern Reporter confirmed the murder of Hawkins, a surprise visitor returned to Milledgeville by way of Fort Gaines.  Despite all reports to the contrary, Benjamin Hawkins remained alive.  Notwithstanding physical evidence by way of the bullet-ridden cloak, Hawkins had not even been injured in the scuffle.  ","There is little doubt that the Upper Creek Indians sought revenge for the United States? and Georgia?s acquisition of former Creek land and their support of the Lower Creeks in the Creek Civil War.  Like many other attacks, this attempted murder and robbery seemed to be random retaliatory violence against a member of the white race.  A few short years after this incident, the Georgia militia clashed repeatedly with Creek warriors in the Georgia Black Belt Region.  Larger battles followed in Chattahoochee region and towards the Alabama border.  Yet, most did not have the luck of Benjamin Hawkins on this late April day.

Accused of the crime were two white men, Sam Beale and James Brittle, and a colored man named Edward White. The September 7, 1899 issue of the Virginian-Pilot describes how the men are accused of the brutal bludgeoning of McDonald and then placing his body on train tracks. However the paper goes on to say that expert witnesses described how Patrick McDonald was murdered prior to be struck by the train.The collaborative efforts of the racial mixed attackers against the white tramp appear to have been senselessly carried out. While the newspaper fails to provide a motive for the crime, one can presume that the criminals had petty motives for the murder of this vagrant. Furthermore race appears not to be the driving factor behind the violence. Just as white and black indentured servants had relied on one another to escape from their owners prior to the Civil War, it appears that the white and black individuals relied on one another in the 1890's. The trust that must be present for the men to have jointly executed a crime must have strengthened the men's bond. In this situation it appears that a common socio-economic scenario for all the criminals served as a source of personal identification rather than race. Additional examples of random violence can be found within the black community. A September 30, 1891 article from the Norfolk Virginian describes the robbery of a black couple on an evening walk through the park. Upon being questioned by police, the black women described being held up by two black men. In this case both the robber and the victims were blacks. What is notable about these events is that random violence does not occur across set boundaries and follows no set patterns. This indicates that murder was not merely confined to the stereotypical perception of whites lynching blacks or blacks murdering whites. Rather as blacks began to assimilate into a predominantly white society, people began to look toward commonalities of social and economic status rather than skin color. Furthermore as additional exposure to blacks emerged and racial lines became more blurred, race was not always seen as the defining factor.

The bullet from the double-barreled shot gun grazed Joseph Richburg's coat. Almost immediately, a second shot tore through his pants. Responding quickly, Richburg fired back at his adversary, Brewer, who had begun to flee. Then Richburg aimed his shot gun at Brewer's son, prepared to fire again. However, when Brewer's son dropped his gun and begged for mercy, Richburg allowed him to live. This confrontation in the form of a duel typifies the white Southern gentleman's way of dealing with a dispute. Moreover, Richburg's grace and mercy highlight a chivalrous, honorable deed that would have served to better his reputation. The culture of excessive masculinity in the South made duels a respected means of settling a conflict."," In the anonymously written <em>Practical Lessons Under the Code Duello</em>, published in 1874, there are valid instances when participation in duels is not only acceptable, but also necessary. The author goes on to state that if a man finds himself in some situation in which his authority or character is threatened, he must be...less than man if he were to submit in silence. The practice of dueling, the author believes, will never fade away, because it will be persisted in as long as a manly independence and a lofty personal pride in all that dignifies and ennobles the human character shall continue to exist. This bold statement clearly reveals the drive that pushed Richburg and Brewer to a duel. The code of honor that came with being a man was deeply branded within the mind of both Southerners."," Joseph Richburg and his neighbor Brewer had been friends in Madison Parish, Louisiana. They were both small planters and knew well the hardships of maintaining a self-sustaining farm. Both men would have relied on a barter system to attain goods and services. However, when Richburg owed Brewer some meat, <em>The National Police Gazette</em> cites that a dispute arose and that out of this tension grew a bad feeling which nothing but gore could satisfy. Richburg was unable to pay Brewer his debt, and so the men confronted one another in a duel. The two men met at Willow ditch, a lonely swamp between Pawpa Lake and Joe's bayou. Brewer brought his twenty-one year old son with him to the meeting, and Richburg brought his fifteen-year old son and his friend, Mr. Willis. Willis, acting as a mediator between the two men, persuaded the men to settle the matter with words and not bullets. Brewer's son, Willis, and Richburg converged to reach an agreement, but suddenly Brewer jumped out from behind a tree, shooting twice at Richburg. The scene described above then unfolded. "," The detailed description <em>The National Police Gazette</em> afforded this event is quite significant. It shows that duels were still a completely acceptable and sometimes necessary way to settle disputes between two men even in 1881. Southern men held themselves to a strict code of honor that included an aggressive, masculine showcase of confrontation which often culminated in dueling. Duels were afforded much attention in this culture of extreme virility that is so dramatically detailed in the both The National Police Gazette and the Code Duello."],"display_date":"May 21, 1881","search_date":"1881-05-21","locations":[{"id":5578,"lat":32.147356423,"lng":-91.0322487665,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3047,"title":"Religion Spawns Murder in South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-03-01","end_date":"1897-03-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the last day of February 1897, according to <em>The State</em>, John Yochum was shot and killed by a coworker from the Richland mill, Bryce McComb. When McComb, a young man not yet of age, approached Yochum, a man of 53, to reprimand him for his treatment of another worker, Owens, the elder retaliated with violence. Owens had approached a group of his coworkers asking them if they would have liked to accompany him to Tabernacle services. According to witnesses, Yochum had called Owens a false Christian who was just as ready as Yochum to have improper intimacy with loose women. McComb told Yochum to respect Owens for his age; however, Yochum used this as a platform to attack the young man. McComb pulled out his pistol in retaliation and in the struggle pulled the trigger; the bullet pierced Yochum?s hat. Yochum then hit McComb over the head with his gun and the latter fired; the second bullet pierced the old man?s neck and followed a downward course to its final resting spot between the fifth and sixth ribs. McComb willingly turned himself in; also, a partly used flask of corn whiskey was found on Yochum?s body, and it is most likely he had been drinking throughout his work day."," While the South experienced a cultural, social, and political reconstruction after the Civil War, religion also became an even more dynamic yet concrete part of the southern lifestyle. In the Yochum murder situation, religion became the motivating factor of the argument as Owens? spirituality caused the negative reaction of Yochum which inspired the fatal argument between the coworkers. Even though personal religious debates may not have been every day occurrences in South Carolina, religious fervor as a whole was a staple of southern life. According to Edward Ayers, religious fervor was a staple across the South after the Civil War in both private lives and political orations. With South Carolina as a mainly Protestant area, the different denominations still inspired strife between religious factions. Furthermore, ?great variability in church membership marked the South.? With some people holding strong onto new religious convictions, their incredibly devout beliefs often times conflicted with the more lackadaisical lifestyles of their neighbors. "," Though the Yochum murder exemplifies a specific conflict in Upcountry South Carolina, it also relates to the widespread, incredibly intense sermons of the time period. For example, while preaching, Sam Jones criticized all of his audience members and disregarded race, gender, and spirituality. Jones touched every hidden aspect of southern life in his sermons. As the Protestant religions scrambled to match the standards of churches that had not lost vital development time in the Civil War and Reconstruction, national preachers, like Sam Jones, inspired a reawakening of religious fervor across the South."],"display_date":"March 1, 1897","search_date":"1897-03-01","locations":[{"id":11641,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3050,"title":"A Petition on Behalf of a Slave Named Royal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-01-01","end_date":"1824-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Several citizens of upstate South Carolina approached the state assembly with a petition concerning a runaway slave of special concern to the region. Several years earlier a South Carolina citizen by the name of George Ford had been murdered by a slave named Joe (also called Forest) owned by a Mr. Carroll of Richland County. Both Mr. Ford's relatives, as well as the state, offered more than 1,000 dollars for the capture of the runaway slave, but no one was successful in apprehending him. Joe was actually so successful in evading capture that he arose as a leadership figure for other runaway slaves in the area, and established a camp of criminal runaways in the depths of the local swamp."," The local citizens had continued to grow more and more uneasy about the presence of this camp of slaves in their community, fearing the group was planning a large scale insurrection. They had petitioned the state and Commander- in- Chief to call in proper military forces to dispel the rebellious camp. When the state did not respond to their requests they took matters into their own hands and formed a civilian militia, intent on finding and eliminating the threat themselves. The expedition was unsuccessful until a slave named Royal, owned by a citizen of Richland County, guided the militia to Joe's camp, allowing the group of fugitives to be captured and hanged for attempted murder. More than 70 citizens signed the petition asking the assembly to grant full compensation to the slave Royal for his assistance in serving the state and the citizens in the capture. The general assembly rewarded Royal's owner seven hundred dollars compensation to delegate to Royal as she saw appropriate."," The above petition provides a view into the complex racial relations in upstate South Carolina, as well as those typical across the antebellum South. The Richland district was one of largest cotton producing regions of South Carolina during this period, and was therefore one of the districts most reliant upon slave labor, resulting in a majority black population. The reality of a black majority may have resulted in a kind of reign of terror, much like other areas of the South with large slave populations. According to historian Walter Edgar, the period before this petition was issued was dotted with incidences of slave revolts across South Carolina: Columbia in 1805, Camden in 1816, and more rumors of rebellion in the coastal areas in 1822. The uneasiness of the white slave owners is clearly represented in the description of this petition and the citizens' insistence on finding the runaway slave and his camp of followers, as well as their desire to reward faithful slaves. The situation illustrated here shows the typical contrast between the wariness of Southerners with respect to threats to the system of slavery and their absolute reliance on slaves as faithful servants and members of Southern communities."],"display_date":1824,"search_date":"1824-07-01","locations":[{"id":11634,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3053,"title":"Robbery by Spaniards\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-04-22","end_date":"1831-04-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Ten years after the acquisition of Florida from Spain, Mr. Munroe, his wife, and a guide rode horseback on a secluded road near Matanzas, Georgia, a few short miles from the Florida border.

Fortunately for the Munroe's, a group of fellow travelers on the Matanzas road came to their rescue right before the Spaniards finished breaking into the trunk.

Sheriff Rogers of Jasper had in his custody the three men believed to be responsible for the murder: Floyd Woodlee, John Turner, and Cal Collins. In fact, Woodlee was the only man who confessed to the act. Sheriff Rogers was keeping the men in the county jail until such time as their trial could take place. However, a mob surrounded the jailhouse, demanding that the men be released to them. They were determined to get the men and to take them away, but the mob refrained from actually breaking into the jail with force. ","Sheriff Rogers went outside and stood among the crowd. He spoke to them calmly, rationally persuading them that justice was sure to take its course in the case. He quieted the mob with his speech and they eventually began to go home. The mob dispersed of its own accord, satisfied as it was that the three men would be found guilty and hanged anyway, with very little trouble to them. But the heat was not off. J.T. Simpson, a citizen of Jasper prognosticated that the black men would very likely be lynched, even over the protests of the sheriff, next time the mob assembled, if they were not found guilty of George Dawson's murder. ","This 1892 narrative seems to be an anomaly in the history of lynching in the South. That the local law enforcement prevented lynching in this case is particularly significant given that in this same year, the number of lynchings of black men across the south reached its peak- 155 men killed over the course of this one year. The scenario of the mob surrounding the jail, demanding that the offenders be released to them was common- if the suspected offenders even made it into the jailhouse alive. Some who study the phenomenon of lynching postulate that the practice became common around the turn of the century in the South because of weak social institutions, weak civic institutions, and ineffective law enforcement. They say that all these factors failed to develop sufficiently and so failed to instill in their communities a respect for the rule of law. However, we see in this episode a law enforcement agent standing up to the mob effectively, something that probably occurred rarely.

The slaves put much effort into the night to make it the happiest of times. Slaves on the plantation looked forward to the ball each year. This year the ball fell on a beautiful night. The Fearns were the last to leave for the ball. As they followed the path to get there, a large slave armed with knives approached Mr. Fearn. This slave had run away three months before to avoid the harsh demands of the sugar-grinding season. The plantation owner ordered the slave to put down his weapons. Out of respect for Mr. Fearns authority the slave fell to the owner's feet and begged to go to the ball. The master agreed to allow him to attend the ball, but warned he would be subject to the punishment by the other slaves. Upon entering the ball he was severely beaten by his fellow slaves and dragged from the ball.","Oftentimes runaway slaves were not punished directly by their owners. Many owners thought that runaways were just an inevitable part of slaveholding. Although slave escapes were a common occurrence, they did not cause much excitement. In fact an owner did not advertise that he had a runaway until that slave had been missing for several weeks. This composure about runaways was due to the fact that most slaves returned to the plantation because they could not bear to leave their families. It was assumed that a successful runaway would never return to the plantation he or she left and would leave his family forever. ","Family was one of the most treasured aspects of life for slaves. The Christmas season was the best time of the year for slaves because it enabled slaves to spend time with their families. Slaves were permitted to take a break from their grueling work to enjoy the holidays. On sugar plantations throughout Louisiana this leisure period was often pushed back until the end of January - after the grinding season. It was common that a dinner and a ball were held in honor of the slaves. Dancing was the most popular activity for the slaves. They danced long into the night. Fellow slaves played music and were sometimes able to make money doing so. Masters often gave their slaves gifts during the Christmas season and may have even given them passes to go where they pleased, within a certain distance, during the rest of their break. There were obvious limitations to the festivities that the slaves were able to enjoy, but it is clear that the Christmas season at least gave enslaved people something to look forward to each year."],"display_date":"April 1862","search_date":"1862-04-15","locations":[{"id":5562,"lat":29.3204554147,"lng":-90.0865534097,"zoom":8,"place":"LAFOURCHE, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3083,"title":"Railroad Ruckus\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-30","end_date":"1895-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On an ordinary day in Rogersville the Southern Railway train, run by Conductor Shell, pulled into the station to unload its cargo of flour and take on the next load of lumber. Lewis Boyd, a black man, hopped up into the car to help unload the flour. As he removed the sacks of flour from the car, he happened to throw some of them to the ground. Conductor Shell reprimanded Boyd for his carelessness and Boyd took great offense. Boyd began to mutter and to curse the conductor out loud. Shell immediately responded, telling Boyd to stop. At this, Boyd snapped and he jumped onto Shell from the train car, hitting him on the head with a large stone. As Shell fell to the ground, Boyd hit him again and began kicking him. Other men working on the train rushed to the scene and restrained him. Boyd, seeing how badly Shell was hurt, ran for a nearby swampy area. However, the trainmen gave chase and brought him back. ","Meanwhile, word spread of what had happened. As Boyd was apprehended and brought back to town, a mob assembled, ready to kill Boyd for what he had done. The trainmen averted a lynching by hurrying Boyd off to the judge in Rogersville, who promptly threw Boyd in jail. At his trial, Boyd claimed Shell was the cause of the incident, that his actions were provoked. ","As railroads spread across the country in the period after the Civil War, they did more than just move goods for commerce from one place to another. They allowed people to move in, out, and around the south to a much greater degree than ever before. Thus, there were more unfamiliar faces- white and black- in towns where the railroad came. We don?t know if Boyd knew Shell personally, but it seems unlikely given the immediate hostility that arose between them on the day of the incident and given Boyd?s extreme actions. Historians have pointed out that these new social situations called for a more complex level of interaction than both white people and black people had been used to in the antebellum period. Indeed, race relations in these urban areas with people coming in and out were more impersonal and confrontational; thus a situation in which a railroad worker insulted a conductor and then attacked and severely injured him would be more likely to occur.

The law was unpopular and the city of Charleston refused to accept it. Opposition grew so strong in the city that even many Prohibitionists came out against the law, massive quantities of liquor were purchased by private citizens before it went into effect, and the state responded by ordering bars across the city closed and arresting anyone who tried to distribute alcohol without a license."," This incident shows both the nature of local politics in South Carolina in the late nineteenth century and the state of the progressive movement in the South. As William Cooper and Thomas Terrill explain, progressivism in the North tended to focus on social reform and saving the souls of the ignorant masses while the Southern strain of the movement was more focused on busting monopolies. This tradition went back over a century and played on Southern planters' mistrust of big business in the North.

On June 1, 1821, a special court, held in Clarksville, Montgomery County, charged two slaves owned by Mr. William Sullivan with having killed Elizabeth Crockett. According to The Watchman, a Tennessean newspaper: the court and jury were occupied until about eleven o'clock, on Thursday night, with the examination of the case. Travis, one of the two slaves was acquitted, for the want of sufficient proof. The following day, there was the trial of his son, Kinchen, who was found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged on 8 June 1821.

Indeed, being a member of a quite well-to-do family was not enough to be protected and it was sometimes a cause of their misfortune. As everywhere in the South, violence was part of the life of people in Tennessee, especially violence between different races. But Tennessee had to deal with lots of interactions between races, perhaps more than other states, notably because Tennessee was a frontier state with many Indian lands. It also had to deal with class cohabitation because there was a gap between rich planters and other Tennesseans. This is why violence was present in different ways in Tennessee: murder, robbery, revolts...

The company examined every nook and cranny of the county and its outlying areas but could find neither head nor tail of the Zeiglers. In the process, the team searched both the Zeigler household as well as that of their sister, Miss Zeigler. This venture proved unsuccessful in the end as well.

Vendettas and vigilante justice were but two elements which characterized the political sphere in Georgia at the time. The new and short-lived Populist Party warred against the long-entrenched Democratic Party throughout the last decade of the nineteenth-century as they sought to rally around the white farmer, recruit the black Republican, and restore a pure form of democracy by eliminating corruption in business and government. Oddly enough the Populists turned a blind eye to the immediate side-stepping of the law taken by individuals like the Zeiglers.

They had drunk their coffee and eaten breakfast as usual that morning, but began to feel ill soon afterwards. The shared pain made them wonder if someone had poisoned them. As it turned out, someone had slipped poisonous Jameson weed into their coffee. But who would do such a thing? That evening as the family recovered, the police arrested a black woman name Frances for the crime and planned to try her the next morning. ","Adolphus Sterne described this event in his diary on July 21, 1841. The only information Sterne gave about Frances was that she was a negro woman. This presumably meant that Frances was one of the Hyde family's household slaves, possibly a cook since she had access to their coffee. Frances's method of murder is significant as Joshua D. Rothman explains: In most cases, women were physically weaker than their owners. When they wished to harm a master or his family, arson or poisoning were more typical weapons of choice. True to Rothman's statement, Frances used poison as a way to injure her master and his family. Her physical limitations as a woman and the ease of obtaining poison and administering it made poisoning her preferred weapon. ","That their own household slave tried to murder them no doubt came as a shock to the Hyde family, and indeed upset many other white families in the area. When slaves rose up against their masters, regardless of the context in which they did so, they implicitly threatened all masters and all whites, observes Rothman. Frances's attempt set a dangerous precedent. If a slave woman could almost murder a family, what could a slave man, or worse a band of slave men do? Episodes like this created feelings of fear and distrust in the minds of slave owners. It also opened the way for other such crimes on the part of slaves. Thus the people had to act quickly on this matter. They planned to try Frances the very next day because they needed to show that they would not tolerate such undermining of a master's authority.

Many whites had never dealt with free blacks and many free blacks had never been free. White Anglo-Saxon Protestant groups such as the Ku Klux Klan were formed in an attempt to maintain the status quo that had arisen over the past two centuries. Through acts of violence and intimidation, Ku Klux members aimed to scare free blacks into adopting a sense of second-class citizenship. In 1875, the Louisville-Courier Journal reported that a young negro girl had recovered after being shot in the eye by Ku Klux members, though her vision was still quite defective. While the paper does not print her name, they do offer an insight into the attack, writing, ?How the ball could have cut the eye without touching the face in any other place is one of them things no fellow can find out.? ","The newspaper may not have printed the young girls? name out of fear it would bring further harm to her.

Hooded men rode on horseback, aiming to destroy radical political organizations and disperse African American gatherings. ","While somewhat successful at keeping these union organizers away, the real impact of the Ku Klux Klan was the return of southern social culture. The Civil War and Reconstruction robbed the South of its identity. The Ku Klux Klan worked to keep blacks from voting or receiving formal educations. Ultimately though, the Klan failed in restoring white supremacy. It had irresponsible leaders who used the Klan as a veil to commit murder and robbery, and it had no centralized control. In 1869, the grand wizard announced the formal disbandment of the order. However, it is clear that the Ku Klux Klan did not simply disappear.

White criminals faced one set of rules while blacks faced another. Southern justice did not favor the death penalty unless the accused was black, in which case there was hardly a hesitation in its authorization. On March 15, 1884 in Jonesville, Virginia, Absalom Russell, a white man, was hanged for the murder of Ira Dean. The murder took place two years prior in July of 1882. After the initial guilty verdict, the case traveled through several courts where the guilty verdict was never overturned. Surprisingly, the newspaper points out that the execution of Russell was the first in Lee County since a man was hung for murdering a police officer sixty-seven years before. ","Justice meant different things to different races. Russell, due to his race, was able to have his case heard several times in appeals courts before he was finally hung. The difference in the treatment of blacks and whites in the court room is clear. From 1800-1860, whites were hung in Virginia only for the crime of murder. Half of the blacks that faced the death penalty during that same time period were murderers. Black rapists, burglars, and arsonists were all hung from 1800-1860 in Virginia. This is true in many of the southern states during the nineteenth century. Absalom Russell was able to have his case heard in several courts before finally being hung, while a black man guilty of stealing faced the noose immediately. ","After the Civil War, when treating blacks as property was no longer allowed, many southern states gave their all-white juries the ability to hand down capital punishments. Thus, these states were able to ensure that blacks faced the death penalty far more often than whites. Many blacks did not have the opportunity to face these juries due to the sudden rise in lynchings that took place during Reconstruction. Those responsible for the lynching hardly ever faced repercussions in the court room. The hanging of Absalom Russell was front page news in Wytheville.

He needed to make a few purchases, namely tools and home goods. While in town Pitts noticed a few stores had closed signs in the window. Upon returning home to his plantation, Pitts entered in his diary, Thursday Holy day among the Jews - All places of business closed among them this day...and this is new year with them... While it remains unclear whether Pitts referred to the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, or Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish days, his observance of this Jewish tradition positively identified a Jewish population living and working in Perry County, Alabama in 1882. Pitts concluded his diary entry by listing the various goods he purchased including a brass handle and a monkey wrench. ","Jewish immigration into the South was divided into four phases from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century. Jewish immigration to Alabama began in the late nineteenth century during the third wave of Jewish settlement in the South. Abraham Mordecai was the first European Jew to travel further west of the early centers of Jewish life in Savannah and Charleston. While the exact date of his arrival is unknown, he settled in what would become Montgomery, Alabama in 1880, pushing the Jewish population further into the South. ","As Jewish immigrants continued to settle in the South, they progressively gained economic influence in society. According to social historian Ralph Melnick, the collapse of the rural plantation system transferred economic and political power to southern cities and townships. With this economic shift, the Jewish population began to earn clout working as professionals, businessmen, mill operators, commodity brokers, and farm owners. In these roles Jewish workers increased their economic status in times of relative instability throughout the South. Reconstruction and the depression of the 1890s further increased Jewish wealth as they continually offered incentives over gentile competition. Jewish business transactions were strictly cash-only, eliminating the vicious cycle of debt for the consumer and decreasing the merchants' risk of financial loss. The economic prosperity enjoyed by these southern working Jews unfortunately led to an increase of anti-Semitism and resentment across the South. ","Between 1848 and 1980 Alabama lost half its Jewish population to bigotry and hate crimes. In 1868, the Ku Klux Klan was founded in Memphis, Tennessee and formally began its reign of terror throughout the South. In 1871, the KKK publicly murdered a Jewish shopkeeper in Memphis and established the Jewish population as a target of the organization. Though many Jews fled both Alabama and the South others remained. Despite anti-Semitic sentiments in the South, many Jewish families lingered in the region of their American roots.

Crockett stole twenty dollars from Wolfenden Brothers and was sentenced to two months in jail by Judge Obenchain. Interjecting their own opinion, the Wytheville Dispatch hoped that his would be a lesson to local merchants to keep ?these little rascals? out of the town?s stores. ","By the end of the Civil War, most blacks expected a swift transition from enslavement to freedom. This did not happen. Reconstruction was arguably the most violent time between races in the South. Whites had for centuries treated blacks as property, and they were forced to free their slaves under the watchful eye of northern officers. ","Two major problems arose during Reconstruction that led to episodes like that of Will Crockett. By 1867, two years after the end of the war, the government in Washington granted suffrage to all freedmen. Three years later the fifteenth amendment passed, declaring that no state could deprive a citizen, regardless of race, of the vote. Gaining a political voice was the ultimate sign of freedom, and one that white southerners were strongly against. White southerners took the law into their own hands, using groups like the Ku Klux Klan to scare blacks away from the polls. By 1877, the Jim Crow laws had been implemented throughout the South ensuring the separation of races. Cleary the Dispatch is in strong favor of Jim Crow.","Alarmingly, Will Crockett was the ninth black boy to be caught stealing in a month in Wytheville. The second problem to arise during Reconstruction was the lack of educational opportunities for African American youths. The Freedmen?s Bureau attempted and was somewhat successful in setting up some schools in the South, but they clearly could not reach the entire South. Often, angry whites along with Ku Klux members would destroy black schools or intimidate the Yankee teachers into leaving. In more rural parts of the South, including Appalachia, many black children were forced to work in order to help the family. They could not attend school. A lack of education among black and white children may have contributed to a higher crime rate. Jim Crow made parts of the South uninhabitable to some blacks and forced others, such as Will Crockett, to test its limits.

By the 1800's, the South and the North separated in their respective approaches to the death penalty. The Southerners retained their capital punishment laws. The Northerners, however, reformed many of theirs, making the death penalty applicable in fewer circumstances. ","Despite the ultra-conservative culture in the South, as the 19th Century progressed, Southerners began to modify their own capital punishment laws. Southern states ceased the execution of whites for crimes other than murder. Effectually, the capital punishment laws in the Southern states approached the degree of severity of those in the North. Even in today's world, many states, including Virginia and Texas, continue to use the death penalty for murderers and extreme criminal cases.","The nineteenth century, additionally, brought a change in the public nature of execution. In the two centuries preceding 1800, hangings were religious, public events with thousands of people in attendance. With the growing popularity and belief in Christianity throughout the South, people flocked to the events. Throughout the 1800's, alternatively, the execution became increasingly secular and private. The <em>Southern Banner </em>article announced Joel Clough's execution, so citizens certainly attended the public event.

On Sunday August 6, Clark claimed she went over to Thomas's home to retrieve an axe, which had been loaned to him. When she reached his house and explained why she had come, Thomas allegedly grabbed Clark and drew her to him. Clark, however, was able to escape and ran home to tell her mother. Thomas was arrested the following day. As night approached on Tuesday, the crowd outside the jail grew larger. Several hundred had gathered by 10 o'clock. The mob began to demand that Thomas be handed over. The mayor pleaded with the crowd to let Thomas undergo trial yelling If the man is not convicted I will lead you in person to hang him. The crowd was insatiable, however, and replied Give us the nigger He won't be here tomorrow The crowd rushed the jail and upon finding Johnson dragged him outside. Johnson tried to escape, but the crowd shot him, dragged him to the corner of King and Fairfax Street, stripped him of his clothes, and hanged him. The mob proceeded to fire shots into his body. After confirming that he was dead, the throng of people dispersed. The response to the lynching was mixed, and many speculated about why it occurred. Some argued that a protest Monday night by many African Americans, arguing that Thomas should not be lynched, may have contributed to the events that following Tuesday. What is clear, however, is that the actions of Tuesday, August 8, 1899 were not unusual."," The lynching of African Americans had become commonplace in the late nineteenth century. Before the Civil war white men were generally the victims of lynching. In the postbellum period, however, lynching and race were strongly related. In the South and border states 85 percent of victims were black. There are several possible explanations. William Brundage argues that southern institutions failed to provide adequate controls to stifle mob violence. Weak educational, religious, and civic institutions, poverty and ineffective law enforcement agencies failed to instill sufficient respect for the rule of law or human dignity. Furthermore, lynching provided a socially accepted channel for aggression in the South."," Although it was an accepted practice, lynching did face opposition from its beginnings. By the time Thomas was lynched in 1893, a number of whites had emerged who were concerned about its implications for the state. Despite these concerns, blacks had very few avenues to address violence towards them. The opposition that was led by blacks tended to be uncoordinated and lacked any concrete program for reform. For rural blacks the only available recourse was usually spontaneous and disorganized protests. More militant methods risked severe sanctions. Lynching continued well into the 20th century: African American Michael Donald was lynched in Mobile Alabama in 1981.

However, in September 1824, two little boys from a well-known family in the area, the Joshua Haskell's family, were accosted by a runaway slave on their way to school. He first spoke to them then grabbed their dinner-basket. Fortunately, he let them leave and the two little boys managed to arrive at school safe and sound. Even if the Jackson Gazette wrote it was a harmless robbery, this piece of news was considered significant enough to be the first one on the page who deals with Jackson news.","Nevertheless, such events were common in the South and especially in Tennessee where there was a large number of Slaves. Indeed, West Tennessee had the greatest concentration of slaves in the state, and Middle Tennessee, especially thanks to tobacco and grain cultivation, held the largest number of slaves throughout the antebellum period. Therefore, Jackson was at the core of the slave South. In consequence, Jackson could not avoid a recurrent phenomenon in the antebellum South: lots of slaves, because of their unbearable living conditions tried to run away from their owner's plantation and dreamt about freedom. However, after their evasion, they soon realized that their standard of living would be difficult to improve. Without job, without money, and sometimes with a family to feed, they sometimes became thieves and attacked people, simply in order to survive. Moreover, the time was one of outlawry and both travel and walks on the road were extremely dangerous activities. This is partly why many historians describe the antebellum South as a very violent place and also why southerners in the nineteenth century considered African American as dangerous people and believed cohabitation with them would be impossible (and unthinkable) without slavery because if they were free, they rebel against white people. This episode which mattered little in comparison with more significant events is therefore a proof of the difficult and dangerous condition of African American in the antebellum South, were they slaves working on a plantation, runaway slaves, or even free blacks.

This was the status of the Augusta jail one day after the attempted raid upon its confines by an angry mob of white men. The mob of 500 armed men had been intent on having their justice with William Robinson, an African American man accused of robbing and attempting to assault a white woman, Mrs. Minnie Walker. Hot with anger, the party of men assembled and then proceeded to storm the local jail last night at about one in the morning. The twenty policemen assigned to guard the jail refused the request for Robinson and defended the jail to the best of their ability. While they were successful in barring entry of the mob and the capture of Robinson, two of the police's corps fell in battle with the mob. As a precaution for possible repeat raids, the jail requested additional backup forces for the next few days and nights as courts tried Robinson. Ironically, several of the soldiers posted to guard the prison were apart of the lynching mob the previous night. In an effort to protect Robinson until proven guilty, the court system agreed to speed up the trial's start date. The grand jury assured the city populace that they would indict Robinson; however, the specific fate of the man was not as concrete. Normally, the courts reserved the death penalty for those who actually committed the act, but there was the slim possibility that that they might sentence Robinson to the death penalty based solely on intent. ","The fate of William Robinson is unknown. Did he receive a fair trial? Was he sentenced to death? Were the efforts of an impassioned lynch mob more successful a few days later when the soldiers returned to their normal stations? The Atlanta Constitution failed to provide a follow-up story in the weeks to come. However, one can hazard a guess as to the likely gruesome outcome of Robinson. If mobs did not seize him while he was in jail awaiting trial, there were plenty of opportunities to arrest the man and enact vigilante justice later on. In Georgia, lynching reached horrific heights from 1891-1899. Though Governor Candler agreed to send troops to protect Robinson and the guards of the jail in 1898, he cannot boast a consistent record, for just a year later, he failed to prevent the torrent of brutal lynchings which spread throughout Georgia. ","In the South, lynching was one of the terrorist tactics used to control and threaten African-Americans. In the Reconstruction Era South, lynching of African Americans was used, especially by the Ku Klux Klan, as a tool for reversing the social changes and enfranchisement of African Americans under Federal occupation. This type of racially-motivated lynching continued in the Jim Crow Era as a means of enforcing subservience and preventing economic competition. Although lynchings did occur prior to 1880, radical racism and mob violence peaked during the 1890's in a surge of terrorism that did not dissipate until well into the twentieth-century. Racism and popular mythology of the time created the image of the hyper-sexualized African American male who would rape pure and noble white women like Minnie Walker; however, historians find that in 80% of the cases, there were no sexual charges alleged, let alone proven. Lynch mobs assembled for petty offenses too. Stealing a cow, arguing with a white man, or attempting to register to vote were reason enough for many African Americans to hang in the eyes of the white South. The absolute inhumanity of lynch mobs was not condoned by every single individual in the South, but its pervasiveness throughout the region is telling of the fierce supremacist mentality which reached its height in Georgia in the 1890's.","<em>~ Colleen Elizabeth Laurence</em>"],"display_date":"November 3, 1898","search_date":"1898-11-03","locations":[{"id":2194,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3241,"title":"How the Wrong Man Got Liquor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-05-22","end_date":"1889-05-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One does not usually conceive of alcohol as the traditional gift of mysterious benefactors, yet that is exactly what Jake Culberth received in his depot package one day. An agent roused Culberth from his work to pick up a package which he eventually discovered was full of alcohol Believing it to be the gift of some kind person, Culberth and his friends immediately set forth consuming the package's contents and were in a bawdy state when they finally discovered that their secret supplier was none other than Culbreth's boss. Of course, Culbreth's boss did not intend for the alcohol to reach Culbreth and his comrades. Rather, the boss had a dependency on whisky which he could only assuage by sneaking alcohol into the dry county through the mail. Alas, Culbreth's boss had to endure a few days without his precious whiskey, but he certainly learned his lesson. Upon discovering Culbreth and his friends, The boss took one long sad look at them, and then remarked, 'Well, the next time I want any whisky you may bet your last dollar I will order it in my own name.'  ","As both Jake Culbreth and his boss discovered, there were ways around the local temperance restrictions. Whether through mail, secretive moonshine operations, or go-betweens, individuals founds avenues to satisfy their habit when the drums of temperance began to beat. Though many Americans subscribed to the temperance movement and its ideals, there were plenty of others like Culbreth's boss who simply could not resist. The degree to which they kept this habit secret varied. For example, Culbreth's boss was admittedly ashamed of his indulgence and did not want his neighbors to know, hence, the secret packages. However, there were many other individuals who didn't care at all and flagrantly disobeyed local dictates and societal pressure. An organized temperance movement began in Georgia in the late 1820's and, after early difficulties, flourished through the 1930's. ","Georgia's temperance movement began much as it did in other parts of the United States. Recruiting many in its ranks from the evangelical Protestant population, the temperance movement condemned alcoholic beverages as harmful or even sinful for the individual and society as a whole. In their minds, drinking destroyed families and reputations and fostered poverty, disorder, and crime. Perhaps the mistake between Jake Culbreth and his boss was dismissed by both parties; however, this cannot be said to be the case for all African Americans during the temperance movement. ","After the Civil War, the temperance movement had an odd relationship with racism. White Georgians resisted any mixing of the races in temperance organizations but were eager to make it illegal for emancipated African Americans to drink. The desire to further disenfranchise African Americans as well as the fear of possible criminal activity from them drove white Georgians' desire to impose restrictions. Originally, Georgia's temperance reformers stressed voluntary participation in prohibition, but they later expanded their campaign platform to change the laws to restrict and abolish the sale of alcoholic beverages. This mandatory statewide prohibition in Georgia lasted from 1908 until 1935, a period which substantially extended beyond the national prohibition (1920-1933) in both its starting date and end.

Christmas was to be celebrated in a joyful, yet quiet manner, not with the use of small explosives, which are noisy and might interfere with private celebrations. On the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth of December, a serenade of horns and pop-crackers outside their doors interrupted the holiday jubilations of those City Council members who voted in favor of the ordinance. The boys of the city celebrated Christmas as usual with the sharp bang of the small pop-crackers and the deeper boom of a cannon-cracker, but the spirit of the noise had changed from religious merriment to civic disobedience.","  The council members accepted the protests in good spirits at first and all in the city enjoyed the Christmas festivities. The police were wholly unable to determine the source of the exploded firecrackers, though they tried faithfully. The boys' actions, though regrettable, seemed simply to be an example of youthful disobedience until the following week when the investigations of police misconduct began. Staunton's city council formed a special committee to investigate the negligence and efficiency of the police force in fulfilling its sworn duty. The actions of the boys, though likely simply a desire for youthful activity, demonstrated a disrespect for the law which the community could not tolerate. ","  The noise and dazzle of fireworks has been a traditional way for Southerners to celebrate Christmas since the French in Louisiana first fired their rifles and set off firecrackers in honor of the holiday. The boys of Staunton reminded all of their rights as Southerners with this bold display, seeking to assert that tradition dominated over the law. Though not an egregious example of law breaking, the City Council chose to elevate the incident with its investigation of the conduct of the police force. In the periods of Reconstruction following the Civil War, it was necessary for city officials to assert the authority of the law. Many of the rules governing past Southern behavior had changed, especially regarding slavery; consequently, tradition was no longer an adequate justification for disobedience.

Thousands of individuals gathered to participate in the brutal death of Blackman. Apparently, the Georgia Press vehemently condemned the actions of the lynch mob prompting the Chattanooga author to pen that such morbid anxiety to see a fellow creature strangled ought not to be allowed to again manifest itself in Georgia. The legislature should pass a law making executions private; and if they were to adopt the plan of executing all capital criminal within the walls of the penitentiary, between the hours of 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., that would be a still further improvement.

And yet the absolute inhumanity of lynch mobs was not condoned by everyone in the South. As the uproar by the Georgia press and the vehement opposition by the Chattanooga Times author demonstrates, opposition to lynching was a salient force. Despite the dangers of vocalizing an anti-lynching message, the movement grew from 1890 onward. Among the opposition, African American women were among the first to speak out. After all, it was often their husbands, brothers, sons, and friends who were wrongfully accused and lynched. Over time this assembly of African American women began to call upon their white counterparts to control the violence and lawlessness of white men. Unfortunately, their pleas and demands for intervention did not achieve fruition for several decades to come.","In the South, lynching was one of the terrorist tactics used to control and threaten African-Americans.

Fifteen hundred people attended the evening church service to hear the sermon given by Love. Love noted that the outrageous acts of lynching would not stop any time soon. Love professed that the best way to decrease occurrences of rape was to depend on the laws set forth in this country. He promoted the idea that all blacks should follow the law in order to dispel any preconceived notions that whites had concerning black people.

","The threat of being hung from a noose scared many southern African Americans after the Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. Black southerners were hanged for any reason that whites determined to be a necessary cause such as the supposed killing of a white person or the raping of a white woman. Yet the hanging of a black person was not the only form of mob violence African Americans experienced. In 1899 in Palmetto, Georgia two thousand white men, women and children gathered to watch the lynching of Sam Hose who allegedly raped a white woman. The innocent black man was burned alive and his body parts were divided and sold as souvenirs. This tragic episode and many others occurred frequently throughout the South.

The sermon given by Love denoted the importance of the issue of lynching throughout the South. The large amount of people that attended the sermon showed that many people had a great deal of interest in the subject.

Austin and Dewing got the knife away from Hutchins and the crowd took Hutchins, who had begun to lose large quantities of blood, away from the wagon and to a nearby tree. The crowd hung Hutchins from the tree, even though he was already dying from his self-inflicted wounds.","The most telling part of this episode is the opening line of the article: The lynching of D.C. Hutchins...was accompanied with more than the usual dramatic surroundings of such events. This article, which was published in a national newspaper, used the word usual to describe the death of an African American without trial. Lynchings became increasingly popular in the cotton uplands, and especially in rural places such as Bossier Parish. Counties or parishes with few towns, low rural population density, and poor law enforcement had high rates of lynching, especially as the African American population increased. The lynching of African Americans reached its highest point when new African Americans came to the uplands and were strangers to the community. Men like Hutchins had no one within the community to support them, allowing reputations as desperados to spring up. These reputations were also due to the white belief that African American crime was out of control and a serious threat. The paper describes Hutchins as a villain, while portraying the lynching mob as the decent citizens of Bossier parish. This description in a national paper cements the severe racism that grew in this era."],"display_date":"May 8, 1883 - May 13, 1883","search_date":"1883-05-10","locations":[{"id":5453,"lat":32.5800672889,"lng":-93.88223782,"zoom":9,"place":"CADDO, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3283,"title":"The Nineteenth-Century Web of Race and Divorce \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-01","end_date":"1857-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Having a petition granted for divorce was hard to come by in the nineteenth-century. However, each year many divorce petitions were filed in the South. In 1857, Mrs. Charlotte Smith of Lowndes County, Mississippi stated that she caught her husband committing adultery with a negro girl named Nancy in April of that year. Mrs. Smith, devastated by her husband's crime, filed for divorce, alimony, and the custody of their daughter. "," It is difficult to tell how much of Mrs. Smith's initiative to file the petition was due to the concept of interracial adultery or just due to the simple unfaithfulness of her husband. No doubt race played some sort of role, since southern plantation society was built on a social hierarchy of fuel by racial relations. However, it seems that indicating the race of the third party would not have much affected Mrs. Smith's case. The accusation was more about the act itself rather than the individuals involved. "," According to Rothman, women's chances for successfully procuring divorces were not greatly enhanced by an emphasis on the interracial sexual activities of their spouses.

The guards allowed the inmates razors and stood outside the cells as the prisoners shaved. According to the article, Hawkins turned to the guard, said, Good-bye, and promptly slit his throat. Being near at hand, we ran to see him. He presented a shocking aspect. The blood was spouting rapidly from the horrid gash in his neck, and the bed on which he lay near his head and neck was all saturated with the purple current. A doctor soon arrived and determined that Hawkins had missed the primary artery and would survive.","The same edition of this paper describes Hawkins' escape from his jail in Harrisonburg, Virginia. For much of the time before his recapture, Hawkins was five miles from the jail. He then went to his family in Dayton, where he hid beneath the bed and passed his time knitting socks, which his wife subsequently sold to neighbors. After some time he gathered his family, stole what was believed to be three or four horses, and set out for the west. Authorities recaptured him on the road and sent him back to jail, where he subsequently attempted suicide. ","Hawkins' public escape and recapture brought the prison system into the public eye. One cannot be sure if it was the condition of the prison that provoked him to attempt suicide, or whether he was just a desperate. However, life was difficult for a convict in a penitentiary in Virginia. Labor occupied most of a prisoner's time. Much more so than today, states used penitentiaries to make a profit. In fact, some men bought or leased prisons and then worked their prisoners to death (The lessees worked them quite literally to death in many cases; the mortality rate ranged from 17-40 percent). Leasing became popular in the South, after the war especially, when states could not afford to keep up the prisons. ","As Edward Ayers states in <em>Vengeance and Justice: Crime and Punishment in the 19th-Century American South</em>, the system of slavery in the ante-bellum South kept much of the lower class under control. Because of southern ideals of honor, it seems that there would be less of a need of a prison system; nonetheless, the South built as many prisons as the North (with the exception of Florida and the Carolinas). The South spent much of the time preceding the war to debate whether or not the penitentiary was in fact in line with the American ideals of liberty. Ironically, unlike the North, their lowest class was already imprisoned within society.",">In 1796, Virginia and Pennsylvania, where the penitentiary started, were the only states that attempted to reduce deaths by capital punishment. At that time, the only offense that warranted it was murder. Punishment varied in every region in the country: the penitentiary system in the West was very different. On November 14th, 1856, James R. Whitehead wrote a letter from the Kansas Territory to his cousin Langhan Scruggs, who lived in the Valley of Virginia. In an earlier letter (September 11th), he had described to great detail the sort of men that were settled in the West; northern and southern relations were mirrored in Kansas. The young men were belligerent and chivalrous, always ready to fight. In Whitehead's mind, the West needed new kinds of settlers. In the letter on November 14th, Whitehead wrote about crime and punishment in the territory. More than three hundred Bills of Indictment had been filed, twenty of which were manslaughter. The punishment was far from death; the men found guilty served five years of confinement and hard labor."],"display_date":"February 29, 1848","search_date":"1848-02-29","locations":[{"id":14232,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3289,"title":"WANTED \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-07-31","end_date":"1875-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A wanted ad for a man named Jeff Williams appeared in The Daily Mississippi Pilot?s reward section. Williams was a convict who escaped while under lease to a family and working on the Noxubee river levee. The Governor of Mississippi offered 50 dollars for someone to arrest and take Williams to the state penitentiary. The description of the man at large was listed. Along with including his height and age, the paper made a special note that Williams was a mulatto with black hair and was pitted by smallpox. "," Most wanted ads during this time were for missing black convicts. The idea of leasing out convicts came about in the South in the years following the Civil War. Leasing convicts meant that black convicts would have to work the land of a public area or be bound to a white plantation owner who, in exchange for the labor, would pay for the convict?s fines. This idea of leasing convicts became more widespread after the war and gave ex-slave owners a new form of cheap labor to make up for the labor force they lost after the emancipation. Convict leasing also provided the states with a readily available supply of laborers to help build up the railways along with other domestic necessities. "," The high number of black convicts was largely the result of the unfair court systems in the South. Most officers, judges, and even the jurors were predominately white and showed little mercy to black offenders. Yet, most blacks tried to turn to other options to avoid dealing with the court systems of the South. The Freedman?s Bureau was a popular alternative to the unjust systems because in normal trials, blacks did not receive a fair trial. The Freedman?s Bureau was called upon by black defendants to attempt to give them a hearing to try to settle their various disputes with other blacks and, in some cases, disputes with whites. "," In addition to unfair trials, southern laws concerning blacks were also extremely harsh, making it easier to get blacks in prisons to be leased out. Arson became a capital offense, stealing from someone?s home caused the offender to go to prison for life, and the theft of livestock became grand larceny. This increase in severity in the punishments in the south gave railroad, lumber, and mining companies a great opportunity to have access to this type of free labor. The large proportion of the convicts were blacks who had been charged for relatively trivial crimes.

M. Todd came to his new district, he heard threats that the white men in the area had a way of getting rid of men who came from the North to preach to the colored people. Todd may or may not have taken the threat seriously. Regardless, he worked with his superior Reverend I. G. Pollard to organize services that were open to mixed congregations. It was after such a service on March 26, 1879 that Todd and Pollard found themselves being held at gunpoint by the marshal and another man. The marshal had begun to direct the two into a back billiard room when Todd, overcome with panic, broke away and ran. The marshal reportedly shot him at least three times, before turning his attention to Pollard. The marshal stripped and searched Pollard in the back room, though he claimed that his main objective was Todd. Once Todd turned himself in later that night and had undergone a similar search, the marshal released the two preachers. Pollard took Todd to a doctor who saw to his wounds, however, the paper in which this story appeared never specified how serious these injuries were. The paper did relate that after that night Pollard took Todd into the country, probably to be kept out of harm's way. Todd, however, decided to send his brother to Little Rock, and weeks later he accompanied him to Brinkley. Todd and his brother were waiting in Brinkley for the train to Little Rock, when they saw multiple masked faces waiting outside of their hotel. Todd was able to escape on foot to a train station nine miles from Brinkley but he died from his wounds upon reaching Little Rock on April 23.","This episode reveals the increased racist sentiment in the South after Reconstruction. Racism became more and more evident as segregation began to spread into many different areas of everyday life. Churches had been biracial before the Civil War but some had become segregated before the Civil War, and racist sentiments obviously flared at Todd's attempt to intermingle the two races, even though they already shared a common faith. These strong and violent racial beliefs would result in even more attacks and cases of lynching as segregation continued to escalate. Todd's death showed this problem on a national level when the story was published in a New York newspaper, and yet the situation remained unchanged until the Civil Rights Movement. ","Todd's work with African Americans in the church draws attention to the increased involvement of African Americans in the church in the postbellum period, as well as the growth of the Methodist Church. Many African Americans turned to the church because they were able to fulfill leadership positions that were unavailable to them outside of it. The church became a way for African Americans to celebrate their new freedom that was being curtailed in many other areas of their lives. Southerners turned to the Methodist Church in general because it broke away from the mainstream denominations with which Southerners became increasingly disillusioned."],"display_date":"March 26, 1879 - April 23, 1879","search_date":"1879-04-09","locations":[{"id":750,"lat":34.8116378829,"lng":-92.2224128621,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3301,"title":"A Strike at the Docks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-01-15","end_date":"1887-01-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Company lay powerless, while over 300 mostly black dockworkers armed themselves with any object they could find. Once organized, they forced their way through the barricaded doors of Pier 2. Now inside the docks, they struck out at the scabs, filling their jobs, and ravaged the offices, where they stole a barrel of whiskey. The effects of their new capture only further soured their demeanor, and resulted in them acting like demons. The dockhands' violence emerged as the culmination of a strike, led by a man named Kelly, a member of the Knights of Labor. Effectively organized, the workers had gone on strike for higher wages, but had received no promise from the Company's agent, Col. Bremond, who claimed to lack the proper wage authority. This disappointment prompted the reckless decision to break into the pier, and subsequently, a Warwick County judge's call for five companies of armed troops. The military unit, of both white and black companies, quickly restored order and forced the rioters to disassemble. Accepting failure, many of the dockhands hoped to eventually to return to work for the railroad company. "," The Knights of Labor emerged in the early 1880's in response to the Industrial Revolution, opposing the increasing trend of concentrated corporate power and monopoly in American business. Though more popular in the North (Kelly hailed from New York), union leaders did travel throughout the South, organizing whites and blacks, and men and women. By 1886, the Knights could claim over 50,000 members, spread out over 10 Southern states. This particular strike resembled typical labor disputes led by the Knights, in that they usually demanded a combination of better wages, better working conditions, or shorter workdays. In fact, the Newport News strike existed as one of twenty-two different strikes by the Southern Knights during that decade, but like Newport News, few affected any measure of change."," Very unique to the Knights of Labor, blacks and whites were treated as equals, despite most leadership still remaining white. Yet, compared to other Gilded Age organizations, such as the Farmer's Alliance, the Knights appeared remarkably interracial. Blacks of the Farmer's Alliance would actually comment on the differences when the two unions formed a tenuous alliance in 1889. An Era of Good Feelings existed for the black and white workingmen in the organization, as interracial solidarity and democratic idealism were fearlessly proclaimed. Sadly, this feature contributed to the union's downfall, as newspapers, across the country, attacked the group for blurring the color line. Coupled with failed strikes and uncooperative economic conditions, by the turn of the century, the Knights had faded out of sight. In their place, though, would emerge the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and its leader, Samuel Gompers. Hoping to organize resistance to affect the same types of changes, this union chose to exclude blacks, preferring that they form their own organization.

Smith of Alexandria, Louisiana, with the intention to kill her. On the same day as the attack, the slave, whose name was not given, was convicted and sentenced to be hanged. By the next day he was dead. ","The relationship between slave and owner teetered on a precarious balance. On one hand slaveholders reveled in their slaves' dependence and love for them. According to Raymond and Alice Bauer, masters saw their slaves' smiling, bowing, and scraping as evidence of their happiness, docility, and acceptance as part of an inferior race. On the other hand, slaves frustrated their masters with feigned illness and pregnancy, broken tools, and running away for short stints to avoid work. This laziness was punished through whippings and other humiliating practices. Slaves resisted day to day in these subtle ways, confusing and provoking their masters. ","Physical slave violence and insurrection were much rarer than these more passive forms of resistance. Attacks like the one against Mrs. Smith did not occur frequently. Melvin Ely writes that the wake of Nat Turner's rebellion in Virginia in 1831 revealed not a militarized culture of bold, well-armed, dead-eye marksmen born on horseback, but rather a land of frightened, often befuddled white men milling around in ragtag militia musters. They were unprepared for a slave revolt, and were often without the proper supplies to put down an attack should it happen. They feared and prepared for it the way a group of people fear and prepare for a natural disaster, like a volcano which has lain dormant for a hundred years. They had a plan but it was not an immediate concern, just uneasiness lurking in the back of their minds.","Attacks like the one that occurred on that hot July day showed up in newspapers occasionally. At moments like that, deep seeded fears bubbled briefly to the surface and made slaveowners, but also whites everywhere, question just how obedient and satisfied slaves were with their place in American society. While slave attacks brought to light the dangers involved in the peculiar institution, these attacks did not make most whites question whether slavery was morally right or not.

On that day, the coroner of Arkansas County held a formal inquest into the death of William Mabbet who had been found near Hickory Point. Curiously, Mabbet's body appeared heavily bruised and beaten, but showed no signs of resistance. If he had been attacked, should there not be some evidence of a struggle?","Violent deaths, like William Mabbet's, were not particularly unusual on the frontier. States and territories throughout the South passed statutes in an attempt to limit the number of concealed weapons a man might carry, but they were careful to specify that these weapons could and should be used in self defense. An important distinction lies in the fact that while such laws were passed, violent brawls and murders still occurred, enough to give the state of Arkansas a reputation as a dangerous place. ","This was due in part to the fact that the territorial government focused most of their attention on organizing new counties and petitioning Congress. The territorial government passed very little legislation concerning anything other than these matters within the first year of its creation and federal troops were often heavily engaged in maintaining borders with the Cherokee, Choctaws, Osages, Quapaws, and other Native American groups within and just outside the new territory. Local courts dealt with justice and, at times, formal proceedings were withheld entirely. As late as 1843, German traveler Friedrich Gerstacker witnessed a shocking account of a horse thief tied to a tree and beaten without a trial. ","The inquest into William Mabbet's death probably took the form of similar proceedings observed by Gerstacker. The court was typically held in a nearby postmaster's home, the jury was made up of neighboring landowners, and a lawyer journeyed to the local town from Little Rock to act as judge. At the end of the hearing, the jury would go outside to a porch or stable to deliberate. But luckily for the people of Arkansas County, the outcome of this particular inquest revealed that their lives were not in danger from some particularly violent drifter or vengeful Indian tribe; just a horse that had trampled his owner while the latter slept in the grass near Hickory Point."],"display_date":"January 22, 1820","search_date":"1820-01-22","locations":[{"id":449,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ARKANSAS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3339,"title":"Mob Carries out Death Sentence\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-03-19","end_date":"1892-03-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the small village of Haymarket, about 38 miles north of Alexandria, two white men, Lee Heflin and Joseph Dye, were lynched on March 19, 1892. The two men had been recently convicted of murder and sentenced to death. At 12 A.M. on March 19, a mob gathered outside the jail and demanded that the prisoners be handed over. The prisoners were taken away before the mob could reach them. The pair was not safe for long, however, and was soon overtaken by the mob. The frightened Dye confessed to the murder of which he had been accused. He and Hefflin were hanged on the edge of a piece of woods, 100 yards from the road. The crowd then fired a volley of bullets into their bodies. ","Some felt that the lynching of Dye and Heflin was a cruel and wretched act. After the court found the two guilty, they had already been sentenced to death. Enough, however, worried that the two might escape capital punishment and so formed the mob that decided to take matters into their own hands. Others felt that Heflin and Dye's inevitable deaths should have been left to the legal system. The Washington Post remarked, mob law...is a dangerous thing to encourage. There is too much of it already throughout the country, and it spreads like a contagion so long as public sentiment tacitly approves it. ","The lynching of whites like Lee Heflin and Joseph Dye was much less common than the lynching of blacks. Whites were normally lynched only if they committed sensational violent crimes. In fact, nearly two-thirds of all whites lynched in Virginia were accused of murder. Blacks, however, were lynched for more minor offenses. In 1852, Frederick Douglass said, There are seventy-two crimes in the State of Virginia which, if committed by a black man (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. In part, because of the practice of lynching, the disparity to which Douglass points had not changed significantly even in more than forty years, despite the Civil War. Even while they were being lynched, whites received more respect than blacks. For example, lynch mobs seldom tortured or mutilated their white victims. Furthermore, although the corpses of Heflin and Dye were shot, Brundage explains that this was not the norm. Post-bellum Southerners saw violence as an unavoidable and necessary way of life. Even those who opposed mob violence believed that the criminals needed to be punished more quickly and harshly than the legal system permitted. In short, southerners had lost faith in their court system. After the turn of the century, lynching whites became even more unusual.

Wilkins was with a crowd of boys on a visit to his uncle, William Wallace, who lived just north of the Virginia-North Carolina state line. Ahead, they saw two carriages and several men. Another round of shots rang out, and the boys were excited even more. As they approached the area, the men hurried into their respective carriages and drove off. On the bank of the canal, lying next to the woods, the boys saw a man with a red handkerchief lying over his face. Wilkins and the boys hurried off to his uncle's to tell him of the dead man in the woods.","The man with the red handkerchief over his face was H.F. Harris; the man responsible for his death was E.C. Yellowly. They were both lawyers of the Greenville bar in Pitt County, North Carolina. During one particular court case, Harris had criticized Yellowly's legal proceedings; Yellowly had responded with harsh criticism of his own. After court, Harris and Yellowly had an altercation that was subdued by friends in the area. Harris challenged Yellowly to a duel, and the challenge was accepted. However, both were arrested and put under heavy bonds to prevent the violence for one year. On the very day the bond was out, Harris renewed the challenge, and it was again accepted. On October 1, 1847, the two rivals met on the Dismal Swamp Canal. Yellowly attempted reconciliation before the duel, but Harris refused. Even as Harris fired his first round, Yellowly shot his pistol in the air, again attempting to make peace. Yet, Harris remained firm and fired another shot that went wild. This time around, Yellowly's ball hit its mark, striking Harris in the forehead, just above his right eyebrow. Seeing Harris fall, Yellowly commanded his second, Go to him, for God's sake, for I don't want to kill him.","Dueling was a common ritual of antebellum Southern life. Southern gentlemen lived by a strong code of honor, and dueling was virtually accepted as a proper way to defend one's honor. In <em>Honor and Slavery</em>, Kenneth S. Greenberg observed how men feared that to refuse a duel was to become a social outcast. The stakes were that high. Accordingly, many men achieved great political success after duels, and among the wealthy classes, most men got off scot-free from their crimes. E.C.

Looking at Virginia's entire 2 district (heavily African American), which included these Tidewater counties, Democrats appeared to have netted about 4,000 votes, greatly slimming the opposition's lead. Sensing the reaction of Mahone's Readjuster Party, which commanded the Virginian Republican vote, the Democrats planned appropriately. Contacting a renowned gunsmith in Portsmouth, they ordered fifty new Winchester rifles, to be strategically dispersed near important voting precincts. Along with the men unafraid to use these guns, this stern measure of intimidation hoped to discourage white Mahonite leaders from inciting the newly disenfranchised black voters to attack the polling places. Celebrating such an important political gain, Southampton Democrats held a large rally at Newsome's farm attended by great numbers of local farmers. "," Virginia's Reconstruction Constitution in 1869 gave blacks and previously disenfranchised poor whites the right to vote, thus largely expanding the electorate in what had been the South's largest slave holding state. Virginia politics during Reconstruction differed from that of most other former-Confederate states, as no real Republican party emerged. Rather, the Readjuster party took up many Republican platforms, and quickly became the party of the African American vote. The Readjusters combined the black vote with that of the poor whites, and it appeared as if a coalition, capable of challenging the white ruling elite, had finally arisen. Sensing disaster, the Democrats began to couch their political appeals in the late 1880's in strictly racial terms, hoping to appeal to a sense of white solidarity. As they defended themselves from the Readjuster onslaught, Democrats also sought to disenfranchise blacks, thereby stifling a future biracial coalition. "," Unfortunately for the Democrats, the Fifteenth Amendment made it very difficult to restrict the right to vote for race-based reasons at face value. Thus, in this period of Redemption, election officials (most often Democrats themselves) would employ registration and election restrictions that they knew targeted blacks and, subsequently, some poor whites. Oftentimes, they would also commit outright voter fraud by stealing ballots, stuffing ballot boxes, or erasing names from the registration. Virginia also adopted the Australian ballot, aimed at confusing those who could not read, by not listing party names next to candidates, and giving voters less than two minutes in the voting booth. Nonetheless, black leaders, especially in the Tidewater area, continued to resist such coercive measures by flooding the polls with blacks, even if their votes were not being counted. "," Motivated, predominately, by the desire to more effectively hinder the black vote, Virginia, and other Southern states, underwent constitutional conventions in the 1890's. Resulting in residency requirements, grandfather clauses, and poll taxes, the South crippled the non-Democratic vote, evidenced by the drastic decline in voter turnout. Whereas 75 percent of eligible voters voted in 1890, this figure dived to 33 percent by 1900. Outright intimidation, though rare, also would emerge in the form of the Klu Klux Klan and the Red Shirts, vigilante groups who ensured few blacks would slip through the cracks. In Virginia's eastern counties, resistance to such Democratic injustice could also spell doom at the hands of newly purchased Winchester rifles.

On Thursday last, another person was taken up on suspicion of being engaged in passing counterfeit Bank Notes. There was little concept of money until the early years of the nineteenth century and as the idea of banking slowly unfolded, many issues that had not been fully thought through caused substantial problems. Counterfeiting was one of them. ","The local exchange farmers were issued from their banks was not a national currency which made it very difficult to use when traveling from county to county. In theory, this system was designed so that these notes could be redeemed in gold or silver but people rarely followed through with this method of accounting, making money especially difficult to track and be accounted for. Banks were also put in difficult situations when more notes were being circulated than actual treasure in the bank, threatening these establishments with bankruptcy if everyone tried to cash out at the same time. Trading notes for gold and silver turned into a large problem and banks were forced to figure out ways to avoid giving money back to people who really did not deserve it. In 1819 the price of cotton and other agricultural products fell which worried the people who had traded their gold or silver in for bank notes and believed that the paper money they received would no longer hold any worth at the bank which caused a desperate dash to liquidate their accounts. Opportunities like these were taken advantage of and when thieves got the chance they simply created their own notes so they could walk into a bank and redeem what did not belong to them.","As more banks opened up and more money was invested in them, counterfeiting bills became a problem that needed significant attention. It was suggested by the author of a newspaper article that it is not improbable, that more of this gang infest our country- citizens ought therefore, to be watchful of this kind of fraud. Eventually in Clarksville, the notes of fourteen different independent banks were not taken in the area due to the amount of fraud that had taken place. As the public found out through similar newspaper articles that thieves were stealing money with fake notes, people who had traded in for legitimate money became very worried and skeptical of the system, forcing banks to consider new methods of creating a sound currency.","Counterfeiting remained a serious issue until a national currency was created. It was difficult for the state to keep account of all the notes that were created and all of the money that was stored in banks which made counterfeiting a very easy practice. Savings that people believed they still had often times disappeared and left these poor individuals with nothing.

In it, a gentleman from Natchitoches, Louisiana reported that the Chief of the Caddo Indian Confederacy was plotting a conspiracy with the Spanish officials in Texas. Despite having traveled into the province on mercantile business, the Chief returned spouting adoration for King Ferdinand VII and boasting of his new title: Generalisimo of all the Indian tribes resident beyond the celebrated Arrayo Honde, between [Natchitoches] and the Sabine. All travelers in this area were subject to arrest by this new minister of the Spanish monarch. The citizens of Natchitoches feared the consequences. Their town was located only a short six miles from Arrayo Honde. The author of the letter feared increased violence and Indian attacks against townspeople and adventurous Americans, as well as the encumbrance of Spanish authority in what he believed to be American lands.","Until 1819, the Spanish still laid claims to the lands of Louisiana just east of the Sabine River up to the Arrayo Honde, a tributary of the Red River, while Americans held that the Sabine maintained the border between Spanish Texas and American Louisiana. During Thomas Jefferson's presidency, the United States acquired the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon, who approved the sale to promote war against Britain. The territory of Louisiana had only just changed from Spanish to French hands through the treaty of San Ildefonso three years earlier. Neither the French nor the Americans attempted to define the borders of the territory until the treaty was signed in 1803, at which point, the French foreign minister replied, I can give you no direction. You have made a noble bargain for yourselves, and I suppose you will make the most of it. ","For the next two decades, the Spanish in Texas and the Americans migrating into Louisiana wrestled over land. The treaty did not define the western border of the Louisiana Territory, so the Spanish sought means to push their claim and authority further east, through individuals like the Caddo Chief, while American settlers pushed back with equal force. The Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819 solved these struggles. It gave up American claims to Texas and Spanish claims east of the Sabine. Despite opposition from westerners who steamed over the loss of Texas, support for the treaty was unanimous in Congress.","This episode demonstrated a significant disjunction between the federal government's concerns and the desires of the American people actually living on the frontier in Louisiana. The author stated somewhat sardonically, How far this affair may require the interpolation of government, government will best determine; but be assured we consider it a matter of considerable importance. The author's tone and comments dripped with disdain for a government that seemed unconnected with his needs. The sense that the people actually living in these borderlands might need to defend their own rights because their government was unable or unwilling to do so permeated throughout the letter. This suggests that the people living in the West were unimpressed with a government that could not keep up with their demands for more land or negotiate effectively to solidify ownership of territory which people living on the frontier believed should belong to them."],"display_date":"February 10, 1817","search_date":"1817-02-10","locations":[{"id":5585,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NATCHITOCHES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3388,"title":"Fatal Shooting in Jackson \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-09-07","end_date":"1895-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the morning of September 7, 1895 in the Saloon of Cain and Davis, an altercation occurred between two African American men, in which Mr. William Miller shot Mr. Dick Wilcox in the bowels. Miller had allegedly threatened Wilcox, just a day before, that if he refused to repay a debt of fifty cents he would be killed. On the morning of the shooting, Wilcox entered the saloon in which Miller was seated. When he received no compensation upon demand of the money, he fatally shot Miller. Wilcox immediately escaped to the Fork Deer bottom, where he was pursued by the Sheriff and his men.","In the South, this kind of violence was an ordinary occurrence as many people opted to take justice into their own hands rather than leave it to the authorities. Historian C. Vann Woodward says The South seems to have been one of the most violent communities of comparable size in all Christendom. This kind of violence in the post- Civil War American South was extremely prevalent, as homicides alone sometimes doubled and tripled the number of such deaths prior to the War. Old census reports exist, however prove unreliable because the reports usually fell far short of the number of actual homicides. ","Freedmen such as Miller appeared in newspapers often for violent offenses as did others, but usually situations involving them were labeled colored. This significance allowed the majority of the newspapers' intended readers, white society, to understand what African Americans were capable of. ","However distinct the reports of incidents such as the shooting between Miller and Wilcox became towards black men, violence of the South in general could not have been attributed to only African Americans because in several southern states white men were killed much more often in proportion to their own population. Southern newspapers of the day were often crowded with homicides between professionals such as lawyers, planters, railroad presidents, doctors, preachers, and editors. The cause for many of these homicides were usually trivial, but were influenced by the phenomena of how carrying a pistol became normal for many Southerners.

The next day two letters were received, one from M'Duffie and another from a friend, both claiming that M'Duffie was stable and that they were slowly making the return home.

A duel taking place between two prominent politicians was certain to have only strengthened the tradition.","Dueling was not done over disputes, but over one's honor. Greenberg argues that an attack on one's honor (usually, by claiming that he is a liar) is what leads to a duel, not the actual issue over which the original dispute was based. To not duel when challenged would mean that one does not care enough to refute an accusation of lying, and is considered very disgraceful. Honor was such an important institution in Southern society that to lose it would be a severe handicap in the professional, social, and political realms.

After the Civil War and Reconstruction, many individuals in the South, in effort to reclaim pride and status, were hesitant to yield to the law, and as an informal code of behavior emerged, it required white men to respond to challenges to their honor by acting outside of the law. Lynching during the turn of the century could be seen as a legacy reminiscent of the years of slavery in which slave states offered Southern plantation owners the widest powers over their slaves in which punishment was at their own discretion. But as the North flourished through economic development, the growth of cities required a dependable exercise of state authority. This created tension within the South, where a majority of white individuals would rather resist legal institutions which might have challenged their discretion.

The White Caps called Fowler a 'worthless shiftless negro,' and accused him of 'doing a great deal of talking in regard to the lynching of Dock King.' Fowler reportedly had planned to notify U.S. detectives to work the lynching case, hence his beating. ","The White Caps were a vigilante group who operated in Eastern Tennessee in the late nineteenth century. Masked in white, members of this secret organization attempted to drive away or reform obnoxious persons by lynch- law methods. Mob attacks were performed frequently by white people toward blacks as a means to demoralize them and restore the social order among blacks and whites from the Antebellum Period. ","Fowler's experience was not rare. Mob violence first became popular in the South during the Antebellum Period as a form of systematic terrorism against whites as opposed to blacks, who were valuable as chattel. However according to historian W. Fitzhugh Brundage, the end of the Civil War and Reconstruction fueled violence against blacks as whites refused to accept emancipated slaves' quest for economic and political power. Lynching became a favored practice of these mobs, as it mirrored the 'Tyburn gallows,' which were notorious in ancient London as the site of public executions by hanging. These executions became public spectacles and the executed bodies would remain hung as a symbol of justice and warning to those willing to disobey social norm. The number of lynchings in the South began to rise in the 1880s, climaxing in 1892 where mobs executed an estimated seventy one whites, as well as one hundred and fifty five blacks, the largest number of lynchings in history of both the South and the United States of America.

Taking care of day-to-day business without a husband and father in the rough settlement of San Felipe de Austin was not an easy feat. The pressures upon the family increased as time went by, and the news of him they received after his absence spanned one month was not heartening. Brown was taking part in an exploration of the upper colonies of Texas, and his party's horses were stolen in an Indian raid. However, the settlers vowed to pursue the marauders and not to return until their stolen property was recovered. Additionally disturbing was the fact that Indians had recently committed several such attacks in the upper colonies. ","The fact that even in the sparsely populated lands of Mexico's northern colonies Brown and other Anglo-Americans were involved in conflicts with Indians was indicative of the Indians' struggles within the United States. Interestingly, the Indians of the upper colonies were not all native to the area. In fact, as a result of persecution within the United States, many of the Indians with whom the Anglo-American settlers interacted were displaced members of the Cherokee tribe. After the American Revolution, a large number of Cherokee left their traditional homes in the southeastern part of the United States, and moved west to Louisiana, then owned by the far more welcoming Spanish. As time passed, more and more Cherokee who found their eastern homes encroached upon by white settlers joined their tribal brethren to the west. Following the U.S. purchase of Louisiana, many Cherokee again moved, now seeking to live under the friendlier Spanish government in Texas. As time passed, Anglo-American settlers as well as the Spanish government again threatened the Cherokee Indians. Cherokee leaders actually applied for a formal land grant in order to legally secure their lands from other settlers, but they correctly interpreted repeated delays in their application's approval as a portent of eventual rejection. By 1826, the Cherokee were desperate enough to take part in an armed insurrection against the Mexican government, along with some Anglo-American settlers and other indigenous groups. The revolt was crushed by Mexican troops with the aid of volunteers from the more established American colonies. ","The plight of the Cherokee in Texas was merely a later chapter in their great struggle resulting from the colonization of their native lands.

They claimed to have heard of his propensity at the violin and requested to hire him to accompany their traveling circus performances. The pay was quite reasonable and Northup eagerly took on the job. He accompanied them the entire way down to Washington, D.C. without realizing that this was a cruel trick. Those circus performers were, in fact, slave traders looking to make a quick profit off of selling free men. "," Northup did not realize the true motives of his companions until he awoke one morning bound in chains in a damp and dark cell-like room. He never saw the traders again, but the nightmare to which they introduced him continued. From Washington, Northup was put on a ship with other enslaved people and relocated to New Orleans."," After arriving in New Orleans, Northup's outraged cries of his free status went largely ignored or resulted in angry lashings. He was placed in a slave pen along with many others. First thing next morning everyone received a bath, if necessary, a shave, and a set of cheap but clean new clothes. Northup experienced firsthand the degradation that occurred inside those slave pens; when the customers arrived, the traders paraded the slaves around and allowed them to be patted down, walked about, questioned and otherwise examined. Some of these prospective buyers demanded that the slaves open their mouths and display their teeth, precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. The dehumanization continued with mandatory exercise activities taking place. At one point Northup was even called on to provide violin music to the slaves' tortured dancing."," These New Orleans slave pens mocked any notion of innate or universal humanism. The slave traders and future owners translated their own discomfort with the practice of trading people into viewing the so-called 'items' for sale with repulsion. In their eyes, blacks existed purely for the purpose of making them, the whites, a profit. Because of this rationale, traders generally had no desire to attempt to keep many family ties together.

Literally. A man named Owings had fought a Mr. Anderson over an issue of honor and had been stabbed in Bath County, Kentucky in 1830. The doctor had declared that Owings's situation was not life threatening, but this diagnosis proved incorrect as the stabbing victim soon passed away.  Owings had asked for trouble. He insulted a woman of Anderson's household, so Anderson returned the favor by stabbing Owings when they met in the courtroom. To Anderson, defending his family's honor was paramount."," Dr. Hood thought that Owings would not die, so the local court did not charge Anderson with murder and merely requested that the violent assailant present himself for judgment at the court's next session. Anderson left town, however, upon hearing that Owings death had made him a murderer. In any case, such violence was typical of the South because of its honor culture and differentiated it from the rest of the United States according to Ed Ayers. It became vitally important to southerners to fight for their honor because this proved that they had honor to defend and deserved respectable social standing. Unfortunately, this promoted a cycle of violence because southerners constantly had to defend their honor. "," Women and slavery encouraged a cult of honor in the South in different ways. Women's moral standing directly affected their husbands' and sons' social status, so men felt compelled to defend their female relations' honor in order to avoid ridicule. Women also informally doled out social rank by judging families' honor, which men had to define through violence. With slavery, whites gained an elevated sense of superiority by degrading black people that they felt compelled to defend. As Ayers notes, It was slavery that allowed wealthy whites to consider themselves the heirs to the manners and pretensions of the English gentry. The idea of the English elite continued to feed a copycat honor culture defendable to the death in the South. In the nineteenth-century South, violence was not only a solution, but a status marker. A man proved he had honor to women and society at large by his violent behavior. The rich thought themselves more civilized because they contained their violence to duels, but the scars marred everyone the same."],"display_date":"May 7, 1830","search_date":"1830-05-07","locations":[{"id":4595,"lat":38.1037552133,"lng":-83.6995431506,"zoom":9,"place":"BATH, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3484,"title":"Pirates\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-01-08","end_date":"1820-01-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Jean Lafitte's mean have attacked again Pirates in Louisiana Again? Hide the valuables","These were a few thoughts that went through the minds of the citizens that read the newspaper of St. Francisville on January 8, 1820. An articles reported the robbery of a station in Attackapas by three men associated with the legendary pirate, Jean Lafitte. To the readers' relief, the article related the capture of the men on their way to Galveston after having sought refuge with surrounding Native Americans.","So why is Jean Lafitte legendary? And why were all the citizens of St. Francisville scared at the mention of his associates? The account of the life of the Louisianan pirate Jean Lafitte is steeped in shadows. A great deal is not known about his early years but the France native arrived in New Orleans in 1804. He quickly set up a stronghold in Barataria Bay with his brother Pierre Lafitte. The brothers recruited a band of buccaneers and together they pillaged ships of every nation whenever convenient. The fame of Lafitte's military power grew to such enormous heights so that Jean was offered a captaincy in the British Navy during the War of 1812 is his troop of men would fight against the Americans. Lafitte attempted to use this offer to entice the United States to give his entire band of men an act of oblivion in exchange for his loyalty to America. This plan did not succeed until General Andrew Jackson accepted Lafitte's offer in December of 1814, when a battle with the British off the coast of Louisiana was eminent. The Battle of New Orleans ensued on January 8, 1815 where Lafitte's men were divided and poured devastating fire into the advancing ranks of redcoats and contributed to a large degree in the victory.","Although Lafitte's pirates acted as patriots during the Battle of New Orleans, they did not lose interest in their careers as criminals. After the battle, Lafitte again fell into evil ways and moved to Galveston, Texas to set up a utopian pirate's den to base his operations from. His men continued their demoralizing activities with renewed vigor and staged raids into Louisiana, stealing slaves from one planter and selling them to another.","This shows that even when Lafitte resided in Texas in the 1820s, his prescence was nonetheless felt in Louisiana through criminal acts. The pirates of Lafitte's band used their power to rob ships as well as citizens. It is evident that the robbery of the station in Attackapas was a small part of the organized crime directed by Lafitte from Texas. The citizens of St. Francisville, therefore, had every right to be scared at the though of the ruthless men of Lafitte being in their area."],"display_date":"January 8, 1820","search_date":"1820-01-08","locations":[{"id":5694,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST LANDRY, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3485,"title":"Life on the Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1822-01-01","end_date":"1822-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When Jean Pearce moved to Louisiana from New York, he had high expectations. Pearce moved his family south in order to live near his brother and get education for his children. Plagued by illness and bad luck, Pearce moved his family away from his brother and took a job as an overseer at a secluded plantation on the Mississippi River. In his new surroundings, Pearce learned through the murder of a neighbor that life on the frontier in Louisiana differed from that of any life he had known.","The characteristic of ruthlessness moved with relentless determination through...Louisana's fields because every plantation competed against their neighbor for profits in the world of sugar cane and cotton. Pearce learned this first-hand. In the narrative about his life, Pearce related the story of the death of Robert Scott at the hands of Thomas Phipps. Although Pearce was not an eyewitness to the crime, he insisted on an inquest into the murder and served as one of the jurors during the investigation. According to witnesses, a fight broke out between the two men during a drinking frolick and Phipps began harassing Scott without cause. Scott's death occurred three days after this fight so therefore the crime was not a drunken crime of passion. Although it is impossible to know about a specific animosity between the two men, it can be inferred from the narrative that there was an underlying cause for Scott's death. After seeing Scott's body, Pearce asserted that Scott's injuries were made evidently with a club which matched with the threat Phipps made to Scott that he would beat him to death with a club.","This incident demonstrates the way in which unrestrained individualism caused by grasping for wealth can hurt communities. The settlements themselves were isolated and Pearce himself was more than unhappy...by being secluded from society. This isolation caused intellectual and cultural sterility of the community which in turn meant that the enormous educational needs of the settlement were neglected. The education Pearce desperately wanted for his children was not the community focus because commercial transactions [were] indeed the prime objects of attention. The children were instructed about crops and horses instead of reading and writing in such settlements.","It is evident through the brutal death of Robert Scott and Pearce's experience on a Mississippi River plantation that the competitive nature of frontier settlements cut great inroads into person and public honesty by turning its members into ambitious seekers-after-power. It is hard to tell the exact cause for Scott's death but Pearce knew that the constant quarreling among those around him led to several hair-breadth escapes from murder. The death of Scott was no stretch of the imagination for Pearce and he recognized the injustice of the situation he was in. Life on the plantation frontier focused on individual gain and therefore Scott's death was most likely one of many that occurred among men grasping for wealth."],"display_date":1822,"search_date":"1822-07-02","locations":[{"id":5558,"lat":29.1734822816,"lng":-90.5148369557,"zoom":8,"place":"LAFOURCHE, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3498,"title":"A Negro Killed\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-28","end_date":"1864-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The crime was reported in the newspaper with a bit of contempt, as if it was a mildly amusing diversion in the late days of the Civil War. According to the Wellsburg Herald, the black population of Wellsburg had been meeting nightly at societies or parties at the residences of other free blacks. But on this particular night something went wrong, or as the local white-owned newspaper mused, [the party] appears...to have been diverted from its legitimate object - affording an opportunity for the younger classes to meet, court, and sport together. The -'green-eyed monster' jealousy was of course not idle. A young free black man by the name of Thomas Groves was in town briefly as an employee on the steamer Miami and attended the party. When he left the house in the company of a local black woman, he got into an altercation with a group of local black men over his relationship with the woman. In the ensuing quarrel a member of the group pulled out a pistol and killed Groves. Though the identity of the actual killer was not known at press time, six of the men had been arrested on charge of being concerned in the riot. A hearing was scheduled for that afternoon.","Western Virginia, soon to become the new state of West Virginia, did not secede from the Union, and thus became a haven for free black men and escaped slaves during and after the Civil War. The border between West Virginia and Virginia was an important escape route from the Confederate states to the Upper South. Many former slaves were drawn to the area by the promise of a large number of high-paying jobs created by the burgeoning mining and timber industries. But in some cases, the influx of newly-free blacks was scarcely tolerated by the whites of the northern Border States. In an area that had traditionally had few blacks because of the lack of demand for slaves, the immigration of African Americans heightened tensions between the two races. The high tensions sometimes led to violence. In this case, however, the violence was limited to the black race, and so was looked on more as a diversion rather than cause for alarm.","Many of these escaped slaves became useful members of the Union Army, and some even became soldiers after conscription of African-Americans was approved in 1863. However, white attitudes toward free blacks in the South would remain a problem well into the 20th century, and soon black-on-black crime would be relatively ignored by many local southern authorities. Though the men in this case were arrested and perhaps even given a trial, this attitude of disdain among the whites would only increase during Reconstruction, and eventually transform into the codified racism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With the displacement of large groups of slaves during the Civil War and the sudden complete emancipation of the 14th Amendment, blacks and whites would be forced to deal with each other on grounds unfamiliar to both races.

While the women called their actions unexampled, and they felt all the timidity incident to our sex in entering the sphere of politics, they worried that the revolt was but a partial execution of a widely projected scheme of carnage. They could not hide the fears which agitate our bosoms, and the dangers which await us, as revealed by recent tragical deeds. Apparently the women believed that the slaves, once emancipated, would have little incentive to revolt. Further, the women were ready to take on the lost labor themselves.  Tell us not of the labors & hardships we shall endure when our bondservants shall be removed from us. They have no terrors for us, the petition continued."," The <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, a historical record of the county, would later publish additional information on what is perhaps the same push for local women for emancipation. The <em>Annals</em> relate how, in 1831 John McCue, one of the State Delegates from Augusta, presented a memorial to the State Legislature signed by 215 Augusta women praying for emancipation. While emancipation was not granted, the Women were not alone. The Annals report that there were numerous other petitions from Augusta County as well."," Although contrary to the conventional view that slavery in the South was immutable, the women's' petition probably did not fall on deaf ears in the Virginia Legislature. Historian Scot French notes that the State Legislative session of 1831 and 1832 following Nat Turner's Rebellion, became a debate over the future of slavery, the specter of black insurgency, and the possibility of solving this problem through abolition and removal of African Americans from the state. French quotes James McDowell, from Augusta's neighboring county, Rockbridge, as commenting on the large number of black victims killed in a frenzied white response to the revolt: Was it the fear of Nat Turner and his deluded and drunken handful of followers which produced or could produce such effects? Was it this that induced distant counties where the very name of Southampton was strange to arm and equip for struggle? No, sir, it was the suspicion eternally attached to the slave himself, the suspicion that a Nat Turner might be in every family. It was as if Nat Turner had in one vicious stroke exposed the violence at the very heart of the slave system, to the point that more than a few in Augusta County and Virginia wanted to abstain."],"display_date":1831,"search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":13636,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3516,"title":"An 1860 Presidential Debate Comes to Blows\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-10-13","end_date":"1860-10-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Less than a year before the Civil War spread destruction throughout the state of Virginia, a heated exchange between two Democrats indicated the sharp divide that split the party. In the election of 1860, the Democratic vote was split between three candidates, John Bell, Stephen Douglas, and John Breckinridge. During a formal debate between Gen. George Blow, a Douglas Democrat, L.H. Chandler, a Bell man, and Maj. William Lamb, a Breckinridge supporter, the discussion quickly disintegrated into personal insults between Mr. Lamb and Mr. Chandler. The <em>Herald</em> wrote that Lamb, might have spared some of the gross ribaldry and vituperation which he unnecessarily and we should think injudiciously heaped upon the [Constitutional] Union party, and that when he was understood to say that no honest man could attach himself to such a party...[it] was felt by hundreds present as a direct personal insult, and resented by a storm of hisses. However, when Lamb pointed at Chandler and alleged he was a member of the controversial Massachusetts Freesoil Party in 1848, it was simply too much for the Bell Democrat to bear. It's a d----d lie. announced Mr. Chandler. Do you mean to say I am a d-----d liar? Lamb responded. To which Chandler then shouted, ...sir, you are a d----d infernal liar And, as the paper so delicately put it, it was here the parties came into a collision...the blows seemed to those nearest the spot to have been almost simultaneous. This exchange of punches prompted supporters of each man to rush to the stage. To The <em>Herald</em>, in a chillingly prescient statement, it seemed that one imprudent act...might have lit up a flame of discord that could only have been quenched with blood, and caused the sacrifice of many lives.","This violent dispute reflects much of the turmoil that marred the Upper South during the months prior to the Civil War. The border states held the closest ties to their neighbors to the north and therefore felt the rift between the two regions most deeply. And it was here that the rift in the Democratic Party was felt most intensely. Breckinridge was supported by the Deep South, as he was a vocal proponent of slavery and its expansion. Those closer to the border were wary of his rhetoric, however, and Virginia was especially unenthusiastic. Stephen Douglas was more acceptable in this region, as he was dedicated to the preservation of the union. John Bell, the candidate of the Constitutional Union party, an organization dedicated to avoiding secession, also had a large following. The main issue was slavery. The South wanted a permanent guarantee of its continued preservation and expansion to new states in the form of a Constitutional amendment. This proposal was absolutely opposed by the North, who feared the political power that the slave states would hold if new states that welcomed slavery were allowed into the union. Though every Democrat in the South demanded a right to slavery forever, their differences in the area caused more conflict than unity. It was this conflict that allowed for the victory of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican candidate, who took office with a minority of the popular vote. And it was this event that prompted the Cotton Belt states to secede, but the deep divisions among southerners, evident in this episode, delayed Virginia from immediately following suit.

According to the<em> Annals of Augusta County</em>, a historical record of the County, it all had started when Maria, one of Dr. McChesney's enslaved children, came to dinner one night very much frightened, apparently having been chased by an old woman with her head tied up. Soon after, stones began to fall on the McChesney's roof in intervals-both at night and day. The <em>Annals</em> record that the stones averaged about the size of a man's fist, and some of them were too large to be thrown by a person of ordinary strength. Occasionally, some of the stones were hot, and scorched the dry grass on which they fell."," The McChesney's tried sending Maria to their in-laws, the Steeles. The situation was no better there. As Maria approached, the white family found themselves with all the furniture in their large room piled up promiscuously. Sods of dirt began to rain down on their house. Soon, Maria began to complain of being beaten with slaps that the Steele's could hear but could do nothing about. Maria would eventually fall down exhausted and the beatings would stop. As the Annals recount, worn out with these troubles, Dr. McChesney, as a last resort, sold Maria, and she was taken South. As soon as she left the disturbances ceased and they never followed her in her new home. ","   Questions of the supernatural aside, a certain paternalism towards his slave permeates Dr. McChesney's behavior-paternalism that Walter Johnson describes at length in his history of the Slave Market, <em>Soul by Soul</em>. Much of this ideology implied that the owner knows what is best for his slaves, a fantasy readily seen in the way the slave owner's decision to send the child down South is also her cure.

On a Saturday night in late October 1832, Joseph Wienand, the manager of the Neptune Hotel in Charleston, was murdered. Apparently, he was in possession of between 200 and 300 in cash. His murder was discovered by his African-American female servant at close to 6 a.m. the next day. After repeatedly rapping on his door to awaken him to start the day, the servant became nervous and forced her way into his room. He was found lying in a pool of his own blood. Upon investigation by a coroner, it was declared that he was murdered by strangulation with a handkerchief and by blows to his head with a stone. It was a sad fate for Mr. Wienand, a good member of Charleston society. ","Like any other city, murder and crime were facets of life in Charleston; however, it was not a huge problem for the antebellum city. In fact, the problems of regulating crime were more centered on slaves and free blacks rather than whites. Whether a white person or a black person killed Mr. Wienand is not known. However, it was quite apparent that as time wore on, white members of Charleston society who committed crimes were subjected to more lenient punishments than their black counterparts. In fact, city leaders became so worried about slaves and free African Americans committing crimes that the Charleston Work House was established in 1839. That year, the Work House became a house of correction for slaves. In addition to becoming a place for the punishment of slaves who committed various offenses or crimes, the Work House was also established so that the city would have a central place for a slave market. The work house was run under Spartan conditions and in a correctional manner. Many considered it a deterrent to committing crimes. No one wanted to go to the Work House. In addition, it was designed in a Gothic Revival style, similar to that of many churches built after the Great Fire of 1838, serving as a reminder that the righteous did not commit crimes like that one that was so cruelly bestowed on Mr. Wienand. ","Judging from the murder of Charleston hotel manager Joseph Wienand, one would assume Charleston was unsafe. However, as Maurie McInnis points out in a chapter of her book, <em>The Politics of Taste in Antebellum Charleston</em>, crime was greatly controlled in Charleston during the 1830s and 1840s, thanks in large part to fear of being incarcerated in the Work House.

The law stated that if one captures a fugitive slave, it is the responsibility of the law enforcement and citizens to aide in the returning of those slaves to their rightful owners.  The people of Mississippi knew that slaves would attempt to escape, and hoped that these new laws would help them keep the property in which they had invested so much.  The court's decision coming out of West Chester, Pennsylvania was a great sign of success for the South, as well as the institution of slavery.","The article in The Palladium, which was a Democratic newspaper, stated In an almostincredible short space of time she was delivered to the claimant, or his agent, who put her into a close wagon and drove rapidly from the State.

As long as the North was not attempting to threaten the institution of slavery, there were no major quarrels.

This shows a lot about the cares and interests of the people of Mississippi at the time of the Fugitive Slave Laws.

Up to this point in 1865, she had been enjoying the life of a socialite in Washington, DC, while Mr. Clay had taken on the role of Senator for the Confederacy. President Johnson had Clay arrested, alongside Jefferson Davis for allegedly conspiring in the assassination of former President Lincoln. He wrote from jail to his wife, stating, I am more confirmed by my reflections and our bitter experience that the Northern people were so hostile to the rights, interests and institutions of the Southern States, that it was just and proper for these to seek peace and security in a separate government. In response, Mrs. Clay made several attempts to visit with the President, urging him to release her husband. She seemed to share her husband's negative feelings for the Union, speaking highly of their being Southern as a means for Clay's defense. Mr. Clay was not released from jail until 1866, and he was later pardoned by Congress in 1880. Whether or not Clay was in any way involved in the plot for Lincoln's assassination is unknown.

As early as the 1830s, the South was developing an attitude that embraced sectionalism. As time went on, Southerners began more and more to see themselves as a world apart from the rest of the nation and as having their own separate interests. Both Clay and Mrs. Clay's anger towards the North and those involved in his arrest are revealing of the major division that had come to be between the North and South."],"display_date":"May 22, 1865 - April 17, 1866","search_date":"1865-11-03","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3562,"title":"Benjamin Thomas Lynched\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-08-08","end_date":"1899-08-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Tuesday, August 8, 1899 in Alexandria Virginia, news about the alleged assault on eight-year-old Lilly Clark by Benjamin Thomas, a black male, spread rapidly. On Sunday August 6, Clark claimed she went over to Thomas's home to retrieve an axe, which had been loaned to him. When she reached his house and explained why she had come, Thomas allegedly grabbed Clark and drew her to him. Clark, however, was able to escape and ran home to tell her mother. Thomas was arrested the following day. As night approached on Tuesday, the crowd outside the jail grew larger. Several hundred had gathered by 10 o'clock. The mob began to demand that Thomas be handed over. The mayor pleaded with the crowd to let Thomas undergo trial yelling If the man is not convicted I will lead you in person to hang him. The crowd was insatiable, however, and replied Give us the nigger He won't be here tomorrow The crowd rushed the jail and upon finding Johnson dragged him outside. Johnson tried to escape, but the crowd shot him, dragged him to the corner of King and Fairfax Street, stripped him of his clothes, and hanged him. The mob proceeded to fire shots into his body. After confirming that he was dead, the throng of people dispersed. The response to the lynching was mixed, and many speculated about why it occurred. Some argued that a protest Monday night by many African Americans, arguing that Thomas should not be lynched, may have contributed to the events that following Tuesday. What is clear, however, is that the actions of Tuesday, August 8, 1899 were not unusual.","The lynching of African Americans had become commonplace in the late nineteenth century. Before the Civil war white men were generally the victims of lynching. In the postbellum period, however, lynching and race were strongly related. In the South and border states 85 percent of victims were black. There are several possible explanations. William Brundage argues that southern institutions failed to provide adequate controls to stifle mob violence. Weak educational, religious, and civic institutions, poverty and ineffective law enforcement agencies failed to instill sufficient respect for the rule of law or human dignity. Furthermore, lynching provided a socially accepted channel for aggression in the South.","Although it was an accepted practice, lynching did face opposition from its beginnings. By the time Thomas was lynched in 1893, a number of whites had emerged who were concerned about its implications for the state. Despite these concerns, blacks had very few avenues to address violence towards them. The opposition that was led by blacks tended to be uncoordinated and lacked any concrete program for reform. For rural blacks the only available recourse was usually spontaneous and disorganized protests. More militant methods risked severe sanctions. Lynching continued well into the 20th century: African American Michael Donald was lynched in Mobile Alabama in 1981.

Of the three witnesses who testified, two of them were black and one of them was white. The first black witness, known as Henry Barret, testified that the assailant had been a white man who he believed may have been dressed in grey and wearing a hat. The following white witness, George Smith, told the defense that he did not see the accused, Oscar Mankin, shoot at the colored man. Lastly, a black, Jane Green, who was with Anderson on the night of the shooting, recalled talk of a black soldier being beaten up in the street outside, to which Anderson responded saying, he could whip any rebel man who had hit a Union man. She then said that Anderson was met by gunshots from Mankin, who she said may have been wearing a black coat and hat. The doctor who then examined Anderson's wound said its position was the result of the bullet coming from an elevation. Upon cross-examination, however, the defense contends that Mankin could not have been responsible given his average height and its inconsistency with the gun being fired from an elevation. At the trial's end, the jury returned the verdict of not guilty.","The proceedings of this trial, as well as the event on which it was based, reveal the nature of the relationship between blacks and whites during and after the Civil War. First, it was common for slaves from the South to join the Union army as an escape from slavery. Although the colored man being beaten up and to whose rescue Anderson came is not identified by the article, it would not be surprising that he was a former slave who came to the North to join the Unionists in the army. In addition, this trial also reveals the inferior treatment received by blacks at the hands of the whites. The testimonies of the black witnesses and victim involved, who were not even slaves, were nevertheless clearly given less consideration by the jury in considering the verdict. Thus it was clear that even in a society where blacks were not enslaved, the problem of race relations and the discomfort felt by whites living alongside blacks, remained."],"display_date":"January 19, 1866","search_date":"1866-01-19","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3574,"title":"Another Train Wreck\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-04-30","end_date":"1890-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Rather than going to bed early Sunday night after a long day of church and family time, the city of Staunton spent the evening putting out a fire, only to then have a serious train wreck in the early hours of Monday, April 28, 1890. The No. 2 train on the C&O line from Cincinnati had cars derail after losing air power to the brakes. The train picked up even more speed because there is a descent into the Staunton station. Along with the increased speed, the engineer had to maneuver the train along the curves of the rail. The engineer managed to prevent the whole train from jumping track and saved many lives. The derailed sleeper car caused the most damage by destroying the 6-inch iron columns lining the platform. As this was a night train, there were many people sleeping in this car and they suffered the most injuries. The wreck caused the death of a young girl of the Pearl of Pekin Company, a Dramatic Corps. Her body, on which there was the silver cross of the King's Daughters Organization, was taken to a local funeral home and prepared for the journey to Jackson County, Missouri. The other townspeople took the injured to two residences and the Virginia Hotel. "," This article was not the front-page headline of the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>of Augusta County. Instead, it ran as the longest column under the headline A Night Horror on the second page with mostly local events. Oddly, the news writer did not comment about the lack of a hospital. A group of local women, the King's Daughters Organization, did note this absence and started a campaign to build the first hospital in Staunton. "," This one train wreck illumines so many new themes of life in the 1890's. There is the strong danger of railroads. From 1890 to 1900, there were over 6,000 accidents involving mail-carrying trains and the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>listed train accidents and wrecks frequently. Alfred D. Chandler has explained how railroads drastically changed life in the United States. Small Staunton connected to greater America and her almost 200,000 miles of operating line in a way that horses and boats never could have. These railroad connections created opportunities for the citizens. The trains delivered mail demonstrably faster and more efficiently, and kept people who moved (increasingly because of trains) connected. There were new economic opportunities for builders, operators, and those who wanted to sell products to other cities. The grain of Staunton had a new market that enabled farmers to produce and sell more than ever. Railroads also represented the possibility of mobility. People could travel and see cities the average person twenty years before never would have and people could simply travel quicker. The girl who died originally had been a telegraph operator, another important development of the nineteenth century. The young girl imagined a greater life for herself and railroads provided the means of pursuit. She left a steady job in the Midwest and moved to New York City to become a star, as so many people continue to do so today. This one newspaper article intimated to its readers that Staunton was not just a dot on the map.

The United States of America was one of the few major players in the world economy that still had a firmly intact system that subjugated a race by the late nineteenth century. However, the race lines were skewed as two men planned to meet each other on the dueling field. Joe Dickerson and George Graham had to see each other in some context as equals. Both were fighting for the same woman even though Joe Dickerson was a free black man. This single duel between Joe Dickerson and George Graham is a reflection of race relations in Florida as of 1892. Florida was no stranger to slavery or free blacks and subsequently created an atmosphere of awkward racial tensions that existed throughout the South following the Civil War and Reconstruction. The love triangle created between a white woman and a man of color and a white man was more than just a dilemma. Inter-racial relations were still frowned upon in southern culture in the late nineteenth century; however, inter-racial relationships were still rampant. In addition, the two men had to meet and converse similar to closing a business deal before the duel could take place. Dueling was considered a civilized practiced in the nineteenth century; a way to defend your honor, and certainly only a man and not a piece of property would be able to defend his honor. ","It was the black man, Joe Dickerson who won the upper hand in the duel and fired before the white man, George Graham, could draw. Consequently, Dickerson fled the scene and his whereabouts were still unknown when the article was published. This interaction between races illustrates the fragile balance between whites and blacks as the South recovered from the Civil War for the next hundred years.

Although the evening had started with a small group of African Americans watching a trial of engines between the Richmond and the visiting Wilmington, Delaware Fire Companies, police soon arrested an African American man who allegedly attacked the firemen.  A riot followed, with the mob hurling paving stones at the officers all the way to the station-house.  Captain Junkins, two sergeants, and one private were all seriously injured.  The incident caused enough of a disturbance to compel General Schofield to arrive at the scene along with a company of the 11 Virginia Regiment.  Although the throng initially ignored the General's demands for disbandment, the soldiers ultimately proved to be a more effective catalyst for breaking up the mob.  ","      Following the incident, <em>The Richmond Whig</em> featured an editorial extolling the white policemen for their marvelous moderation:  When it is remembered that they were all armed, and that they were assaulted and in peril of their lives, and that they...forbore to fire...we cannot sufficiently commend their prudence and self-control.  ","      In this case, the non-violent response of whites was, in fact, noteworthy, as were the violent actions of African Americans.  In the postwar South, blacks widely suffered from brutal beatings and murders as white resentment of the freedom of African Americans grew.  Southern whites who believed in and were accustomed to the racial etiquette between a master and slave frequently attacked blacks for actions deemed impertinent and insolent.  Blacks bidding a white man good morning, for example, could provoke horror in the individual who expected blacks to remain silent unless a white person spoke to them first.  Despite this volatile nature of race relations, however, accounts of blacks assaulting whites were uncommon.  Whites often feared insurrections of their former slaves, but such rebellions rarely materialized.

The river is located near today's Jupiter, Florida and acquired its name from an assumed thought that the fighting was over between the Indians and white settlers.","Soldiers came, gathered, and removed the Indians from their homes by the river. Some Indians escaped the soldiers' clutches and ran to warn the others. After being rounded up and made to walk toward the west, the Indians were put on boats headed in the same direction. After traveling on the boats, the Indians had to walk again. It was during the walk along the Trail of Tears that the Indians knew the treaties for removal were never to be just or fair like President Jackson claimed they would be. Along the trail, many would die from lack of nourishment, dehydration, and diseases, but those were not the true horrors on the trail.","Betty Mae's great-great-grandmother, Mary Tustenuggee Tiger a Seminole from the Snake Clan, told her the true horrors of the trail. Mary and her three daughters were four of the captives at the River of Lies. Mary and her eldest daughter were raped and used for the soldiers' pleasure along the arduous journey west. The eldest daughter was raped so much that she could barely walk, and her mom had to carry her. Other young women were raped on the trail as well. The soldiers had no remorse for their actions. They were like wild beasts who laughed and kicked the Indian women around while raping them and joked about it in front of others.","Innocent lives were taken by soldiers as well. Mary recalled to Betty Mae how they were driven like cows on the trail. Mary told Betty that when older people got sick or too tired to walk, they would fall and be whipped until they got up. If they did not get up and continue walking, the soldiers would shoot them. Mary even described how soldiers would throw babies in to a creek or pond to drown or hit them against a tree if the babies cried too much from hunger. Everyone was in danger of dying because a soldier would kill them for not complying with orders or wanting to rest. They were not able to ride in the wagons, not even the most elderly or sick; resting did not exist on the trail.","The stories that Betty Mae retold in her diary from Mary's story are truly nightmares. Most people think that malnutrition, dehydration, and fatigue were the worst conditions on the trail, but those conditions were nothing compared to the rapes and murders that took place. Betty Mae wanted to help her great-great grandmother tell her story so that the whole truth could be revealed about the Trail of Tears.

Second, Dolan notes, official police forces in the United States were just gaining ground, generally having been instituted around only 50 years prior to this raid in D.C.

However, this inability to vote was not because it was illegal for African Americans to do so. Three hundred armed white men were standing in front of the registry office in the town of Palmetto in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana to prevent them from registering to vote. After the armed men left, a few African Americans had managed to register to vote and were therefore flogged unmercifully for their actions. Following this beating, the group of angry white men went to the home of another black man, Reuben Stelly. After requesting that he come outside to talk with them, Stelly became frightened and shot into the mob, killing a nineteen-year-old white man. In response, the armed mob fired back into the house, killing Stelly and another black man that was with him."," Though African Americans had been given the right to vote in the fifteenth amendment nearly 30 years earlier in 1870, white men of the south were still trying to take a stance against this decision. This incident occurred in 1896; just one year after the grandfather clause had been enacted by several of the Southern states in the United States. A grandfather clause is a phrase used when an exemption is put in place that allows an old rule to apply to particular circumstances, while a new rule applies to everything else. This particular grandfather clause was put into place in lieu of the Jim Crow laws, which were state and local laws in the South between 1876 and 1964 that required racial segregation of African Americans in the majority of public areas. The clause stated that those who had the right to vote before 1867 would be exempt from any property, tax, or educational requirements for voting, and their descendents would have the same exemption. Because African Americans had not been given the right to vote until 1870, the clause effectively excluded blacks from voting. However, it still guaranteed the right to vote to many illiterate and poor white men. As a result of this clause, any African American attempting to register to vote would face quite an ordeal. The type of situation that Reuben Stelly was involved in was obviously chaotic, with racism motivating irrational actions. It was very common for groups of white men to gather in this way to protest the voting rights of black men. When violence erupted from these types of circumstances, it was typical for them to result in an unjust case that was unfairly represented on the part of the black man. Clearly, Reuben Stelly acted drastically because he knew what the situation entailed. The mob of white men did not just want to talk to him; he had registered to vote - exactly what they didn't want him to do. Unfortunately, this situation resulted in casualties on both sides.

Southern race relations had not yet mended after the Emancipation Proclamation, issued in 1863 which freed all slaves, and the Thirteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, officially abolishing slavery. In an attempt to replace the social controls of slavery, the Black Codes were enacted in 1885 which greatly limited the rights of blacks, and stated that if they were unemployed or homeless, they would be charged a fine or imprisoned. The Codes were done away with after reconstruction, but many were nostalgic for them and the ideals that they represented.  The Jim Crow laws were created shortly after, in 1877 to racially segregate the South. Though the conflict between the whites and blacks of Baton Rouge was reported to have resulted from the murder of a white man by a black man, the anger between the groups was obviously based on more than the murder.

Charles Furlong was, therefore, one of many men who decided he would rather kill himself than go through the torture of being in the Louisiana Penitentiary System. Though slavery had been abolished in the thirteenth amendment in 1865, being forced to do work on roads, railways, plantations, and buildings was similar to being brought back to pre-abolitionist society. Men were whipped and beaten on a regular basis; much like a slave would be, if they did not do their assigned work correctly. The tales of brutality that existed at the camps were shocking and almost beyond belief. There was even a law that paralyzed the tongue of the convict, forbidding him to speak of what had happened to him at the convict labor camps. Convict labor was so important that if a slave attempted to escape or kill himself, much like Furlong did, guards were ordered to shoot and kill them in their tracks. Major General Winfield Scott Hancock was currently in command of the military department in Louisiana and had issued an order for the employment of convicts outside of the prison walls. There also was ample military necessary for the General's actions. A state law was currently in place that actually stated a prohibition of convicts working outside of the penitentiary walls. However, state laws concerning prisoner's rights were then of little account, and prison management had drifted into the wrong hands - the hands of the military. They used the convicts at their disposal and for their own profit. While the control of the Louisiana State Penitentiary lying in the hand of the military was unusual, prisoners committing suicide to escape the brutal work at convict labor camps was not, and Charles Furlong's story is one of many."],"display_date":"July 15, 1885","search_date":"1885-07-15","locations":[{"id":5772,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"WEST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3653,"title":"Slave Management in Darlington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-10-13","end_date":"1852-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There were always fears of slave rebellions. In a letter dated October 13th, 1849, from E.W. Cooper, Thomas Cassels Law learned of a Negro insurrection in his home district of Darlington, South Carolina. Cooper served on an investigating committee to respond to the matter. Although they could not gather sufficient evidence to have the four leading insurrectionists hanged, they were lodged in jail and later sent out of the state. One of the enslaved men mentioned that word was spreading around Darlington that this was the last year the slaves would be held in bondage; white men traveling between Sumterville and Darlington City were apparently spreading the rumors. Cooper believed his own slaves were largely ignorant of the matter, but he warned Law, You had better keep a look out.","It is unclear how much of an impact this letter had on T.C. Law, but it is known that he was an active member of the Darlington Agricultural Society. In 1852, Thomas Cassels Law gave an address to the society entitled, Report on Management of Slaves - Duty of Overseers and Employers. Law's chief purpose was to give some insight in keeping an efficient and productive operation, and he incorporated an intricate analysis of the relationships between master and slave and overseer. He began, If slaves were brutes, as many seem to view them we might more easily point out their proper management, but they are human beings - morally accountable - committed to our care by a mysterious Providence, for, no doubt, a wise purpose. Law advocated for a moderate and constant work schedule for slaves, with proper intervals of rest. Yet, he also justified the use of the whip by citing scripture: he that spareth the rod hateth his child. Law recommended giving slaves a small plot that they could work in their off time and have a small notion of ownership. When the owner buys crops from his own slaves, it convinces them of your doing justice. ","As Law's report suggests, the relationship between master and slave was intricate and multi-faceted, layered with contradictions. Slaves were seen as racially inferior, yet still morally accountable human beings. Slaves were quite literally the property of their owners, and Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul </em>examines the reduction of human beings to financial numbers. Yet, Law and other planters found it immoral and improper to rule by simple and violent dominion over their chattel. Religious and racial convictions compelled white masters to treat slaves with paternalistic supervision. There was also a level of insecurity. So, giving a token piece of land to the slaves and convincing them of the justice of the system was a rational approach to slaveholding. Though men like Thomas Cassels Law may have applied the industry of slavery moderately and sensibly on their plantations, the existence of slaves as economic property was inherently dehumanizing."],"display_date":"October 13, 1849 - August 10, 1852","search_date":"1851-03-13","locations":[{"id":11496,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3655,"title":"Dueling in Southwestern Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-09-26","end_date":"1850-09-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When James E. Brown of Wytheville County wrote a letter to his daughter Jane, he discussed the latest duel as the topic of choice.< Writing from Cobbler's Spring, Virginia, he said that Mr. Hickman and Mr. Long had entered into a duel. Mr. Hickman was the principle fighter and Mr. Long was his second. Dueling with them was Mr. Naylor, the principle fighter, and Mr. Stephen Taylor, his second. Many townsfolk gathered to see the sight, including Brother G. Stuart and Mr. General Repeat. It seemed that Mr. Hickman shot early before the time that was agreed upon. Following the rule of seconds, which enabled a second to engage if his principle was fired upon unfairly, Mr. Taylor shot Mr. Hickman. In retaliation, Mr. Long, Hickman's second, shot and killed Mr. Taylor. After the duel, only two men walked away: Mr. Hickman and Mr. Long. Mr. Hickman was not much hurt from his gunshot wound, but both Mr. Naylor and Mr. Stephen Taylor were annihilated. Mr. Hickman and Mr. Long were victorious. While the cause of the duel was not known, being that it occurred in the South during the height of dueling, it was assumed to be a matter of honor.","It seemed likely that Mr. Naylor insulted Hickman or vice versa, and one challenged the other to a duel, as this was the way to settle the matter when insulted. When a man was challenged to a duel, he could not back down. He had to fight. Then the seconds, who in this case were Mr. Long and Mr. Taylor, would arrange the time, place, and conditions of the duel. If someone was challenged to a duel by sword, but lacked ability in that skill, it was the duty of the second to arrange an alternative. Seconds were hand selected by the principle fighters, and they were usually good friends. In all cases, the seconds were of the same stature in society as their principle. Once the seconds set the conditions, certain friends were invited to come and watch. Not all duels ended in deaths. Once one man had been injured, the duel ended, and they were supposed to shake hands and become friends, as delegated in many dueling guideline books of the nineteenth century. Furthermore, if anything unfair transpired over the course of a duel, it was the duty of the second to step in and preserve their principle's honor, as Taylor did when Hickman shot Naylor before it was time.","This duel between Hickman and Naylor in southwestern Virginia highlighted the importance of honor in southern society. By the nineteenth century, dueling had penetrated the essence of white southern society. The duel was not just a way to settle an argument. Dueling in the South meant a way to protect your honor. If someone tarnished your name, the only way to uphold a man's dignity was to challenge him to a duel. At the height of the dueling era, Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in 1804. As a consequence of Hamilton's death, the practice of duels dissipated in the North and became a sectional practice associated with the South. Dueling provided an atmosphere for southern men to protect that honor that they, as southerners, had. Dueling also provided a form of entertainment for the townspeople from the daily routine. Southerners would rather see their fellow man perish than turn his back on a duel. To not protect a man's honor carried the connotation of a degraded slave. By extension, if the southerner was unable to protect his liberty, including the southern lifestyle of slavery, then he could not prove himself as a man. A loss of control over slavery threatened not only his liberty but also his honor. The Civil War provided an opportunity for southerners to protect their honor regarding their lifestyle of slavery. So it seemed that dueling demonstrated the importance of honor to the southern man, a concept which sustained the South from the antebellum period to fighting to protect the institution of slavery during the Civil War."],"display_date":"September 26, 1850","search_date":"1850-09-26","locations":[{"id":14365,"lat":36.9538901577,"lng":-81.1000549711,"zoom":9,"place":"WYTHE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3694,"title":"A narrative of the adventures and escape from American Slavery of Moses Roper\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-01-01","end_date":"1838-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Moses Roper was born in North Carolina, but after being sold several times, he ended up in South Carolina in Lancaster and also spent time in Cashaw County. Born a mulatto, he experienced both the advantages of being too white and also the disadvantages of being too black. For example, while slave traders attempted to sell him, he suffered because he was considered too white and spent time in horrible slave conditions as a result. After settling in South Carolina, he decided to escape numerous times but was always caught. He received as punishment numerous floggings and lashings; he was also chained and beaten. Those conditions only made him more determined to gain his freedom. He eventually escaped because he was white enough to convince others he was not a slave. He eventually reached Liverpool, England. ","The treatment of slaves was reflected in the treatment of Roper. Slaves responded by either individual resistance or group resistance through spirituals, work songs, or general work ethic. Overall, the treatment of slaves, as argued by Donald, Baker and Holt, reflected the white supremacists' views that they were fundamentally different than whites. Roper's narrative also reflects the treatment of mulattos since even some black blood in a person meant that a person did not deserve freedom. After arriving in England, he joined a Christian Church even though he was not allowed to practice in the Christian Church in America because he was a slave.

The years leading up to the affair were full of bargains, compromises, and violent encounters that transcended both racial and societal lines. On January 7, 1847, many newspapers distributed articles focusing on the ongoing war with Mexico. The dispute increased social and political unrest back east, and the decision of whether or not to allow slavery in the new lands previously occupied by Mexicans was at or near the top of the agenda. In an attempt to bolster and create a harmonious atmosphere in the nation's capital, the news publication The National Era ran an article proclaiming the importance of order and abstinence from violence in the District at such a perilous time. The most threatening concern expressed in the article was the importance of keeping the city running smoothly and peacefully, despite widespread domestic turmoil. The citizens of Washington felt this was vital because visiting foreign diplomats saw Washington as a picture or representation of the nation as a whole. Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the city in order to secure positive foreign relations. After all, if anarchy existed in the city of Washington, then visiting foreign diplomats would be less inclined to trade or do business and would also leave with a poor impression of Americans and republican liberty in general. The gradual emergence of a world economy built upon trading was fundamental to the existence of both the North and South. This futuristic ideal economy requires, at the very least, peaceful conditions back in Washington so as to promote the kind of city-on-a-hill atmosphere that will attract foreign support. Richmond for example, saw an increase in urban population and a rise of new professions such as prostitution - which could yield a livable economic income at the time. After further examination, Joshua Rothman pointed out that resources were scarce and consequently, prostitutes constantly assaulted one another in public. If upon arrival foreign ambassadors or diplomats were greeted with a scene similar to the picture Rothman paints of Richmond, then their view of Washington would no doubt be negative, and therefore detrimental to the reputation, accountability, and future existence of the nation as a whole."],"display_date":"January 7, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-07","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3700,"title":"Twelve Years a Slave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-02","end_date":"1853-01-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The memoirs of Solomon Northup vividly portrayed the descent of a former New York freedman into the harsh system of slavery faced by many African Americans living in the antebellum South. Few people probably recalled January 4, 1853, as a significant day in the history of the United States. However, on this day a very important meeting was being held in the small town of Marksville, Louisiana, and the fate of one man was changed forever. For this day marked the release of Solomon Northup from years of involuntary servitude after being deceived and forced into slavery against his will while visiting the city of Washington.Solomon was not the first slave, nor the last, to be set free from the chains of slavery. What makes his story stand out, however, is that he was not born a slave; he had worked various jobs throughout his lifetime, always looking to better the lives of his family. It was this desire to provide a better life for his family that led him to take a job offer that would forever change his life. While working in Saratoga Springs, New York, Solomon met two white men named Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton who offered Northup a job providing musical entertainment for the circus. They said the circus was currently located in Washington, D.C., but would be traveling back North; Solomon agreed to take the trip.  Although free blacks traveling through areas where slavery was legal could acquire papers as proof of freedom, documentation was not always a guarantee of safety.  In Washington, Solomon was captured at a bar, presumably drugged, and woke up a few days later, ill from his poisoning, alone in the darkness of a basement in chains.  He had been robbed of his documents, money, and ultimately his freedom. Slave traders used a variety of tactics to illegally enslave freedmen, whether by force or physical violence, or, as in Solomon's case, by tricking, drugging, and other deceitful means.  At the threat of death, Solomon was silenced and shipped to Louisiana where he spent twelve years doing hard labor. In the novel Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson, he reiterates this harsh reality by stating that, none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known, so they were sold with new ones. Although Mr. Northup sought to bring his captors to trial, they were never prosecuted and he mysteriously disappeared. To this day, Solomon's burial site has not been identified and it is still not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured, or died of natural causes. Walter Johnson best describes Northup's experience: despite the fact that he was able to achieve his restitution of freedom, he met the same end as many African Americans from that time; unexplainable, undocumented, and seemingly unnoticed disappearance."],"display_date":"January 2, 1853 - January 4, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3738,"title":"Troubles between blacks and police in Princess Anne County\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-01-07","end_date":"1869-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One January day, Lieutenant.

Edward Pollard of Lunenburg County, Virginia was a wealthy farmer who later discovered that in addition to the murder of his 56-year old wife, his home had been burglarized as well.

A seat of racial tension, particularly because of an established African American population that controlled many prestigious government and military positions, Hamburg had undergone nearly eleven years of Reconstruction that had, in the opinion of South Carolinian Sam Aleckson, brought some \"tranquility to the state and people.\" Nonetheless, the success of Reconstruction (especially in Hamburg) was blemished when a white Ku Klux Klan mob assaulted a black militia group led by South Carolina National Guard Captain Doc L. Adams. ","    At the time of the incident, Adams' regiment had been parading legally on the streets of Hamburg in celebration of the Fourth of July. Two white men, Messrs. Henry Gatzen and Thomas Butler, approached them and instructed them to move to the side of the road, which they did begrudgingly. This action, however, was not enough for Mr. Butler, and he reported the militia company for \"obstructing the highway\" to the local trial justice, Mr. Prince Rivers, who printed out a warrant against Capt. Adams. This action Mr. Butler carried out in accordance with South Carolina law. The second action Mr. Butler took, however, was much less lawful. Butler related the stubborn response of the militia company to his cousin, General M.C. Butler (an ex-Confederate general and a participant in Ku Klux Klan activities), who took the law into his own hands, demanding that the militia company turn over its legally-held weaponry as well as summoning an armed mob from Augusta, Georgia, to assault the black National Guard regiment.","    Soon after, Butler's mob forced the militia men into a local house and threatened to blow up the house with cannon fire. Weary of this threat, the militia company escaped the building, but was unable to evade General Butler's mob, which murdered five and severely wounded three of the captured African Americans. This violence occurred for no other reason than the company's immediate refusal to move from a public road.","    The Hamburg Fourth of July incident, while cheerless in outcome, portrays race relations in South Carolina during Reconstruction, specifically whites' blunt refusal to end antebellum traditions and accept society's newly freed members.

Healy, a student at the University of Virginia in the years surrounding 1859, wrote a letter to his brother in Urbanna, Virginia on November 3.  He was eager to explain to his family an event that had occurred a short distance from where he was in Albemarle County, Virginia. On the morning of October 16, 1959, John Brown, a radical abolitionist, and 17 white men and five African Americans attacked the government armory and railroad bridge at Harpers Ferry, Virginia.  They hoped that they would not only raise a slave revolt, but also provide their black followers arms from the arsenal in order to escape safely.  Even though Brown and his group were able to quickly take possession of the armory, they were unable to create the army of slaves that they had anticipated and had truly hoped for. ","    This raid obviously created great concern with the citizens of Charlottesville, Virginia because as Healy says in his letter, they felt as if they did not fulfill their job of protecting nearby Virginia citizens.  If they had had a sufficient military force, they could have aided Robert E. Lee's troops and ceased the attack more quickly.  Therefore, only five days after John Brown was found guilty of murder and treason, the people of Charlottesville scheduled a mass meeting in order to increase their military force.   Healy and many other students found it necessary to attend the meeting. This meeting, however, still seemed to be a very drastic measure compared to reactions across the South.  As Reynolds says, people in other states, at first, simply decided to always be armed individually in case of another abolitionist attack.  It was necessary for Virginians to take more immediate precautions because of the actions of Virginia's governor Henry Wise.  He was the one to quickly arraign Brown on three charges: murder, inciting slaves to rebellion, and treason against the state of Virginia.  Wise wanted to make a statement, and by claiming John Brown for the state of Virginia, he did.  So, in turn, Albemarle County responded quickly and efficiently to the Harpers Ferry events and stood up for the state of Virginia. ","    If John Brown had been killed during the raid, Albemarle County and other Southern counties would have taken these previously stated precautions less seriously, but this was not the case.  John Brown had a period of seven weeks between his being found guilty and his execution.  During this period, he was able to talk and write from jail; so, by the time of his death the entire nation knew of his writings.  He was no longer simply a criminal, but a martyr in the North, and a representative of the abolitionist reform to the South.  The South was then paranoid and in a state of panic.  Their views of secessionism and defense of slavery strengthened.  They were more rigid when dealing with their slaves, and all Southern states realized they should be prepared, like Virginia, with sufficient force in case of another foolish abolitionist raid.  Today, historians see John Brown in many cases as the man who truly provoked the first events that would in turn lead to the Civil War.

In April 1862, the Senate Committee on the Conduct of War was asked to investigate accusations of Confederate crimes against Union dead and wounded at the First Battle of Manassas.  On May 5, 1862, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> published the Committee's report, including excerpts of testimony and their conclusions.  The testimony was taken from soldiers and citizens who witnessed or were victims of the atrocities.  The testimony of Drs. Swain and Ferguson both highlighted instances in which wounded Union soldiers were denied adequate medical care, leading to further pain and death in some cases.  Louis Francis, a Union soldier, gave testimony as a victim of this inadequate treatment; his wounds were so badly tended that on several occasions the bone of his amputated leg continued to rupture through his wound.  His multiple requests for a more qualified surgeon were all denied.    Finally, the Committee heard testimony from many citizens who had witnessed Confederate soldiers desecrating the bodies of the Union dead in order to obtain trophies, such as bones or skulls.  All of the testimony and evidence led the Committee to find that Confederate soldiers had committed atrocities against the Union's wounded and deceased.  In their conclusion, the committee decried the barbarism of the Confederacy and called for the support of all loyal people and foreign nations to defeat this inhumane and immoral enemy of the Republic.  ","The First Battle of Manassas was an embarrassing defeat for the North; it weighed down their spirit of prewar triumphalism, deflated the morale of the troops, and quelled public support for the Civil War.  Historian Harry Stout claims that many religious and civilian leaders viewed the defeat as a moral judgment against the North's leaders and their aims in war.   After the defeat, the North needed to rally mass public support and boost the morale of the troops; this report and its publication were an attempt to define the North's cause as a noble fight against the barbarism of the uncivilized South.  The committee made this expressly clear in their conclusion's call for support and solidarity against the inhumane enemy.  This article framed the conflict as a war that pitted the civilized and virtuous North against the uncivilized and barbaric South; this interpretative shift helped the Union regain popular support for the War and reenergized their troops against the enemy.

Of all the slave rebellions in the United   States, this revolt led by Nat Turner was perhaps the most infamous. Turner's violent rebellion capitalized on one of the plantation class's greatest fears: insurrection. Campbell, in his letter to Colonel Baldwin, detailed the revolt's aftermath, noting \"the whites murdered amounted to fifty-eight\" and that \"excitement and apprehension\" had consumed Virginia. Over the course of two days, approximately seventy slaves, including \"eleven of Richard Drummond's Negroes,\" terrorized the white citizens of Southampton County. In order to comprehend the significance of the Southampton slave insurrection, it is necessary to first understand the brooding concerns of the Southern planter class.","A slave rebellion, argues historian Marion Kilson, \"expresses the realization of the worst fears of the slavocracy.\" Due to plantations' significant dependence on slave labor, an Eastern Virginian county comprised of a larger slave than white population was not atypical. The Historical Census Browser shows that according to 1830 census figures, the population of Southampton County contained 7,756 slaves and 6,573 whites. Because slaves were regarded by the white minority as a form of chattel property that could be bought and sold, potential for uprising was-ever present. Whenever violent rebellion did emerge, Southern sentiment punished the entire slave population in hopes of re-establishing confidence in the traditional plantation economy.","As a direct result of the Southampton slave insurrection, the Virginia General Assembly instituted strict legislation further assuring white social control over free and enslaved blacks. Historian Scot French writes that the Assembly \"banned blacks from preaching or attending unsupervised religious gatherings,\" while Harvey Wish notes that the Assembly strengthened the \"police codes of the slave state[s].\" Wish further observes the fact that because Nat Turner was an educated black, \"Negro education became more than ever an object of suspicion.\" Panic regarding future conspiracies encouraged trials and convictions of many slaves for alleged plots that never materialized. As William Campbell observed, \"in the present state of excitement, a little [suspicion]... on our side goes a long way.\""],"display_date":"August 22, 1831 - September 4, 1831","search_date":"1831-08-28","locations":[{"id":14281,"lat":36.7198931687,"lng":-77.1037749414,"zoom":9,"place":"SOUTHAMPTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3899,"title":"The Trials and Tribulations of the South Carolina Ku Klux Klan\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-12-28","end_date":"1875-03-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 28, 1871, in Columbia, S.C., Sherod Childers, Evans Murphy, Hezekiah Porter and William Montgomery received their sentencing for the infamous Ku Klux Klan conspiracy in South Carolina. It was here, in Columbia, that the federal court attempted to provide serious solutions to stunt the organization whose actions had become increasingly violent and oppressive. While these actions by the federal court and the infamous nature of the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina created controversial issues in the late 1860s and early 1870s, the \"reign of terror\" by the Ku Klux Klan was temporarily immobilized by token arrests in 1871. ","The Ku Klux Klan planted their roots, under emissary R.J. Brunson in 1868 in Rock Hill, S.C. The Democrats, hoping to win back governmental positions in South Carolina, felt that by intimidating and eliminating the \"negro Republican vote,\" victory could once again belong to the Democratic Party. In Abbeville County, for instance, the secretive, violent actions of the Democratic Party went hand in hand with the actions of the Ku Klux Klan, working together in most cases. In the presidential election year, South Carolina was anticipated to have won steadily Republican seats, but instead, intimidation triumphed democracy.","The violence exploded in the elections of 1868, as Abbeville, Newberry and Anderson counties were entitled \"the KKK counties\" because of the armed mobs and murders that occurred on Election Day as white supremacists employed violence to ensure political upheaval. One Southern man claimed that they [white Southern Democrats] were being \"trodden under foot by an inferior and barbarous race.\" But by 1870, the Democrats could no longer depend on intimidation to win elections and the emergence of the more militant KKK continually gained momentum, primarily for Democratic Party political gains, and of course, in the name of white supremacy. When 2,500 armed whites gathered in Laurens County to violently protest the election results in 1870, violence spread among the upstate of South Carolina. Negroes were pulled out of jail, beaten and murdered by white supremacy members of the KKK. In York County alone, in the course of six months, there was an estimated 304 incidents of violence. Klan violence, though the Klan had been officially disbanded in 1969, arose out of all socio-economical classes in a decentralized format, reigning terror and death wherever possible. The federal government, under Grant in late 1870 and early 1871, respectively passed the Enforcement Act and the Ku Klux Klan Act hoping to put an end to the once again rebellious South through these increasingly strict federal acts. Because of these acts, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended in nine South Carolina counties and in most cases, the procedure of due process was neglected.","The trials, evidenced by Evans Murphy's questioning during one aspect of the ongoing South Carolina trials, proved mostly ineffective and as support waned, largely futile. In the South Carolina KKK trials alone, an account collaborated by the federal government in 1873 discovered that 831 persons were indicted and only 27 of which were ruled guilty, 71 persons pled guilty, and by 1875 pardons released the last of the imprisoned KKK members and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was passed in early March. Under the Klan's \"virtual reign of terror,\" however, much violence and terror was accomplished. But those who were caught and testified in court, such as Evans Murphy, created an environment not easily conducive to convictions. Evans claimed \"[he] didn't see anything [himself], [he] didn't do anything [himself],\" and \"[he] didn't hear anything\" about the night he was said to have been one of nine members in a beating at the Rainey house. Yet, as the questioner so succinctly stated, \"so it turns out that those who happen to be indicted didn't do anything, and all those that haven't been caught, did the whipping.\"  And with that testimony, Evans Murphy, like the other token Klan members convicted, was fined one hundred dollars and imprisoned for eighteen months, in order for South Carolina to put an end to Klan violence and grant South Carolina peace. The story of Evans Murphy provides insight into the South Carolina Ku Klux Klan trials, which temporarily shattered the Ku Klux Klan and reinstated temporary law and order, only to have the organization emerge once again in the 1920s, more violent than ever."],"display_date":"December 28, 1871 - March 1, 1875","search_date":"1873-07-29","locations":[{"id":11639,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3903,"title":"Govenor Zebulon Vance&#39;s Negotiations with General Sherman\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-11","end_date":"1865-04-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Zebulon Vance, North Carolina's governor during the Civil War, was a very loyal Confederate.

Upon his arrival on free soil, Jones contacted Brown and made arrangements for Brown's escape. They communicated through a clever system that involved passing each other magazines in which \"letters in different words were undermarked by a dot or period, and which letters, when put together, made an intelligible sentence.\" Once a time and meeting place were agreed upon, Jones sent a supply wagon as a means for Brown to escape. Brown was filled with elation when he reached freedom and met Jones until, unfortunately for the fugitives, the prison commander immediately confronted the men and accompanied both back to the prison. ","While this anonymous account relates the story of an escape attempt, it also alludes to the favorable conditions that existed in some prison camps during the Civil War. For instance, regarding the commander of the prison Brown reported, \"Major Wilkes is emphatically one of Natures noble-men...perfectly unassuming, even with those under his surveillance-wishing them well, and endeavoring to promote their comfort and happiness.\" Likewise, Fort Warren, to which Brown referred in the description of his escape, was known for its benevolent treatment of prisoners. In his diary, former Confederate Secretary of State Alexander H. Stephens attested to the accommodations offered in the Federal prison. He revealed that he had a large room with plenty of light, a bed of \"tolerable comfort,\" pure water, sufficient food, and \"the privilege of seeing daily papers and reading books\" during his detainment at Fort Warren. The prison itself was originally built in 1851 on an island in Boston Harbor as a Union fort that had been converted in 1861 to hold high-ranking officers and political prisoners during the Civil War. Due to the high social and military status of most prisoners, their treatment and living conditions were overall exemplary in quality. Historian Minor H. McLain even describes Fort Warren as \"an outstanding example of humanity in time of stress.\" Despite the problems it faced due to overcrowding when it first opened, Fort Warren only amassed a total of twelve prisoner deaths during its existence, while reaching a high of 394 captives in February 1865. However, the relatively small death count that Fort Warren accumulated serves as an exception to the atrocious mortality found in other prisons during the Civil War, such at Andersonville, Georgia; Elmira, New York; or Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia.","Of the approximately 193,750 Union soldiers captured, over 30,000 died in Confederate captivity, while nearly 26,000 out of the approximately 214,900 captured Southerners died in Federal prisons. Military historian Robert S. Davis gives mortality rates for the worst prisons on each side; as high as 35 percent at the worst Southern prison, as high as 24 percent at the worst Northern prison, and an average of 12 to 15 percent of the troops for both armies. Although these rates seem high enough to motivate anyone to flee captivity, it was also a soldier's duty to escape and rejoin his army in battle. Historian Pamela Hain gives evidence of this obligation when she cites several escape attempts made by prisoners at Fort Warren, despite numerous testimonies to its benevolent conditions compared to those at prisons elsewhere. As Brown suggested in the account of his escape, regardless of the quality of treatment, \"there are those as ready and anxious to escape from this, as from that, or any other prison.\""],"display_date":"November 1864","search_date":"1864-11-15","locations":[{"id":6210,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3924,"title":"Desertion from the 5th S.C.

The men fled from camp on the night of April 3, but the notice did not provide any location. The group of deserters included three men from Company A and five members of Company G, both under the command of Brig. Gen. Thomas Logan. A chart also ran under the notice providing detailed information on each soldier's height, age, complexion, hair and eye color, and terms of enlistment. All eight deserters had enlisted for the duration of the war. The notice, issued by General Logan himself, promised a furlough of thirty days to any member of the brigade who \"shall arrest, or cause to be arrested and placed in jail\" any of the deserters. It went on to explain that a citizen who arrested any of these soldiers would receive a similar furlough for any member of the brigade.","Desertion like this plagued the Confederate Army throughout the course of the Civil War. It was more frequent towards the end, and the case of desertion from General Logan's unit was no exception. A number of factors contributed to widespread desertion from the battlefields, particularly the sense of conflicting duties that many men faced. Soldiers felt a duty to the Confederacy but also a strong obligation to protect their homes and families. According to historian Mark Weitz, they experienced a \"push from the conditions they were in\" and a \"pull which came from home.\" Furthermore, unpopular practices such as conscription often undermined their sense of patriotism and the national identity that the Confederate government had tried to build. Conditions on the battlefield also drove soldiers to desert. Many suffered emotional and physical hardships from the horrible realities of war and the intense demands placed upon them on a daily basis. Troop morale was critical to their performance and also for the drive to remain loyal to the Southern cause. The scarcity of necessary supplies such as food and clothing, especially as the war progressed, also contributed to desertion.","Punishment for deserters varied. Some commanders such as Robert E. Lee and Braxton Bragg stressed the importance of severe punishment-often a death sentence-to those who fled the army. They felt that the prospect of death served as a deterrent for the crime. Most deserters, however, faced less severe penalties, such as hard labor, floggings, or brands.

To use the words of her editors, the Gazette continued printing \" at a cost and trouble of which many of our readers have not the least conception; for if they had, there would not be so many who would still withhold what they owe us for our labor.\" ","    The war cost the Confederacy a great deal of resources, making simple and everyday items and foodstuffs scarce. The South sent its young men off to fight the North, which meant that they also sent off a majority of their farmers to go fight. Conscription was strict and only a small demographic of men were exempt from service. The Confederacy exempted only those planters owning twenty or more slaves and those that grew food crops only. Planters and the Confederacy could not waste land on cotton. The women and young sons of these soldier-farmers had a hard time bringing in the harvest without the extra labor of fathers and older brothers or sons, so food was scarce. The slaves also found it easier to resist their mistresses or run away with their masters and overseers away at war. Even a number of slaves were drawn away from the fields to fight alongside or serve the Confederate Army. Historian William Blair writes \"large-scale farmers on whom the burden of production now rested felt besieged by their own people, as nonproducers and the poor clamored for regulated prices on foodstuffs and the Confederacy demanded slaves for production and military work.\" The Richmond Bread Riot in 1863, when 68 women were arrested in the Richmond market after causing a ruckus and breaking into shops to steal bread, illustrated these tensions.","    Not only could the Confederacy not produce enough food, but the Union Army also destroyed what little they had when marching through Southern towns. Blair writes of the destruction the Union Army doled out within \"a five-mile radius around Dayton\" in the Shenandoah Valley. Blair states that the Union Army burned and killed \"a total of 2,000 barns filled with wheat, hay, and implements; seventy mills filled with grain; and roughly 4,000 head of livestock.\" This lack of supplies, coupled with the Confederacy continuously printing its own unbacked paper money and raising the inflation rate, effectively crippled the South's economy. Thus when the Gazette asked for repayment, it offered a variety of methods to pay off amassed debts: \"we will take from those in arrears, 1 in specie, 1 bushel of wheat, 1 1/8 bushels of corn, 7 pounds of good bacon or butter, 75 pounds of clean rags, or a half load of wood for each year as may best suit subscribers.\""],"display_date":"April 27, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-27","locations":[{"id":14234,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3930,"title":"Student Withdraws After Beating Slave Girl\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-03","end_date":"1856-05-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            In May 1856, students and faculty at the University of Virginia were consumed by the news that the faculty board forced a student to withdraw after beating a slave child.  The removal of a student from the Academical  Village over a slave whipping was difficult for many to believe since whipping was a common disciplinary action for misbehaving servants.  Confusion mixed with curiosity lingered throughout the grounds.  ","            In late April 1856, W.D. Clarke, a student at the University of Virginia became particularly agitated after seeing a young slave girl chase a flock of pigeons onto the grounds of the University of Virginia.  After chastising and threatening the girl with a whipping, Clarke approached the slave's master to inform him of the child's misconduct, expecting prompt disciplinary action.  To his astonishment, the master chose to disregard the girl's actions and Clarke's anger, telling Clarke to leave the young slave alone and go about his day.  ","            Clarke's anger continued to build until he decided to take matters into his own hands late one evening.  Clarke beckoned the young slave girl to his living quarters and proceeded to discipline the girl himself, beating her until she became unconscious and  bringing her within inches of death.       Clarke's violent behavior angered the University of Virginia community.  Many felt that his actions negatively represented the community of scholars and that his actions should be evaluated by the faculty, a common practice at the University for any dishonorable act.  Clarke went before the faculty board, who reviewed his actions.  On May 3, 1856, the faculty board voted that Clarke's actions were inexcusable, requiring him to withdraw immediately from the University.  ","            Almost one full day later, Clarke responded to the faculty's decision in a letter requesting the board to reconsider its final verdict on his case.  Clarke acknowledged that his actions were dishonorable, however, he also wrote that he could have justified his actions with \"sufficient representation.\"  Days later, the faculty board at the University  of Virginia decided to rescind his withdrawal.  ","            The actions of W.D. Clarke and the response of the University of Virginia were particularly characteristic of the accepted social behavior of the slave South during the mid-nineteenth century.  A racially tense white society regularly scrutinized the behavior of slaves<strong>.  </strong>Masters would routinely discipline slaves who acted inappropriately.   Furthermore, it is also important to recognize the social implications that would result from disciplining a slave owned by another master during the nineteenth century.  It was considered illegal to discipline another master's slaves because slaves were the master's private property.    Clarke's defiant and violent behavior toward the young slave girl and the University's response exemplified the gravity of such actions in areas where slavery was a significant aspect of society.

Ford realized early that his company was in for a tough battle.  As a captain in the cavalry of the Confederate States Army, he worried about the lack of leadership in his unit.  After all, Colonel Price, the only man who seemed to know how to \"form a line of battle,\" was fighting on the other side of the state.  As Ford glanced across Spring  River, which was the only thing separating Ford's army from General Sigel's Federal troops, he was mesmerized: \"I could not help admiring for their beautiful movements in their formation line of battle.\"   He knew his men had a small chance of winning the skirmish, but they had no choice.  Suddenly, gunfire erupted.  The battle of Carthage had begun.","    The battle raged on for hours.  It was a back and forth affair, as each side would rally after what seemed like defeat.  Desperate for a victory, Captain Hiram, a colleague of Ford's, commanded the Confederate soldiers to throw anything they could at General Sigel's men.  The cavalry threw rocks and pieces of iron.  Soon, General Sigel began to retreat from the constant bombardment.  Before long, Ford and the cavalry had pushed him back ten miles from Carthage, sealing the Confederate victory.  After the battle, Sigel, reflecting on the battle, applauded the efforts of the Confederate cavalry: \"if [I] had such men in [my] command...[I] would not be afraid to charge hell and capture the devil.\"","    While the determination and drive of the Missouri soldiers threw General Sigel off guard, their resolve is not surprising.  The Kansas-Missouri conflict served as a prelude to the Civil War.  Each state dealt with raids and guerilla warfare on a consistent basis beginning in 1854, so the two states were in the midst of the conflict when the War Between the States broke out.  When the war officially started, Lincoln's top priority was to try and secure the loyalty of the Border   States.  While Lincoln was able to attract Kansas to the Union cause, Missouri, a slave state, sympathized with the Southern plight and, while it never seceded, did favor the Confederacy.  This division between Kansas and Missouri only reinforced the hostility.  For the soldiers in Captain Ford's company, they not only saw Federal troops before them - they saw Kansas, the neighbors they hated the most.  This hatred led each side to fight harder than they might have had there been no rivalry prior to the war.  Their border war manifested itself in the Civil War.  Missouri became a symbol for the way the rest of the South should fight as their sacrifice and passion would set the standard for the rest of the Confederacy during the Civil War.

He focused his attention on an innocent black woman who seemed out of place in the area.  After questioning the \"suspicious\" woman, Policeman Saunders decided to arrest her.  The woman resisted the seemingly unwarranted arrest and the result was bloodshed.  The police officer brutally beat the woman over the head numerous times with his billet.  As news of the savage beating spread throughout Charlottesville, individuals of the black community banded together, demanding that the officer be tried for excessive and unjust force.   The demands of justice by the black community were ignored by the white politicians and the police officer went unpunished.  ","            Black inferiority was an uncontested aspect of the South during late 1800s.  The failure of Reconstruction allowed blatant racism to become an accepted part of the Southern states.   Whites often used violence to instill fear in the minds of black Southerners in an attempt to regain the level of control which they had prior to the Civil War.  This rampant violence and widespread fear shaped and defined the relationships between blacks and whites during the late nineteenth century.   To remedy this overt discrimination in the Southern states, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which made it illegal to discriminate against blacks by assigning them an inferior legal and economic status.  Approximately two years later the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, guaranteeing \"equal protection of the laws\" to every American citizen.   In response to this legislation, however, the Southern states passed a new set of laws that \"permitted local officials to informally discriminate against blacks.\"   The actions of the Southern states following national legislation indicate a desperate effort to retain a position a position of superiority over newly freed black Southerners.  Unfortunately, the desperate attempt to maintain a sense of white supremacy in the South resulted in the disappearance of any form of legal justice in the black community.  The absence of legal action against Policeman Saunders is just one example of the widespread acts of injustice which plagued blacks across the United   States following the abolition of slavery.

He was fortunate to be a part of a soldier exchange that allowed him to return to the North, and when he boarded the steamboat to make the journey home, he was met with a new uniform, a new pair of boots, a bath, and a hot meal.  However, these luxuries were a far cry from the horrors he and the other Union soldiers experienced in the prison camp at Andersonville.  Before arriving at Camp Sumter, Kellogg and the men in his company had been under the care of a group of Confederate soldiers who had been released from a Union prison.  He and his comrades were well fed, and had a distinctly positive view of their pre-Andersonville captors.  He noted that the southerners were \"a gentlemanly set of fellows, and treated the northern soldier with some consideration.\"  The men were able to procure rations and other pleasure items from southern citizens through purchase and trade, and enjoyed a fairly comfortable existence.  "," The time before they reached Andersonville set the men up for a great shock, however, as conditions at the prison worsened daily.  When the men arrived, the sight of other prisoners foretold the fate awaiting them.  As one former prisoner said of his first sight of the camp, \"The uncheerful sight, near the gate, of a pile of ghastly dead - the eyes of whom shone with a stony glitter, the faces black with a smoky grime, and pinched with pain and hunger, the long, matted hair and almost fleshless frame swarming with lice - gave us some idea that a like fate awaited us on the inside.\"  Sadly, this soldier could not have been more right."," The prisoners were not provided with shelter, and were only given very meager rations.  No cooking utensils were provided, nor was there any wood for burning fires to cook their food.  The only water for the entire camp was located at the center of the compound, and was also used as an outdoor latrine, which laid the foundation for countless diseases to fester and grow.  Also, a death line was drawn around the camp, and any prisoners who crossed this line were shot immediately.  Many times, the guards would shoot for no apparent reason, leading to the death of a number of innocent men.  One confederate guard appealed to the president of the Confederate States, Jefferson Davis, to stop the violence.  He wrote, \"They think killing of a yankee will make them great men, they shoot prisoners, alleging they crossed the dead line.  I know you are opposed to such measures, and I make this statement to you to be a soldier, a statesman, and a Christian.\""," In 1864, the death tolls at Camp  Sumter were astonishing.  In the month of August, one in eleven prisoners died.  In September and November, one in three died, and in October, a shocking fifty percent of the prisoners at Andersonville passed away.  By the end of 1864, almost 14,000 of the supposed 33,000 prisoners held at Camp  Sumter had fallen victim to the horrible conditions they lived in.  Conditions in Union prisons were much the same, and by the end of the war, some 56,000 prisoners had lost their lives to disease and starvation.

Mullen of the Boycott Committee of the Knights of Labor. This statement expresses the significant influence the Knights of Labor had achieved in the areas of labor relations and social reform by the end of the 1880s. The organization, noted for its official motto, \"that is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all,\" was established on January 1, 1869 as a secret society in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Knights of Labor prided themselves on establishing a diverse and integrated membership that was committed to the preservation of working-class rights.  ","Before the industrial influence of the Knights of Labor can be explained, it is important to first understand the underlying premise of the boycott staged against the Haxall-Crenshaw Company. Due to racism still evident throughout the Reconstruction Era, black prison populations had vastly expanded in size. State governments attempted to capitalize on this situation by instituting a system of convict labor. Historian Edward Ayers describes the structure of the state prison labor system, stating, \"for a small fee, a railroad builder, a planter, or a mine owner could use the labor of state convicts with little financial risk and with no labor troubles.\" In Richmond, the Haxall-Crenshaw Company used convict laborers to produce the barrels that contained company products. The Knights of Labor, dedicated to free labor and economic justice, believed convict labor competition infringed upon the rights of the free working class. In order to counteract this practice, the Richmond Knights of Labor devised a boycott, one that was ultimately successful.","The founding principle of the Knights of Labor is nowhere more evident than in the surviving papers of William H. Mullen. Commissioned as \"Organizer\" for the Richmond District Assembly, or \"DA 84,\" on November 28, 1885, he was authorized by decree from the General Master Workman (T.V. Towderly). Historian Peter J. Rachleff described Mullen's immediate impact on the city of Richmond when he noted Mullen's order of \"a boycott of the products of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, which packaged these products in convict-made barrels.\" This boycott, instituted in order to protect the interests of black coopers in the Richmond area, was sanctioned through Mullen's power to \"exercise all the authority conferred upon him by the Constitution, Laws, and Usages of the Order.\" Mullen's papers documented the Richmond District Assembly's creation on January 1, 1878, and the continual desire to protect rights of the working class from corporate abuse through the five principles of \"JUSTICE, WISDOM, TRUTH, INDUSTRY, and ECONOMY.\" Thus, the boycott of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company was an opportunity to stimulate social change through non-violent means, drawing upon the strength of an integrated and unified working class.","Perhaps it was the Knights of Labor's superior efficiency in mobilization that led directly to industrial reform in Richmond. Under General Master Workman T.V. Towderly, the labor organization rose to prominence in the 1880s, becoming, as Craig Phelan observes, \"the most significant and ambitious labor organization of the Gilded Age.\" In a document describing the \"Great Seal of Knighthood,\" found among Mullen's papers, the Knights of Labor were instructed to \"hear both sides, then judge.\" Through the work of Chairman William H. Mullen, the Richmond Knights of Labor were able to preside over the \"public court of labor\" on behalf of their working class constituency.

Such a complete picture of small-town Southern life is hard to come upon in the modern day, especially considering historian Robert Oliver's assertion that \"many Southern women abruptly stopped writing in their journals and diaries when the [Civil] war ended.\" Nevertheless, Emmala Reed's journal touched upon an extraordinary amount of subject matter, specifically the dire economic situation of her town, health and familial issues, her own failing relationship with a Confederate surgeon, and the progress of relations between blacks and whites in the Anderson area. In so doing, Reed contributed wholeheartedly to a living history of South Carolina; as Civil War author Jacqueline Campbell puts it, women like Reed \"assum[ed] active, and vocal, roles in the creation of historical memory.\"","    Among Reed's entries, the scene that occurred on June 8, 1865, is particularly interesting; so too are the ideas that it suggests on the state of race relations in South Carolina and elsewhere in the South immediately following the War Between the States. It is an extreme exaggeration to suggest that relations between southern whites and newly freed blacks were anything but hostile in the early Reconstruction period; even so, the events that Emmala Reed witnessed on the night of June 8, 1865, call into serious doubt the extent of amicable relations <em>whatsoever</em> between blacks and whites. Reed's journal entry certainly proves this, for she observed the frightening picture of \"an innocent, peaceable negro all thought, taken from his frightened wife, taken out, his house searched, and (then) he was shot and left lying in the street the next morning.\" All this occurred due to the vengeance of a lynch mob operating in the town of Anderson, yet according to a traumatized Reed, \"no [citizen] knows who perpetrated the dark deed - nor for what reason - all excitement.\" Such occurrences of racism were not only common during early Reconstruction, but would also continue to appear for quite some time in South Carolina and across the South, proving that many whites in the region remained \"strongly committed to white supremacy.\"","     Reconstruction in South Carolina and in the rest of the former Confederacy was meant to turn the tides of racism and inequality that had been entrenched in the region for nearly two hundred years. In the long run, this racism would die out. Nevertheless, early Reconstruction strayed far from its purpose, a tolerance and freedom meant to apply to <em>two</em> races for the first time. More accurately, early Reconstruction efforts led to a southern culture of racial despair and hostility, one considered by Emmala Reed to be \"a horrible, disorganized state of society.\""],"display_date":"June 8, 1865","search_date":"1865-06-08","locations":[{"id":11429,"lat":34.519117434,"lng":-82.637883414,"zoom":9,"place":"ANDERSON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3995,"title":" This Sin Polluted Earth\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-03","end_date":"1857-01-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            On January 3, 1857 cries of pain echoed throughout the plantation.  The crack of the whip onto bare skin had an unmistakable sound.  All those who witnessed the brutal whipping cringed with each crack.  The slave's back was already covered with old scars; some several years old and some only days old.  Mary Boyden became used to seeing her father discipline unruly slaves, but this time she became disgusted with his behavior.","            Before Mary went to sleep on the night of January 3, 1857, she wrote in her diary as she did every night.   Normally, Mary would write about the weather and the people she had met throughout the day.  This entry, however, had a particularly different focus. Mary began this entry with the thought, \"another day has dawned upon this sin polluted earth,\" followed by an emotional, detailed description of the brutal whipping of a slave that she had witnessed early in the day.  Her father, an overtly bigoted, violent man, had senselessly beaten a slave in an attempt to solidify his superiority over the less-than-human slaves who worked on the plantation.  His futile actions had disgusted Mary, a religious adolescent girl who tended to sympathize with the slaves that her family had owned.  Mary had developed a substantial internal conflict between her personal ideals and the beliefs encouraged by her Southern Baptist religion. ","            Mary wrote about her personal hatred and disgust with the Southern culture, which heavily revolved around slavery.  She did not agree with the idea of slavery and wrote, \"white folks will have to pay for making slaves of the black folks, in the insurrection.\"  Mary no longer wanted to experience the routine whippings of the slaves, whom she had developed close relationships with.  She longed for a way to remove herself from the life that her family was so deeply imbedded in.   ","            Conflict between religion and slavery was not an uncommon dilemma in the slave South during the years immediately preceding the American Civil War.  Many deeply religious slave owners were even troubled by their own involvement with slavery.  Some slave owners who were particularly religious considered the institution of slavery to be evil and were often convinced that they would be going to hell.  However, Southern Christian churches often supported the idea of slavery.   Religious communities considered the institution slavery in terms of its social, political, and economic consequences as well as in terms of its ethical implications.  The majority of the religious communities, however, feared that emancipation would lead to devastating effects.   Slave owners used the views of their churches as a foundation to rationalize or justify their own involvement in slavery.  As a result, many slave owners considered slavery an economic and political issue that was beyond their control and ignored the ethical issues surrounding the institution.  Mary Boyden embodied this internal conflict which existed between her own ethical beliefs, her religion, and her family's use of slaves to bring in revenue.  This conflict proved to be a crucial weakness for many southerners fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War.

It quickly became fashionable to defend one's honor by dueling because it \"constituted not merely a pseudo-aristocratic affectation, but the most rationalized manifestation of a set of values.\" Southern politicians, like Governor William Smith, made use of this tactic whenever aggravated by insult or slander. ","As time went on, Southern honor culture increasingly came into conflict with the law. For obvious reasons, killing a man for his opinions was illegal. Thus, by the end of the Civil War the number of duels had significantly diminished.

Although some freedmen demanded land rights from their masters as payment for their labor during slavery, most focused on reuniting their families, educating themselves, and establishing a black community.

For three days, violence ruled the city as roaming mobs murdered, robbed, and burned throughout the Black Quarter.

Roughly fifty blacks were murdered outright and scores more were wounded. Burned to the ground were nearly 100 private homes, 12 churches, and 4 schools. The riots shocked the North and resulting Radical Republican outrage led to congressional investigations and a tightening of federal military occupation of the conquered South.","    It would take weeks before the exact details of the Memphis riots were known. The Freedmen's Bureau of Tennessee conducted an investigation and released a report on May 22. The report was a compilation and summary of a number of affidavits obtained from witnesses and participants in the riots. It was determined that the general cause of the riots was racial tension between blacks and poor whites-- particularly between poor whites and blacks who had served in the Union army. More importantly, \"There was an especial hatred among the city police for the Colored Soldiers, who were stationed here for a long time and had recently been discharged.\" The city police were at the core of much of the rioting, often leading the mobs.","    The rioting began during a confrontation between policemen and black veterans. Attempting to arrest a black for disorderly conduct, some blacks reportedly fired their pistols into the air. Perceiving themselves to be under attack, the police fired into th e crowd. The situation rapidly worsened as city officials dispatched the police into the streets and white citizens were asked to assist in a search for weapons. City Recorder John Creighton delivered an inflammatory speech and demanded \"That everyone of the citizens should get arms, organize, and go through the Negro districts.\" The resulting butchery saw policemen directing white mobs into black homes-- indiscriminate murder of women and children, raping, burning, and robbery ensued.

Its commander, General George Stoneman would later testify before Congress and defend his inaction by saying he wanted to defer to the local authorities. However, in the case of the Memphis riots, local authorities were the very root of the problem. Much of the violence was conducted by local officials and police officers. Ultimately, the black community in Memphis had nowhere to look for protection and federal aid was needed to stop the rampaging population.

Asst. Comr. Michael Walsh, a member of the Bureau of Refugees, Freedman, and Abandoned Lands, wrote a letter to his superiors discussing a recent riot in Pulaski, Tennessee. Walsh traveled to Tennessee on January the Ninth to investigate the riot, murder, and wounding of several men. He ultimately concluded that on January 7, 1868 a group of white men, formal Members of the Ku Klux Klan, set out on a mission to locate and harm Calvin Carter, a col'd (colored) man. ","            The whole dispute was instigated by a comment from Carter. In the presence of Whitlock Fields, Carter stated that if Lucy Reynolds, who he referred to as a \"colored strumpet\", goes to Lamberth's anymore he would whip her. Reynolds, who frequented Lamberths' at unseasonable hours, told Calvin Lamberth of what Carter said. Lamberth, a white man, grew angry about this decree and stated that he would hunt and kill Carter on sight. ","            In a few initial attempts Lamberth and a few friends were unsuccessful in tracking down Carter or in carrying out their acts. At about 1:30 PM Calvin Carter, who was unprovoked, shot at Whitlock Fields twice as he warned Carter of the men's search. Immediately following this action a group of 18 white men entered John Carter's Grocery. The eight Negroes in the store were unprepared for this 'organized well matured drill' and they huddled in a corner following the advice of a Mr. Malone. This trapped the black men and the white group charged firing into the huddled assemblage of men.","            The attack killed Orange Rhodes, Calvin Carter was supposedly killed, and a few other men were injured some severely and others slightly; in fact the report also accounts for Calvin Carter as slightly injured. Taken into custody, the white men were placed under bonds of 1500 while awaiting their appearance before a criminal court. Michael Walsh concluded that these eighteen White men had been prepared for this action. He claimed, \"There is reason to believe and circumstances & affidavits warrant the belief that such organization is in existence & that is called the Ku Klux Klan...The parties, numbers, & instituting of such clan is not yet definitely known, but sufficient of the clan and its intentions is known...\"","            This event is just one example of many riots during Reconstruction. This riot references the formation of the white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan; interestingly the Klan calls its official home Pulaski, Tennessee. Kwando Mbiassi Kinshasa points out that the Klan was produced in a time period in which lawlessness ruled the South; he also cited a historian as writing, \"Southerner could scarcely be expected to repudiate cheerfully the doctrines for which they had fought and died.\" This principle is an example of the founding ideology from which the KKK formed. Some members of the Klan believed their purpose was to form a 'vigilance committee to patrol black communities and reduce if not eliminate depredations.' The Klan believed blackness was a 'monolithic non-varying entity that needed to be contained, controlled or destroyed.' James L. Payne commented on the existence of racial tension between blacks and whites for over a century now as a motivating factor for riots; In fact for many years following the war black lynching, murders, and massacres were common in the South.

The Commission focused on the details of Union soldier's imprisonment during their service. The soldiers gave testimony as to their experience as a prisoner of war. The compilation of accounts details the suffering and privations of different soldiers both commissioned and non-commissioned officers. ","            Private Joseph Grider was sworn in and examined in Virginia by the Commission. He detailed his survival from both the Libby and Danville Prisons operated by the Confederate States of America. The main discussion elaborated on the health of Private Grider and the conditions in which he was held. Grider detailed the rations allotted to himself and his fellow prisoners of war; the main storyline revolved around the bread ration, a staple in the diet of Civil War soldiers. The bread was rough with whole grains; when he was moved to Danville he received black bread made of cane seed. Grider discussed the deterioration of his health as a result of the food rations and inadequate housing. The prisoners suffered from diarrhea and other ailments. One other area of interest from Grider's testimony involves the severity of punishment enforced by the Confederate guards; during his stay at Danville seven men were shot for out the window. Other punishments involved the holding of men in chambers until they 'fouled on the floor.'","            Another testimony from Private Robert Morrison detailed the differences between Richmond, Pemberton, and Danville Confederate Prisons. Similar to Grider, he discussed the loss of personal items and the deprivation of clean and warm shelter during his early experiences in the prisons. The deprivation of healthy and clean food was another problem for Private Morrison. He noted the decline in his health as coinciding with his entrance into the prisoner of war encampments. Prior to his capture he did not have problems with diarrhea or fever; sickness did not take hold upon Morrison until he began eating the rations given to him by Confederate guards. Unlike Grider's testimony, Morrison detailed his final living quarters as warm, spacey with endless amounts of food and also access to a 'privy.' ","            The similarities between these two privates testimony is parallel when it comes to their experiences with food rationing. In many instances they expressed their opinion that it was contaminated or perhaps undercooked. Private Morrison stated, \"I got a chunk of corn bread daily...sometimes it was about half baked.\"  Dr. Joseph Jones, a witness in trial against Henry Wirz, 'formerly the commandant of the interior of the Confederate States military prison at Andersonville', shared this hypothesis stating, \"As far as my experience extends, no person who had been reared on wheat bread, and who was held in captivity for any length of time, could retain his health and escape either scurvy or diarrhea, if confined to the Confederate ration (issued to the soldier in the field and hospital) of unbolted corn meal and bacon.\" ","            Interestingly enough, Confederate law decreed that all prisoners should have access to the same privilege and food rations as the Confederate Soldiers; this act was acknowledged by General Robert E. Lee himself in a letter to a relative stating, \"The laws of the Confederate Congress and the orders of the War Department directed that the rations furnished prisoners of war should be the same in quantity and quality as those furnished enlisted men in the army of the Confederacy, and that the hospitals for prisoners should be placed on the same footing as other Confederate States hospitals in all respects.\" Whether this was an act of forbearance or an act of compassion it is easy to see, Union soldier in Confederate prisons suffered through disease and desperation similarly. Although this was an act in effect, prisons in the South failed to comply with all its' standards and requirements. William Best Hesseltine pointed out that the closing of the summer of 1863 brought about the halt of a cartel in which prisoners from both sides of the war were exchanged; this halt increased the number of mouths to feed and also the growing debt of the Confederacy. Prisoners in southern camps suffered the consequences of this halt.

A summary of the Lincoln Assassination case in the New York Times on July, 21 1865 proves that Fort Jefferson, the Dry Tortugas would be home to several of the Lincoln conspirators.  ","Ponce de Leon made a discovery in 1513 that would later serve as home to a group of men connected to the assassination of an American President.  The island chain would later receive the name of the \"Dry Tortugas\", each word in reference to an identifying feature of the islands as noted by early explorers.  The \"dry\" depicts the lack of a fresh water source on the islands, an essential piece of information that sailors relied upon.  \"Tortugas\" was a maritime term for sea turtles, and these creatures also happened to be the main source of meat for anyone inhabiting the islands; such as the crew of the HMS Tyger did in 1742 after they were shipwrecked and stranded for 55 days.  The extreme isolation of the Dry Tortugas along with its strategic location, not unlike that of Gibraltar, made them the target for a US Fort that would serve to protect shipping lanes and carry out the Monroe doctrine.","Construction of Fort Jefferson began in 1846 and was never completed.  The massive structure covered 11 acres of land on Garden Key, the only island in the Dry Tortugas suitable to serve host to the large mason building.  The American Civil War caused Fort Jefferson to double as a military prison and housed several hundred inmates in the second story gun casemates.  ","In April, 1865 John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Lincoln and fled Ford's Theatre.  After breaking a leg, he sought medical attention from Dr. Samuel Mudd, a prior acquaintance, and proceeded to dodge the authorities for several more days before being shot.  Dr. Samuel Mudd, Edmund Spangler, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlin were all sentenced to life in prison for their alleged roles in the assassination of President Lincoln.  Following their sentencing, the Lincoln conspirators departed in July, 1865 for Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas.  ","In the fall of 1867 several cases of Yellow Fever broke out amongst the troops garrisoned at Fort Jefferson and by mid-September an epidemic gripped the fort.  After the medical officer passed away, Dr. Mudd volunteered his services which saved many of the soldier's lives.  More extraordinary was the fact that Dr. Mudd himself had Yellow Fever and he continued to labor through the disease.   Despite Dr. Mudd's best efforts, his comrade in chains Michael O'Laughlin passed away from the epidemic along with a handful of soldiers.  The NCOs of Fort Jefferson wrote President Johnson a letter praising Dr. Mudd's heroic medical feats despite being a prisoner.  ","As a result of the letter that President Johnson received from Fort Jefferson he granted a pardon to Dr. Mudd on February 8th, 1869 and subsequently pardoned Samuel Arnold and Edmund Spangler on March 1st, 1869.  The strategic value of Fort Jefferson waned throughout the later part of the 19th century until being abandoned in 1874; but the strategic value of Fort Jefferson and the Dry Tortugas caused the fort to be re-activated and armed during the World Wars.  Today the Dry Tortugas are a National Park and Fort Jefferson continues to hold the record as the largest mason structure in the western hemisphere."],"display_date":"April 14, 1865 - March 21, 1869","search_date":"1867-04-02","locations":[{"id":1428,"lat":26.6841881812,"lng":-82.0889710874,"zoom":7,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4292,"title":"A Seemingly Normal Day for President James Garfield\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-07-02","end_date":"1881-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["1 Gearing up for the 4th of July President James Garfield's itinerary for the weekend is printed in the Washington Post this morning.

The President's train will depart from the Baltimore and Potomac Depot at 9:30 A.M. this morning. ","            Garfield was originally elected to the House of Representatives as a Republican from the state of Ohio.  He immediately distinguished himself as a very competent and likable person.  His tendency to try to please everyone helped him win the Republican Presidential nomination in 1880 but would eventually hinder him during his presidency.  ","            2 On the morning of July 2, 1881 President Garfield made his way to his executive train car in the Baltimore and Potomac Depot. On the way he was shot twice from behind by Charles J, Guiteau.  Garfield would later become ill from infection and eventually died two months later on September 19, 1881.  Garfield's Vice President, Chester A. Arthur, was sworn into office the next day.  Garfield had only been in office for four months before he was mortally wounded.  Only William Henry Harrison had a shorter term in office. "," 3Ironically the most lasting legacy of James Garfield is the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883 which passed 3 years after his death.  The civil service reform movement capitalized on the assassination by a \"deranged office seeker\" by blaming the spoils system for Garfield's death.  The Pendleton Act has had a significant effect on the civil services in the United   States.  It forced presidents to make appointments based on merit instead of patronage.  This helped eliminate corrupt practices inherent in the spoils system and also made the civil services more efficient because the new appointments were better educated and more experienced.

The result was the needless deaths of thousands of men on both sides due to malnourishment, lack of medical care, and abuse by prison guards.  But one set of prisoners fared slightly better than the other.","In a documented 1876 interview, Dr. R. Randolph Stevenson spoke of a provision in the Confederate Constitution for captured Union soldiers. The provision says, \"and the rations furnished for prisoners of war shall be the same in quantity and quality as those furnished to enlisted men in the army of the Confederacy.\"  Union prisons did not uphold such guarantees.  Many Confederate prisoners were denied basic needs by a nation with all kinds of resources.  The Confederacy on the other hand even went so far as to sell valuable supplies in order to feed and care for captured Union soldiers.","Indeed, many surgeons commented on the poor health of returned rebel soldiers. Those diseased souls spoke of abuse and neglect at the hands of their captors.  It was not uncommon for prisoner trade barges to contain the bodies of dead and dying persons.  Some prisoners spoke of being placed in prisons where disease like Small Pox ran rampant and medical aid was denied. Such accounts were collected and published after the war by historians.  Such stories seem at odds with the fact that the Union had funds available to improve the health and well being of captured rebels.","The Confederacy, on the other hand, made sure it upheld its belief in equal treatment of captured soldiers.  When money became scarce within the Confederate prison system, cotton and tobacco were sold to provide additional funding. When disease began to ravage prisoners, Confederate officers tried to barter with Union commanders for medical supplies, only to be rebuffed.  Accounts of favorable treatment and hospitality by Confederate prisons came from men like Mr. John F. Frost of Folgers Company 19th Maine.","In some circumstances, Union soldiers were held prisoners inside hospitals, while Confederate troops were held in makeshift camps.  The unequal treatment of captured soldiers by the two sides stands in contrast to the readily accepted notion that Union soldiers were treated much worse than Confederate troops.  This is perhaps the belief because of northern propaganda like \"Report 67.\" A renamed Congressional report on Confederate prisons based on conditions of soldiers and not on testimonials of POWs.   However, the truth is eventually revealed, and the light shone on the misdeeds of others.

On November 23, 1860, the Richmond Daily Dispatch reported an account from the New York Journal of Commerce about the manufacturing and selling of \"Arms to the South.\" Before directly quoting the New York Journal of Commerce, the Richmond editor mentioned that the makers and sellers of arms were perhaps the only ones \"gathering any advantage from the present crisis.\"  According to the New York account, a firm in New York received anywhere from twenty to fifty orders for arms from South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama daily. The writer for the New York Journal of Commerce also mentioned that while those who did not know better might call the South's credit and financial dependability into question, the South actually concludes all business transactions with cash within thirty days. Adding significance to this article, the writer noted that all the orders came from Southern states, but \"but mainly from those in which secession is regarded as the only remedy for Southern grievances.\"","    The author of this article refers to the \"Colt's revolvers and rifles [sold] to Georgia,\" the arms for \"1,800 men…sent to Savannah,\" and the order of one thousand \"death-dealing weapons\" for Alabama. The New York Journal of Commerce ended this article with another seemingly biased statement that, \"the wholesale houses and agencies in the city [New York City] have been hard pressed to supply the orders for every imaginable species of weapons.\" These figures seem slanted towards Unionist and Northern sentiments, but perhaps these astronomical figures and seemingly exaggerated sentiments by Northerners were not as far-fetched as they first appear. ","    At the onset of the Civil War, the South struggled to provide adequate arms for Confederate troops. Records exist, however, of these several thousand modern small arms that were shipped to the Southern states and that were provided by Northern industries pre-Civil War. When these supplies were cut off at the start of the Civil War by orders of the U.S. government, smaller Confederate states began to produce and manufacture small arms, but they never were able to catch up with the production by the Northern states. It was at this point that the Confederacy turned to Caleb House in Europe in 1861 and 1862 for their weaponry and supplies. Despite the constant gaining and losing of arms in various battles during the Civil War, at the end of the war, the Confederacy, provided by Chief of Ordinance Josiah Gorgas, reported that they possessed 1,306 field artillery pieces, 921,441 rounds of artillery ammunition, 323,231 infantry arms, and 72,413,854 small arms cartridges. So, while the North was not the sole provider of the arms for Confederate armies, their early supplying of Confederate weaponry provided the basis for the Southern states to never lack in arms and ammunition, even though the conditions of these Confederacy arms was negotiable.

Nat grew up very religious, and had the ability to read and write. Along with his education, his spirituality gave him a distinct view of the injustices of slavery taking place around him. Turner believed that he could lead a successful revolt, and in February of 1831 he executed his plan. Turner's original plan was to commence the insurrection on July fourth, but his plans abruptly changed due to a lunar eclipse on the 12th of February. \"On the appearance of the sign, I should arise and prepare myself, and slay my enemies with their own weapons.\"  The eclipse was viewed by Turner to be a sign from god telling him to start the rebellion. Nat Turner, accompanied by a few trusted fellow slaves entered their master's house killing the entire family. Their acts were brutal and merciless.  Recollecting the murders, Nat said, \"Will immediately killed Mrs. Turner, with one blow of his axe. I took Mrs. Newsome by the hand, and with the sword I had when I was apprehended, I struck her several blows over the head, but not being able to kill her, as the sword was dull, Will turned around, and discovering it, dispatched her also.\" Turner's rebel force, which amounted to about fifty strong, continued going house to house until White militia ended the insurrection. On the fifth of November Nat underwent a trial.  He was sentenced to death and later hung. Thomas Ruffin Grey was Turner's lawyer, and he published \"The Confessions of Nat Turner\" as a result of his time spent with Turner when he was in jail. ","    In the antebellum South slave rebellions and conspiracies tended to be extinguished, slaves still continued to resist. Nat Turner's rebellion along with many others raised a continuous concern of safety to the whites living in Virginia. Demographically, the slave population in Virginia was continuously growing, with large concentrations of slaves all over the state. Many whites feared that soon African-Americans would outnumber White slaveholders, making it difficult to keep surveillance over such a large population that could easily communicate. Economically, the plantation economy was deteriorating giving rise to more towns and cities. With the growth of towns and cities, economic gain was found in skilled artisanship, leading to the education of slaves in order for them to conduct such activity. Abolitionist pressure from the north also influenced the African-American community through propaganda and preaching by people sympathetic to emancipation. These factors brewed together produced a slave who was educated, in touch with other slaves, and fueled by the ideas of emancipation.

Of the second, Cushman was en route to Nashville, riding on the Hardin Pike, when two Confederate scouts grew suspicious of her and mounted her on horseback to bring back for sentencing.

When the scouts fled to check out the invading troops, Cushman escaped temporarily, only to be recaptured the following day. Her eventual capture while concealing Southern battle plans in her shoes and petticoats placed her in jail. By now, the sickly Cushman was sentenced to hanging upon notice of her recovery.

The night before, he somehow managed to come into the possession of a poison, probably strychnine, and attempted to commit suicide rather than face the hangman's noose. Unfortunately for him, his attempt was thwarted by the efforts of physicians who pumped his stomach and saved his life. ","Gordon's last request was that they cut a lock of his hair and send it to his wife along with a ring he removed from his finger. Gordon was given rather large amounts of whiskey to keep him alive for the execution and so he was not sober when he went to his fate. ","The execution of Gordon was so important a signal of the impending end of the slave trade that the execution was held in an unlikely place – City Prison, New York City – better known as \"The Tombs\". Gordon was the only slave trader ever executed in the United States.

Although it may seem outlandish, the strength of this local legend about the Lafitte brothers, Pierre and Jean, persists to this day. The National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings, as well as The National Historic Landmarks Program, describe the structure on Bourbon Street as being built by the Lafittes between 1772 and 1791. Both sources claim that the brothers used the building to front a blacksmith shop to cover their reprehensible dealings in pirating and slavery."," The cottage at 941 Bourbon Street is a historical building in itself. It is located at the intersection of Bourbon and Saint Philip Street. This section of New Orleans is known as the French Quarter or Vieux Carre. The streets forming the Vieux Carre, or the old square, are the original streets of the city. William C. Davis explains that the names are \"redolent of [the] French and Spanish History.\" Historians acknowledge that this area prospered during the time of the Lafittes. Furthermore, the structure of the cottage is very emblematic of the French Colonial architectural style of the time period. The cottage is constructed with timbers of cypress, soft brick, and plaster. According to the historian Liliane Crete, the fact that the wood is cypress illustrates that \"the lowland of Louisiana was entirely covered with cypresses.\"","While 941 Bourbon Street is important because of its preservation of a historic style and time period, it is the brothers associated with it that solidify its historical importance and legendary quality. Many stories exist that tell of the Lafitte's blacksmith shop located on Bourbon Street and Saint Philip Street and the affairs, adventures, and trials of the brothers. The Lafitte brothers are very important to the history of New Orleans, particularly the slave trade. Many people in Louisiana wanted slaves, but several situations limited the supply, such as the embargo on importation of Africans into the United States. The Lafittes exploited the situation in order to become wealthy by providing slaves through illicit dealings when no one else could. They also became involved in many scandals and political situations.","Although legends, myths and other sources believe that the Lafittes lived or worked in the building, others argue the association. The author Barbara SoRelle Bacot believes, \"[941 Bourbon Street] is romantically known as Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop, but it has nothing to do with Lafitte or any blacksmith.\"  She attributes the association to the nineteenth century writer George Washington Cable. Although it is difficult to find concrete evidence for either side, whether the Lafitte brothers truly built the structure is not what is important. 941 Bourbon Street is enlivened by the local legends of Pierre and Jean Lafitte and in turn has immortalized their legends in the region."],"display_date":"1810 - 1823","search_date":"1816-12-31","locations":[{"id":5594,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4463,"title":"Abolitionist Flogged for Allegedly Selling Pamphlets\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-08-03","end_date":"1833-08-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Amos Dresser, a student at Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, left  the college after a ban on an anti-slavery society and traveled through the upper south  selling bibles. While travelling through Nashville, Tennessee, Dresser took his carriage to a local shop for repairs. A workman rummaging through the carriage found a store of anti-slavery letters, books and pamphlets. According to Dresser, \"This added considerably to the general excitement, which I afterwards learned, was prevailing in relation to slavery--and in a short time it was noised about that I had been 'circulating incendiary periodicals among the free colored people, and trying to excite the slaves to insurrection.'\"","            On the evening of August 8, Constable John Braughton brought Dresser into custody where an impromptu Committee of Vigilance convened at the courthouse to try Dresser for violating the non-existent law of possessing anti-slavery material. During the convention, the committee resolved unanimously to search Dresser's trunk, finding antislavery publications. Dresser stated \"These, I informed the Committee, I had put in my trunk for my own perusal, as I wished to compare what had been written with the result of my own observation while in the slave states, and that no individual had seen them besides myself.\" After the reading of the letters, Dresser claims that \"Great stress was laid on these extracts, and I was questioned very minutely...\" and that \"They labored much to prove I was sent out by some society, and that I was, under the guise of a religious mission, performing the odious office of an insurrectionary agent.\"","            When the committee withdrew to deliberate on the case, Dresser recalled having no anxiety: \"There was no law forbidding what I had done...my intentions had been those of kindness to all--I had no secret feelings of guilt, arraigning me before the bar of my conscience, for any mean or clandestine movement.\" After reaching a decision, the committee found Dresser guilty of being a member of an anti-slavery society and of possessing periodicals published by the American Anti-Slavery Society. He was sentenced to twenty public lashes and ordered to leave Nashville within twenty-four hours. The punishment was carried out in front of a large crowd and Dresser was escorted out of town that night.","            Dresser gave an accurate account of his lashings and exile from Nashville is very accurate. Thomas Wood of the Nashville Post published an article on Dresser and confirmed much of his account, except for one key element: Wood says that Dresser intended to sell antislavery pamphlets through the South, not bibles. Dressers account of his trial and punishment is well supported.

It is the realization that this is not a plot line for a fictional soap opera, but a real account that occurred in the Lower East Side of New York City in 1897. Martin Thorn and William Guidensuppe were both competing for the love of Mrs. Nack. When the barber, Thorn, discovered the encounters of Nack and Guidensuppe he was overcome with jealousy and killed Guidensuppe with Nack's help. The role that gender plays into this murder is not unusual when the urban circumstance is considered because the strict limitations placed on individuals by their close proximity to others.  When people are placed closer together there is more violence between males because they are hoping to establish a sense of dominance not only in the community, but also to protect their resources.  In this situation it could be argued that Thorn saw Guidensuppe as a threat to his relationships and his territory. Furthermore, it is the role that geography played out in development and resolution of this crime that is truly unique.","While the actual murder occurred in the Woodside community in Long Island, the body was purposely cut into pieces and hidden around New York so that the authorities would not be able to identify the victim, Guidensuppe. Two children from the Lower East Side found one part of the body when they were playing along the East River. They discovered only the torso and arms, while they discovered that the rest of the body was missing. The lower half of Guidenssupe's trunk was found in the northern part of the city by the Washington Bridge, and eventually the legs were found in a Navy-Yard in Brooklyn. The deliberate placement of the body pieces shows that Thorn and Nack's perceptions of communities within the city and the constraint that it places on the citizens was too strong to extend beyond the neighborhoods they lived in. The Chicago School of sociologists would argue that this had a huge impact on their decision to carry out the murder in such a unique way because they theorize that environmental characteristics like density, housing types, land use, social heterogeneity define the social constraints of an individual. If we hold this theory to be true it is understandable why Thorn and Nack would have thought this was the perfect crime because the threesome lived in a close proximity despite the size of the city: Guidensuppe worked for a Turkish bath on West Forty-Second Street and Mrs. Nack lived on near by on Ninth Avenue.","Location, however, was not a limiting factor and this was due mostly to the influence of the media.  As the men who found the remains at the Washington Bridge location recognized the unique packaging as a result of reading about the Lower East Side reports of a mutilated body being found in similar packaging. This is explained by the sociodemographic theory in which social interactions with neighbors are based in differential access to resources that allow people to deal with their social environment, and the paper being a constant resource in New York City these various enclaves were drawn together rather than being kept separate. This murder also showed the role of national media and its growth in this period as this article about the Guidensuppe murder was found in the Chicago Tribune. The editor and founder of the Chicago Tribune, Joseph Medill, was known for publishing sensational stories in hopes of gaining readers. This story certainly fits the bill with its articulate and vivid language like, \"body shockingly mutilated.\" While the motives of Medill were most likely profit driven to publish this piece it gives New York City a sense of legitimacy as their news was being published in other cities, and also gives rise to the spread of information around the country.  "," "," "],"display_date":"June 25, 1897 - November 8, 1897","search_date":"1897-09-01","locations":[{"id":8931,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":70,"tag":"Geography"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4523,"title":"Burnside Rationalizes his moves at Fredericksburg","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-12-17","end_date":"1862-12-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["General Ambrose E. Burnside, the newly appointed Commander of the Army of the Potomac, was regarded by General O. O. Howard as distrusting himself with the position, but was eventually persuaded to accept it. Along with the position came the responsibility for a plan of action that would differ from the failed plans of General George B. McLellan.  It turned out that Burnside's plan of campaign was sufficient on paper, but, as the after action report of Fredericksburg shows, the execution of the plan shattered Burnside's hopes for success. ","                As noted by Howard, Burnside planned to move small numbers of his army as McLellan had planned toward Chester Gap and Culpepper, but to use these marches as a feint to the Confederates so that he could move the majority of his army to Falmouth and cross the Rappahannock to Fredericksburg and gain control of Marye's Heights for future movements.   This plan required the repair of the railroad and delivery of pontoon bridges to the crossing very quickly, which was left in the hands of General Halleck in Washington. The element of surprise was a key for the success of this plan. ","                Burnside's plan did not turn out the way that he had hoped as shown in the after action report. He commented that he moved sooner than he had told the President, Secretary, and General Halleck. The reason he gave for this was that he had seen that the enemy had moved his forces down the river and he hoped by having a \"vigorous attack\" across the river at Fredericksburg that he could separate the troops of the Confederates which would cause them to violate one of the well-known rules of war: never divide your troops in the face of a superior enemy. Burnside and his army were unfortunately unable to accomplish this due to the \"fog and unexpected and unavoidable delay in building the bridges.\" This gave General Lee enough time to assemble his troops at Marye's Heights to defend against Union attacks and ruin the element of surprise Burnside needed. ","                Burnside admitted in his report that he and the army had failed, but had a few things been different, such as the pontoon bridges arriving on time, they might have won a victory for the Union. He reported on the over 10,000 casualties in the battle, but said that he was \"glad to represent the army at the present time in good condition\" which seem to contradict each other. Burnside expressed sympathy for those killed and praised the braveness of those who fought in the battle. The sentiment in the after action report was that Burnside knew he had acted hastily at the wrong time and was willing to take the blame for the loss, and it felt like he knew he would be demoted after this defeat because he thanked the government for their support and confidence almost as a farewell."],"display_date":"December 17, 1862","search_date":"1862-12-17","locations":[{"id":14293,"lat":38.1882210605,"lng":-77.65248979,"zoom":9,"place":"SPOTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4548,"title":"Creek Trouble With Americanization","course_id":21,"status":"P","start_date":"1797-01-01","end_date":"1797-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A letter from Tennessee Governor John Sevier from 1797 emphasizes the tension between the Cherokee nation and white settlers.

","            The Cherokees were very protective of their tribal lands, and after the murder of their tribe members, they did not hesitate to react.  Native American tribes of the south had \"understood frontier violence to be an integral and healthy part of their relationship with whites\" (Saunt, 1999).  This caused problems, because the tribe did not file complaints into the courts.  Sevier writes, \"None of your people sent me any information.\"   The Cherokees were unaccustomed to American ideas of justice and did not have faith in the judicial system.  Nor did they have their own official judicial system.  \"Creeks did not have a centralized means of enforcing conformity\" (Saunt, 1999).  For this reason, some members had killed those believed to be guilty of the crime.","            The Americans can be seen as drastically trying to change the minds of the Cherokees.  First, they are violently resolving disputes on the frontier.  If they are not violently forcing assimilation on the Cherokees, they are trying to do so by making them accept American cultural ideas such as property and common law.

","In the letter Stouffer writes that he did not know what to do when he heard of the assassination.  He tells his sisters to stay strong back home, and reminds them that it was God's will for him to go.  It seems as though Stouffer is trying to find a reason or explanation for Lincoln's death to deal with the mourning he is going through.  Stouffer also describes the town of Poughkeepsie, which most likely had a similar atmosphere as many northern towns at the time of Lincoln's assassination.  He wrote that nearly everyone wore black and white badges, and that the streets were filled with crape.  He also noted that flags were flown at half mast, and were trimmed in black.  Stouffer continues to give advice to his sisters in the letter, reminding them that no one knows when the son of God is coming back, hinting that they could die unexpectedly just as Lincoln had.  He states, \"God was ready to give him,\" referring to Lincolns untimely death.  Stouffer finished the letter catching up on things like the news of his sister's new colt, the feelings of his uncle, and other small talk that would be discussed in a family letter.","Northern whites were not the only group of Americans to mourn Lincoln's assassination.  Recently freed blacks saw Lincoln as their savior from slavery.

He went as far as writing that some blacks had felt that Booth had \"crucified their Lord.\"  Blacks in both the North and the South recognized that they had lost a leader that did invaluable things for them, and they mourned his death accordingly.","Although there was an intense mourning of Lincoln's death, not everyone in the country felt remorse over the assassination.  Many southerners saw Lincoln as the cause for their most of their problems, and blamed him for the war and extreme destruction of their land and livelihoods.

Leading up to the riot, there had been a rivalry between the English actor Edward Macready and the American actor Edwin Forrest.   Baker wrote that this rivalry began when Forrest believed that Macready sabotaged his recent tour of England.  The nativist trend in the United States at the time did not help Macready's popularity in New York as most of Forrest's fans were poor working class citizens.  \"The quarrel, then, waxed warmer and warmer, until it has ended in a fearful riot, in which thousands of excited people engaged, incurring a serious loss of life.\"  The May 10 riot was the second time that theatergoers tried to force Macready from the stage.  Historian Bill Kauffman writes that on May 7 they had succeeded by throwing anything possible onto the stage including vegetables and chairs.  Afterwards leading New York citizens apologized to Macready and convinced him to stay and perform Macbeth again on May 10 by promising such an incidence would not occur again. Meanwhile, Forrest's fans circulated handbills asking if Americans or English should rule the city.  In response to threat of violence a large number of policemen were stationed at the theater for the performance.      ","  Starting around 6:30 PM and continuing throughout the performance a crowd began gathering outside the theater.  The performance started off calm enough, but erupted into violence after police arrested four audience members and confined them in a small room.  The arrested men attempted to set the room on fire so were placed in irons.   When news of the arrests spread the mob gathered outside exploded.  The police were soon overwhelmed by the mob so the military was called in.  A cavalry company arrived, but was also driven off.  Then the National Guard came and was attacked by the mob, but eventually was able to force their way to the theater.   The soldiers fired over the mob's heads after the captain was struck down with a large stone.  When this did not stop the mob from attacking, the soldiers then fired three rounds of ball cartridges dispersing the crowd.  More troops were called in and two artillery pieces were loaded with grape shot directly in front of Aster Place Theater.  By 11:30 pm the crowd had dispersed, carrying off the dead and wounded.   ","Both Baker and Kauffman agree that twenty-two rioters were killed instantly and more soon died from their wounds. Baker goes on to say that this riot sent shock waves through New York's upper class.  Hardly any of them believed that shooting was necessary to save Macready or Astor Place from destruction.

He was no doubt relieved to have escaped a lynching.","Some lynching victims could be castrated, mutilated, or even killed. Aiken knew he was lucky to escape this fate, even if he meant no harm chasing Sallie. Many people thought that the main reason why lynchings took place was because black men raped white women. According to historian Leon Litwack, though, “of nearly three thousand blacks known to have been lynched between 1899 and 1918, only some nineteen percent were accused of rape.” Some mobs lynched blacks for stealing shoes, calling white girls on the phone and annoying them, or even just for running past a white girl and accidentally brushing up against her. “A South Carolina editor acknowledged in 1917 that some three-fourths of lynching was for ‘trivial offenses,’ and sometimes entirely innocent men were ‘butchered,’” Litwack observed.","All the violence between whites and blacks continued due the need of blacks to have self control over their own lives and the need whites had to control blacks. According to historian Jacqueline Jones, “white men’s persistent violation of black women constituted a more common phenomenon that served as a backdrop for periodic lynchings throughout the South, especially during the years of 1890 to 1910.” It was fine for the white man to attack a black woman, but was wrong for a black man to attack a white woman. Blacks were scared to walk by whites, thinking they could be attacked or lynched just for looking at them wrong. Whites were scared for their families just as blacks were scared for theirs. White men had to constantly reaffirm their sense of racial superiority and their manhood. The mutilation and castration of lynching victims brought into explicit focus the tangle of “hate and guilt and sex and fear” that enmeshed all southerners well into the twentieth century, wrote Jones. White men lynched blacks due to the control they had at the time, but those lynchings only caused hatred to build up more and more in society."],"display_date":"August 1, 1896","search_date":"1896-08-01","locations":[{"id":1823,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}],"course":{"name":"African-American History from 1863 to the Present","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":31,"school_id":9}},{"id":4778,"title":"Union Private Describes Raiders at Andersonville Prison","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-04-08","end_date":"1864-04-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1864, Robert Knox Sneden, a Union private and mapmaker, lived as a prisoner in the notorious Andersonville Prison. During his stay, Sneden kept a diary of the conditions and daily monotony of the captives. Occasionally he gave up trying to write a daily account and would lump his entries together by the week as he did from April 8 to 20, in 1864. This particular week, Sneden talked about a group of Union criminals within the prison known as “The Raiders.”","Andersonville was a Confederate prison that was originally designed in early 1864 to hold 10,000 Union prisoners of war. By April, the prison population had reached its capacity and continued to increase until August. Prisoners suffered from terrible burdens caused by overcrowding. These problems included unsanitary living conditions, an insufficient amount of Confederate supplies, and disease. Along with these horrible living conditions, prisoners also had to deal with the threat of being mugged and killed by these thieves.","Sneden first encountered the Raiders in April when one of his fellow prisoners was killed. On a foggy night, the group killed a prisoner with pine clubs and subsequently robbed him of his overcoat and money. Due to the fog, the Raiders were able to escape undercover. The scoundrels kept together and continued to steal from prisoners on foggy nights."," Sneden described the Raiders as a desperate set of thieves and murderers from the Belle Island prison camp located west of Richmond, Virginia in the James River. Most of them were from the slums of the cities and originally served time in prison before they listed in the Union army. Sneden expressed discontentment in saying “…no one’s life is safe among us as long as these Raiders have their own way.” To help each other fight, members lived in groups. Sneden added that “They are given a ‘wide berth’ and no right minded prisoner will venture into their quarters knowingly, as he is sure to be robbed of everything he has if he does.”"," To counter the Raiders, prisoners organized a police force known as “The Regulators.” This group of fifty or more of the largest and strongest men used club force to keep Raiders from attacking. Twenty of the men were to move about the camp during the day while twenty-five stood at important points at night to head off and club Raiders. A certain portion of each man’s ration was to be allotted to these men in order to keep them in shape for fighting. The chief of the Regulators, “Big Pete,” was to decide the cases among prisoners and lash them with the cat-o-nine-tails when they were found guilty."],"display_date":"April 8, 1864 - April 20, 1864","search_date":"1864-04-14","locations":[{"id":2222,"lat":32.0447139452,"lng":-84.1951910375,"zoom":10,"place":"SUMTER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4972,"title":"Shelbyville Affects the Letter From An Everyday Soldier","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-06-27","end_date":"1863-06-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Matt Turner was an assistant surgeon caught in battle at Shelbyville with a little time to write his mother.  The letter thought brief gave a great account to the attack that occurred in Tennessee from the 24<sup>th</sup> to the 28<sup>th</sup> of June in 1863.  Turner gave the account of his army “falling back” and being “flanked” by the enemy, the hospital he feared would soon fall and the rest of the unit be captured shortly after.  They were looking ahead to an encounter at Tullahoma.  He informed his mother that he remained in good health, but the action will hinder his ability to accept letters so she is to wait to reply until she hears from him again.","The charge at Shelbyville was during the spring/early summer of 1863 when an offensive was led against the Confederate army under General Braxton Bragg.  On the 27<sup>th</sup>, the day of Turner’s letter, a charge was led to the center of Shelbyville and this caused the Confederates to retreat.  The leader of the charge for the Union, Captain Charles C.

Free Ballots! Free Schools! The Pledges of Wade Hampton, Democratic Candidate for Governor, To the Colored People of South Carolina.”  The pamphlet included letters and excerpts from Hampton’s campaign speeches, purportedly revealing his concern for racial equality and concern for the needs of black South Carolinians.  The pamphlet also included a letter from one of Hampton’s former slaves pledging to vote for him, remembrances of his peaceful and harmonious relationship with the slaves on his Mississippi farm.

However, the entire purpose of the campaign was the re-assertion of white Southern control over the state, and under his leadership, the Democratic campaign was marked by violence and hatred.  In one example, conflict in Ellenton led to the killing of at least 30 black South Carolinians.

Perdue provided his view of the importance of slave narratives in his book “Weevils in the Wheat: interviews with Virginia ex-slaves” when he said “Though most historians have not utilized the ex-slave interviews in the past, there is a growing realization that prior histories have been one-sided on the subject of slavery and that the slaves’ view of the institution is essential to round out the picture\".  The first-hand account of the period is invaluable to historians and students alike and he further explained, “the ex-slave interviews provide us with insights into Afro-American culture that are not obtainable from other sources”.  Stories like Walter Calloway’s must continue to be shared and studied to shed further light on their troubles and the tribulations they worked to overcome.","Walter’s narrative not only described the horrible mistreatment of slaves, but the lack of the value of African-American lives during the nineteenth century.  They were purchased as commodities and forced to work hard labor as young as ten years old.  Although Walter and his mother and brother were able to stay together, this was often not the case and most families were separated and spread throughout the country."," "],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":300,"lat":32.2508016784,"lng":-86.1660804753,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5127,"title":"<strong>Crime and Instant Punishment in Gold Rush California</strong>","course_id":48,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-03-08","end_date":"1851-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In California there was lots of gold to be had, but not everyone would strike it rich.  While early gold rush merchants Stephen Chapin David and his older brother Josiah ran their store near the mining camps in 1851, they were surrounded by all sorts of people.  In close quarters you could not always trust the people around you.  Stephen recounted upon his return from the city in March 1851, that one of their boarders had all his money stolen from beneath his pillow.  In a show of unity amongst the miners, they attempted to seek out the culprit.  Once a suspicious man was apprehended, they threatened to lynch him.  With no proof, the miners let the man go, and he soon moved on from the camp.  A man caught stealing a pitchfork from the store was almost hung but eventually was let go and run out of town.  In April of 1951, a man accused of stealing ran into a drug store and drank a two ounce bottle of laudanum, in fear of his impending trial.  He was immediately given an emetic and recovered: the belief was that the justice you received was given to you, not chosen yourself.  Crime was everywhere and needed to be dealt with immediately as to hinder any thoughts that one could easily get away with this type of behavior.","Though harsh punishments were not always implemented, vigilante justice still had its place in gold rush society.  Leonard L.

On October 19, 1932, Second Lieutenant Ralph Hurst wrote to his commanding officer Brigadier General J.C. Parsons about the “Communist Agitation” in Birmingham. The International Labor Defense had recently moved its Southern headquarters to Birmingham and there had been trouble ever since. According to Hurst, the police had originally arrested communist agents and disbanded their meetings. During one of their raids, they found correspondence that indicating that the communists in Birmingham had been “instructed to concentrate on Negroes in the South.” The communist agents had held two meetings that Blacks and Whites attended.  According to Hurst, Communists advocated social and political equality between the races and adopted resolutions calling for “abolition of poll taxes, enfranchisement of every resident without respect to color or other qualifications” and urged both black and white families to go out and take what they needed. Communists also took aim at capitalists who “exploited whites against blacks and vice versa.” The infamous Ku Klux Klan broke up the second of these meetings with “malodorous bombs” and announced that “The Klan Rides Again” and would “stamp out” communism. Hurst concluded his letter by telling Parsons that the communists were “playing a shrewd game of capitalizing on unemployment and adverse conditions” to gain supporters. He warned that unless relief facilities are sent “there is a likelihood of some disorders and attendant violence.”","Hurst proved to be correct. Anti-communist violence began to increase around this period and lasted until the end of the decade. Historian Robin Kelley attributes the rise in violence to the fact that communists promoted equality between the races. According to Kelley, anti-communists used racism to fight against and hinder the communist cause. White-supremacy groups, like the Ku Klux Klan and White Legion, and racist politicians played on the Southern fears of racial equality to ostracize communists. Another historian, Robert Ingalls takes a different perspective on the issue. Ingalls believes that the most important factor in anti-communist violence was the big businesses that economically dominated Birmingham. Ingalls focuses on the Tennessee Iron, Coal and Railroad Company (TCI). By the end of the 1930s, the La Follette Senate Committee found enough evidence to show that TCI had been sponsoring violence against communists. For Ingalls, the real cause of the violence was “establishment attitudes towards labor” that kept the elite in power. From Hurst’s letter, it seems that both factors, racism and big business capitalism, were at work to limit the communists’ acceptance in Birmingham."," "],"display_date":"October 19, 1932","search_date":"1932-10-19","locations":[{"id":24062,"lat":32.2202206971,"lng":-86.2076124057,"zoom":9,"place":"Montgomery, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5271,"title":"Black Family Challenges Racial Barriers in Suburb","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/57","end_date":"8/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On August 13, 1957, Daisy and Bill Myers moved their family to a well-developed suburb in Levittown, Pennsylvania.  They were just like every other eager newcomer to arrive in Levittown, except that they were black.  As news of this Levittown “first” quickly spread, so did the curiosity.  Drivers continuously circled the house in their automobiles, trying to catch a glimpse of the first African American residents of Levittown.  Other interested citizens gathered near the house to share in their disbelief.  Only hours after the family moved in, violence erupted in the traditionally quiet community.  This “Levittown Incident” was documented in a <em>New York Times</em> article from August 25, 1957, revealing the racism that plagued this sprawling suburban community.  A mere two days after the family had started preparing the house for the move, an angry crowd of 200 residents formed outside the home.  Demonstrators hurled stones at the house, shattering two panes of the picture window.  Police arrived on the scene to break up the crowd.  As Levittown historian David Kushner noted, “It was the first time in twenty-nine years a sheriff had been called in to restore order. But order wouldn’t come easily.”  More disapproving Levittowners returned to the Myers house the next evening.  In fact, as the <em>New York Times</em> reported, “Demonstrations continued almost nightly.”  Time and again, police arrived at the scene to suppress riots.  With the police protecting the house, “An uneasy peace descended on the neighborhood.”  However, the bitter reality of Northern racism remained.","With their innovative mass-production techniques, the housing developer Levitt & Sons helped alleviate the post-World War II housing crisis.  Despite the promise of affordable housing for all Americans, the company excluded blacks from their communities.  “This pattern of racial exclusion was set in 1947,” wrote historian Alexander O. Boulton.  However, William Levitt defended his company’s continued support of racial covenants.  As cited by historian Joshua Ruff, Levitt declared, “‘We can solve a housing problem, or we can try to solve a racial problem. But we cannot combine the two.’”  Thus, Levittown, Pennsylvania remained an all-white community.  “I have come to know that if we sell one house to a Negro family, then 90 to 95 percent of our white customers will not buy into the community. That is their attitude, not ours,” remarked Levitt in the <em>New York Times</em>.  However, as pointed out in the newspaper, “the builders had no say over the resale of houses.”  This is where the Myers family entered the picture.","In August 1957, a tight-knit, pleasant community became the scene of vicious uprisings.  The riots highlighted the bitter racial tensions of the time and revealed the legitimacy of Levitt’s concerns; Levittowners were not ready to welcome blacks into their community.  As noted by Kushner, Daisy Myers remembered picking up the little culprit that broke her window.  “‘The rock, weighing less than an ounce,’ as Daisy put it, ‘carried tons of hatred with it.’”  Such hatred rocked the town for weeks."],"display_date":"August 1957","search_date":"1957-08-16","locations":[{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5272,"title":"Whites Riot in Response to Arrival of First African American Family in Levittown, PA","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/57","end_date":"8/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Upon driving up to their new home at 43 Deepgreen Lane, Daisy Myers was filled with doubt, recalling that she repeatedly asked herself, “what would be the extent of our ostracism? Would we be able to sleep comfortably?” as she studied the four law officers standing on the lawn of her address in the Dogwood Hollow Section of Levittown. These questions regarding the neighborhood reaction to the arrival of a black family in what had been an intentionally all-white enclave, were unfortunately answered over the next two weeks. At dusk each evening, crowds of people gathered outside the Myer’s home, angrily shouting and jeering, singing the national Anthem, and throwing stones toward the Myer’s home, as apparently these “spacious skies,” they sang of were not meant to be enjoyed in an integrated setting. Levittown police failed to enforce the court ordered protection for the Myers, prohibiting more than three people from assembling near the residence at once. Mobs consequently gathered in this fashion each night, only finally subsiding due to interference from the state police. After an agonizing fourteen days, the riots ended, but the Myers continued to suffer the anxiety of the consequences triggered by the introduction of integration to Levittown. Harassment of the family persisted for almost three months, as Daisy Myers received threatening phone calls of those who “told [her] they threatened to shoot William down on sight,” the family’s deliveries of oil, bread, and milk stopped arriving, and the more than occasional unfriendly white stroller-by forced the Myers to have constant protection, or at the very least, sympathizing company. Anti-segregationist even obtained property immediately neighboring the Myers’ home, using the location to intimidate the family further, evident by their conspicuous display of the confederate flag.","The resistance seen in the August riots against the integration of Levittown, PA was not uncommon throughout suburban neighborhoods. Quite the contrary in fact, racial discrimination and the subsequent segregated communities were the norm in 1950s suburbia. Yet despite this plaguing harassment, the Myers refused to leave their Levittown home, justifiably feeling entitled “to live where [they] chose,” as William put it. Remarking on the family’s incredible determination to outlast their opponents, Dianne Harris, historian and author of <em>Second Suburb: Levittown, PA, </em>stated<em>, </em>“the Myers endured an ordeal that few could have weathered with such dignity, courage, grace, and fortitude.”"," ","This endurance allowed the family to break “the lily-white pattern of Levittown,” as Daisy Myers stated, a pattern that William Levitt had attempted to keep in existence in his planned suburban community. While he did not consider himself to hold racist ideals, Levitt had long refused to sell his homes to African Americans.

Despite faulty and clear mishandling of evidence, as well as forced confessions from many witnesses, Frank was convicted and sentenced to death for the rape and murder of 13 year old Mary Phagan, a young girl that was employed in his factory. However, influenced by his ties to the defense team Governor Slaton commuted the sentence from death to life imprisonment.","This outraged a public, who had become convinced that this man, a convicted murderer in their minds, was escaping justice.

The blame for the massacre originally fell on the Native Americans. <em>The Pittsfield Sun</em>, a Massachusetts newspaper, provided an eyewitness account to the horrific crime and indicted the Mormons as the actual instigators. The men accused of the crime were Isaac Hight, John D. Lee, and John Higbee. The horrific massacre in Mountain Meadows displayed tensions that were present between the territory of Utah and the federal government of the United States.","The United States acquired Utah as a territory after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. Prior to the acquisition, Utah had been governed by members of the Mormon Church. Throughout the 1850s, distrust towards Mormons and their practice of polygamy intensified within the federal government. Historian Kenneth M. Stampp stated “Northerners and Southerners, whether Democrats, Republicans, or Americans, could unite wholeheartedly in condemning it.” The impending threat of federal government intervention created wartime hysteria for the Mormons in Utah.","The Mountain Meadows massacre exemplified how far the Mormons were willing to go in order to protect freedoms that they believed the federal government threatened. The emigrants engaged in a conflict with the Native Americans and then were received by the Mormon militia, who they thought had arrived to give aid to them. They followed the advice of the Mormons and gave up their goods to the Indians and marched to Cedar City with the militia. The group never made it to Cedar City; the Native Americans attacked the defenseless emigrants by order of the militia. The massacre resulted in the death of around 120 men, women, and children. <em>The Pittsfield Sun</em> claimed that the Massacre occurred due to the wealth that the emigrant party had and the desire of the Mormons to gain it. Historians have since argued that the true reason for the massacre was to protect Mormon religion.","<em> The Pittsfield Sun</em>, located in Massachusetts, certainly held some type of prejudice against the Mormons, as did the majority of U.S. citizens at that time. However, regardless of bias, the end result of the massacre remained the same, it resulted in a tremendous loss of human life with little provocation. The United States’ relationship with its territories during the 1850s was a time of high tensions and mistrust. The fragmented federal government in the late 1850s could not respond appropriately to the massacre due to the internal tensions between the North and South and a long-standing mistrust of the Mormons. Therefore, justice was never fully received for the victims of the massacre. John Lee was the only Mormon charged for the crime and he received execution by a firing squad at the location where the massacre took place. The Mormons felt justified in defending their religion and the safe haven that they established for themselves in Utah from government interference and a hostile U.S. populace."," "],"display_date":"September 7, 1856 - September 11, 1856","search_date":"1856-09-09","locations":[{"id":13381,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"IRON, Utah"}],"tags":[{"id":1094,"tag":"Church/Religious Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5327,"title":"Freedmen Massacred at Opelousas","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-09-28","end_date":"1868-09-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Opelousas massacre occurred in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, on September 28, 1868. It centered around Emerson Bentley, a white editor for a local newspaper called <em>The Landry Progress </em>and an influential schoolteacher who promoted the education of black children. Bentley wrote an article that local members of the Seymour Knights, a branch unit of the white supremacist group The Knights of the White Camellia, deemed offensive. The backlash to the article led three men to take the attempt to intimidate and severely cane Bentley, causing him to flee St. Landry. Local blacks were told that Bentley had been murdered and banded together to retaliate. While marching towards Opelousas with arms in hand, efforts were made to inform the freedmen that Bentley had not been murdered but escaped; causing some of the men to retreat, while others continued to march.","The freedmen were met by armed whites determined to defend their town. Shooting occurred by both sides and twenty-nine black prisoners were captured. On September 29, all of the captured prisoners, with the exception of two men, were taken from the prison and executed. The violence at Opelousas continued for weeks to come. The death toll of the massacre resulted in some controversy. Three white Radical Republicans and two Democrats were killed in the assault. Republicans stated that around 200-300 blacks where killed whereas the Democrats denied this claim as fraudulent and stated that only twenty-five to thirty were killed. Historians today have deduced that the Republicans were more correct in their number range.","The Freedman’s Bureau ordered Lieutenant Lee to investigate the atmosphere of Opelousas. In an article written on October 8, Lee described the cause of the riot and the death count. He gave a low estimate in regards to the number of blacks killed, stating that only five died, but expressed his opinion that the death toll would increase due to blacks being unwilling to give up their arms to whites. Ultimately, Lee was positive in his reports, he believed that peace had been restored overall and stated, “no further trouble is apprehended.”","The end of the Civil War resulted in widespread violence in the South due to racial and political tensions. A majority of newly freed African Americans strongly supported the Republican Party, angering prominent southern Democrats. The inability to accept racial equality led to the growth of white supremacist groups, the most noteworthy being the Ku Klux Klan. White radicals sought to silence African Americans and those who supported them through various scare tactics and physical violence, such was the case at Opelousas.","Historian Carolyn DeLatte argued that the white Southerners acted in the same manner that they had for many years. This time, however, “the vengeance visited upon the Negroe population was greater, as blacks were no longer protected by any consideration of their monetary value.” The riot echoed its influence in the political as well as social arena, where whites bounded together to protect their rights from black infringement, and blacks stepped away from their right to vote in order to evade persecution."],"display_date":"September 28, 1868 - September 29, 1868","search_date":"1868-09-28","locations":[{"id":5698,"lat":30.5481655437,"lng":-92.2423441161,"zoom":8,"place":"ST LANDRY, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5349,"title":"Freedmen and Republicans Murdered in New Orleans","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-07-30","end_date":"1866-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The New Orleans Riot occurred on July 30, 1866 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Whites instigated the riot and targeted freedmen. However, this riot was different from those of its time because it centered primarily on disagreements regarding Reconstruction policies. Radical Republicans were unhappy with former Confederates gaining power and influence under Governor Wells. Wells himself eventually noticed the power shift and became uncomfortable with it as well. In 1866 the legislature of Louisiana called new elections, allowing for a former Confederate mayor to regain his title. The state legislature overturned Wells’ veto. As a result, Wells gave his support to a Radical plan to reassemble the constitutional convention that occurred in 1864. The Radical plan would grant power to blacks, prevent former Confederates from voting, and lay the foundation for a modified state government for Louisiana.","Those opposed to the idea of Louisiana becoming a “revolutionized” state, the city police force of New Orleans, which was comprised of Confederate veterans, was supposed to maintain order during the convention but supported the opponents of Radicals. On July 30, twenty-five delegates and 200 black supporters, consisting primarily of former veterans, convened in New Orleans. When the two sides met, fighting broke out followed by gunshots. The delegates took cover in the convention hall. Those who tried to escape were immediately shot, the white flags they held in their hands as a sign of surrender were ignored. The total death toll consisted of thirty-four blacks and three white Radicals to be killed. Around 100 people were injured in the riot.","The <em>New York Times</em> described the event as a dispute between angry radicals and thugs, the police force, describing them as, “unprincipled scoundrels, thirsting for blood, whose every moral sensibility had been blunted by lives of desperados, were maddened to informal rage by injudicious harangues from men who follow in the stormy wake of Sumner and Stevens.” Republicans reported that the death toll was around 200 men, a fact in which the article questioned.  The Military Commission went  in to investigate the riot and the <em>Times </em>argued that the instigators would be deemed guilty due to the close allegiance that members of the Commission had with the Radicals.","Historian Eric Foner argued the significance of the New Orleans riot, stating, that it completely took away any hope of Presidential Reconstruction in Louisiana. Supposedly, before the riot occurred, the local military commander stationed at New Orleans warned the President of the violence that would occur if the convention happened. Johnson did not adequately prepare for the violence or take the warning to heart. Foner summed up the New Orleans Riot, stating, “But the stark fact remained that nearly all the victims had been blacks and convention delegates, and that the police, far from preserving order, had joined in the assault.”"],"display_date":"July 30, 1866","search_date":"1866-07-30","locations":[{"id":5599,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5350,"title":"Attorney General William on Enforcement Acts","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-04-02","end_date":"1875-04-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Colfax massacre of 1872, believed to be the most devastating occurrence of racial violence during Reconstruction, resulted in the death of around 150 freedmen at the hands of white supremacists. The events at Colfax resulted in only three men to convicted. However, disagreement led to the case entering the Supreme Court in the form of <em>United States v. Cruikshank </em>in 1876. The case brought in to question the constitutionality of the Enforcement Acts. It questioned if the federal government had the jurisdiction to enforce these acts on the state level.","The Enforcement Acts were issued in 1870 and 1871; they sought to prevent intimidation of voters and discrimination based on one’s skin color. The Acts also issued specific crimes committed by the Ku Klux Klan as federal offenses and those who committed them would be punished based on federal standards. Many white Southerners believed the Enforcement Acts were a violation of State’s rights. During the <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank </em>Supreme Court case, Attorney General Williams argued that the Enforcement Acts were necessary to protect the right to vote for African Americans. Williams argued that government could not exist without votes from its citizens, and as citizens, African Americans deserve the opportunity to cast their vote. He stated, “If Congress has no power to protect the voters, then the White League of Louisiana, a minority of the people, can stand around the polls and prevent the majority from voting.”","The results of <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank</em> were devastating for those in support of the Enforcement Act. The men were charged with using their power to halt African Americans from voting. However, the government did not charge them with using race as a motive in the massacre. The error in wording resulted in the three men to going free, leaving no one held responsible for the horrific massacre against the freedmen.","The Court went further to state that the federal government only had the right to prohibit the violations of black rights in states only, they did not hold the power for punishing criminal acts committed by individuals, the state and local authority held this right. Historian Eric Foner commented, “In the name of federalism, the decision rendered national prosecution of crimes committed against blacks virtually impossible, and gave a green light to acts of terror where local officials either could not or would not enforce the law.” The devastating result of <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank</em>, allowed acts of violence against freedmen and republicans to escalate in the following years because of the inability of the federal government to try individuals."],"display_date":"April 2, 1875","search_date":"1875-04-02","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5353,"title":"A Soldier Complains of the Army Life","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-02-16","end_date":"1863-02-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 16, 1863, a Union soldier from Huntingdon County Pennsylvania wrote home to describe the war as he saw it.  “Here we are yet stuck in the mud, crushing the rebellion, over the left, and enjoying our hard tack as usual.”  The soldier described the boring life that the Army of the Potomac went through as they were in camp.  The man known as “TIMBER DOODLE” in his writings was going through the slow and seemingly endless time spent in an encampment with monotony, unreliable paydays, and no battles to break up the drudgery of camp life.","He wrote about life as he saw it and the embedded sarcasm showed his true feelings about his situation.  The soldier seemed as though he would have welcomed battle just to end the way of life that soldiers endured in camp.  Soldiers often wrote home because of loneliness and even just to kill the time.  It was a way that they could keep their friends and family at home informed about the progress of the war and their feelings towards it.","They not only talked about the war in their letters but also of simple things such as the weather, rumors, accidents, ceremonies, and the tasks that they had to perform everyday.  They would also write about the social change that they witnessed in the areas of the South that they took control of.  The letters also served as their chance to complain about the Union Army and all of the things that they felt were wrong with it.","Many of them used an alias such as TIMBER DOODLE in order to preserve their anonymity.  The letters were important to the soldiers who wrote them and to the folks at home who received them.  In the case of TIMBER DOODLE, his letter was viewed by many of the members of the county because it was posted in the local newspaper.  These letters got at the war through the eyes of the common foot soldier and it is important to see the war from their point of view."],"display_date":"February 16, 1863","search_date":"1863-02-16","locations":[{"id":14302,"lat":38.4358602351,"lng":-77.3635484517,"zoom":9,"place":"STAFFORD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5355,"title":"Copperheads in Illinois Threaten Violence against the Act of Conscription","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-08-31","end_date":"1863-08-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an article from the <em>New York Times</em> on August 31, 1863, it is made evident that the Peace Democrats or Copperheads were not so peaceful.

The Copperheads threatened aggression against both Federal officers and members of the Union military. However, “authorities in this State and Indiana were soon informed of the demonstration and an adequate force to squelch all the traitors was soon at hand.” While the Copperheads then dispersed without any bloodshed, they were said to be bold and swore that a draft would not occur in Edgar County, Illinois.","The term Copperhead was first coined in an article that appeared in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on July 20, 1861.

Among these citizens was a woman by the name Carrie Childers. On September 15, 1863 Carrie Childers of Bolivar, Missouri wrote to Capt. Rowan E. M. Mack in Cassville, Missouri a letter concerning the Rebel activity occurring in her local area. She informs Capt. Mack that guerrillas are razing the homes of the citizens and also committing murders. Her letter to Capt. Rowan E.M. Mack indicates that she knew him personally as later she speaks of her disappointment at his departure for Arkansas. Childers writes (ungrammatically) about the depraved situation and states “I can wright it you may be ashured it is very bad there is a man killed or a House razed evry night by the Rebels.\" Certainly during this time period of the Civil War, the state of Missouri and its citizens were enduring a major battle within its own borders with guerrilla fighters.","     Carrie Childress seems to feel that times will eventually get better although she states even the Union soldiers themselves had to come into the local town to escape the guerrillas. During this period in Missouri, guerrilla soldiers were particularly cruel; they were raping, robbing, beating, and murdering the innocent civilians. Occasionally, they murdered an opposing soldier, scalped him and kept the scalp as a trophy, hanging it off the bridle of their horse. Sights like these would most certainly lead the locals to fear these bands of barbarians. Many of these locals were women who had been left to take care of the home and the children while their husbands were off fighting. Carrie Childress herself praises Capt. Mack for his efforts while away at war, stating “I congratulate you on once more having the opurtunity of invading the Sacred Soil of Arkansas and presume the Rebels will have a hapy time while you are in Arkansas.” The reader assumes that this may be a “while the cat is away, the mice will play” situation for the surrounding area. Without the proper authorities in place to help keep the irregular warfare under control, the situation would have become unbearable for the citizens.","     Michael Fellman, historian of guerrilla warfare in Missouri, reminds his readers that guerrilla warriors were are bands of irregular fighters who have either rallied on their own to form a group or have been fighting separately from any official military association. Guerrilla warfare was a difficult situation in Missouri for the citizens largely due to amount of confusion the guerrillas caused as a result of fighting. Fellman also discusses the conflict the people of Missouri had while trying to cling onto their faith and moral values all while feeling disrespected and violated by the guerrillas and invading armies. There were several major divisions of guerrilla bands that caused such confusion and conflict within these communities. These rebel groups were the raiders, partisans, and bushwhackers. There were also units of Missouri Partisan Rangers formed by the locals to help protect the citizens from the invading Federal troops. Meanwhile the invading Northern troops were also treating the locals savagely and committed horrible crimes, like the massacre at Camp Jackson on May 10,1861 which killed over thirty civilians. There were also Jayhawkers who were guerrillas that were fighting for anti-slavery and also terrorizing the locals in the process. Also many brutal attacks were committed by bands of irregular guerrilla fighters, like the Lawrence Massacre on August 21,1863 led by William Quantrill, which killed close to 200 men and boys, or the Centralia Massacre of September 27,1864, where “Bloody “ Bill Anderson led his band to brutally kill twenty-four unarmed Union soldiers. Reviewing events like these and factoring in all the civil unrest in the area it is not suprising that someone like Carrie Childress would be pleading for hope of a calmer future for her region."," "," "," "],"display_date":"September 15, 1863","search_date":"1863-09-15","locations":[{"id":7847,"lat":37.6164921569,"lng":-93.4005351949,"zoom":9,"place":"POLK, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1232,"tag":"Irregular Warfare"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5397,"title":"Ambush in the Darkness of the Sam Gaty","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-04-04","end_date":"1863-04-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["     April 4<sup>th</sup> 1863 at two in the morning the steamboat Sam Gaty stopped on the Independence River at Sibley and was ambushed by band of bushwhackers, that killed fifteen “contrabands” and two other whites. There was a resentment at the Union for the acceptance of the escaped slaves, whom some had been undertaken as labor to the Union forces. \"Contraband\" described former escaped slaves due to the fact that the Union would not return them to their former masters. One of the main motivators of guerrilla warfare during the Civil War was the issue of slavery. When Lincoln issued his emancipation policy and asked the border states to also end slavery, the possibility of slavery coming to an end provoked extreme frustration in Missouri. As the Federal troops began to enter the Border States they encountered Confederate troops and meet resistance bands of irregular soldiers or guerrillas. There were many different groupings of guerrilla warfare; bushwhacker, jayhawker, and partisan. There was guerrilla warfare taking place on the North and South sides, with this being said, it depended where your loyalties lay whether you were a jayhawker, bushwhacker, or a partisan. Jayhawkers were anti-slavery fighting guerrilla soliders, bushwhackers were bands of irregular fighters who hid in dense locations of vegatation in prepration for ambush, and partisans were calvary soldiers who were smart and performed dashing raids on Union troops. Sometimes the bushwhacker had no loyalties to either the North or South and was committing atrocious acts just to be vindictive. Their basic goals were to cause terror, rape, rob, and vandalize the local communities.","     The Smoky Hill and Republican Union Paper in Junction City, Kansas describes how the bushwhackers were strategic in their attack, taking prisoners by name and even knowing where the seventy-six former slaves were being kept on the boat. The attack was led by guerrilla leader George Todd who served under the well-known William Quantrill. The “assassins” took over the boat and also they robbed the passengers of thousands of dollars of personal belongings and money. They also destroyed government property such as freight and employed some of the passengers to help them. The passengers were willing to help if meant to save their lives. Unfortunately not all the passengers met such a fate. The bushwhackers took the “contrabands”, marched them off the boat and lined them up in a row. The paper describes as these “poor, helpless creatures” were shot and fifteen fell dead. Thirteen former slaves did get did away as the men proceeded to go back to pillaging the Sam Gaty but the paper states that later remainder of the “contraband” was killed by these \"inhuman monsters\". (What the paper fails to state is if there were seventy-six contrabands on the Sam Gaty, and fifteen were killed, why does the Smoky Hill Republican Union only headline that fifteen were killed?)","     In any case the Smoky Hill and Republican Union paper does state that this appalling act was certainly one of the worst and would evoke revenge. This was a savage attack on the people of this steamboat and the Union. These bushwhackers, who generally did not take sides on the war, made a major statement with the assassination of these former slaves with ties to the Union. However their main goal was to cause fear and confusion for the opposing troops, and they accomplished that with their attack of the Sam Gaty. The civil unrest in these communities of border states, especially Missouri, during the Civil War was of a large scale, and caused serious turmoil between neighbors and authorities. According to guerrilla warfare historian, Richard Brownlee, the turmoil was also in regards to Missouri’s frustration at being portrayed to Northerners as potential secessionists and parts on North Missouri the state was in \"near anarchy\" because of the increasing strain of conflict. It was difficult for local and state governments to handle the raging situation with guerrilla warfare. Brownlee notes in certain areas of Missouri that some communities disintegrated entirely due to the violence of guerrilla activity. These bands of irregular fighters were motivated and difficult to control and their reputation outlasts them even today."," "],"display_date":"April 4, 1863","search_date":"1863-04-04","locations":[{"id":7633,"lat":39.0084856397,"lng":-94.3460789427,"zoom":9,"place":"JACKSON, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":1232,"tag":"Irregular Warfare"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5409,"title":"Mr. Guerrilla is Innocence Personified","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-09-06","end_date":"1862-09-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["     On Saturday September 6th 1862 an entertaining article was published in The New South paper in Port Royal regarding the antics of guerrilla warfare. This intriguing article describes the operations of guerrilla fighters during the Civil War. Guerrillas during this period fall into several different categories. Partisan, raiding, and bushwhacking are just several of the main focuses of many historians of Civil War guerrilla warfare. Partisan rangers were brilliant Calvary men with quick wit that conducted raids of Union camps causing the soldiers to stay on alert. Likewise the Raiders were bands that had skirmishes with both civilians and military troops, while the bushwhackers were generally men who conducted raids from heavily covered areas of vegetation. Most bands were irregular fighters, not sanctioned by the government however this separated the partisan rangers because they were under the 1862 Confederate Congress Act. Port Royal’s article of 1862 informs the reader how these guerrilla bands would operate. The witty article focuses on the category of raider bands in general.                ","     In our article we look at “Mr. Jones” and his parish in the state of Louisiana. Our article in the New South states “Mr. Jones is a distinguished man in his local community, well known and well liked. He will use his personality to influence the men in parish to follow his lead and rebel against the incoming opposing troops.” From here the influenced party will organize into a small band of fighters, numbering around thirty to fifty-five, into gathering together their local supplies, such as rifles, shotguns, and mounting their horses, riding out to hide in bushes and woods in anticipation of the skirmish to come. They will lie in wait to ambush or sometimes secretly raid the military camps by night. They engage many times in fierce skirmishes with the enemy. If the opposing troops can pursue, they are sent on roundabout chase. These chases usually end up with the guerrilla stashing away the clues to his antics, where then “Mr. Guerrilla” is found sitting on his piazza, philosophically smoking the pipe of peace, with the appearance of innocence personified.”","      In many of the more dangerous raids, there were numerous civilian murders, rape, terrorizing of the locals, and robbery. In any category, guerrilla soldiers were masters of disguise, sometimes dressing in stolen Union soldiers uniforms or women’s clothing to fool the enemy. This led to much confusion as to who they were. In Missouri, bushwhackers were specifically adapted to inducing a state of confusion and the civilians could not tell if they were Confederates or Federals committing such horrible crimes. These guerrilla fighters, regardless of the region of country they were located in, felt justified by fighting by any means necessary for what they regarded as important. Guerrilla warfare historian, Michael Fellman, states that “in such a war, for guerrillas, terror was both a method and a goal.” In the case of “Mr. Jones” and most of the Confederates, they focused on Lincoln and the Northern aggression. Fellman adds that guerrillas demolished homes, supplies, morale, and lives of the citizens around them. There was a danger associated with guerrilla warfare that affected these local American populations that sadly today is overlooked for what is considered mainstream Civil War battles."],"display_date":"September 6, 1862","search_date":"1862-09-06","locations":[{"id":11447,"lat":32.4068445137,"lng":-80.4452215468,"zoom":8,"place":"BEAUFORT, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1232,"tag":"Irregular Warfare"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5454,"title":"<strong>When Will It Ever Change?</strong>","course_id":86,"status":"P","start_date":"7/11/30","end_date":"7/11/30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["News stories relating ‘death by accident,’ ‘murder by one of own’ or even an ‘unsolved mystery’ are just too far-fetched to explain the discovery of so many ‘Negro’ bodies found in the swamps or in uninhabited places in 1930.  It is inconceivable to think that the white tyrannical press believe that we are fooled by their fabrications about the missing southern ‘Negro’ workers,” as reported in <em>The New York Times</em>. “This inhumanity against the ‘blacks’ must be stopped.  It is the twentieth century!  It is simply ridiculous to think that in this modern age, these atrocious mob killings are continuing to occur.” Outraged reactions of shock and frustration burst from the members of the <em>American ‘Negro’</em> <em>Labor Congress</em> <em>(ANLC). </em>Therefore, with a passionate fervour, the commitment to continue to seek out new strategies to eliminate these acts of violence are renewed as well as plans being made to quickly implement the new approaches through publicity campaigns and press releases.","These statements of disbelief from the <em>ANLC</em> were published in the <em>New York Times</em> on July 11, 1930 as a response to the eighteen African Americans who had been lynched in the first seven months of 1930.  This appalling statistic made it very obvious that the primary goal of eradicating the practice of lynching needed to be their top priority, especially when combined with the eleven African Americans who had been lynched in 1929. Unfortunately, in spite of the three attempts for an anti-lynching bill that successfully passed through the House of Representatives, it continued to fail in the Senate. Lynching was protected under the Constitution as it protected the right of local government to control crime thus giving them freedom from interference or scrutiny.","The early twentieth century was the era of ‘The Declaration of Principles,’ a call to “restoring to ‘blacks’ the right to vote, an end to racial segregation, and complete equality in economic and educational opportunity”  created under the leadership of W.E.B. Du Bois, being adopted in 1905. Yet, as African Americans began to show assertiveness and independence, racial tensions were amplified and whites reacted in violence, in order to maintain their white supremacy.  Horrifically, more than 5,000 African Americans were lynched by white mobs between 1882 and 1932, with the express purpose being to “terrify ‘Negroes’ as to dissuade them from ever asserting themselves or their rights.” Incredibly, the lack of concern over the murder of thousands of African Americans was because whites believed that their lives were cheap and “inherently and permanently inferior,” to the point of being as low in value as animals. In fact, lynchings were committed by respected and regular citizens and celebrated as social events attended by families. The real horror about this period in American history is that, regrettably, racism would continue to raise its ugly head for three more decades before many of the African Americans dreams for true freedom and equality would begin to be realized through the crusades led by Martin Luther King, Jr.  <br /><br />"],"display_date":"July 11, 1930","search_date":"1930-07-11","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"}],"course":{"name":"US History since the Civil War","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":86,"school_id":28}},{"id":5611,"title":"Jefferson Davis Responds to the Gibson County Massacre","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-09-02","end_date":"1874-09-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 2, 1874 former President of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, delivered a speech in Memphis, Tennessee denouncing a massacre of sixteen black men a week prior in Trenton, TN.

One of those masters was Mr. Lovejoy, who was a printer. While returning from an errand to the \"Missouri Republican\" to pick up type, William was attacked by several slave-holders sons. He could not make his escape, being heavily outnumbered and carrying the substantial type, so William fought back. He was able to make his retreat, but the sons of slave-holders took the type. William informed Mr. Lovejoy about the incident, and Lovejoy was able to return with the type. However, he did inform William that Samuel McKinney said he would whip him because he had hurt his son. McKinney was true to his word, finding William on the street and striking him over the head five or six times with a large cane. It took William five weeks to be able to walk again.","In Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul</em>, it is the idea of “whiteness”, the principle of being a true white Southern male, it was necessary to be able to keep slaves in their place. It was the idea of proving how white someone was by how they treated blacks, by either being a slave-holder, becoming a slave-holder or seeking vengeance on a black, treating them as less than human. That was the kind of act McKinney was displaying. The purpose behind finding William again, with the express intention of hurting him, was because William had attacked his son. That was how McKinney perceived the event.","For McKinney the beating was about protecting his white, slave-holding honor. A slave had stepped out of place by hurting his son. It was not important that his son had started the confrontation; it was about how William defended himself. His actions were about protecting the southern hierarchy, the hierarchy on which everything depends. An idea put forth by Saidiya V. Hartman in <em>Scenes of Subjection</em>, the exercise of power by the slave-holders upon the slaves was as important as having a legal title to the slave property. For all slave-holders, it was essential to keep control over the enslaved population because the entire economy was based on that hold. Slaves provided the labor that kept the plantations in business, negating the cost of labor. The planters were able to then invest the funds saved back into the plantation for more land and more slaves. For Southerners, slaves were important for their economic value, and created a cycle where Southerners felt they could not function without slaves. That cycle needed to be protected with violence as a way to maintain control over the labor force.","In William Wells Brown’s life this was one of the few instances where he was personally subjected to the cruelty of the Southern white male. He was personally targeted with the purpose of causing him lasting, physical pain because of his actions, required actions, against a white slave-holding son. As explained in the context of both Johnson and Hartman, McKinney’s actions were intended to prove his “whiteness” and as a symbol of power and control that all slave-holders have over all slaves.

Groesbeck of Ohio took the floor to argue in support of the recent capture of filibusterer, General William Walker. The speech served as a rebuttal to objections raised by Representative Keitt of South Carolina and Representative Stephens of Georgia.","Representatives Keitt and Stephens argued that the seizure of Walker and his company from Nicaragua was illegal. For these two Congressmen, the United States had violated jurisdiction zones established by the “law of 1818” during Walker’s seizure. In defense of the US forces that captured Walker, Representative Groesbeck focused his speech on the theme that “the sea is no sanctuary for crime.” He stated that since Walker and his company were American citizens, “the duty of this Government [was] to keep the peace with all other nations; and to break up combinations of its own citizens who have actually started upon expeditions to violate the peace of other nations.” This being said, Representative Groesbeck saw nothing wrong with the actions the US government took to apprehend Walker and his company: “He [the commander of the US Navy] had the right to cross the line of the marine league from our shore; he had the right to pursue this expedition, which was being <em>carried on</em> across the Gulf; and he had the right, with the consent of Nicaragua, to enter within her jurisdiction.” Simply put, General Walker and his company were rightfully and legally seized and detained by the US government.","William Walker was a man of many skills. Despite his medical education and experience in journalism, he is best remembered as a filibusterer. Walker’s first filibuster occurred in 1853 in Sonora, Mexico. The success of this filibuster prompted Walker to pursue Nicaragua a few years later.","The US Department of State acknowledges that filibustering-the militaristic actions of private citizens in a foreign land-was common in the years between the Mexican War and Civil War. Like Walker, most filibusterers were southern men hoping that the acquisition of new territory in Central America would ensure the expansion and survival of slavery. For this reason, as historian James McPherson wrote, “While much of the northern press condemned Walker as a pirate, southern newspapers praised him as engaged in a ‘noble cause.’” These conflicting perceptions of Walker’s actions created fierce tension in Washington.","When Walker and his company returned to Nicaragua in 1857, the US reacted. Historian Amy Greenberg wrote on this matter, “In May 1857 Walker surrendered to the commander of the United States navy after falling to the combined pressure of a Central American army, Great Britain, and threatened American shipping interest.” As evident in Rep. Groesbeck’s speech, there was a lot of controversy concerning Walker’s seizure. This contention between southerners and northerners in regards to the US actions was, in the end, pointless. In May 1858, a jury in New Orleans acquitted Walker of all charges for violating federal law."],"display_date":"January 11, 1858","search_date":"1858-01-11","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":1854,"tag":"Filibuster"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6081,"title":"<strong>Violence Erupts at Altamont Free Concert</strong>","course_id":123,"status":"P","start_date":"12/6/69","end_date":"12/6/69","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones took the stage at Altamont Speedway the atmosphere was already intense. While the sun went down the Rolling Stones began their fateful set at a concert that was the culmination of their 1969 US tour, and by far the most violent. What promoters had advertised as a free concert for one and all featuring the immensely popular Rolling Stones, quickly degenerated into a violent, intimidating, and frightening scene in the northern California countryside.","The Rolling Stones’ US tour manager Sam Cutler had hired the San Francisco chapter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club to provide security for the concert. According to Bill Wyman, former bassist of the Rolling Stones, the Hell’s Angels agreed to protect the generators and stage from the crowd. They agreed to be paid with $500 worth of beer. Wyman recalls in his book <em>Rolling With the Stones</em> that by the time the Stones began the third song of their set the crowd had become unruly and close to completely out of control.","In the documentary film <em>Gimme Shelter</em>, which focuses on the 1969 Rolling Stones tour, Mick Jagger can be seen and heard pleading with the crowd to, “Just calm down in the front there. Cool it man.” Jagger was speaking in response to a series of brawls that had broken out directly in front of the stage, between Hell’s Angels members and concert-goers. It was here, in front of the stage, that eighteen year-old Meredith Hunter was stabbed to death by a Hells Angel. As seen in <em>Gimme Shelter</em> it is clear that Hunter revealed and began brandishing a revolver in the midst of the crowd, when Hells Angel Alan Passaro drew a knife and charged Hunter, stabbing him to death. The concert ended there, as the situation had gone beyond the control of the band.

Carter witnessed the unjustifiable and immoral events that ensued once his unit entered the village.  Charlie Company did not encounter any opposition from the villagers, but it did not matter.   According to Carter, the commanding officer ordered the men to “kill everybody, leave no one standing.”  Under the leadership of Captain Ernest Medina and spearheaded by Lieutenant William Calley, the men of Charlie Company tortured, murdered, and mutilated the inhabitants of My Lai.  When asked how many people were killed during the massacre, Carter responded, “There were more than 100, but I couldn’t tell you accurately how many people were killed.  I don’t believe there were any people left alive.”  The men of Charlie Company ceased fire between 9:00 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.  Carter shot himself in the foot and was evacuated at approximately 10:30 a.m.","The events of My Lai have been investigated and disputed since that Saturday morning in 1968.  Australian professors Truda Gray and Brian Martin claimed, “Upon publication of the news in late 1969, many people in the United States and beyond were shocked.”  The massacre at My Lai altered the American public’s stance on the war in Vietnam.  Since the military concealed facts surrounding the massacre, U.S. citizens felt left in the dark and increasingly protested the war once they learned what actually happened.  Top-level military commanders had no idea of what transpired on March 16, 1968 until the story reached publication a year later.  The cover-up process was kept within the middle ranks of the military.  The only person to be convicted for his actions was Lieutenant William Calley, reflecting injustice and bias within the judiciary system of the U.S. military.","Professors of sociology Joachim J.

Lynching, commonly practiced throughout the United States from the 19<sup>th</sup> century until the 1960s, was a method of murder used to control African American behavior. The victims were typically accused of inappropriate behavior towards white women, though historians agree that these charges typically were false. Armwood’s case met with something highly unusual of Maryland lynchings up unto this point: gubernatorial intervention.","Gov. Albert Ritchie had ordered that Armwood be moved out of Somerset County to Baltimore for protection until his trial. However, relentless pressure from the whites in Princess Anne pushed Judge Robert Duer to transport Armwood back to Somerset County, where an angry mob waited for him. The mob broke through the guards and used a telephone pole to batter down the jailhouse door. The mob rampaged the jailhouse, found Armwood, and dragged him to the courthouse lawn where they beat him severely. They then dragged him through the streets into Duer's neighborhood, where they hanged him from a tree near the judge's home. Afterwards his mutilated body was set on fire and abandoned in a lumberyard where it stayed to terrorize the African American community.","Politically, Maryland was sharply divided over issues of race. In general, Baltimoreans identified more with northern progressive thought while residents of rural areas held to southern sensibilities. With the gubernatorial election on the horizon, Gov. Ritchie found himself torn between rural white segregationists on the one hand, and urban progressives and African Americans on the other hand. Baltimoreans were enraged by his refusal to take responsibility for Armwoods' lynching. In response, Gov. Ritchie declared that, “The responsibility for Armwood's being at Princess Anne rests squarely on the shoulders of Judge Duer and State's Attorney Robins.” Ritchie’s reluctance to use his power to administer justice seemed to demonstrate a broader unwillingness to improve the rights of minorities and promote a progressive agenda. In order to recover his reputation in this demographic, Gov. Ritchie sent three hundred National Guardsmen to apprehend four of the men accused of the Armwoon lynching and bring them to Baltimore for trial. This ultimately failed because Somerset residents actively rebelled.","Ritchie’s short-lived attempt to prosecute the lynchers alienated White segregationists and his ambivalence about the lynching of Armwood had infuriated African American and white progressive voters. He lost reelection. Interestingly, the Armwood lynching was the last in Maryland. That, combined with the voters' actions, suggest that Maryland politics was turning toward Civil Rights during the 1930s."],"display_date":"October 18, 1933 - October 30, 1933","search_date":"1933-10-24","locations":[{"id":23153,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":10,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"},{"id":24915,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"Somerset, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":2540,"tag":"George Armwood"},{"id":2539,"tag":"Gov.

An African American man, Armwood, had had some encounter with an elderly, white woman the previous day. Mary Denston had been walking down the road from the post office. She claimed to have been attacked. Such accusations were deadly for black men. Regardless of the true nature of Armwood’s “attack” on Denston, a posse of over a thousand gathered and stole Armwood from the town jail. They lynched him, burning his body, and leaving him smoldering in a lumber yard. He was discovered early on October 18<sup>th</sup>. In the history of lynching it is evident that the mainstream media fueled the kind of fear that justified racial violence. At the same time, the black press was crucial in drawing attention to the prevalence of injustice and instrumental in pushing for  change.","Racial bigotry did not die with the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. Whites relentlessly continued to implement new means for upholding a misguided social hierarchy once they no longer had the institution of slavery to justify their control of black people. Lynching emerged as a method of control, demoralizing and terrorizing black people to discourage them from protesting injustice. This was one of many ways they were kept as second class citizens.","Journalists in the George Armwood case began to use the media to press for change. White newspapers tended to downplay racial unrest, at least until the  early 20<sup>th</sup> century. They emphasized African American crimes in order to create an image of a people not suited for free society. By 1933, white newspapers had begun to report more frequently on crimes <em>against</em> African Americans. They were not interested in activism, however. Rather, the tone of most articles was informative and the focus was local. This made it difficult for readers to understand lynching as a systemic problem.","The Baltimore Sun took this approach in the Armwood case, reporting the details of the lynching without raising questions about the response of local officials or police. Armwood's jailers had lfailed to protect him, and he never had the benefit of a trail. The Sun did not make these points clear. Further, The Sun attempted to soften the atrocity, for example, by referring to the posse’s contempt for pleas for peace as “good natured.”","The black press took a much more activist approach. In Baltimore, reporters for The Afro American expressed outrage. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, African American newspapers became key players in advancing the cause of civil rights. No longer would African Americans stay silent under the chains of oppression. Instead, they would become more vocal and more insistant – a role that The Afro played beautifully. Reporters reminded the public that George Armwood had been tortured before his body was burned, that he was a son of a mother distraught with grief, that this event was a travesty and a flippant disregard of the justice system. A new juggernaut of media style began to take form as it walked a nation into an era of social freedom.","Media holds the power to shape nations. White journalists failed to question the long reach of  slavery into the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Black journalists propelled a movement for change. Every form of media has a cause: to remember this and to understand where it is leading us will open a window to escape the cycle of history. To forget is to become Sisyphus: forever rolling the stone of racial relations up the insurmountable hill of progress."],"display_date":"October 16, 1933 - October 18, 1933","search_date":"1933-10-17","locations":[{"id":24915,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"Somerset, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":600,"tag":"Media"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}},{"id":6602,"title":"Free-Statesman Receives News about Pottawatomie Murder's","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-24","end_date":"1856-05-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 25, 1856, an “unnamed free-statesman,” visiting Kansas, joined a group of paramilitary abolitionists to help stop the ransacking of villages by proslavery southerners. Proslavery paramilitary men had devastated villages to make sure that the people of Kansas were not promoting free-soil. These battles gave Kansas the name, “Bleeding Kansas,” which was appropriate due to all the bloodshed. This “unnamed free-statesman” joined the other paramilitary abolitionists because he had no choice due to where he was in Kansas. Everyone else in that section of Kansas felt compelled to join groups of one side or the other to help protect their towns and other citizens that were being pillaged. When the free-statesmen fighter got to Osawatomie, he learned that five proslavery men had been murdered by a posse of free-statesmen.  According to what they heard, “the men killed, were butchered—ears cut off and the bodies were thrown into the river.” On the following day, the free-statesman was informed that a party under John Brown had committed the murders, and that two of John Brown’s sons had been taken for questioning in relation to the killings.","John Brown, a fifty-six-year-old abolitionist originally from Connecticut, who had little success in various business and farming enterprises, decided to join six of his twenty sons and a son-in-law, in taking up claims in Kansas. In joining his family in these claims, the Brown family intentionally incorporated themselves in a free-state military company in an effort to stop slavery in Kansas before it took root. This company served in the guerilla warfare that spread across Kansas during the spring of 1856. They joined the military company to help defend cities such as Lawrence, Kansas. According to historian Ken Chowder, when Brown heard of Lawrence being ransacked, he had also received news that a southern Congressman had attacked and caned Senator Charles Sumner for insulting the South. With Brown in a complete rage about the sacking of Lawrence and beating of Sumner, he wanted to show southerners that the people of Kansas also had rights.","This massacre escaped the legal process, with the exception of the arresting of two of Brown’s sons. Historian James McPherson pointed out that, with Brown’s family committing these murders with a holy vision, Brown and his remaining sons avoided being captured and were never indicted for these killings on Pottawatomie Creek. Many people considered Brown as a crazy man, or that this act of justice was barbaric, however, the Pottawatomie massacre was soon dubbed “The Civil War in Kansas,” and further foreshadowed war across the United States."],"display_date":"May 24, 1856 - May 25, 1856","search_date":"1856-05-24","locations":[{"id":52974,"lat":38.6165913,"lng":-95.3102505,"zoom":8,"place":"Franklin County, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}},{"id":6617,"title":"Constructing the Path to Victory through Island No. 10","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-03-23","end_date":"1862-04-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After conquering New Madrid, Union General, John Pope formulated a plan to secure the fortified Island No. 10 in order break Confederate control of the Mississippi River in Missouri. Pope’s bold design to evade the Confederate held Island No. 10 involved bypassing it by cutting a canal along the base of the northern “S” meander and directly connect the river areas between Island No. 8 and Island No. 9, along with New Madrid."," Engineers and an infantry regiment from Wisconsin devised ingenious tools to saw down trees below the level of the spring floodwaters. Some 600 soldiers eventually cleared a fifty-foot wide, eighty- mile long canal, taking about three weeks. With the Mississippi River being as unpredictable as it was, floodwaters would soon subside several inches a day after April 1, 1862, meaning that the tress that were cut at a higher mark would have to be cut again so the ships could pass. As Pope recalled, “To do this a cross-cut saw was attached, or rather was made the lower side of a triangle, the upper angle of which was fastened to the tree just at the water-line, and the depth from this point to the lower side of the triangle (the cross-cut saw) was about five feet.” With the canal completed on April 3, 1862, it was fully operable for ships and other vessels to use with the existing water levels of the Mississippi.","With the completion of the canal, on the stormy night of April 4, Captain Walke ran his gun boat, the <em>Carondolet</em>, past the battery of enemy troops on Island No. 10 untouched. Two nights later, Walke ordered his other ship, the <em>Pittsburg, </em>past the battery for Pope’s use. With these two ships, Pope intended to silence the battery on the bank called Watson’s Landing, in order to land troops for battle. On the morning of April 7, Pope ordered his men to open fire on the enemy using their ground battery and gunships to silence their weapons so he could land troops. According to Pope, “I at once communicated the fact to Paine and ordered him as soon as he effected a landing to leave a guard and push on himself with his command as rapidly to Tiptonville, to which point all the forces of the enemy were tending, assuring him that the rest of the troops would cross rapidly and be up with him soon.”","At about four o’clock in the morning on April 8, the Confederates evacuated Island No. 10 and were driven back to Reelfoot Swamp on the Tennessee side, unable to resist the Federals anymore.

They faced many struggles along the way including disease, thick mud, and broken roads, but the men pushed forward to the Confederate-held town. The Confederate General John McCown had caught wind of the movement of Pope’s divisions and decided to strengthen his defenses. McCown had a grand total of fifty-two pieces of artillery on his side, along with five foot thick bags of corn and dirt that could hold up to three regiments per fort. On March 3, Pope and his men set up their field guns in order to cut off Confederate communication, as well as to try to seal the fate of McCown’s remaining two forts.","On the night of March 11, the 10<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> Illinois moved heavy artillery into place, about 800 yards from the Confederates lines, without the enemy knowing. Pope commanded Captain Mower, the Union siege gun commander, to concentrate fire on the C.S.A gunboats until they were silenced and then to batter the fortresses, in order to save ammunition. Confederate General McCown went into complete panic. He demanded that Polk and Beauregard give him 20,000 more men to fight because he thought that Pope had constructed an army of 50,000 soldiers, when he only had 12,000. On the evening of March 13, McCown realized that the heavy artillery that Pope’s men had brought through the swamps would lead to failure for his army. McCown, in defeat, told his leading commander Stewart to evacuate New Madrid and head to Tiptonville, Tennessee.","According to Pope, “A few minutes after daylight a flag of truce approached our lines with information that the enemy had hurriedly abandoned the works both below and above New Madrid, and been carried to the other shore of the river by gunboats.” The Union Army of the Mississippi defeated the Confederates with perseverance and dedication due to their fearless general, John Pope.
