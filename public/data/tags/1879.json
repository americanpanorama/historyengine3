In some cases they took false hope that the only real threat to secede came from the state of South Carolina. Statements from a small town central Pennsylvania newspaper, <em>The Democratic Watchman,</em> affirmed that it was not possible, nor likely, for any of the other southern states to follow South Carolina’s lead and leave the Union.","In regards to the small town doubt about secession, the <em>Democratic Watchman</em> stated, “It is probable that no southern state will cooperate with South Carolina in secession and resistance to the General Government, and that she will not attempt to go out of the Union alone.” The <em>Watchman, </em>similar to other small northern towns, believed that South Carolina would not leave the Union unless they had support and alliance of other southern states that were willing to secede.","In the South, the push for secession was speared by the election of republican Abraham Lincoln as the president of the United States on November 6, 1860. The election stands as the final controversial political moment before southerners began to formally choose secession. Southerners believed that Lincoln would take their liberties because he was a member of the Republican Party and this pushed southern trust of the federal government to its breaking point.","Secession should not have caught the Union by surprise because before the election of 1860, southern citizens, who were considered supporters of the Union, warned northerners of the likelihood of secession upon Lincoln’s presidential victory. This “fever” for independence soon spread out of the deep south and into the upper south. South Carolina called for a convention immediately following the news of Lincoln’s victory. The federal judge at Charleston, the District Attorney, the Collector, and other federal officers, all from the state of South Carolina, resigned from their respective offices. These officials were attempting to bring immediate issues with the federal government.","South Carolina voted 169 to 0 to secede from the Union of the United States of America on December 20, 1860. By May 21, 1861, the eleven states that all eventually comprised the Confederacy had officially broken from the Union."],"display_date":"November 15, 1860","search_date":"1860-11-15","locations":[{"id":10917,"lat":40.9190359343,"lng":-77.8196278227,"zoom":9,"place":"CENTRE, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"},{"id":683,"tag":"Abraham Lincoln"},{"id":1861,"tag":"Confederates"},{"id":1879,"tag":"Secession"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6092,"title":"They fought with bread and humor.","course_id":121,"status":"P","start_date":"4/23/82","end_date":"4/23/82","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Drug smuggling in South Florida was a major issue in the early 1980's. Drugs were being dropped offshore and residents would pick them up, and bring them North to the distributors in the major cities. Many of the drugs coming into the country were coming from the Cuba and many of the Central American countries through Florida. In an effort to combat this problem the Federal Government set up a roadblock and checkpoint in the early months of 1982. The Border Patrol placed the roadblock at the northern limits of the Florida Keys. Residents of the Keys were disturbed about the fact that everyone was being stopped and searched upon their entry and exit of the County. With the massive amounts of tourism being lost, it was decided that an injunction against the Border patrol's actions should be filed in Federal Court. Dennis Wardlow, the mayor of Key West, flew to the Federal Court in Miami on April 22, 1982. The Court decided in favor of the Federal Government and maintained that the checkpoint was legal. When the media asked Mayor Wardlow what they would do, he responded \"we are going to go home secede.\" Then next day around noon, Mayor Wardlow, addressed the massive crowd. Reading the Conch Republic Proclamation of Secession, Wardlow ended the speech with \"Big trouble has started in much smaller places than this. I am calling on all my fellow citizens here in the Conch Republic to stand together, lest we fall apart-fall from fear, from lack of courage, intimidation by an uncaring government whose actions show it has grown too big to care for people on a small island.: The US flag was lowered in the town center, and the official flag of the Conch Republic was raised. Following the speech Mayor, now Prime Minister, Wardlow declared war on the United States. He took stale Cuban bread and broke it over the head of an individual in a US Navy uniform. Residents of the \"Conch Republic\" began throwing stale Cuban bread at the US Coast Guard cutter <em>DILLIGENCE. </em>After about a minute into the war, Prime Minister Wardlow surrendered to a US Naval Officer that was present. Upon the surrender, Wardlow demanded financial aid from the US for the Conch Republic. The US did not give the Conch Republic any financial aid, but the roadblock was immediately removed."," ","."],"display_date":"April 23, 1982","search_date":"1982-04-23","locations":[{"id":40533,"lat":24.6544423073,"lng":-81.6949104117,"zoom":8,"place":"Monroe, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1879,"tag":"Secession"},{"id":1496,"tag":"Florida"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"}],"course":{"name":"Introduction to Digital History","school":"University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee","course_id":121,"school_id":68}},{"id":6404,"title":"Coming South: A Confederate Sympathizer in a Northern State","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-14","end_date":"1860-12-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Just days before South Carolina seceded from the United States in December of 1860, an article titled “Coming South” was printed in a South Carolina newspaper, the <em>Abbeville Press.</em> The article included a letter written by a Northern Gentleman who wanted to support Southerner’s interests in rebelling against the abolitionist North. He believed that the South had been tolerant of the North’s tyranny for too long, and that the Southern states should rebel against the Union. The letter was originally addressed to a large commercial house in Mobile, Alabama, and it discussed the mounting political tensions at the time of publication between the Northern abolitionist states and the Southern pro-slavery states. The author of the letter stated that he was always a believer in the “divine and legal right of slavery,” and in state’s right of secession, and his beliefs made him an outlier in the North. Because secession seemed likely, the author wanted to express his support for the state’s right to secede, and for his desire to conduct business with or even migrate to the South in the event of secession. The author had accumulated land and wealth, and also produced goods that were exclusive to northern states, which would be valuable to the cotton states. The author claimed that if the Southern Confederacy was created as its own union, his first priority would have been to defend that right to secede, and his second would have been to help establish trade between the Confederacy and Europe, both of which would have been essential to fostering the Confederacy’s independence. The author chose to side with the South, because he believed fundamentally in the right to own slaves, to trade freely, and to secede if these rights were infringed upon.","In the letter presented in “Coming South,” the author addressed the issue of secession in terms of it being the only means to protect the interests of the South. In <em>Half Slave and Half Free: The Roots of the Civil War,</em> historian Bruce Levine discussed how Southerners believed that their position in the United States was untenable, and how the fear of abolition lead to secession (226). The letter author reflected the dominant ideology of the South at the time, because Southerners felt that in order to protect their economic interests and their existing lifestyle, it was necessary to remove themselves from a union that sought to eradicate slavery. Levine notes that antislavery sentiment had “demonstrably taken hold of a huge portion of the northern population” and that this instilled fear in the South, but the Northern letter author interestingly contrasted the dominant view of his region (233). The letter author's position as a wealthy gentelmen suggests that his interest in engaging with the South stemmed from economic concerns. In <em>Half Slave and Half Free, </em>Levine described instances of Northerners who sought to reconcile with Southern planters for the sake of economic gain, and stated that those who sided with the South were usually “key sections of the economic elite who feared alienating the slave owners more than they disliked slavery” (229). Essentially, in some instances businessmen, like the letter author, were more concerned with profiting from the Southern agricultural giants than they were with the moral aims of abolition. In \"Coming South,\" the <em>A</em><em>bbeville Press </em>used the letter to<em> </em>further the newspaper’s own pro-slavery and pro-secession agenda, by highlighting the possibility of economic and moral supprot from wealthy men in the North. The article did not give a name, location, or any identifying information about the letter’s author, so the letter could even have been a fabricated piece of propaganda, intended to encourage readers to side with secession. Southerner’s feared oppression from the majority of the North, but the existence of a pro-secession minority in the North would give Southerner’s reason to believe that they would be supported and successful if they removed themselves from the Union. Overall, the letter transcribed in “Coming South” is significant to period leading up to secession and the Civil War, because it reflected the contrast between Northern and Southern interests, and foreshadowed the eventual secession of the Southern slave states.  "," "," "],"display_date":"December 14, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-14","locations":[{"id":52809,"lat":30.6953657,"lng":-88.0398912,"zoom":8,"place":"Mobile Alabama"},{"id":52808,"lat":34.1781719,"lng":-82.3790147,"zoom":8,"place":"Abbeville South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":500,"tag":"trade"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1879,"tag":"Secession"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6651,"title":"Virginia Seccesion","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-17","end_date":"1865-04-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The act of secession was a very important topic when it came to the time before and during the Civil War. Through time you can still see the divide amongst our society from the effects of the war and secession of the southern states. One state that played an influential role in the Confederate states was Virginia. Virginia is a very history rich state, the first colony was in the state of Virginia and many political leaders of America were Virginians. I believe it is very important to discuss why Virginia left the union because many battles and the surrender of the war happened in Virginia. I believe the three main factor behind the secession of Virginia is their ties with slavery and the roots of their southern culture.","            Slavery played a very important role in the time of the civil war. Virginia was the most populous state of the south and had very deep ties in the slave trade. Geography played a huge role for slavery in Virginia, the barrier which affected it was the Blue Ridge Mountains. East of the mountains slavery dominated, plantation agriculture ruled and was the main source of income for that area. The slave trade was also found its grounds in Virginia making huge headquarters in Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia. William A. Link speaks in his book <em>Roots of Secession</em> and states “The entire Fabric of Virginia’s legal, constitutional, and political system was woven into the slave holding society, and the social interests and political imperatives converged around slavery.” This quote shoes the importance of slavery in the Virginian society and how they base their society around it.","            Even though Virginia was not the first to secede it had strong ties to its southern culture helped tip the balance when it came to the secession of Virginia. One aspect the kept the South so close is their pride in their society. The paternalistic ideals the south held kept unity across all of the southern states. The people of the south viewed the north as the people who wanted to start a revolution, and they were only doing what they believe was their right. In the <em>Declaration of Cause Secession of Virginia </em>it states “Having declared that the powers under the said Constitution were derived from the people of the United States, and might be resumed whensover the same should be perverted to their injury and oppression” In this quote, you can see that the people of Virginia felt that the southern way of live was being oppressed and it was there right to leave to preserve their rights.","            To conclude, the secession of Virginia was mostly motivated by their strong ties to slavery and the southern culture built around it. Though Virginia was not the first to secede, the state is home to many battles of the civil war and the surrender of the war. These events not only effected the people that lived during that time, they also will affect people for years to come. Even today the issues of the Civil War can still be seen throughout the country. The secession of the South played a pivotal role in the history of our country, and it will forever be studied and looked at by historians for years to come."," "," "],"display_date":"April 17, 1861 - April 1, 1865","search_date":"1863-04-09","locations":[{"id":14214,"lat":37.5407246,"lng":-77.4360481,"zoom":8,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1879,"tag":"Secession"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}}]}
