The Greek Orthodox Youth of America, GOYA, a Greek organization, made attempts and held drives to have their religion be included in the major faiths of the U.S. At the time, only the Catholic, Protestant and Jewish faiths were recognized as faiths in the U.S. The chairman of GOYA gathered with other members of the organization in Birmingham, Alabama to hold a conference on how to further their cause and get their faith validated. With over 5 million Greek Orthodox followers in the U.S. they felt they deserved the right.<br /><br />The United States constitution boasted freedom of religion and this was true for the most part. The Greeks and people of other faiths were allowed to practice their religions. However, the U.S. only chose to officially recognize 3 major religions of the time. Soldiers serving in World War II that were not Catholic, Protestant or Jewish were unable to have their respective faiths listed in their profiles. This practice continued for many years. GOYA was eventually successful in their attempts to have the Greek Orthodox faith recognized."],"display_date":"August 24, 1953","search_date":"1953-08-24","locations":[{"id":28563,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":221,"tag":"Greeks"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}},{"id":4653,"title":"Greek Immigrants in U.S. find new start","course_id":22,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/46","end_date":"1/1/46","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Stamatis Demoes was saddened to leave his Greek hometown behind. He would miss the people and the vineyards he worked in. But he had no choice because his town had been destroyed in an attack by Communist rebels. Demoes was part of the outnumbered troops that fought against them to the very end. After his town was virtually destroyed, Demoes and his family managed to come to Birmingham, AL with the help of some relatives. He was grateful for the opportunity for a new life and requested help for those he had left behind from his new community. He did not want to forget his roots.<br /><br />Demoes was one of a great number of Greeks that migrated to the United Sates and especially the South during the early part of the twentieth century. Most Greeks arrived in the South starting in the late nineteenth century in an effort to find work. Some Greeks also arrived later as a result of the ongoing war in their home country. Demoes was one of these Greeks. He brought his family to the new country and established his allegiance to it. However, he never forgot those that were left behind."],"display_date":"January 1, 1946","search_date":"1946-01-01","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":221,"tag":"Greeks"},{"id":222,"tag":"birmingham"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}}]}
