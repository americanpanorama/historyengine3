Roosevelt had a great challenge ahead of him as our nation’s 32<sup>nd</sup> President. The United States was in a period of unemployment and extreme poverty. The people were losing faith and it was F. D. R.’s responsibility to fix the problem. On May 7, 1933, F.D.R. entered American homes through their radios. Hoping to restore hope to the public, Roosevelt assured them that Congress was taking the necessary steps to fix the economic situation.","In the early 1900’s, the United States entered the “Great Depression.” With the stock market crash, the majority of people lost jobs, along with their homes. Soup kitchens had more business than ever before. People had to change their lifestyles just so that they could survive. Roosevelt came up with numerous programs to help the country’s economic situation. Programs like the Railroad Bill and others gave jobs back to different families all over America.","  F.D.R.'s “Fireside Chats” brought the president into the homes of the American public through a series of radio programs. On May 7, 1933, F.D.R. tried to comfort people and assure them that things were going to get better for them. He explained that he knew everything was not yet perfect, but soon everything would turn around and begin to get better. He said that the government was going to ease mortgages, grant money to the states, and take further steps to increase employment. Families gathered around their radios to hear the voice of their President assuring them that the government was working on many different ways to improve their lives.         ","These radio chats were a novel idea in communication between the President and the common citizens. Before this, no other president used this method to reach the people. Presidents after this, however, realized how important it was to make a connection with the people. They began to see that communicating on a more personal level helped their popularity with the voters. Now, Presidents take advantage of the media as much as they can. Use of the media makes the Presidents closer to the general public. It is much more personalized and effective to use the media to reach the people, and Franklin D. Roosevelt was the first to understand and use this method."," "],"display_date":"May 7, 1933","search_date":"1933-05-07","locations":[{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":620,"tag":"Franklin D.

The black and white or sepia pictures display dirty children, tired mothers or men hard at work. Every one was broke and tired. This era, known as The Great Depression, lasted from 1929 through the advent of the Second World War. This was a time of struggle for people from all walks of life. Even people from white-collar fields, such as lawyers, librarians and teachers were unable to provide for their families. The New Deal program <em>The U.S Works Projects Administration</em> (WPA)felt that there was a more productive way to use the unique skill set that these people brought with them than put them to work on the construction crews created across the nation. The resulting effort was <em>The U.S Works Projects Administration Federal Writers’ Project and Historical Records Survey.</em>","This project was the result of several meetings that took place in 1934 between Jacob Baker, the assistant to the chief of the Civil Works Administration and his assistant, Katherine Kellock. The <em>Works Project Administration </em>ultimately created four appendages to protect and sustain the arts: the <em>Federal Writers' Project</em>, <em>the Art Project</em>, the <em>Theater Project</em>, and the <em>Music Project</em>.","By 1935, <em>The Federal Writers Project </em>was up and running. The main goal of this project was to create a series of guidebooks and local histories. Championed by Kellock, The <em>American Guide Series</em> and “<em>America Eats</em>”were a result of this project. Other collections include the narratives of former slaves as well as celebrations of local culture and art. Even though these projects collected invaluable history, one of the many issues the faced was the collection and intake process. In addition, there were many bureaucratic hurdles that could not be resolved.","Many in Congress felt that the money used to fund the many WPA writers and art programs could be used elsewhere. With the impending threat of war, many Congressmen were intent on diverting those funds to the defense budget. Before the program was terminated in 1939,<em> The Federal</em> <em>Writers Project </em>compiled an impressive collection of pamphlets, books radio scripts and transcripts. These histories are stored in many places on the Internet such as The American Memory Collection."],"display_date":"1934 - 1939","search_date":"1936-12-31","locations":[{"id":22390,"lat":40.7455449451,"lng":-84.936600608,"zoom":10,"place":"Adams, Indiana"},{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1220,"tag":"Federal Writers' Project"},{"id":1084,"tag":"The New Deal"},{"id":620,"tag":"Franklin D.

Knudsen (Ford Motor Company, and GMC) and Sidney Hillman (head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America), Roosevelt expressed his opinion on the matter rather flatly.  “ [The] discrimination against Negro workers has been nation-wide…[they] are being turned from the gates of industry on specifications entirely unrelated to efficiency and productivity…this situation is a matter of grave national importance, and immediate steps must be taken to deal with it effectively.”  Roosevelt goes on to state that “Every available source of labor capable of production defense materials must be tapped in the present emergency.”  He saw the discrimination for what it is: an uneducated and backwards, racist sentiment left over from the previous century.  He urged unions and labor leaders like Knudsen and Hillman to take into account the huge numbers of skilled black workers to increase war-time productivity.","Of course, this did not guarantee success, nor did his Roosevelt’s words fall only on discerning ears.  Many times the policies of different workplaces caused racial tension and strikes throughout the country.  In Mobile, Alabama, one of the South’s biggest shipyards and transportation hubs, more than a few strikes crippled production.  For instance, the Mobile Pulley Works was halted in August of 1942 over racial discrimination.  Eighty percent of the workers of the Mobile Pulley Works were black laborers.  During August, several black workers were discharged from work for varying small incidents.  The main incident in question was that of the Financial Secretary of the local “colored” union was fired.  The unnamed Fin. Sec. was off work for three days following a death in his immediate family, and upon returning to work he was told that he must leave, and would not receive his job returned.  This ended up putting his family on the street within days of loosing said position.  The day he was fired, the story circulated throughout the Works and caused an uproar that ended up with all the black workers leaving work to strike at the gates.  In effect, the lack of workers caused much strife in the production of war materials.  The Mobile Pulley Works created pulleys, winches for Jeeps, gears for war machinery, but also produced a number of artillery pieces and artillery rounds themselves…so it is easily seen just how needed their business was during WW2.  In the end, the Work’s unions were able to settle with the business and put its men back to work for the war effort…of course, this strike would likely never had happened if Roosevelt’s policies were actually observed without question.","Many laws and policies have been challenged in the course of the United States’ existence.  From slavery, education, and work, all the way up to social issues and tearing down barriers with the outside world.  It is quite disconcerting to know that a man so responsible for this nation’s continued being was heard and not observed. Of course, such is the way of social, political, and racial advancement in the world today; we must take strides to make better the future for others."],"display_date":"1940 - 1945","search_date":"1942-12-31","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"},{"id":25291,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1684,"tag":"Unions"},{"id":1683,"tag":"Black Workers"},{"id":1682,"tag":"Roosevelt"},{"id":960,"tag":"Labor Unions"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":620,"tag":"Franklin D.
