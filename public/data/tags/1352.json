For years, many had simply lived with the pollution as an everyday part of life. However, in 1971 the County Health Department issued pollution alerts on two separate occasions with daily particulate counts well above national averages. These measurements collected over separate areas of the city could not be ignored any further as a thick blanket of pollution covered the cities skyline for several days. As Alabama’s largest city and a southern industrial hub, Birmingham served as home to many steel and iron producing plants that accounted for much of this pollution. In response to the crisis U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer of North Alabama issued a temporary injunction on twenty-three local industries and prompting the intervention of a federal strike force of environmental specialists by recommendation of the still new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.","However, when the Birmingham News announced the arrival of a congressional subcommittee to hold a hearing, the question of most concern was determining if federal action was either too extreme or not aggressive enough, in spite of claims that local industries had been slow to act accordingly. If voluntary action from industries weren’t in place, then feds would exercise emergency powers of the Clean Air Act of 1970. While The Clean Air Act enforced EPA standards, it was The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 that paved the way for the institutionalization of environmentalism. NEPA was enacted as a means to assure safe, healthy and esthetically pleasing surroundings, while attaining the most possible benefits devoid of compromising unwanted consequences.  At the height of the pollution crisis, particulate counts measured double the national average. Even after the count dropped following the shut downs, local industries still complained the order was carried out with little evidence any individual industry was to blame. Though the injunctions did not demand the complete shutdown of industrial plants, the dramatic reductions implemented brought production to a crawl. With so many employed by these industries and such huge cutbacks, worker’s jobs and their livelihoods were placed on the line. According to historian Thomas Wellock, up until recently any though of limiting industrial growth was considered “civic heresy.”","Nestled in the Deep South, Alabama has long been a state of proud independent character with a long political history preferring little to no federal intervention. However as Wellock points out, in the seventies politicians were aware of the publics demand for federal action, and Alabama’s leaders knew better than to alienate their constituency. Major legislations, like NEPA, were passed that would instill environmental values within local, state, and federal bureaucracies’. With Vietnam War, Civil Rights movement, and so many dividing issues during those times, the environment became one topic of bi-partisan support. To politicians, this was a win, win scenario that everyone can benefit from especially when it comes to votes."],"display_date":"November 18, 1971 - November 20, 1971","search_date":"1971-11-19","locations":[{"id":35012,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1355,"tag":"Clean Air Act"},{"id":1354,"tag":"Air Pollution"},{"id":1353,"tag":"NEPA"},{"id":1352,"tag":"EPA"},{"id":1351,"tag":"Environmentalism"},{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":84,"school_id":10}},{"id":6152,"title":"The Rezoning and Repurposing of Parkerson Mill Creek in Auburn, Alabama","course_id":127,"status":"P","start_date":"2/10/78","end_date":"2/10/78","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Auburn has always been a sleepy little town in the heart of Southeast Alabama, and it was even more so in the 1970s. The population was just over 25,000 people, with 18,000 of them being students and the median income for the city was estimated at $7,700 per year (Warr 1). The economy was starting to stall and inflation was on the rise, and people were just trying to make ends meet to provide for their families. The main occupation was farming, and a crucial part of farming was the accessibility of water to sustain the business.","The main source of water for middle and lower class families’ crops and livestock was Parkerson Mill Creek. In the 1970s, however, there was a large movement to increase the amount of areas, including waterways, to be reverted back to their natural purpose of supporting fish and wildlife. Because of this, William Warr of the EPA conducted a report was conducted on the feasibility and cost of changing a section of Parkerson Mill Creek back to its original purpose. The people of Auburn were understandably concerned about this prospect, because it changed their way of life for the worse and they would be forced to find a new source of water for their farms.","Auburn had always prided itself on its low cost of living, and one component of that was having a combined sewer and water cost of just $81/year (Warr 1). The new repurposing of the creek would add an estimated $10 per month to each household's water bill. That would mean an extra $120 per year that families could use for food, clothes, housing, and other living expenses would have to come from somewhere else. Not only this, but there would need to be another source of water for their crops and livestock. As one would expect, the people of Auburn were very nervous.","The environmental arguments, however, were also undeniable. The runoff and silt from their farms was draining directly into the creek, causing the fish and other aquatic species to die off. In a picture provided by the Alabama State Water Program from 1954, the creek is free flowing, but it looks very cloudy and contaminated. This could become a major problem, and if let go far enough, could become completely unsuitable for use (ASWP). While the residents of Auburn did sympathize with them, they did not think it was feasible to enact this new charge, and neither did William Warr of the EPA (Warr 3). Nonetheless, in the end, the EPA did rezone the area for the purpose of supporting fish and wildlife, even against the recommendation of Warr (Warr 3). With this monumental change in the residents’ of Auburn’s lives, they were forced to find a new source of water to support their livelihood."],"display_date":"February 10, 1978","search_date":"1978-02-10","locations":[{"id":34598,"lat":32.6011777617,"lng":-85.3556271043,"zoom":10,"place":"Lee, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":2140,"tag":"water quality"},{"id":1352,"tag":"EPA"}],"course":{"name":"Fundamentals of Environmental History","school":"Auburn University","course_id":127,"school_id":73}}]}
