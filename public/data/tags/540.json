History had a huge significance for their churches, as well as understanding about their future.  Both preachers taught that by understanding the past, and understanding the nuances of it, one could have attained morality through example.  Although morality can be achieved in many ways, a credible way of viewing the present place and the future outcomes is by viewing the past. (This isn't their thoughts, but mine.  Need to put theirs here).  History was, to them, the cornerstone to the Baptist denomination and Christian religion.","James C. Furman started his sermon with Deuteronomy 32:7, “Remember the days of old; consider the years of many generations.”  From this he went into a sermon discussing the history of the Charleston Baptist Association.  The Charleston Baptist Association had existed for one hundred years, and their work had shown great progress.  James Furman preached on the values of looking at the history of organizations as a means to define one’s morality, stating, “Much is gained for human virtue, whether in the family, the State, or the Church, when each member is impressed with a sense of personal moral accountability.”  He also discussed the “most important and interesting phenomena of the human mind…the expectation of the future.”  He went into how the only way to define one’s future is to look at the past.","Twelve days after the celebration of the United States Independence, David W. Cuttino preached an extensive sermon on the history of the Baptist denomination.  He alluded to all the events going on across the nation that celebrated the nation's history up to that point.  The focus of Cuttino's sermon was not on the sacrifices of the soldiers in the American Revolution.  He asked in his sermon, “Shall we celebrate our National Independence and not call to mind the great victories of soul liberty, and do what we can to extend like blessing to all the race of man?”  He discussed what Baptists do believe in, and preached boldly that the Baptist church was the original church in Jerusalem.","Both sermons, however, told a very specific lesson – without the past, the future cannot be written.  Both advocated education of the past as a means to understanding the present and looking to the future.  In order to enjoy the present liberties and look to the future, one must respect the past.  In addition, one must respect it and learn of its false analyses and bias nature.  Rosenberg writes that the Baptists go to near obsession over the past.  Today’s historians strive to learn facts and how bias was attached to that historical fact.  However, learning what the bias is, and finding where else that same kind of bias appeared is its own history."],"display_date":"November 1, 1851 - July 12, 1876","search_date":"1864-03-06","locations":[{"id":11621,"lat":33.5119530737,"lng":-80.8773339627,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGEBURG, South Carolina"},{"id":11456,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":729,"tag":"Religious History"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":540,"tag":"Baptists"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5068,"title":"Kind Words for Sunday School Children teaches children to live a Christian lifestyle.","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-01-01","end_date":"1866-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Once a month, children all over Atlanta, Georgia would rush to the front yard to gather up the newspaper. With their Bibles in hand, they eagerly flipped to their favorite section labeled Kind Words for Sunday School Children. These “kind words” were stories written for the Christian children to read and to take away important lessons that the Bible teaches. These stories were stories from the Bible with a modern twist. They were designed to teach children to follow Christian teachings and to develop a moral center.","During the nineteenth century, the American Bible Society was formed. The society’s main purpose was to promote moral reform.  But during the 1850s, the society began to undergo major changes. The group became institutionalized and commercialized. The focus was no longer on spreading ideas of moral values but now it had a bureaucratic feel to it, it was business, not religious anymore. Kind Words for the Sunday School Children is a prime example of this change. With the publication of Bible teachings in the newspapers, there was no need for children to even attend Sunday School, all the children had to do was read the newspaper. This was one example that marked the death of the community and the creation of individualization.","Kind Words was not the only of it’s kind. Several other techniques were used to help engrain good morals and Christian values in the brains of the nineteenth century youth. One example of this is Mark Twain’s Tom Sawyer. Although the novel promotes some degree of rebellion, Twain still expresses his views and ideas of Sunday school and promoted Christian ideals.","Kind Words for the Sunday School Children were essentially fables and moral stories that taught children stories in the Bible and taught them to live their lives by the Bible. The reason for stories like this to reach the children was to ensure that the religiosity of the following generations would remain strong.  According to southern Christians, it was vital for their children to be well versed in the ways of the Bible so they would continue to spread the word."],"display_date":1866,"search_date":"1866-07-02","locations":[{"id":1820,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":514,"tag":"Christianity"},{"id":540,"tag":"Baptists"},{"id":734,"tag":"sunday school"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}}]}
