In most cases, readings dealt with how many slaves were “in the house” because of some illness or sickness. However, there are also quite a few entries that made mention of the weather and it’s affect on the crops. I felt there had to be something more behind all the conversations about weather, so I decided to look deeper into the readings and the transcriptions, investigating the weather patterns.","The weather was mentioned in at least 27 letters that I read through. In some instances, it is blamed for not being able to travel or plant crops, and in some others, it is simply stated that it rained for a portion of the day. However it was presented, it is important to note the significance it is having on the plantation. What happened when there was foul weather and no work could be done? The crops would obviously be affected, but what were the slaves to be doing in this down time?","It was no secret that the slaves were expected to do the work that was required of them whenever they were told to do it. We cannot safely assume that the workers were forced into the fields in less than ideal conditions though. Given the day and age when these letters were written, where little attention was paid to the medical needs of slaves, and the less than perfect conditions of the living quarters the slaves were in, it is no wonder that the slaves were constantly being held “inside the house” with some kind of illness.","So was the weather to blame for the numerous times sickness and disease are mentioned throughout these letters? Perhaps, but we can also look at the amount of work the slaves would have to do in order to catch up due to the loss of time with the bad weather. If the slaves had to work double time to make up for the lost days, they would be more susceptible to catching a bug. Also, if we look at this increase in labor demands and the less than ideal living conditions, we may be able to figure out how disease was spread throughout the population. It seems like the slave master was not the meanest of men in the world, but it would not be farfetched to think he saved some money on medical costs of the sick slaves.","Through all of this though, the weather seems to be mentioned far too many times to be ignored. Even today, we look to blame the weather for delayed flights, cancelled outdoor events, and even farmers with bad crops. The Plantation Letters provide a very good way for us to think about and question our past in many different ways. In my mind, we don’t have to look much further than the local weatherman to figure out what may have been a leading cause in problems with the crop production and other speed bumps on this plantation."],"display_date":"June 1, 1845 - May 1, 1847","search_date":"1846-05-16","locations":[{"id":174,"lat":32.7925598314,"lng":-87.8378038018,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":409,"tag":"Slavery, health, Cameron"},{"id":419,"tag":"Weather"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}},{"id":4814,"title":"\"Weather\" or not a slave was treated well.","course_id":38,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-09-01","end_date":"1847-12-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When we learn about slavery and the slaves’ masters we often get a picture of an evil cold hearted man, who would whip and torment slaves, while they worked in weather conditions that made it impossible to get any work done. We also often assume that their (the slaves) masters would force them to work whether they were sick or even near death. Using the plantation letters from the Cameron Family we can create a different interpretation. Through these letters we can use the weather as an indicator to determine how well slaves were being treated and cared for on the plantation. This is not to downplay the immoral act of slavery or to say that there were not slave masters who treated slaves poorly because they did exist. Rather, the theme of weather and its patterns, across the letters, can give us a better understanding of how slaves were cared for and treated.","Between the years of 1845 and 1847, there are several instances where Lewellyn (the overseer of the plantation) shares his account of the weather conditions and his inability to get work done on the field. “The Negroes will make an effort to get out the crop by the 25<sup>th</sup> if the weather will permit it being done- but I fear they will not do so.” Even with good weather and the opportunity to get things done, illness has stopped their progress. “The weather here is very warm today, more like July than November, and yet we have a great deal of disease in our Negro family.” Regardless of the weather, if it was too hot or too cold, and without consideration for the slaves’ health, Lewellyn could have easily demanded that the slaves “weather the storm” and worked under any condition. Mr. Cameron, as well, could have ordered Lewellyn to put the slaves to work under any circumstance to ensure the production of his crops. The fact that they did not resort to those measures suggests that the overall health and wellness of their slaves were important. Productive, healthy slaves seems to be Mr. Cameron’s priority when he requested “the overseer to keep the [unintelligible] in the house as I [unintelligible] suffer more cold.” We can assume that Mr. Cameron’s request pertains to keeping the slaves inside to protect them from getting sick and to keep them healthy.","One may think that the Lewellyn’s or Paul Cameron’s intentions were for the good of the plantation and the production of the crop and not so much about the health and well-being of the slaves. Wilkins and Wilson suggest, with regards to the treatment of slaves, that most slave masters were not as brutal or sadistic as one is lead to believe. “<em>The Slave Narratives </em>are overwhelmingly favorable in the judgment of slave masters as ‘good men.’” They found out of 331 narratives that had a reference to a master, 86% suggested that their masters were “good” or “kind.” Some of those references also suggested that the master did not allow whippings and a number of them only allowed whippings while they were present.  Wilkins and Wilson also suggest that slave masters did not want slaves who were defiant and lazy. They wanted hardworking and responsible slaves.  “Such attitudes cannot be beaten into slaves. They had to be elicited.”","It is easy to believe that slave masters and overseers treated slaves as less than human or measured their importance to the amount of labor they contributed to. We can use the weather as an indication of how slaves were treated. From what we learn about, we would believe that slaves were constantly placed in situations that jeopardized their health and well-being, in order to produce and gather crops. These letters help paint a different picture. Slaves were relieved from working in the fields when weather conditions prohibited them from doing so. With numerous amounts of “rain days” many would assume that an overseer or a plantation owner would over work their slaves to make up for the loss production of their crops. At least in this case, by analyzing weather patterns and conditions we can determine the treatment of slaves and the relationship between slave master and slave."],"display_date":"September 1, 1845 - December 30, 1847","search_date":"1846-10-31","locations":[{"id":9680,"lat":36.0638291279,"lng":-79.1821891988,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, North Carolina"},{"id":172,"lat":32.7925598314,"lng":-87.8378038018,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":420,"tag":"Slaves"},{"id":419,"tag":"Weather"},{"id":144,"tag":"plantation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}}]}
