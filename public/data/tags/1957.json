Their fishing nets, cast off a Belle Isle dock in the Detroit River, are not yet full.  This is a scene which George Washington Merrill, a Great Lakes Steamship engineer, captured some time around the turn of the last century.  About twelve men and a horse standing on a large dock connected to Belle Isle are featured in the black and white photograph. Behind them is a heavily wooded shoreline, and what seems to be a bridge.  The photo is taken after Frederick Law Olmsted, then America's premiere landscape architect, had proposed his plan for Belle Isle’s design. He had anticipated that artificial waterways be implemented on the island for water recreation such as boating, but said nothing of fisheries or using the water for industry.","Perhaps Olmsted did not envision fisheries in his initial plan because he did not agree with using natural parks in this way.  He represented a the middle ground between John Muir's preservationist movement and Gifford Pinchot's utilitarian vision of nature.  Utilizing Belle Isle Park’s waterways for fishing is something Pinchot would agree with, as long as it was done conservatively, in a way that would preserve the fish stocks for the future. Olmsted probably envisioned waterways in the park for boating and recreation (and not fishing) because he saw nature as a place for reverence and use.  The artificial waterways he planned are inherently for “use” as the original land would be altered, but the boat users would still be able to enjoy their natural surroundings. Olmsted's vision was also one that matched that of the upper class, who had the time and money to boat and use the water for leisure.  Working class families did not have this luxury; perhaps the men in the photo are fishing to feed their families. The varying plans for use of Belle Isle's waterways can therefore represent a larger struggle of socioeconomic class in how to utilize this shared space."],"display_date":"1890 - 1910","search_date":"1900-07-02","locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1958,"tag":"Waterways"},{"id":1957,"tag":"Fisheries"},{"id":1926,"tag":"Frederick Law Olmsted"},{"id":1901,"tag":"Belle Isle"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5901,"title":"Where Have All the Whitefish Gone?","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-11-12","end_date":"1899-11-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The French Canadian fishermen of Belle Isle pull in their catch. The seine net, hauled in by canoes, horsepower, and manpower, is 1,600 feet long and twelve feet deep, full of black bass, muskallonge, whitefish, and other species. All these men care about, however, are the whitefish. Their bounty greatly varies each seine haul; some hold four whitefish, some hold two hundred. They used to not care about spawning the fish; they had what they thought an inexhaustible supply. However, it is 1899, and after 80 years of heavily fishing the Detroit River off of the docks on Belle Isle, the population has depleted greatly.  The fishermen, under regulations from the Michigan Fish Commission, must spawn the whitefish to maintain their jobs and keep the Great Lakes fishing industry alive.","The Belle Isle fisheries were a facet of the working class. The whitefish fed families, and the men depended upon their jobs to support their family financially. The Belle Isle Aquarium, constructed in 1904, represented a very different socioeconomic class; a class who could afford the time it takes to observe fish, both exotic and native to the Great Lakes. It is interesting to look at the parallels, and to consider that the aquarium opened at the same time that Detroit residents were fighting to keep the Belle Isle fisheries active. Today, Detroit residents are fighting to keep the Belle Isle Aquarium, now described as the “anchor of Belle Isle,” active in the face of the city's financial crisis. These represent very different priorities in the use of Belle Isle: to commercially use the land for a product or an expensive, educational form of entertainment?"],"display_date":"November 12, 1899","search_date":"1899-11-12","locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1957,"tag":"Fisheries"},{"id":1901,"tag":"Belle Isle"},{"id":2022,"tag":"Aquarium"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
