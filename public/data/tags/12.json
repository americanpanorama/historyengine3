a Monday morning at 3 a.m., a breach in the levee allowed rushing waters to flood New Orleans.  Within two days, the breach had expanded to be at least an acre in width.  The areas initially most affected by the waters were the Cyprus swamp and St. John's Bayou.  However, the waters were continuing to flow into the city, and it was predicted that by the time the flood waters stopped rising, the entire city would be underwater. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The governor of Louisiana took immediate action and hired engineers who pledged to have the breach fixed within several days.  Due to having an abundance of the resources need to fix the levee accessible to them, the projected time to be able to fix the levee was accurate.  Many of the city's residents relocated for the summer out of fear of an epidemic breakout of illnesses due to the excess of mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way to protect the city from experiencing such devastating effects was by constantly patrolling the levee, which spanned for miles above and below New Orleans.  Every landowner was responsible for maintenance of the levee that bordered his land, often helped by slaves and free Blacks.  The portions of the levee that did not border personal property and ran through New Orleans were maintained by the city at the public's expense.  This breach occurred five miles upstream of New Orleans, a section that was not under care of the city.   Catastrophic events, such as this one, that threatened the southern way of life, brought together Whites and Blacks to work towards preservation of their society."],"display_date":"May 7, 1816","search_date":"1816-05-07","locations":[{"id":5594,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":19,"title":"409 Slaves from Africa arrive in Georgia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1798, Georgia banned involvement in the Atlantic Slave trade, followed a decade later by a nationwide ban.  The Constitution had required the ban when signed, and Congress put it into effect on January 1, 1808.  As the Hon. Joshua Giddings announced in a speech to the House of Representatives, the United States;pronounced the African slave trade to be piracy, and those who followed that vocation to be pirates worthy of death.'  All captured Atlantic slave traders in the future would tried for their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strong sentiment against the Atlantic trade was not as universal as people imagined.  Many politicians in the South were unyielding in their attempts to reestablish the Atlantic routes.  Fifty years later, a candidate for Mississippi office announced that the the great want of the South is more Negroes, fresh from Africa,' and he was not alone in this idea.  The development of an illegal slave trade started as soon as the law was enacted, and this black market continued for decades.  However, the illicit trade was costly and dangerous, and the already flourishing domestic slave trade replaced the Atlantic trade to a large extent.  The last known delivery of African slaves occurred in 1858 when the Wanderer smuggled 409 slaves from the Congo and Angola into Georgia, near St. Simons Island.

It would take 2,500 miles of cable to complete the job, and construction was interrupted often by errors.  Cables snapped, ships wrecked, and money was running out.  Meanwhile, the American South was watching the progress with anticipation.  Newspapers were quick to report the many failures and setbacks of the line throughout the South in places from Louisiana to South Carolina to Mississippi.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, the cable was laid properly, and the line succeeded.  Public enthusiasm about its success was magnificent, and pieces of extra cable were even sold as souvenirs.  President Buchanan and Queen Victoria exchanged the first message on August 16, 1858.  Unfortunately, the cable stopped working four months later, but the precedent was set.  For the first time, rapid inter-continental communication was possible.

By 1850, the Louisa Railroad was built east to Richmond and west to Charlottesville. As the railway extended, it was renamed the Virginia Central Railroad. Desiring to move forward with internal improvements, the Commonwealth of Virginia allotted money to continue to expand the line. Moving westward, the Virginia Central moved through Gordonsville, past Staunton, and towards Covington. To finish the line across the mountainous territory of the Alleghany Plateau, the Commonwealth chartered a state-subsidized railroad called the Covington and Ohio Railroad. However, by this time, the Civil War would break out, and the westward expansion of the railway stopped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Civil War, the Virginia Central Railroad was one of the Confederacy's most important lines, carrying food, troops, and supplies constantly. By war's end, though, the line would be torn apart and wrecked completely. In order to rebuild the railway, funds had to be sought outside of the economically devastated South. Through a chief New York entrepreneur, Collis P. Huntington, Virginians were supplied with the money to complete the railway to the Ohio River as the Covington and Ohio and the Virginia Central Railways were already previously consolidated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the completion of this railway, many perceived the line as the great route establishing a significant connection between the tidewater of Virginia and the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. Virginia was now in a quick and direct union with rich coalfields and wealthy mineral deposits of the Ohio River valleys. Thus, this railway was vastly productive for Virginia and the South in general. Furthermore, this achievement benefited many of the Western states, whose huge shipments had grown to such magnitude that existing railroads were scarcely able to accommodate the teeming freights."],"display_date":"January 29, 1873","search_date":"1873-01-29","locations":[{"id":13918,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":67,"title":"The Daily Picayune reaches out for Support from its Readers\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-11-07","end_date":"1856-11-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In June of 1856, the Pro Slavery Party of the Kansas Territory elected the city of New Orleans to manage the affairs of the party.  This entailed disbursing funds to aid the cause and keeping their foreign friends abreast of current situations in the territory.

The paper stresses that although the Pro-Slavery men had made gains in the battle over Kansas, the battle was in no way over.  To win the battle, the Pro-Slavery men would need heightened support from the rest of the South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to giving money to the cause, the Picayune said that more settlers from the South would need to relocate to Kansas in order to strengthen the territory's base of Pro-Slavery men.  Not only were more southern settlers needed, but ones with substantial numbers of slaves.  Though the newspaper largely failed in enticing established, wealthy plantation owners to migrate to lesser known territory to ensure the implementation of slavery, these same plantation owners sympathized with the cause.  The fact that the Pro-Slavery Party elected New Orleans to manage their affairs and that the Daily Picayune promoted the cause of the Pro-Slavery men in Kansas shows the solidarity felt in the entire south over the topic of slavery."],"display_date":"November 7, 1856","search_date":"1856-11-07","locations":[{"id":5598,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":85,"title":"Seminole Chief Billy Bowlegs and His Tribe Refuses to Leave Florida\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1832, the Seminole tribe in Florida entered into a treaty with the state agreeing to emigrate west of the Mississippi within three years or extend the period by which they were permitted to remain within the state.

Manifest destiny is the idea that it was God's will that the United States expand throughout the whole of the continent (though not by force) to spread liberty and democracy.  O'Sullivan's second use of the term, in the <em>New York Morning News</em> on February 27, 1845, was extremely influential.  With this use, he discussed what he believed was the right of the United States instead of the British to claim Oregon Country.  With the expansion of American territory inevitably came the disagreements as to whether or not expansion should include the institution of slavery, and where: after early 1846, Democrats enthusiastically adopted the phrase for their use.  The idea of manifest destiny was also used in many instances to justify displacement of the American Indians throughout the continent.The use of the term manifest destiny in propaganda and publications promoting westward expansion had long-term, lasting effects on the United States.  Manifest destiny was a major rationale behind the Mexican War of 1846-1848, after which Americans gained Alta California and Nuevo Mexico.  New industrial empires sprung up in the West, especially with the gold rush in the newly acquired California in 1849.  Once the U.S. had control of Oregon Country from the British, it was found to be as rich and fertile as imagined.  After the Civil War, the philosophy of manifest destiny helped to promote the westward movement of the population after the emancipation of slaves.  In some situations, manifest destiny is even discussed today, for some Canadians believe that the United States may still have the somewhat hidden goal of annexing Canadian land."],"display_date":"February 27, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-27","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":106,"title":"11th President James K.

Railroads offered the ability to traverse the difficult geography of the South, offering opportunities to expand trade and develop local economies into regional ones. Railroads fostered the spread of the cotton culture because it allowed farmers in more remote areas to transport their crop to a city center where it could be sold. According to the authors, while railroad mileage in the South doubled in the fifteen years between 1865 and 1880, the boom increased in the final two decades of the century with mileage tripling between 1880 and 1900.&lt;br /&gt;While railroads clearly offered many opportunities in the South, Cooper and Terrill argue that, by the 1890s, the result was too much of a good thing'.

The immigrants would pay a fee for each family member for traveling expenses from New York to South Carolina.

The boom in railroad reconstruction in the South coupled with successful westward expansion projects such as the Union Pacific Railroad had caused investors and speculators to bet heavily on new transportation projects (like a second transcontinental railroad, the Northern Pacific).  Once Cooke realized his firm had overextended itself financially in rail investments and was unable to meet its debt obligations (loans), he had to declare bankruptcy.  Fearing more defaults, banks around the country began calling in loans, causing more firms and investors to default, cutting off the rail industry's cash flow, causing more banks to call in more loans, and so on to cause a major financial depression; the New York Stock Exchange was closed for 10 days.  Between 1873 and 1879, employment reached a high of 14%, 89 of the nation's 364 railroads went under, and 18,000 businesses failed.  &lt;br /&gt;The aftershocks of the financial crash were soon felt in the Deep South, despite initially hopeful reporting that the worst has been seen;In Petersburg, Virginia several banks have been suspended; But off in the South and West no trouble is apprehended save some monetary stringency for a while' (Atlanta Constitution September 25).  The diary of a Northern Pacific Railroad employee named Thomas Rosser reveals the profound and rapid downward spiral Cooke's default initiated.  On September 18, 1873, Rosser learned; that Jay Cooke & Co. had failed. and [sic] the future of our co. is dark and uncertain.'  By October 13, less than one month later, the railroad had to send Rosser to Fargo in the Dakota Territories to represent the company at an auction sale to liquidate the last of the Northern Pacific's quartermaster dept. [property].'  In Rosser's words, the Northern Pacific [was] uttering its last gasp.'  The Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad soon joined the Northern Pacific in bankruptcy; by mid-November it was in the hands of receivers appointed by the Circuit Court of the United States, sitting at Mobile' (Montgomery Daily Advertiser).&lt;br /&gt;In this context of financial failure, Southern whites found it easy to blame Republican politicians in Washington and in their state governments, which in many cases had promised state funds to rebuild war-ravaged railways throughout the region (over 10 million alone to three North Carolina railroads).  The repercussions of the Panic reached across the South, as financial malcontent coupled with Republican corruption, lingering Civil War hostilities, and racial polarization lead to the North's retreat from Radical Reconstruction, making way for the Bourbon Redemption in 1876.  The South's large and influential agricultural sector took an especially large hit in the months following Northern investment failures, hurting black and white alike.  Crop prices dropped sharply: in just six short months, cotton prices fell by 50%, from around 20 cents per pound in July 1873 to just 10 cents per pound by December (prices quoted in the Atlanta Constitution). The double-whammy of a precipitous decline in profitability and steady deflation caused by a shortage of gold with which to back currency (the U.S. was still on the gold standard at the time) meant that farmers' debts were becoming more expensive at the same time that their crops were bringing in less money to pay those debts.  Property sales and bankruptcies were common, leading farmers to unite their collective woes and demand government aid, touching off the rapid expansion of the Grange Movement and the entrenchment of sharecropping."],"display_date":"September 25, 1873 - December 31, 1879","search_date":"1876-11-11","locations":[{"id":14181,"lat":37.1906306855,"lng":-77.2352563232,"zoom":10,"place":"Prince Georges, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":315,"title":"Southern Historical Society moves to Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-08-14","end_date":"1873-08-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["From its 1869 establishment in New Orleans, the Southern Historical Society sought to establish a branch in every southern state, but membership was low in the first four years of the its existence.

Most of the delegates to the convention had been prominent Confederate supporters (Virginia ex-Governor John Letcher) or former Confederate military officers; South Carolina's delegation was certainly dripping with Southern brass, naming Generals Butler, Kershaw, Conner, Hagood, Bonham, and McGowah, and Colonel McIver' as representatives.  &lt;br /&gt;The convention delegates adopted a number of resolutions which would shape the SHS's future influence.

Unlike most slaves, Douglass was literate and could therefore taste the pleasures of freedom. This desire was also augmented by his location in the upper south.  While such a position eased some of the burdens of bondage,' it also increased one's knowledge of potential autonomy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Douglass's account of his mind state prior to the escape is particularly instructive.  In his narrative he describes the conflicting emotions and pulls to both remain a slave, and attempt escape.  He comments that, like other slaves, his knowledge of geography and the distance of his escape route was largely unknown - slave owners portrayed slave territory as endless.  However, lack of a secure plan and potential danger could not outweigh the appeals of freedom, regardless of its remote possibility.  In reference to his mentality and that of his coconspirators, Douglass writes, I believe there was not one among us who would not rather have been shot down than pass away life in hopeless bondage.'  It is clear that the privilege of education played a role in such an assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The future impact of Douglass's escape was pervasive.  A skilled and artful author, the writings of Douglass were able to strike an emotional chord with nearly all those who read them.  Douglass released an influential autobiography in 1845, and soon after founded an abolitionist newspaper, the North Star.'  During the Civil War, he served as an advisor to president Lincoln.  Today, nearly all students of racial history read his powerful accounts.  However, his 1838 escape is an example of an event that remained under the contemporary radar.

Despite these efforts, the Indian question remained unresolved after Jefferson Davis' term as Secretary expired.&lt;br /&gt;Indian removal had been a frequent occurrence throughout American history and often resulted in violence.

Bobo's church was located slightly south of Spartanburg, and his followers came from nearly every local plantation to hear him preach.  Toward the end of July, Bobo's significant congregation had gathered for a kind of revival' which by August 5th had culminated in one of the greatest religious demonstrations ever seen in this country.'  Whites thought the preacher's passionate exhortations, urging his flock to sell all their belongings and follow him at the appointed time, were the ravings of a madman; black churchgoers thought he was the new prophet high in favor' who would lead the children of Zion' to the Promised Land, which he claimed was just 160 miles to the east. &lt;br /&gt;During the first week of August, Bobo announced that the command to march had been received,' and as soon as the oldest member of the group was sacrificed, they would leave Spartanburg.  With a show of violence, local whites managed to save the elderly black woman (who was not opposed to the idea) selected as the group's martyr, foiling one part of Bobo's rather bizarre plan.  Undeterred, his followers immediately sold off the majority of their possessions, packed up their children and food in a single wagon, and began their march.  Witnesses interviewed by the News and Courier reported that, On the march several attempts were made to dissuade them from their folly, but without turning to the right or left, with eyes upturned they went on without making any answers. The last heard of them they were crossing the mountains in the direction of Tennessee.'  &lt;br /&gt;Although Bobo's revival and march were not intended to shed white blood, as Turner's did, several elements in this rather peculiar event merit comparison with Nat Turner's 1831 uprising.  Turner's religiously-inspired prophesies and declarations were dubbed insane by whites, who fearing any show of black independence and leadership, did everything they could to discredit him.  Forty-two years later, the same thing happened in South Carolina to Bobo; the paper dubbed him a Negro of gross ignorance; of very loose morals' whose followers were poor deluded creatures.'  Again, white Carolinians seem to have missed the importance of Bobo's flight: he was leading freedmen out of the land of their enslavement, away from their former masters, toward a new life of possibility.  The Biblical analogy of a prophet leading the Israelites away from Egypt signifies the importance of religion to the black community, much as Turner proclaimed himself a prophet in 1831.  It is, of course, entirely possible that the black mystic named Bobo who led sixty fellow freedmen away from Spartanburg was completely insane; regardless, the event is an important indicator of the continuity of the role of religion in Southern black communities and the mistrust which unexpected black action inspired in the white population."],"display_date":"August 5, 1873 - August 8, 1873","search_date":"1873-08-06","locations":[{"id":11648,"lat":34.9591922676,"lng":-81.9357757115,"zoom":9,"place":"SPARTANBURG, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":349,"title":"The Virginius Affair\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-10-31","end_date":"1873-11-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Virginius was a former Confederate blockade runner which had been captured by the Union during the American Civil War.  A Northerner, John Patterson, purchased the Virginius from the government, and, unbeknownst to the New York Customs House, planned to use the ship to take supplies and men to Cuban insurgents fighting the Ten Years' War with Spain.  The Ten Years' War was the Cuban war for independence which lasted from 1868-1878; the last three months of the conflict would escalate to become the Spanish-American War. On October 31, 1873 in international waters near Jamaica, a Spanish naval vessel took the Virginius (which was flying the American flag) and its passengers and crew into custody.  There were 52 American and English crewmen, and around 100 Cuban passengers.  On November 4 in Santiago de Cuba, the Spanish summarily tried and executed 53 of the Virginius's crew, including the ship's commanding officer and former Confederate Captain Joseph Fry, as well as some passengers who turned out to be insurgents.&lt;br /&gt;Americans were outraged at the news; it was inconceivable that Spain would dare to board a vessel flying the U.S. flag in international waters, then impound and execute most of the crew.  Southerners were especially angry at the death of the ship's captain, an upright gentleman' and native Floridian; melancholy obituaries of the Captain who supported the secession of Florida from the Federal Union, and served throughout the war in the navy of the Confederate States' appeared in papers across the South.  In exchange for the loss of such a man, ever ready to espouse the cause of liberty,' Southerners wanted justice: The blood of Captain Fry and his comrades has not been shed in vain. From all over this country will go up a cry for vengeance upon their murderers, and Cuba soon be free Cuba.'&lt;br /&gt;Even after the news came out that the Virginius had flown the American flag illegally, tensions were high between the U.S. and British and Spain.  However, on December 8, Spain agreed to release the remaining prisoners, return the Virginius to the United States.  In 1875, the Spain paid an indemnity of 80,000 to the American and British governments in apology for the execution of American and British citizens two years earlier.  Though the Virginius incident rallied Southern pride, it also lit a fire of nationalism in the United States, a prelude to the rise of nativism later in the century, and sowed a seed of discord between the American and Spanish governments which would yield the Spanish-American War a few years later."],"display_date":"October 31, 1873 - November 8, 1873","search_date":"1873-11-03","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":353,"title":"Labor Strikes in the Upper South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-11-05","end_date":"1877-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the mid- and late-nineteenth century, railroads and supporting businesses like iron and steel rolling were the nation's largest industrial employers. When the Panic of 1873 began causing financial problems for railroads, many had to cut wages and lower their orders from iron, steel, and cement suppliers; others, like the Northern Pacific, went bankrupt and ceased production immediately.  Subsidiary industries, in turn, were forced to cut their own employees' wages and hours or shut down.  In the face of cuts on all sides, workers began to use their only real defense: strikes.&lt;br /&gt;The Upper South was a hotbed of rail-building activity after the Civil War because so much of the fighting and, consequently, the destruction, had taken place in border states.  Additionally, parts of the Upper South were less agrarian than areas like the Black Belt and Carolina low country, making states like Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee more likely to turn to industrial employment.  These factors taken in conjunction with the Panic of 1873 produced a number of labor-relations problems.  In Louisville, the steel-rolling and iron-molding mills were forced to close as workers protested recent wage reductions and shift cuts, putting over 400 men out of work at the rolling mill alone.  The cement mills also had to shut down as a result of having large stocks and light sales,' the classic marks of a recession.  Just to the south, southern railroad company leaders met in Chattanooga to form a united front and face down aggressive strike tactics by workers, while also affirming the justice of any reasonable reduction of wages by companies.'  In Knoxville, the East Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia Railroad attempted to deal with striking employees who insisted on riding trains to prevent scabs from doing their jobs, while the Knoxville and Ohio line was forced to temporarily [cease] all trains,' the result of a total strike by its workers.  &lt;br /&gt;Railroad companies' financial difficulties caused by the Panic got much worse before they got better.  Consequently, the labor situation for subsidiary industries and rail workers kept deteriorating.  The freefall hit bottom in a wave of strikes in 1877, after which the economy and rail industries began their slow recovery.  The Panic affected all parts of Southern society, not just cotton farmers and political leaders, causing widespread malcontent which in the case of Tennessee and Kentucky, manifested itself through strikes and aggressive negotiations with the business elite.  The power of unions to halt production and at least have their demands heard by business leaders was not lost on employees at the time, setting the stage for the age of the union in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century."],"display_date":"November 5, 1873 - December 31, 1877","search_date":"1875-12-03","locations":[{"id":12157,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":387,"title":"Kentucky&#39;s Senate passes joint resolution to colonize &#147;free people of color&#39;\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-01-01","end_date":"1829-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In January, the Cherokee Phoenix and Indians' Advocate reported the outcome of the Kentucky State Senate's Joint Resolution. There were only three dissenting votes against these two measures. The first measure urged Kentucky's statesmen in Washington to endeavor Congress to appropriate money and aid, so far is consistent with the Constitution of the United States, in colonizing the free people of color' in Africa. The second measure stated that Kentucky's Governor should send a copy of the previous resolution to all the States' Governors and Statesmen. Since whites were very suspicious of free blacks and loathed the very idea of coexisting with them, Kentucky's action was very typical of this time period. To solve this problem humanely, many advocated colonization of freed blacks and many colonization societies were founded to promote this idea. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An example of one of these colonization societies was founded in December of 1829 in Nashville, Tennessee. To promote the formation and expansion of colonies of free slaves in Africa, many prominent Nashvillians joined together and formed the Tennessee Colonization Society. Philip Lindsley, head of the University of Nashville, was made president of the society. This event reveals that anti-slavery sentiment had already made its way into the south by 1829 and that prominent citizens were beginning to take a philanthropic view towards slaves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few people knew what to do with the rising number of free people of color and even fewer people knew what to do about the moral issue of slavery. During this period there was a flourishing of Colonization societies and colonization sentiment because colonization was seen as a humane solution to the free black problem.' In other words, the people of the United States, especially the South, could not imagine a society of peacefully coexisting free blacks and whites, and colonization was seen as a humane way to avoid a race war. Unfortunately, the resettlement and transportation of former slaves to Africa was not only costly but few slaves desired to make the perilous and long journey. Due to being highly unfeasible and costing a great deal, colonization never became a widespread practice."],"display_date":"January 1, 1829 - January 30, 1829","search_date":"1829-01-15","locations":[{"id":4822,"lat":38.1429651724,"lng":-84.9082120384,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":395,"title":"Black Women Agitate for Civil Rights on the Railroads\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-10-02","end_date":"1881-10-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 2, 1881, Mrs. Harding, the wife of a upstanding black man, was initially denied access to the ladies car on the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad.  She ordered the assistance of General Manager Thomas, who promptly ordered that a separate car be arranged for her.  Harding refused to enter the separate car and filed a law suit against the company.  Later that afternoon, a black organist, Miss McLemore, attempted to board the ladies coach of the Lousiville and Nashville Depot, but she was denied access until all of the white passengers had been switched to a different car.  Like Mrs. Harding, McLemore refused to enter after the events took place.    &lt;br /&gt;In 1881, half of Tennessee's lower house was occupied by Republicans, four of whom were blacks.  The blacks had previously attempted to overturn a law instituted in 1875 that prohibited blacks from suing discriminatory railroads.  They failed by a narrow margin, and their attempt was immediately followed by the 1881 segregation statute that required railroad companies to provide separate cars for first-class black passengers.  The statute ordered that the black passengers must abide by the same rules issued to the white passengers, and it stated that the new cars must be properly maintained. The statute was significant in that it proceeded Plessy vs. Ferguson in being the first of the separate-but-equal law.  &lt;br /&gt;Railroad segregation played a major role in Southern history as railroads became the reluctant scenes of the first state-wide segregation laws in the South.  Travel by railroads allowed for blacks and whites to ride in close proximity, which upset many white Southerners.  They feared that close interaction would enable the blacks to rise in society, and they felt a need to extend the color line into daily life.  Many states established railroad segregation laws to do so.  The railroad companies were not eager to enforce such laws.  The laws complicated their job, and they would have preferred interracial seating.  &lt;br /&gt;Ayers notes that, in reality, the Tennessee statute in 1881 did not require segregation; it merely required that railroads provide separate but equal accomodations that blacks had the priveledge to enter and occupy.''

Hill, a Missouri creamery owner, produced 43,500 pounds of butter in 1890.  He sold all of his butter in the eastern market.  Increasing railroad building and growing connections with places like Edina, Missouri made possible the sale of agricultural products across the country.  While some like Hill thrived because of this more open trade, others opposed the expansion of markets.  They believed railroads brought more outside goods and competition within the local market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making profits from butter production was not unique to Missouri.  Raising cattle and butter production played an important part of the livelihood for G. Pearce Wood, a farmer in Decatur County, Georgia.  Wood made such a name for himself that an Atlanta newspaper interviewed him and shared some of his techniques.  Over the course of the year in 1889, Wood sold 2,100 pounds of butter for a total of 630.  His neighbor's production and profits amounted to about the same.  Wood not only used the grade Jersey cows' milk production for butter but also to feed his hogs thereby increasing their value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the commercial aspects of dairy farming covered in the Atlanta newspaper, a North Carolina newspaper published an article detailing the steps in making butter.  According to the article, temperature maintenance remained one of the crucial considerations in making good butter.  The article instructed the farmer to not jab your finger in [the butter] and say it is just right, use a dairy thermometer.'  The article also recognized the growing commercialism in dairy farming and ends with instructions for the packaging and shipping of the butter.  It instructed the reader to [p]ress into one pound cakes with a butter press, with some plain stamp on it, and wrap each cake separately in parchment paper, place it in a tin can send to market.

The need for railroads, canals and roads was a necessary complement to the rapid territorial expansion of the U.S.  In addition, commercial centers with limited access to waterways needed land transportation in order to grow and compete with better-situated towns and cities.  On the same day that the county court of Fayette, Kentucky appointed delegates to the convention, it authorized 15,500 to aid in the completion of all the Turnpike roads within the county.'  Thus the convention was only one of many steps towards the building of infrastructure in the South.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Kentucky Gazette reported, From the beginning to the close of the Convention, the very best spirit seemed to animate all hearts.  Party politics were neither spoken of nor alluded to.'  There was some little jealousy' between the Carolinas, Georgia and Alabama regarding the proposed route of the railroad, but a Kentucky delegate by the name of Wickliffe offered up various resolutions that gave universal satisfaction.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delegates agreed on a plan to construct a line connecting Charleston to Knoxville.  For Georgia and lower East Tennessee, though, universal satisfaction' was not exactly achieved.   The agreed-upon route would run through the southeast corner of North Carolina, along the French Broad River.  But this required passing through the mountainous Cumberland Gap area, which their own route took pains to avoid.  Georgia disliked the plan so much that it made separate plans to build a road from Atlanta to Chattanooga.  This line would eventually come to be known as the Western and Atlantic Railroad."],"display_date":"July 4, 1836 - July 8, 1836","search_date":"1836-07-06","locations":[{"id":12153,"lat":36.0086650052,"lng":-83.9297656575,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":474,"title":"Potentially Fatal Train Wreck near Ivanhoe, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-06-14","end_date":"1890-06-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Saturday, June 14, 1890, a serious accident between a passenger train and material train occurred on the Cripple Creek division of the Norfolk and Western railroad near Ivanhoe, Virginia.

The passenger train apparently ran under no such order and continued toward Ivanhoe.  The trains came around a curve and collided with each other.

After the Civil War, efforts were renewed to construct a southern transcontinental railroad.  In order to do so, the Texas and Pacific Railway Company, which had received a federal charter in 1871, was granted permission to build tracks from Marshall, Texas to San Diego, California.  However, controversy arose with a California-based line, the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, over claims to the tracks between El Paso and Yuma.  Both companies competed to obtain the best route.  &lt;br /&gt;Negotiations between the two companies began in November.  Jay Gould signed an agreement on behalf of the Southwestern railroads in mid-November, and, on November 26, 1881, with the signature of C.P. Huntington, the companies reached a formal compromise.  Labeled the Gould-Huntington Agreement, the compromise provided the Texas Pacific with the desired tracks.  In turn, it limited claims of the Texas Pacific to no further than the Sierra Nevada and provided for a joint-track system for the line to El Paso.  The two systems met one hundred miles to the east of El Paso, and they were instructed to share the stretch equally. &lt;br /&gt;Railroads greatly impacted the South in positive and negative ways.  They served as a primary mode of transportation, and the transcontinental passage increased the interconnectedness of the Southern states.  Problems arose, however, when cities were built along railroad lines, which led to overcrowding conditions and health problems.  The railroads also spurred controversy as they brought people of all races and classes into close proximity.  Although the railroad companies were not in favor of segregating their lines, the railroads became the first sight of state-wide segregation laws."],"display_date":"November 26, 1881","search_date":"1881-11-26","locations":[{"id":13257,"lat":30.3347220867,"lng":-97.7818662757,"zoom":9,"place":"TRAVIS, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":488,"title":"Baltimore and Ohio Railroad compete against Pennsylvania Central\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-01-13","end_date":"1874-01-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As reported in Baltimore's The Sun a fight between the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Pennsylvania Central Railroad produced reduced ticket rates between the cities of Chicago, Cincinnati, and St. Louis on one side and Pittsburg, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington D.C. on the other.

Honorable Joseph Segar, a delegate from the Chamber of Commerce in Norfolk, Virginia made a speech during the convention to appeal for a waterway to be created in Virginia.  Segar argued that the minority opinion, led by Illinois, who wanted to expand the Illinois Canal and improve the Illinois River as well as other rivers in the area were overlooking the benefits of a waterway in Virginia.  Segar contended that the James and Kanawha Rivers in Virginia would be the ideal place to build a canal because of the route's access to Eastern ports and the West.  Segar said that this shortest, quickest, safest, and cheapest water-way is as much entitled to a recommendation from the convention and favoring notice of Congress' as is the Illinois plan. Segar pointed out that cheap transportation would help connect alienated sections' of the country because it would open up lines of social and economic communication.  Hon.

In 1820, the Creeks were being paid 25,000, but 22,000 was set to expire in 1829. The Creeks that did emigrate settled in the area of Muskogee County, Oklahoma. In typical U.S. style, 300 US troops were positioned near the peaceful emigrants (Phoenix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1829, the number of Creeks that had already emigrated west of the Mississippi was about 1400.

The Cherokee Phoenix and Indians' Advocate believed that the Creeks had a greater disposition to emigrate, than among the Cherokees; and it is possible that the whole tribe will at length consent to remove. Sadly, though, many Creeks had sought to become civilized' as they had been told by the United States, and many had even become wealthy slave and plantation owners.

At this time there were over 1000 slaves in Texas, so Houston obviously fought the application of this proclamation in Texas, and in December he succeeded. By the end of 1829 immigration was booming. In November and December alone, 153 new families immigrated to Texas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after hearing of the suspension of the decree he wrote his brother-in-law, again urging him to move to Texas. I have never been so thoroughly convinced as I now am of the future rapid rise of this country;.This is the most liberal and munificent Gov. on earth to emigrants.

An immense sum' had been paid to Spain for Florida in 1821, and the territory had been a messy place since, marked by recurring wars with the Seminoles.  As Senator Strange of North Carolina said, the Indians might be whipped, but unfortunately for the country they would not stay whipped.'  The Florida War with the Seminoles had begun in 1835 with the Dade massacre and the ambush of a small force of Americans.  This had convinced the United States government of the need to take more serious actions in Florida.  In 1840, after five years of war, the United States government was getting tired of its failure to subdue the territory.  Accordingly, the Senate was debating measures designed to settle Florida in a more permanent and forceful manner.  &lt;br /&gt;The American reported that the Senate deliberated upon a bill granting up to 10,000 white settlers a bounty of three hundred and twenty acres of land each.'  The men would have to be able and willing to fight, and they would be organized into camps for the purpose of claiming and protecting their own areas of land.  This bill was opposed by Senator Crittenden of Kentucky, who argued that it was not worth maintaining the United States Army in Florida to protect a mass of settlers who would not be establishing farms and homesteads.  Meanwhile, the federal government would be responsible for feeding and clothing these settlers.  He proposed instead that bounties be offered for each Indian killed.  Reports of numbers of Indians killed and the manner in which they died continued to appear in newspapers throughout 1840.  The military forces in Florida even imported bloodhounds from Cuba to hunt down Indians for deportation.&lt;br /&gt;In July, a bill for the admission of Florida as a state came before Congress.  Congress would admit Florida as soon as it reached the requisite population of 30,000.  A second bill also made its way to the Senate floor, this one calling for Florida to be split into two territories and then admitted as two states.  The Charleston Mercury suggested that this bill had been written by abolitionists with the intent of delaying statehood for years so that anti-slavery settlers could flood the territory in the meantime, eventually turning at least one of the halves into a free state.  A free state at the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico was something which the Mercury could hardly live at peace with.'  It would be a Botany Bay for superfluous Tappans and Garrisons so near us , better to have the Seminoles.'

Increasing railroad rates, along with other economic hardships throughout the eighties, pushed citizens to ask for more government control over corporations in general, but the railroads especially. Although Governor John Young Brown refused to sign the bill he found too strict,' the bill was passed, outlawing extortion by the railroad. Investigations, court trials, and fines were all possible punishments to a railroad corporation suspected of or found guilty of extortion. For the next seven years, Kentucky legislators fought a fierce battle over railroad regulations. &lt;br /&gt;William Goebel, a Democratic Kentucky Senator, was well-known all over Kentucky for fighting for the common man. After Republican Governor Bradley was elected in 1895, Goebel, then a Senator, realized the discontent among the economically-separated Kentucky Democrats and stood up as their leader. When the McChord Bill, a very strict and thorough bill to control railroad activities, was submitted to Congress in 1898, Goebel was a strong supporter. However, Republican control of the assembly led the bill to be vetoed. In January of 1900, after Goebel had won the election for Governor of Kentucky, Goebel re-introduced the McChord Bill into the Democrat-controlled Senate. By March of 1900, the McChord Bill, lessening the railroads' control over the common man of Kentucky, became a law. On January 1, 1900, as William Goebel was making his way to the state capitol office building along with 2 other politicians, a gunshot was fired and Goebel fell to the ground. Five days later, he was dead. Goebel was assassinated only six weeks before the McChord Bill was enacted. &lt;br /&gt;The McChord Bill was quite a controversial piece of legislation in Kentucky according to the Louisville Courier-Journal, stating that no other measure before the General Assembly for many years past has been so bitterly and persistently opposed by corporate influences' (1). Until this point, railroads had possessed the power to charge their customers whatever rates they pleased and to change those rates at any time because railroads were the most efficient way to travel for most people. The McChord Bill put a strict control on railroads and the money they were to make for the first time. Railroad owners had reason not to be pleased with this control."],"display_date":"April 5, 1893","search_date":"1893-04-05","locations":[{"id":4829,"lat":38.2391019422,"lng":-84.877038419,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":751,"title":"March 3, 1893 act of Congress to aid Cherokee Nation, NC","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-03-03","end_date":"1893-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 3, 1893 Congress passed an act to allow for a training school for the remaining citizens of the Cherokee Nation in North Carolina.

The resolution, written by Witten McDonald, goes on to give the United States government the range of reasons why possessing the land would be beneficial, including arguments such as the sooner the Indian is surrounded with the guardianship of laws which protect the weak, the better for him' (3), as well as because every branch of financial and industrial business in the East would feel perceptibly the increase of markets which an opening of the Cherokee outlet would afford' (4).

In the wake of the economic exploitation of the sharecropping system, as well as the political repression and racial violence in Southern states following the end of reconstruction, many in the African-American working class responded to the movement by organizing public meetings to encourage and facilitate migration.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time many nationally prominent African-Americans, including Frederick Douglass, urged the African-American public not to join the exoduster movement and to remain in the South. These messages were echoed by local African-American leaders who sometimes came to exoduster meetings to urge potential exodusters to stay in their home towns.  This occurred on December 8, 1879 when former congressman Jeff Long urged attendees at meeting in Forsyth, Georgia not to leave for the North.  For their part, the organizations headed by the white economic elite from Louisville Kentucky, to East Carroll Parish, Louisiana, sought to repress the movement by concocting dubious stories about the suffering of blacks in Northern states, and by making accommodations with their black workers.  Ultimately, the exoduster movement not only presaged the great black migrations to the North in the early 20th century, but also achieved in gaining concessions from the white power structure such as lower rent rates, and usage fees for equipment for AfricanAmerican sharecroppers."],"display_date":"December 16, 1879","search_date":"1879-12-16","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1034,"title":"James Eads&#39;s Mississippi river jetty system completed\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-07-08","end_date":"1879-07-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After five years of construction, James Eads jetty system officially succeeded by lowering the depth of the Mississippi river to 30 feet at its mouth.

Ultimately, these improvements would allow New Orleans to become a leading shipping hub of the South and improve the efficiency of commerce on the Mississippi river.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreover, this improvement was only one instance of the growing role of both state governments and the federal government in promoting infrastructure projects designed to promote commerce on the Mississippi river.  For example Articles 213 and 214 of the Louisiana constitution of 1879 mandated a state run system to promote and regulate the construction of levies designed to protect settlements and waterways from flooding along the Mississippi river.  On a larger scale, the creation of the Mississippi river commission sought to create a national policy for promotion of commerce.  On October 16, 1879 in Quincy, Illinois, the commission discussed their numerous recommendations to the federal government.  Their recommendations included the creation of a reservoir system in the upper Mississippi valley, and a prohibition on construction of wharves and water mills by private businesses and local communities designed to curb the formation debris and sandbars along the river.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, these improvements constituted only one part of the massive projects being envisioned by advocates of government infrastructure investment.

As the Richmond Enquirer notes on May 25, the Act technically did not require the Indians to relocate and that they were not to be unfeelingly driven across the Mississippi.' Instead, the President was allowed to designate land west of the Mississippi that was not part of an existing state. Moreover, Indians choosing to relocate would be reimbursed for any improvements made on their lands and, according to the Enquirer, were to be aided in their transportation and to receive subsistence for the first year.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primary force behind this Act were southern states such as Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi who had large Indian populations within their boundaries and who were conflicting with the Indians over matters such as rights to natural resources, settlement, and legal jurisdiction. These conflicts came to a boiling point in Georgia especially, where the discovery of gold within Cherokee territory sparked a huge rush of miners to the area. This brought to light an equally important issue of legal jurisdiction over the Indian territories, which to this point retained some degree of independence despite state government claims of sovereignty. In the Niles' Weekly Register, for example, Georgia Governor George Gilmer is quoted as saying that the powers vested in the executive department by the constitution and laws do not sufficiently enable the governor to remove or restrain such trespassers.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Indian Removal Act sought to put an end to these conflicts, therefore, by relocating Native American tribes and ensuring states sovereignty over the lands within their boundaries. In a letter to Congress reprinted in The Globe, a Washington D.C. newspaper, President Andrew Jackson justifies the Act saying that it will separate the Indians from immediate contact with settlements of whites;; (and) enable them to pursue happiness in their own way, and under their own crude institutions.' Despite removal being voluntary, however, in saying the Indians have crude institutions' and later in calling them savage tribes,' Jackson's letter shows the latent racism of many American whites. It is this racism and the desire for access to the rich lands occupied by Indian tribes that eventually led to forced removal and events such as the Trail of Tears.'"],"display_date":"May 28, 1830","search_date":"1830-05-28","locations":[{"id":6076,"lat":39.603674835,"lng":-77.8141711851,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1046,"title":"Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-09-27","end_date":"1830-09-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek was signed between the Choctaw Indians of Mississippi and the U.S. Federal Government on September 27, 1830. Dancing Rabbit Creek was the first official treaty signed under the Indian Removal Act of 1830, an Act which allowed the President to negotiate with Indian tribes living within the boundaries of existing U.S. states to voluntarily exchange their lands for unorganized territory west of the Mississippi River -- mostly in what is now Oklahoma -- as well as to be assisted in the move and to be reimbursed for any improvements on the abandoned lands. This treaty is of great significance because it started the process of Indian Removal to the mid-West, at least on a more centralized, federal level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specifically, the main tenet of Dancing Rabbit Creek treaty was to exchange the 11 million acres of land in Mississippi currently occupied by the Choctaw tribe for approximately 15 million acres of land in what is now Oklahoma. Interestingly, an article in the Richmond Enquirer on September 14, 1830, states that it was at the request of the Indians' that negotiations were opened. The Enquirer goes on to note we are glad to hear' of the presence of the Secretary of War at the negotiation -- a comment which says a great deal about the sentiments of many Americans at the time should Native-Americans decide not to accept voluntary' exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Removal Act and subsequent treaties such as Dancing Rabbit Creek were designed to lessen tensions between white American who were pushing into Indian territories, and to resolve boundary and jurisdictional disputes between Indians and the governments of the states in which they resided. As President Andrew Jackson puts it in a letter to Congress reprinted in The Globe on December 7, 1830, the waves of population and civilization are rolling to the westward; and we now propose to acquire the countries occupied by the red men of the south and west by a fair exchange.'

By 1869, only four thousand African American families had attempted to use the act and most of the land ended up being settled by whites working for the logging industry.

Water and boats were the only adequate forms of transportation and ultimately trade. As a cycle of reinforcement, water transport promoted trade and trade promoted water transport. Soon, with the implementation of newer materials, lighter resources and fresher ideas, boats become better and faster then before. Access to a body of water was so necessary to means of living in the 18th Century that the upper class would buy isolated houses on the water front. As long as they had access to water they did not need neighbors. &lt;br /&gt;Soon thereafter railways and trains were built and a new industrialized form of trade emerged into the South. Railroads soon became another medium of trade, though not as reliable or as fast as one would have liked. The greatness of employing trains, however, meant that resources and commodities could be found and transported to places within the states that were not on or near a body of water. In 1844, iron was implemented for both railroads and underground railroads. Southern States that bordered water, had previously relied on steam boats and water for essential transportation needs. Now, they had a fast and reliable alternate form of transport. &lt;br /&gt;Railroads provided for more unity within the states, whereby people could travel across the country for leisure. It also provided an accessible method for transporting goods and commodities for trade, such as bringing sugar from the south up to the north, which boosted the economy. This improvement also enhanced the infrastructure of America. More importantly though, the railroads were now an easier way for slaves to escape their masters and oppressed lifestyles. Blacks knew that if they made it to the North or Canada, help awaited them. Underground railroads began to flourish all over the country.

In some cases, US explorers tried to live alongside Native-Americans who called the West their home, but hostility from both peoples often caused conflict.

On January 15, 1820, Secretary of War J. C. Calhoun wrote to Speaker of the House Clay of the progress' that had been made thus far in this endeavor.  &lt;br /&gt;The widely held view of the Indians as savages' was distorted by embellished tales about their violent acts, such as an account of murders in The Clarion and Tennessee Gazette.

Congress made appropriations of ten thousand dollars annually to aid in advancing Indian societies in the US.  An additional emphasis of the efforts to conform the Native-Americans was establishing schools, and Calhoun mentioned the Cherokee as a relatively civilized people because they had already launched two successful schools.

The writer used primary evidence to make the argument that those who criticized Southerners for upholding the institution of slavery were hypocritical because many of them made money from illegal importation of slaves overseas, the act that produced this servitude (Alexandria).'  The transportation and selling of slaves from West Africa, or any other country, was officially outlawed in 1808 as a response to Northern persistence.  Nevertheless, between that time and 1860, the South illegally imported over 250,000 slaves.  &lt;br /&gt;This crime had become a major topic of controversy, especially earlier in the year in which the Herald published its article.

The US government required copies of communication about bringing slaves into the country since 1816.  Thompson's letter contained a few short letters he received about suspicious activity on the seas, as well as instructions he had sent in January, 1819, to all the commanding naval officers to make them aware of the illicit activity.  &lt;br /&gt;The Alexandria Herald correctly pointed out that though Northerners began to abolish slavery within their borders and speak out against the institution, it was frequently the shippers and merchants from those same states who engaged in the slave trade.  The moral ideals of the North were undermined by the economic mindset of these traders, looking to profit from illegal slave imports for the South.  The newspaper backed its accusation by reporting a recent capture of a Rhode Island schooner with a full cargo of slaves.

The United States hoped to expand white settlement specifically in Mississippi, the Choctaw homeland.  In return for the Choctaw land, President Monroe agreed to a cession of about one-fifth of the state of Arkansas, encompassing sixteen counties.  In addition to ceding Southwestern Arkansas, the US gave up the southern half of Oklahoma, parts of the Texan panhandle,' and into New Mexico.  Jackson and Hinds made provisions to supply the Choctaw with blankets, kettles, and enough ammunition for a year in order to help the resettlement.  &lt;br /&gt;In an October 7 Arkansas Gazette article, before the treaty was written, the author clearly portrayed an attitude of white superiority over the Indians.  The author painted the picture that the whites were doing the Choctaw a favor, by being willing to let the owners of the country sell what they please.'  It is certainly not clear from this biased account that the Choctaw, as were most other Indian tribes, were actually pressured into the deal and felt as if they had little alternative.  On December 9, another Gazette report , written during the Treaty's proceedings , gave the most current information it had.  Without guaranteeing its accuracy, it presented the rumor that the treaty lately concluded with the Choctaws is very unpopular with that nation, and that they have openly shown their disapprobation by cutting off the head of their principal Chief, who had been instrumental in making the treaty.'&lt;br /&gt;Although the treaty attempted to improve and maintain friendly relations between the Native-Americans and the United States, which so happily subsists between them,' and simultaneously aid expansion, Arkansans were furious with the decision.

They pointed out that one of the favored crops grown in North Carolina was wheat, and Richmond had one the most profitable wheat markets to buy and sell wheat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reason that the people of Richmond wished to build a new line was to strengthen the ties between the two states.

In 1860, roads were very poorly kept.  As Johnston said in his discussion on the emergence of railroads, Travelers who in summer were plagued by choking dust were certain of being mired in seas of tenacious red clay in the winter.'  In addition, most of the roads were not even found on the few maps that circulated Virginia.  Roads winded through the busy terrain of Virginia, and many times they were so confusing that even the natives could get lost.

Although railroads were well established in the far southeastern states, there was still a need and desire to expand into the west and into the midwestern states.  During the 1850's there was a particular expansion of railroads in Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee.  Railroads were also built more upon the north-south lines as opposed to the existing east and west lines.  Although rivers were helpful, the train was much more efficient for transportation of economic goods.&lt;br /&gt;Among many bills passed was the one passed in the Tennessee Senate incorporating the Mississippi Central and Tennessee Railroad Company.  The linking between the states of the south was continuing and spreading into the other states of the Union.  As there was a push for economic independence from the northeastern states, the southern states laid down railroads that linked them to other parts of the Union.  The Charleston Mercury advises that the south should extend its ties to the west and northwest in order to form commercial connections, that will make them independent from the rest of the world for all articles of necessity.'  The Mercury goes on to attack the northeastern states, saying, The centre and source of the whole disease that infects the Union is the Northeast.'  The ulcer' of abolitionism has pushed the south away from the north, thus it must form other ties.

A large part of this view that northern abolitionists were involved was because of the Underground Railroad.  Activity of the Underground Railroad was more common in the Border States, such as Virginia, and even in the farther state of Delaware, which was surrounded by anti-slavery states.  This loss of slaves was attributed to slave stealing.&lt;br /&gt;In November 1855, the Richmond Dispatch reported that there are undoubtedly abolitionist agents in all of Virginia.'  The common disappearance of slaves led to a desire to further strengthen any laws against slaves and those who help them escape, which would include the northern abolitionists who steal' slaves away to the north.  The Richmond Dispatch advised more stringent policing of roads and suggested searching all outward-bound vessels.  There was an attempt to curb the movement and loss of slaves, therefore the laws were made stricter with to disillusion anyone into helping escaped slaves.

The article states that the saddest story was that of Mrs. M. J. Metcalf and her family. In the morning, thinking that the water had risen to its highest point, Mrs. Metcalf and her daughter did not evacuate. When the water rose even higher, they climbed up to the roof to keep out of reach of the water. Several men came to rescue them, but the boat they were traveling in half full of water, capsized, within ten feet of the house.' Moments later the roof broke in two and the Metcalfs went screaming as they disappeared beneath the drift.'  Only one man, Mr. S.C.

Designed mostly to make the Tennessee River passable to shipping, this appropriation was a tremendous endeavor for a state which had existed for only thirty-five years and was still very much an undeveloped and sparsely settled frontier. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, the government of Tennessee was beginning to recognize the importance of developing an efficient and usable infrastructure network not only to improve trade and the flow of goods, but also to improve communication. By clearing the Tennessee River and building roads and canals in other parts of the state, Tennessee not only improved its internal trade and communication, but it also more firmly link itself to the Mississippi River network. This network was an integral part of the U.S. economy as it stretched from New Orleans up through the frontier to the Ohio River Valley, the Northwest, and even the Great Lakes, the St. Lawrence River, and eventually the Atlantic Ocean. By linking themselves to this network, Tennessee ensured not only an increase in the flow of goods and information, but a strengthening of bonds with the United States as a whole. Indeed, the Raleigh Register takes note of this Act on January 28, 1830, declaring it of very considerable importance, inasmuch as it will give an impulse to public enterprise.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This developmental sentiment was representative of the U.S. as a whole as well. In Virginia, for example, a letter from residents of Staunton to the General Assembly desired to incorporate(e) a Company, with the usual powers of a Turnpike Company' to construct a road from Staunton to intersect the Ohio and Chesapeake Canal.' However, acts such as that in Tennessee were overshadowed by a national debate on the proper role of the Federal government in development. Specifically, President Andrew Jackson contended that the Federal government did not have to right to invest in state projects such as those in Tennessee or the construction of the Maysville Road because it would give the Federal government too much control in local affairs. Thus, it was up to the states to conduct such improvement internally, making Tennessee's bill could be construed as an early precursor to this debate."],"display_date":"January 2, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-02","locations":[{"id":11951,"lat":36.1806707867,"lng":-86.8728574445,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1445,"title":"Maysville Road Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-05-22","end_date":"1830-05-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One of the most controversial Acts of its time, the Maysville Road act authorizing the purchase of 50,000 worth of stock in the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Company, otherwise known as the National, or Cumberland, Road. To begin with, the road itself, or what was actually built of it, was a significant advance in construction technology. The four mile stretch that was constructed between Maysville and Washington, Kentucky as was a macadamized' road which was passable in virtually any weather conditions, and greatly reduced freight costs by allowing for heavier loads. Its fifty foot width involved innovative construction techniques such as drainage ditches, and marked a step forward in internal improvement technology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The project, however, had far more important national implications because there was a Constitutional question as to whether the Federal government could invest in a private corporation. Though Congress clearly believed the Federal government should encourage internal development this way, many Southerners believed that such investment was an infringement on states' rights because it would give the Federal government too much direct control. The Richmond Enquirer, for instance, wrote on May 25, 1830, that they do most religiously hope (President Jackson) will sign this Maysville Road Bill.' The Inquirer was therefore enthused to print Jackson's message to Congress on June 1, 1830, in which he return(ed) to the House of Representatives the enrolled bill.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President Jackson's reasoning in vetoing the Maysville Road Bill is fairly straightforward, yet lay at the heart of the controversy at the time over the proper role of the Federal versus the state governments and the respective powers of each. In a later letter to Congress, reprinted in The Globe on December 7, 1830, Jackson writes that if the interest of the Government in private companies is subordinate to that of individuals, the management and control of a portion of the public funds is;.. beyond the supervision of our constituents.' Yet, at the same time, Jackson points out that the power which the Central Government would acquire within the several States by becoming the principal stockholder in corporations;. is almost inconceivable, and, in my view, dangerous.' This reasoning is for the most part agreed with throughout the South, because though the importance of Internal Improvements is recognized, many felt it should be done on a private, local, or at least state level."],"display_date":"May 22, 1830","search_date":"1830-05-22","locations":[{"id":5121,"lat":38.5948878034,"lng":-83.8260117349,"zoom":10,"place":"MASON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1447,"title":"Report on the Louisville-Portland Canal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-15","end_date":"1830-01-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 15, 1830, the Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser included a report respecting the state and progress of this important work,' the Louisville-Portland Canal, and the specific methods and requirements of its construction.

These links were vital in the pre-railroad era of 1830, because although railroads existed the U.S. was still very much a riparian economy. Thus, linking itself to this network not only improved shipping costs and speed throughout the region, but it also linked the local economy much more firmly into the national and international markets. This allowed for the flow of imports and exports, as well as the better communication of ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Louisville-Portland canal, however, was also an example of the great controversy at the time concerning the role of the Federal government in Internal Improvements.

However, for many years Mexico had been encouraging U.S. citizens to emigrate and settle what to the Mexican government was its far away northern provinces -- provinces that were sparsely settled and thus perfect for the Americans. As the Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser reports on January 8, 1830, the settlement of American families in Texas was commenced by Col. F. S. Austin under the authority of the Mexican Government in the autumn of the year 1823.' By 1830, as the Baltimore American notes, the population of the colony is from 3000 to 4000 inhabitants, which with some few exceptions are Americans.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rising problem, however was that once in Texas these settlers were not assimilating into Mexican society, but were instead retaining much of their American and usually Southern identity -- including a slave labor system which was illegal under the Mexican Constitution. As importantly, the Mexican central government in 1830 was in the middle of a move to more tightly control its outward provinces. For one, according to the University of Texas' Texas Constitutions project, in 1828 Mexico had enacted stricter immigration laws requiring among other things that he (the immigrant) is a Roman Catholic.' Even more disturbingly to many Texans, the Mexican government began to crack down on slavery in the region which it considered illegal but which to many Texans was an integral part of their economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After decades of being left alone, the Americans settled in Texas were suddenly being much more tightly restricted and controlled by the Mexican central government. This was a shock to many Texans who considered themselves to be Americans and who felt little real connection to Mexico. Whatsmore, America itself had not forgotten its brethren in Texas, as the Baltimore American article shows. Eventually this conflict reached a boiling point, causing Texas to officially declare its independence in 1836, and the United States to go to war with Mexico over Texas and the southwest ten years later."],"display_date":"January 8, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-08","locations":[],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1471,"title":"Recolonization and the Free Black Controversy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-14","end_date":"1830-01-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Census of 1830 reported that out of a total of population of 12,858,670 people, there were 2,009,050 enslaved and 319,576 free blacks. It is no wonder, therefore, that in what is still primarily a slave-based economy, especially in the South, Americans began to wonder what to do with this growing free black population. After all, how could formerly enslaved blacks fit into white society when President Andrew Jackson had declared that even the recognizably free Indian tribes were no better than savage hunters' with rude institutions' in a letter to Congress reprinted in The Globe on December 7, 1830?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a number of options available to whites as to what to do with freed blacks. For starters, Henry Brawner of Maryland chaired a commission that encouraged all free blacks be deported from the state immediately upon becoming emancipated, and similar ideas showed in other states at various times. One of the most popular ideas at the time, however, was Recolonization' of blacks back to Africa. In an address to the American Colonization Society, reprinted in the Baltimore American and Commercial Advertiser on January 14, 1830, Henry Clay argues that as the two races progressively multiply and augment the source of supply of labor, its wages will diminish, and the preference already noticed will be given of free to slave labor.' As a result, he says, pinched by want, and neglected by their masters;. (slaves) would be stimulated to the commission of crimes' or potentially to rebellion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, many white Americans urged free blacks to emigrate back to Africa. Specifically, on March 25, 1830, an advertisement in the Raleigh Register offered immediate information' to any free blacks desirous of accepting the opportunity thus offered of joining the settlement of free persons of color at Liberia.' However, recolonization to Liberia was not the only option for free blacks. A number of Northern states were beginning to tolerate, if not openly accept, the growing free black population -- including, for example, Northern Maryland and especially Baltimore which had a large number of free black residents. Finally, there was an African colony in Canada, the destination of many runaway slaves, which as the Baltimore American reported on January 14, 1830, amounted to about 2000' persons. Overall, however, most whites simply did not want free blacks living in their community; especially Southern whites to whom free blacks, and especially successful free blacks, represented a direct contradiction to an economic system and a way of life based on racial inferiorities."],"display_date":"January 14, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-14","locations":[{"id":4823,"lat":38.2391019422,"lng":-84.877038419,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1479,"title":"Concerns over the building of the Tennessee Rail Road\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-04-09","end_date":"1867-05-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During April and May, 1867, a number of letters arrived into the Brownlow's Knoxville Whig newspaper. The letters, sent by a number of farmers expressed concerns over the delay of the railroad construction. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The farmers worried over two possible delays. The first resulted from the recent state appropriation of 500,000 to the building of the railroad. As a condition for the money, the Tennessee General Assembly appointed new Directors for the Railroad Company. Farmers worried the new Directors would cause disruption, and delay construction. Financial provision for the railroad created the second problem. The farmers recognised that Tennessee suffered from an economic depression, like many ex-Confederate states, yet urged that the line be completed before the harvest of 1867. Although the state had appropriated money, not enough had been provided to complete the line in time. The farmers urged the state Directors to postpone the building of machine shops, so that the 20,000 could be used to finish the railroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The farmers' concern for the railroad construction came from their livelihoods' dependence on the railroad. It connected them to the markets in the big consumer centres across the United States, especially to the large consumer population on the East coast. If the railroad remained incomplete by harvest their crops would not be sold, but wasted, and their chances of provision lost. The worries of the farmers further reflected the importance of the railroad, which began to experience a post-war boom, continuing until 1916.

With only about 5% of the total world population, the country was constructing new railways faster than the rest of the world combined. The Revolution in transportation systems was incredibly important to the history of the American nation. Although canals would persist in certain areas, railroads became the main transportation method. With the improved technology of steel rails, automatic air brakes and larger, sturdier rail cars, trains provided transportation that was quick, reliable and quite inexpensive. As opposed to canals, which could be disrupted by ice in the winter and unsuitable water levels at various times of the year, trains could operate year round with dependability.

The First Treaty of Indian Springs marks Georgia's first of many governmental and territorial struggles with its Native American population.  The provisions of the treaty gave the U.S. government land lying between the head of the Flint and Chatahooche Rivers, and gave the Creek Nation a small reserve of land that lay within the boundaries of the state.  Despite the acquiring of newly ceded land, Georgia legislature demanded the removal of the Creek Nation, citing the 1802 promise on behalf of the United States government to remove the Indians from within the limits of the state of Georgia. &lt;br /&gt;Both the Creek and Cherokee were partially settled on permanent farms within state limits while enjoying the rule of sovereign tribal governments that owed no allegiance to Georgia, provisions which were given to the Creeks and Cherokees under the of the First Treaty of Indian Springs. Georgia Legislature took the task upon themselves, and actively pursued the removal of both nations from within state limits.  In early 1825, a small number of Creek chiefs who lacked the authority or consent of the Creek Confederacy signed the Second Treaty of Indian Springs.  According to the provisions of the treaty, lands belonging to the entire Confederacy were purportedly ceded to the United States; however, the treaty proved to be an act of defiance against the wishes of the national government.  Despite not having the treaty examined by federal officials, Georgia authorities began surveying the lands.

Between sovereigns the weaker is equally qualified to pass upon its rights.  A new treaty was negotiated, but Troup and the federal government remained at odds during the subsequent two years, culminating in Governor Troup eventually calling out his state militia in defense of land he believed to be rightfully Georgia's.   By 1827, the Creek were gone. The Cherokees, more highly civilized and better organized than the Creeks, managed to avoid any treaty for surrendering their lands, and thus Georgia asserted its jurisdiction over them without adherence to the solemn treaties of the United States during the years to follow.

As a doctor early in his life, Linn had seen thousands of cases of dysentery, malaria and other diseases that resulted from life along the Mississippi river. In low-water seasons, the outbreak of diseases increased as blockages in the river forced white and blacks alike to suffer with stagnation and mosquitoes; limited transport along the tributary waterways prevented medicine from reaching affected areas. The blockages accumulated during the low-water seasons of 1839-1843 described by Linn were so great as to render navigation not only dangerous in extreme to commerce but hazardous to the health.","Lewis Linn strove to make changes for his patients' health as well as his own after a series of illnesses he suffered in 1839. With the sudden death of the Missouri senator, Linn would realize his goal when nominated to the position. Linn realized, however, that to garner appropriations to clear out sandbars, large bulk and swampland from major waterways needed a stronger base than health-care reports. Linn worked alongside fifteen hundred St. Louis-area executives and presented a petition to Congress to battle those appropriations that were always strenuously, and sometimes successfully opposed, and the objects intended to be accomplished were never more than half accomplished.","Lewis Linn's work with executives strengthened his argument of the need for change, in both mercantilism and the health of those along the Mississippi. Linn cited the total loss of 3 million dollars in goods and boats along these waterways which were vital to much of the southern-and indirectly northern-trade and commerce. The enormous economic losses for the South and other ports nationwide sparked movement within Congress. As Linn fought to secure money, he created a promising outlook for a large-scale river project. Unfortunately, Linn's sudden death while in office in 1843 left his own efforts unrewarded when legislators failed to garner enough votes for appropriations. "," Yet, his legacy to push for better economic conditions carried to the next group of southern congressional representatives. Businessmen and legislators alike realized the importance of re-tooling the environmental and economic congressional committees not only for the health of their constituents-and their consumer base-but to facilitate faster, more efficient shipping nationwide. Whether or not the government granted appropriations to clear the river ways ultimately affected more than just transportation; the health of the rivers in large part created the success or failure of commerce for the national economy."],"display_date":"January 17, 1843","search_date":"1843-01-17","locations":[{"id":7916,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1960,"title":"Cartography and Map Printing in Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1827-12-18","end_date":"1827-12-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The <em>New Map of Virginia</em> went on sale in the capitol city of Richmond on August 3, 1827.

It cost 20 dollars to buy a copy of the <em>Map of Virginia</em>. <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em> asserted this to be a moderate price for a map of such fine quality. The sale of the <em>Map of</em> <em>Virginia </em>coincided with improvements in transportation; roads and use of waterways. This made it extremely popular among Virginians to own a map of high quality in order to have a coherent understanding of the land around them."," To produce the <em>Map of Virginia</em> cartographers and printers in Richmond used the process of planographic printing. This process made map printing faster and far less expensive. According historian David Woodward, to produce the <em>Map of Virginia </em>printers used lithographic ink or chalk to draw on stone. Printers accentuated the contrast between the inked and un-inked regions of the stone by washing the stone with a weak solution of nitric acid. This increased the porosity and water absorbing capacity of the un-inked regions. The stone accepted ink within the drawn images and characters, and rejected ink within the moistened areas when a roller covered with greasy ink passed over the stone. In the final step of reproducing of the <em>Map of Virginia</em>, printers placed a sheet of paper in a frame that they brought in contact with the inked surface. Printers transferred the image from stone to paper by applying pressure between the paper and inked surface. "," The <em>Map of Virginia</em> resulted from many years of labor, as well as at a great cost of care and money, on the part of cartographers and printers. <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em> wrote that no map of Virginia before this had surpassed in variety and accuracy of detail, or in beauty and elegance of execution. With an inadequate supply of maps in the early nineteenth century, Americans had a poor concept of their surroundings apart from the locations of plantations and stores in their local area. Maps in circulation tended to be unreliable and too expensive for most citizens to own. Beginning in 1820, it became increasingly important for Virginians to own maps as transportation improved with development of roads and use of waterways. Improvements in transportation coincided with the development of the new printing process, planographic printing. The development of planographic printing made maps far more accessible, accurate and affordable.

Gall brought ice to the homes of his customers in a horse-drawn wagon. Gall delivered ice daily to his customers who could afford to pay for the service. Gall advertised the options of a weekly or monthly subscription in the <em>American Beacon and Commercial Daily</em>. The American people quickly picked up on the amazing benefits of refrigeration, and Gall became one of thousands of men involved in the rapidly growing ice industry. Technological advances in refrigeration allowed for the development of the ice industry."," Gall received his ice from companies that harvested across the vast regions of North America. These regions experienced winters capable of freezing lakes and rivers solid. According to historian Gavan Weightman, companies checked the thickness of the ice after two or three weeks of subzero weather. Men harvested the ice once it froze to 18 inches; a depth that supported the weight of hundreds of men and horses. Men wore cork soles that allowed them to grip the ice, and fitted their horses with spiked shoes. Competing companies that worked on the same river or lake carefully observed boundaries pertaining to ownership. Men marked out the ice after clearing the snow on top to expose the ice surface. To mark the ice, men steered iron cutters drawn by teams of two horses across the surface. These men created a network of parallel lines that divided the area into squares. Horse-drawn plows with metal teeth cut deep enough into the groves that permitted men to pry the blocks free using long-handled chisels. Weightman claims that channels of free flowing water coaxed the giant ice blocks to a mechanism that hoisted them into timber icehouses. Blocks slid down chutes and men hauled them into stacks. These men put sawdust between and around the ice blocks to act as insulation. The discovery that sawdust could act as insulation allowed for the growth of the ice industry beginning in 1820."," Wagons draw by teams of horses or oxen carried ice from the timber houses to ports in nearby towns. Weightman claims that from these locations steamboats carried ice to large ice warehouses in city centers. The technological advances in steamboats, largely in part due to the development of the condensing engine, allowed for much faster transportation of ice."," Gall brought his wagon to the Portsmouth warehouse each morning to receive his supply of ice to deliver to his customers. The favored size of ice cube varied depending upon the location that companies transported the ice to. The size of ice cubes that Gall delivered to his customers in Portsmouth resembled that of a New-York sized ice cube of twenty-two square inches. In Portsmouth households, people kept blocks of ice cut to a standard size in what they called refrigerators or iceboxes. These refrigerators were predominantly built of wood and lined with metal. The technology of iceboxes created a way for Americans to store ice, thus increasing the demand for the valuable commodity.

Penn's essay discussed the need to exterminate the Indians in order to allow for expansion into the West. The article in the Easton newspaper stated that while there seems to be such a prevalent disposition south and west of us to exterminate the aborigines of this land, we feel it our duty to raise our voice and use every exertion to stay that band of power from sweeping them from the face of the earth. The article published in <em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> asserted that we stand for the bitter detestation and abhorrence of tyranny and oppression of the aborigines of this land.

"," <em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> article exemplified the tensions between anti-expansionist Americans, and those who supported expansion into the West and Indian removal. Southerners generally supported expansion and Indian removal while northerners tended to disapprove of such action. A significant turning point occurred in 1828 with the election of Andrew Jackson to power as president. Jackson, a prominent figure in the South, led the campaign for Indian removal. Jackson often publicly stated that in order to rescue Indians from the destructive vices of civilization, Indians must be removed and placed farther into the West. Historian William Brandon claims that northerners tended to disagree with this statement. Northerners believed that Jackson's genuine motive for Indian removal resulted from his desire to allow southerners to secure themselves land in the territory that opened up in the West. "," According to Brandon, southerners felt threatened by nationalism. Southerners found refuge in an aggressive assertion of both states rights and sectional economic interests. With the support of Jackson, southerners believed they needed to fulfill their 'destiny' to own and farm the land possessed by Indians all the way from Georgia to the Mississippi River. Thus, southerners found it particularly displeasing that northerners tried to prevent them from fulfilling this 'destiny.

The Maryland accommodated passengers, horses and carriages. The advertisement posted in <em>The Maryland Gazette</em> on April 6, 1820 targeted potential customers by stating that the <em>Maryland </em>is not surpassed in point of elegance or speed by any boat in the United Sates. Customers had to decide whether their preferences laid in paying higher fairs and getting to their destination faster or lower fares with longer travel time. Steamboat companies competed with each other to have the most customers, and often posted advertisements in the local newspapers. Steamboats provided the endless tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay with essential economic and social links to supporting cities of the region."," Steamboat companies on the Chesapeake Bay faced tough competition. Businesses constantly strived to produce engines with increasingly greater power and efficiency. The potential to make large profits existed in the steamboat business, and companies desired to have steamboats with the greatest speed. The <em>Maryland </em>used a condensing engine to increase its power. According to historian David C. Holly, in condensing engines steam discharged from the cylinder after it pushed the piston and entered into the condenser. Once in the condenser, jets of cold water pumped from the Chesapeake Bay condensed the steam into water, and this condensate became the source of water to replenish the boiler. Holly claims that the use of condensing engines prevented the chance of a boiler explosion that often occurred in non-condensing engines. In addition, condensing engines saved engineers up to several hours because they would not have to scrape the boilers and related piping to remove salt scales that formed in non-condensing engines. "," Steamboats played a significant role on the Mississippi as well as in the Chesapeake Bay. Steamboats acted as a means to effectively and efficiently transport goods to towns along the waterways. The <em>Maryland</em>, in addition to other steamboats on the Chesapeake, differed from steamboats on the Mississippi. Holly claims that on the Mississippi, steam exhausted into the atmosphere produced an explosive sound, unlike the quiet engine of steamboats on the Chesapeake that used condensing engines. On Chesapeake steamboats, both side wheels turned together, propelled form the piston that traveled up and down from a single cylinder as a source of power. Chesapeake steamboats displayed a feminine sheer, well proportioned cabin and deck space, and single smoke stacks unlike Mississippi steamboats that had raft like hulls, twin stacks and minimal deck space. Steamboats greatly contributed to the development of tidewater Maryland and Virginia, in addition to waterways all across America.

It cost 20 dollars to enter a horse into the race, but owners who lived within a 50 miles radius of the racecourse did not have to pay an entrance fee. The horse races held at the Greens Course consisted of two laps around the track per heat. Horse races centered around gambling; a popular activity of southern men at the time."," The horse races at the Portsmouth Greens Course differed from quarter racing; the form of horse racing that Americans in the West created. Quarter horse races were far cheaper and easier to run because they did not require formal tracks. According to historian Earl L. Grinols, the races consisted of quarter mile sprints. The organizers laid the course out on a field or straight stretch of road that almost always ran next to the local tavern. Owners usually raced two horses against each other. This created a large amount of betting between the two owners as well as the crowd of spectators. Breeders crossed English saddle horses and Indian Ponies to create the new breed of quarter horses."," Races on the Portsmouth Greens Course tended to be far more controlled than the quarter horse races of the West. Spectators and contestants at the Portsmouth Greens Course concerned themselves with the rules of racing, while quarter horse races were anything but sedate events. Westerners accompanied quarter horse races with shooting matches, cockfights and boxing bouts. Since quarter horse races took place next to the local tavern, they often turned into very loud events with numerous members of the public under the influence of the local brew. Occasionally the Portsmouth Greens Course experienced the rowdy nature of western quarter horse races. Gamblers sometimes encountered corrupt bookmakers who dominated the betting by shortening their odds.

In covering this, the Page County newspaper unknowingly peers into the future of technology and transportation. The paper writes that the railroad companies (specifically the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy companies) begin to contemplate the idea of an oil-run machine, as opposed to their steam-powered locomotives. The companies believe that the change is both practical and desirable. They say that with an oil-run machine, fewer stops will be necessary on long trips and services such as the fast mail will be greatly improved, and have been conducting experiments to test the new technology at Aurora (probably Illinois). Thus, the coal miners' strike indirectly helped force railroad companies into a line-of-thought that will eventually help revolutionize the fuel industry."," Because of its entrenchment in the mining industry, citizens of small valley or mining counties could have a significant effect on the economy of a larger area as well as influence the progression of technology. This episode in Page County, Virginia is a peek at the near future, when oil gains its status as black gold. Poor, unhappy farmers and industrial workers such as the coal miners on strike will begin to move out to the oil fields in order to try their luck at finding wealth through drilling their own wells.

The Montgomery Messenger, of Montgomery County, Virginia recognized this fact and in an article written on Friday, August 23, 1895, the writer discussed the benefits of a good roads convention. The convention was meant to be statewide and one delegate from each county was expected to attend; thus the event was of statewide significant importance, most especially to farmers and industrialists who wanted to get their materials across the state more efficiently. Furthermore, everyone interested in improving the state's roads was invited. The article goes on to explain that the State Good Roads Association had been very active in improving the infrastructure of the state, and that citizens of the state have every reason to feel satisfied and encouraged with the results of the association's work. The paper estimated (though the accuracy of this statement cannot truly be determined) that some 90% of the population believes in the importance of good roads.

Better roads needed to be built to transport raw materials to the newly built industrial centers located now in the South, unlike prior to the industrialization of the South where materials were either shipped overseas or sent north. Improving the infrastructure of the South (through roads and railroads) was crucial to the development of the quickly growing Southern economy and its important industries.","Date: August 23, 1895","Location: Christianburg, Montgomery County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Politics, Government, Economy, Migration/Transportation, Urban Life/Boosterism","Episode Scope: Local, State, Regional, National","Montgomery Messenger, August 23, 1895.

Hamilton ran a regular advertisement for his services in The Nashville Daily Union. In the advertisement he ran on Saturday, July 6, 1850, Hamilton reassured his former patrons that he planned to remain in the business of buying and selling cotton. Hamilton thanked the public for the business they provided him in that venture. Directly below he advertised his steamboat packets. Through this advertisement, Hamilton reintroduced himself as an agent of the steamers that traveled between Nashville and New Orleans, and Nashville and Memphis. In addition, the advertisement declared Hamilton's need to hire 100 NEGROES to work on the steamboats that traveled back and forth along these two routes. Although he claimed to want to hire these black workers, he did not necessarily mean to hire them independently. Some slave owners often hired their slaves out to others within their community, keeping the salaries for themselves. "," Hamilton advertised two types of steamboat packets. The first he described as regular packets traveling from New Orleans to Nashville. The steamers left the port of New Orleans every Tuesday at four o'clock in the afternoon for Nashville. The steamer left to return to New Orleans from Nashville every Saturday afternoon at four o'clock. The advertisement described the other packet as weekly. It left Nashville for Memphis every Monday at four o'clock and left to return to Nashville from Memphis on Thursday mornings at ten o'clock. "," Before railroads, steamboats provided the most rapid means of transportation of both people and goods. Tennessee played a large role in this river transportation. The Cumberland River ran through the middle of Tennessee eventually intersecting with the Ohio River. The Ohio River indirectly connected cities along the Cumberland River, specifically Nashville, with the burgeoning steam boat economy of the Mississippi River. "," The shipment of iron along the Cumberland River became a vital part of the economy in the middle region of Tennessee. Historian Byrd Douglas argues that if it had not been for the Cumberland River, which served as the only medium of transportation, this essential product, which played such an important part in the development of our country, could not have reached the market. Steamboat packets, like those advertised by A. Hamilton, provided the most efficient means of transportation between the South-western states. Tennessee did produce large amounts of the South?s staple crops, tobacco and cotton. But iron production proved to be more beneficial to the economy of the Cumberland region of Tennessee and thus made Nashville one of the largest cities in the South. The shipment and production of iron made Tennessee an industrial state juxtaposing it to many states within the South that found economic success predominantly through agriculture."],"display_date":"July 6, 1850","search_date":"1850-07-06","locations":[{"id":11953,"lat":36.1785835172,"lng":-86.867295434,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2011,"title":"Farmers in Central Virginia Cope after Economic Depression\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-10-28","end_date":"1887-10-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James Holladay, the owner of a plantation in Spotsylvania County, Virginia was exceedingly proud of his new invention.  Holladay had worked hard to perfect the new silo he designed for his farm, but he wanted assurance from an expert that his silo needed no further improvements.  On October 28, 1887 Holladay wrote to Professor Elliot W. Stuart, an expert in agriculture at the University of Virginia, and inquired as to the soundness of the new silo and machine that would automatically fill the silo that he had developed.  Holladay explained, The increasing difficulty of obtaining reliable labour when needed led me to consider the practicability of substituting machinery for hand labour in this part of the operation of filling silos.  Like Holladay, a number of farmers in Central Virginia who struggled to maintain or increase their plantation's productivity utilized innovative tools which, in the words of Holladay, improved in the quality of eusilage and economized labour.  After the economic depression that occurred in the 1870's, men in Central Virginia whose primary source of income revolved around agricultural ventures explored new options that would allow them to reduce farm expenditures while retaining their land.","Other farmers in Central Virginia did not invent new farm machines but, instead, rented tracts of land to tenants as a means to increase the economic productivity of their plantations.  In <em>Southern Crossing</em>, Edward Ayers explains that status as a renter was viewed as a temporary station that was merely a rung on the agricultural ladder of economic success.  Those who entered into contracts as renters aspired to one day become independent landowners.  On July 18, 1875, in a letter addressed to Dr. Cary C. Cocke of Fluvanna County, Virginia, Thos J. Rowland of Richmond, Virginia inquired about the land that Dr. Cocke was hoping to rent.  Mr. Rowland proposed that he pay rent in the form of annual cash payments to Dr. Cocke in exchange for the usage of five hundred acres of his land.  In December of the same year, Mr. Harry B. Tomlin, Jr. wrote a similar letter to Dr. Cocke in which he too asked to rent a parcel of Dr. Cocke's land.  However, Tomlin offered to make part of his payment by relinquishing a portion of the crops he produced on the land to Dr. Cocke.  ","Some farmers in Central Virginia undoubtedly utilized both of these techniques for increasing their plantation's productivity.  Holladay, the plantation owner who designed the new type of silo, also received a letter from a prospective renter.  On December 5, 1884, Z. C. Daniel wrote to Holladay saying that he would either buy or rent a tract of his land because he was somewhat short for land to put in corn.  Mr. Holladay and other farmers of Central Virginia both rented their land and created new farm machines as a means of coping with the aftermath of the economic depression that occurred in the 1870's. ","In Southern Crossing, Edward Ayers describes the years following the economic depression by asserting, New technologies and techniques offered sudden hope to areas that had been passed over for centuries.  These new technologies offered hope not only to farmers like Holladay in Central Virginia, but also farmers in the other farming regions of Virginia and states of the South.  Dependable help was hard to maintain due to the abolition of slavery and the migration of laborers, according to Ayers.  Therefore, farmers needed to develop methods for increasing production while decreasing the number of laborers they utilized on their plantations.

That did not prevent Captain Tirrell from taking Mattie Jackson, her brother, and her sister away from their mother and putting them onto a boat headed to Memphis. However, before the boat left St. Louis, Union policemen stopped the boat and returned the young slaves to their master. The Union policemen took no further action. Mattie recalled, Their power was limited to the suppression of the selling of slaves that go out of the city. Then two years later, seven men, four watchmen, and three traders, forced themselves into her home and put her family into a closed carriage. This carriage took them to a dilapidated prison where they spent the night. Mattie recalled that, [the] kidnapping had been in contemplation from the time [they] were before taken and returned. The family was transferred from one train car to another, until they finally arrived in Louisville where they were held at John Clark's trader's yard. The family was sold out separately, except [her] mother and little brother, who were sold together. Mattie recalled that her mother and brother spent two weeks in the trader's yard, her sister six weeks, and herself four.","Mattie's family was enslaved in Missouri at the beginning of the Civil War. Missouri was considered a border state and ultimately remained a member of the Union. Historian Ira Berlin argues that President Lincoln promised to respect the property rights of slaveholders in border states in order to keep them in the Union. Thus, slavery remained legal in Missouri. As Mattie knew however, interstate slave trading was outlawed. Despite violating the law, Captain Tirrell smuggled Mattie and her family out of the state and sold them in Louisville. Many other slaves experienced similar incidents. Mattie noted considerable smuggling was done. Although Union soldiers protected some slaves from being sold to areas outside of Missouri, slave owners and traders who [pretended] Unionism successfully smuggled slaves out of the state. ","The Union soldiers were not the only people Captain Tirrell fooled while smuggling his slaves out of Missouri. Mattie stated that Captain Tirrell tricked and deceived her family before he forced them to the trader's yard. She recalled that Captain Tirrell's kindness, generosity, and approbation to the contemplated marriage was only a trap. Such lies and trickery were common among slave owners in the South. Historian Walter Johnson argues, Many sellers resorted to ingratiation, deceit, and coercion. Slaveholders told their slaves that they would not be traded and then sold those same slaves weeks - or even days - later. Other slave owners tricked their slaves into thinking they were going to attend an event, such as a party, at another plantation. Once the slaves got into the wagon, they were brought directly to slave traders.","Trickery and lies were just the beginning to Mattie's horrible experience. Mattie described how her family spent considerable time in John Clark's trader's yard before being sold to their new masters.

A letter from Governor Reeder of the Kansas territory, printed January 4, 1855, condemned the first election in the district for a delegate to Congress. Reeder stated that the majority of the people at the election meeting were not citizens of Kansas, but rather Missourians. These people rushed into the new territory only to return to their homes later that evening. Angry that Kansans were not making the decisions for the territory, he argued that the law guaranteed them the right to manage their own affairs. In a different article, a writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>was quoted as saying, If the thing [was] to be repeated, however, at every election in Kansas, it [would] ultimately lead to bloodshed. He went on to suggest that the Missourians were organized in separate parties...[each] designed to operate at specified locations. Members of such parties stood by the ballot box, asked to see people's ballots, and intimidated any person who did not support slavery."," Governor Reeder estimated that on that day anywhere from 200 to 400 Missourians came by ferry and horseback to vote in Kansas. Missourians reacted in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Under this act, popular sovereignty decided the issue of slavery in new territories. This meant newly forming states in the West had the right to vote whether they would be a slave state or free state. Reeder acknowledged his frustration that the people who lived in Kansas were not the ones who ultimately made the decisions. Historian David Potter states any resident could vote, however recently he arrived. Reeder recalled one man whose only attempt at a residence in Kansas [consisted] of a card nailed to a tree upon ground long since occupied by other settlers. "," Both Reeder and the writer of the letter to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> stated that the Missourians who invaded the new territory supported slavery. Historian John B. Boles suggests there were as many as 5,000 fraudulent votes from border ruffians who wanted to ensure a pro-slavery candidate would be elected. The writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> stated that an extensive scheme [was] on foot to make Kansas a slave state. Historian Clayton E. Jewett's argues that southerners used the annexation of western territories as a means of spreading slavery and gaining pro-slavery support in Congress. "," Tension mounted between the North and South as both sides struggled to control the future of slavery in new territories. Historian David Potter argues, Such friction was not unusual in frontier situations, and it often led to controversy, lawlessness, and violence. The writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> mentioned that the proslavery Missourians threatened and intimidated the judges, violently drove off all those who were suspected of being in favor of any other candidate than their own, and pointed revolvers as some cast their vote.

Upon returning home from a trip to Texas, he wrote a letter to his sister, Millie, asking her to accompany him on his next trip. In discussing his trip to Texas, Erastus described his encounter with the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw Indian Nations. He described the Cherokee people and remarked their land was the most lovely country [his] eyes ever beheld. He added that the Cherokee people seemed very well enlightened. However, Erastus did not think so highly of the Creeks. He considered the Creeks to be the most inferior of the three races. Erastus continued his focus on the Creeks, and gave a full account of the traditional Creek dance he witnessed. The Creeks gathered around a pole yelling, singing, and dancing in a manner that reminded [him] of the exact representation made in history of their 'war dances.' He remarked, Only the poor or inferior portions continued such dances. The superior Indian Nations [studied] the art of agriculture. "," Erastus Brown was not alone in wanting to travel to newly settled territories in the United States. In fact, historian Randolph Cambell titled his book, Gone to Texas, to represent the message that appeared on the doors of many abandoned homesteads across the southeastern United States in the mid-nineteenth century. While Erastus did not explicitly state his reasoning for going to Texas, Cambell offers many reasons why people from the southern United States felt comfortable leaving their homes for Texas. First, the U.S. Army established forts and explored the new lands, thus providing the stability needed for people to move into the new territory. Those who went to Texas wrote home about the opportunities the new territory offered -primarily cheap, rich land. Furthermore, like other new territories, slaveholders saw Texas as an opportunity to expand slavery. "," Although Brown did not mention the exact route he traveled on his way to and from Texas, it was likely he traveled through Oklahoma. He stated that he went through the Indian Nations: Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw. As historian Dallas T. Herndon states, the movement of Americans into the western frontier forced Native Americans to be relocated to reserves in Oklahoma and part of the Texas Panhandle."," Brown noticed the different effects that American expansion and the relocation of Indians had on the tribes he came across.

Casting subtlety aside, thieves approached Stetson & Brother's Store, drilled a hole through a window shutter, lifted the door's latch, and walked in through the front doors. Dragging the safe (so-called) from the backroom into the common area, the burglars forced it open, stole 500, and left without any real identification.","Police, combing the scene, had few real leads. They arrested several suspects over the ensuing week, but were unable to get any useful information from interrogations and soon let the men go.

The Milledgeville police very likely chose two passing blacks as scapegoats, well-aware these suspects would never return to deny the accusation.","     Popular culture in the Reconstruction South cast free or idle black as drunks, thieves, and trouble-makers. This episode shows a desire amongst the authorities of Milledgeville to cast a middle- or upper-class black man in this same stereotypical role. The shorter suspect, educated and wealthy enough to travel from Boston and back, neatly dressed along the way, was a threat to some of the fundamental assumptions Georgian whites held about their black neighbors. If black were able to live civilized lifestyles when given the opportunity, it was no longer the white man's duty to look after an inferior race, but rather an act of oppression. Faced with a need for a scapegoat, Milledgeville's authorities jumped at the chance to simultaneously reinforce the prejudices of the community around them."],"display_date":"July 14, 1868","search_date":"1868-07-14","locations":[{"id":1526,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2044,"title":"The Crisis of 1849\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-07-25","end_date":"1849-07-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shots went off. John Barker turned and sprinted towards his house, but the Indians were too quick. They overtook him, stabbing and killing him instantly. Caleb Lyndon Brayton, frontier neighbor to Barker, stood there stunned. He had just conversed with the Indian party on the road to Captain Gattis' house, seeing nothing unusual in their appearance. How could this have happened? The adrenaline flew through his veins: no time to think, get to the boats Brayton, Captain Gattis, and Colonel Russell flew down the hill towards the shore and pushed off just as the Indians, having doubled to eight, loaded their rifles. The first volley ripped through the shirt of a Negro man in the boat, but by the time they reloaded, the frontiersmen were out of range.","Brayton now had time to absorb what he just witnessed and plan a course of action. The men needed weapons, but, upon returning from obtaining Brayton's Colt 8 shooters, the Indians were no where to be found. The land lay in ruins. Houses were plundered and set ablaze and cattle floated lifelessly in the river. Colonel Russell's family was gone. The following day Brayton came upon the most distressing scene of his life: Here were a parcel of helpless women and children, bare footed and bare headed, and almost naked. The children crying and screaming for water and food, having been two days without anything to eat... They had found Russell's family downriver, but the horror of the past two days could not be escaped.","This was the scene Brayton described to his wife, Marian, who remained in Augusta, Georgia with their family while he settled the frontier of Florida. The Indians he refers to are Seminoles, and the attack and murder of John Barker was part of a larger reemergence of hostilities known as the Crisis of 1849. The Second Seminole War had been over for seven years, but a group of young Seminoles conducted raids up and down both Florida coasts in the summer of 1849. United States Troops mobilized and threatened attack but Chief Billy Bowlegs, who has been described as a great peacemaker, averted conflict by claiming the raiders were outsiders and defiant warriors. He delivered three prisoners and the severed hand of a fourth.","Scattered episodes of violence were not uncommon across the South wherever whites intruded into historic Indian territory, but the Crisis of 1849 was temporally concentrated and particularly horrific. Intricate racial interactions in Florida were augmented by the influx of settlers after 1842 and the peace that followed the Second Seminole War. Specifically, the Armed Occupation Act allowed prospective settlers to claim land and feel safer doing it; Caleb Brayton himself had claimed 160 acres in 1843 under this act. After 1849, however, many settlers did not return to this area and others. Billy Bowlegs had prevented a third Seminole war, but lasting damage had been done to the relationship between frontier settlers and the indigenous Seminoles.

Christmas was a time to spend with family, both close and distant. Mary Fitzhugh had moved to Richmond almost two months ago, and it was too great a distance for her to make the trip. In a letter, Lizzie Fitzhugh wrote to her sister: So many young cousins are assembling to-getther, at first one house and then the other. Most visitors stayed for many days, since family gatherings happened only a few times each year. Saturday was Christmas, and the celebration began with a visit to the huge Christmas tree outside the Fitzhughs' home. While the adults laughed and talked, the children rushed to the presents underneath the tree. Willie, Oscar, and Edward, Lizzie's brothers, received Roam candles, candy, and nuts. Bessie and Fannie, Lizzie's younger sisters, combed the hair on their new dollbabies. Brother Frank received a little wagon and horse.","Everyone knew that Christmas was truly a celebration of the birth of Jesus. On Sunday night, all of the family listened to Mr. Boggs preach at the church down the street. On Tuesday night, Lizzie went to a dance at the Mr. Moyer's house. She writes, there was such a crowd of strangers that all of us got two of the fiddlers and went in the dining room, where we had a very nice time. The parlor was crowded. But there was a young man who caught her eye, Lizzie tells her sister.

The distances between family members were not long by modern standards. However, traveling by horse made even these trips impractical unless it was a special occasion. Even though Richmond was less than 70 miles away from the Fitzhugh home, Mary still could not attend the celebrations. Railroads greatly accelerated the speed of travel, but rural areas such as Virginia's Eastern Shore had to depend on horses or private sailing vessels. In fact, the first railroad to reach the Eastern Shore only opened in 1884, running to Cape Charles.

People also packed carpets, mattresses, plates, bowls, bed linens, lamps, rocking chairs, and even clocks. The annual, week-long, Turlington camp meeting had finally arrived. The big bell tolled, beckoning everyone to the benches. It was quite a congregation: almost 8000 people would attend some portion of the meetings. James Cannon, Jr. from Salisbury, Maryland, sat with this father and listened: the substance of the preaching was the same as ... [his] church back home. There was somewhat more pressure brought to bear upon the church members to bestir themselves to hunt the sinners, and stronger more impassioned appeals to the sinner to forsake their ways and return to God. People jumped and shouted Hallelujah, especially the older white men and blacks who sat in the front of the wooden tabernacle.","The next morning, James rose promptly at 7 a.m. as the big bell clanged. After breakfast, there was a time of prayer. In the two hours of free time that followed, James took the opportunity to meet different families from Virginia's Eastern Shore. At 10, the lovefeast began, with the preacher incessantly calling for another testimony, another testimony James attended religious services at 3 and 7:30. After the little children were tucked in their tents, there was one more evening service. Organ and piano led stirring hymns like Blessed Assurance and What a Friend We Have in Jesus. Despite all the preaching, the camp meetings were a mix of the secular and spiritual. At night, women traded recipes, and young children spent their allowance at the candy stand. Young men and women joined nightly promenades around the grounds. One night, James heard giggling in a girl's tent as he walked by. He entered and found the girls laughing at an old lady in a rocking chair nearby, smoking a pipe. Each time she rocked, her shadow expanded and contracted on the wall of the tent. James wasn't as amused: he explained to the girls that smoking was an evil habit. This was a lecture the girls would not forget for many years.","The original idea of the Turlington Camp Meeting was for Methodists, rich and poor, black and white, to leave the comforts of their normal lives for a time of rededication to Jesus Christ. Early on, there was dramatic revival at the annual meeting. Each year, the meetings grew more and more popular (in 1889, nearly 1,500 people showed up each night). They also became grander, finer, and more institutionalized. In 1876, the church added a wooden tabernacle. In 1891, they added a choir loft. The dresses of the ladies became fancier and fancier, and the expected time for testimonies became shorter and shorter. For the Turlington Camp Methodists, religion became more secular with each passing year. While Christianity declined in spiritual significance for many southerners in the late nineteenth century, other regions of the South still resisted secular influences. In the early years, northern Methodists from Maryland shared in the fellowship at Turlington. While newspapers reported the friendly and brotherly feeling between these groups during the Methodist Centennial Conference in 1884, the situation soured quickly. In 1885, the northern Methodists split from the Turlington Camp, fearing that the original purpose of the meeting had been lost."],"display_date":"August 7, 1881 - August 15, 1881","search_date":"1881-08-11","locations":[{"id":13591,"lat":37.9436744077,"lng":-75.3696408508,"zoom":9,"place":"ACCOMACK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2065,"title":"Visiting Washington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-06-26","end_date":"1840-06-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Richard Champion Rawlins arrived in Washington D.C. from Baltimore on Friday June 26, 1840.

However, on the afternoon of May 1, 1844, another new and exciting sight fascinated Whipple. The wonder of wonders was Professor Morse's electrical telegraph. Through the electrical telegraph, information was transmitted with almost the rapidity of thought. Railroad cars left with information of a nomination, for example, at the same time as the telegraph. However, the news transported via the telegraph was received one hour and a half before the cars arrived. The machine was simple and plain. Professor Morse had been working on it for 12 years. He gave Bishop Whipple a specimen of the writing as well as an explanation of the work. He was also able to hold communication with the man at the other end of the route.

According to Tomas Nonnenmacher, writing in <em>The Journal of Economic History</em>, the telegraph industry began as a single monopoly patent and grew into a national monopoly. Nonnenmacher pointed out the significance of the telegraph in the development of technology: prior to the telegraph people relied on the Pony Express, homing pigeons, and the railroads.

After describing the weather, terrain, and typical lifestyle, Dr. Byme acknowledged the differences between Florida cotton and that grown in other states but made sure to clarify the reason behind the variance. It is true that the average quality of Florida Cotton is not rated so high as that of the Sea Island, but the difference in this respect is chiefly, if not entirely, attributable to the defective manner of preparing the former for market. ","Despite the noted difference in quality, the long staple cotton of Florida sold for a high market price. This led Byme to claim that the lower quality (but greater amount) of Florida cotton was due more to a deficiency of care in its preparation for market than to an inferior product. Perhaps what Byme meant by claiming that there was a deficiency of care in cotton production was that the one-crop agricultural system implemented in Florida was problematic. It used crude, unscientific methods that left slaves incapable of working with the modern agricultural implements introduced in later years. Lacking versatility, Florida slaves could be taught little more than routine operations required in the growth of a single staple. ","In emphasizing the importance of quantity rather than quality for the Florida cotton planter, Byme was describing an economic reality of the region. When the Florida planter found that he could make an average crop of three hundred pounds of cotton to the acre, he was unlikely to bestow as much care on its preparation for market as the planter would on the Sea Islands of South Carolina where, Willie Lee Rose explained, one hundred twenty pounds was a good average crop. Dr. Byme wrote his pamphlet in such a way that clearly illustrated a widespread desire to jumpstart the Florida economy in the mid-nineteenth century. Byme praised the climate, landscape, people, and agriculture of Florida so as to prove the state's superiority over South Carolina and Texas, specifically. He boasted that Florida's seasons were more favorable to the production of cotton than those of any other Southern state. He wrote, Florida not only surpass[ed] Texas, but far excel[led] every other state in the Union.","In 1860, when Byme wrote the main article of his pamphlet, growing and selling cotton was, indeed, the most common way for Florida residents to earn cash. However, in future years, attempting to produce a cotton crop came to be a gamble for households that had limited labor resources (i.e. only had a small number of slaves, all of whom knew how to complete the same exact task). With the onset of the war, Floridians began to realize that they needed to reduce cotton production and increase food production if they wanted the South to survive. Many did not act through purely patriotic motives, however, but to the economic fact that cotton could not be sold in large quantities, and that foodstuffs, especially corn, could be readily sold and could produce a significant profit. Dr. Byme did not foresee the development of other agricultural industries when writing his pamphlet, but those readers who bought into his real estate propaganda soon learned the economic realities and needs of plantation life in the deep South."],"display_date":"April 1, 1860","search_date":"1860-04-01","locations":[{"id":1421,"lat":29.2235069663,"lng":-82.0960676488,"zoom":9,"place":"MARION, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2091,"title":"Jesse Willis Petitions to Keep Slave Families Together\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Jesse Willis, administrator of the estate of Amanda Willis, asked the Marion County court for permission to sell land (rather than slaves) from Marion's estate to repay his debts. He claimed that selling the slaves could not be done without upsetting Amanda's children. Willis added, the slaves are all of one family, and [they are] mostly children which are constantly increasing in value. He did not think it was right to separate families of slaves when it could be avoided. He realized that for slaves, the slave trade was more than just a financial exchange. A one-time miscalculation on the part of an owner might lead to a life-changing sale for the slave, and Jesse Willis did not want this to happen to his family's slaves. Instead, he insisted on avoiding the separation of slave families.","There have been several court documents that reveal that there were other masters who looked out for the welfare of the slave family. Other owners, like the Sanderson's in Duval County and the Hanson's in St. Johns County, would almost never sell a slave and refused to employ overseers who beat slaves. In addition to court proceedings, slave and master accounts also provide information about master-slave relations and the preservation of the slave family. One slave remembers that he never had to do any strenuous work as long as he won in marbles when he played against slaves of other masters. His master's goal was to excite the ambition of his slaves and promote loyalty through kindness, not to depress their spirits by fear and punishment.","Despite the handful of other cases of kind masters who cared for their slaves, Jesse Willis' demand in the Marion County court was not typical of Southern slave owners. The majority of the court petitions in Marion County and throughout eastern Florida consisted of requests to divide, rather than to consolidate, ownership of slaves amongst kin or to sell the slaves at public auction. More often than not, economic interests drove masters' decisions and led to the dehumanization of slaves. The Florida slave was often separated temporarily, and sometimes permanently, from those he or she loved. The abnormality of Willis trial shows that there were probably fewer hard plantations and mean slave drivers in Eastern Florida than there were in Mississippi, Alabama, and in other places where the plantations were great in number and size."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":1420,"lat":29.0561754463,"lng":-82.0448605922,"zoom":8,"place":"MARION, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2124,"title":"Virginia General Assembly Votes on Railroad\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-09","end_date":"1835-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By 1835, the Industrial Revolution had swept up Richmond in its wave of innovation and change.

More than ever, industrial success depended on tying resources, markets, and people together in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Railroads were becoming the preferred way to do this, and any effort by the legislature to build an expensive railroad needed a lot of public support. ","But why was the General Assembly so eager to link coal mines with industrial centers (like Richmond) on the James River? The answer reflects an underlying fear that plagued many Virginians in the early nineteenth century: economic inferiority. Virginia had been a dominant producer of coal in the early decades of the nation's history, but by the 1830's the state was beginning to feel the strain of economic division. Rather than devoting itself completely to the production of one good (like states in the deeper South who depended on cotton), Virginia had diversified. As a result, coal miners in the west found themselves in competition with planters in the east for slave labor and transportation resources. This strain resulted in high prices and poor quality, setting Virginia behind other coal-producing states further north. Railroads represented a possible remedy for this problem, and would give entrepreneurs the ability to move coal from the mines to Richmond fast enough to be competitive with other states. Unfortunately, even the infusion of new technology brought on by the Industrial Revolution could not save Virginia's mining business. Although officials in Richmond tried to revive the industry (and gain public support), coal mining in the state was destined to remain the victim of arrested industrialization."],"display_date":"January 9, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-09","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2130,"title":"A Meeting of the Knox County Colonization Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-06-01","end_date":"1850-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the week of June 16, 1850, the Knox County Colonization Society convened for a meeting. This was of great significance because it marked the second anniversary of the Society in the city of Knoxville. At this time, the Chairman of this society declared that 15 to 20 free blacks of the city were ready to begin the process of emigration to Liberia. During the meeting, officers for the following year were also nominated and later, elected. The newly elected officers of the Executive Board were then granted the responsibility to communicate with applicants for emigration. Their duty was to instruct the applicants as of how to raise funds for the journey and any other information they might need to facilitate their quest.","Much about these potential emigrants is unknown. The African Americans in question could have been free blacks who had decided on their own accord to migrate to Africa where they could live freely. This scenario, however, is unlikely due to the expense such a journey would require. More likely than not, these were former slaves who were recently released by their masters. After slaves were manumitted, their options were limited in terms of where they could settle. Often, in order to live freely, they were required to either leave their homes and migrate to a non-slave state or travel to Liberia. With the monetary help of their former owner and benevolent organizations like the Knox County Colonization Society, this trip could be made feasible. ","Though many states and localities created colonization societies, only a small percentage of blacks actually made the journey to Liberia. Although expense was a key deterrent, other factors also played a role in inhibiting this movement. Historian Melvin Ely argues that a significant barrier to the success of colonization were the wishes of blacks themselves. Many did not like the idea of leaving behind the only world that they knew. If free blacks themselves were not compelled to make this journey, whose best interests were taken into account for this movement's justification? Ely shed some light on this question by noting the abolitionist opposition to emigration. Abolitionists believed that black emigration to Liberia was just a cover for the desire of whites to rid themselves of the burden of the free black population. Armed with this perspective, one begins to question whether this movement was as benevolent or as humanitarian as it appeared on its surface."],"display_date":"June 1850","search_date":"1850-06-15","locations":[{"id":12155,"lat":36.0086650052,"lng":-83.9297656575,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2131,"title":"The Wheat Economy in Antebellum Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-09-12","end_date":"1830-09-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["George Watson was a businessman in antebellum Richmond. With a profitable wheat farm and an advanced method of distribution in place, Watson regularly shipped hundreds of bushels of grain across the region from his base in Henrico County. Like any businessman, he also kept a tight eye on his bottom line - constantly setting and resetting the price of wheat once demand started to pick up. Watson was also George Valentine's boss. Valentine, an overseer in the wheat trade, regularly made the long wagon trip from the wheat farms near Richmond to the mill in Louisa to deliver bushels of grain to be ground into flour. Besides making sure every wagonload got where it needed to go, Valentine was also the middle man between Watson and the mill operators. Like any good employee, he tried to get his boss a good deal. When Watson wanted to fix the price of each shipment in order to turn a heavier profit, Valentine took care of business on the ground level. After one particular journey to the mill, Valentine told Watson he could, fix the price any time you please for the whole crop in order to maximize revenue. Watson and Valentine were clearly regular customers in the wheat trade, and were cut a good deal by the owners of the mill for their patronage. ","  Watson had a reason for wanting to fix the price of his shipments (and thereby maximize profit). In the antebellum South, Virginia did not enjoy the same cotton-based slave economy that was so common in the Deep South. In order to remain economically competitive, the central plains of Virginia specialized in wheat production. Farmers like Watson helped the state become one of the leading wheat producers in the nation, with Richmond serving as a central trading point. Virginia growers often shipped hundreds of thousands of bushels of wheat per year to Northern cities and foreign ports.   Thirty years after Watson received Valentine's report, Virginia's wheat-producing capacity would become vitally important to the Confederacy's self-sufficiency.

In 1852, the local government of Marietta passed an ordinance against negroes hiring out their own time or living on lots to themselves. This new law was greatly at odds with Jenny's current living situation. Jenny believed that under the law she would no longer prosper at her current residence. Faced with these unfavorable circumstances, she traveled to Atlanta to see if her options there would be any better. In the city, she encountered a certain Mr. Jeremiah who agreed to take her in on his lot and protect her. To determine whether or not Jenny could take this course of action, Andrew J. Hansell sent a letter to Farish Carter asking for him to approve of her removal to Atlanta.","What remains unclear in this episode is the status of Jenny, the African American woman who desired to relocate. It seems as if Jenny's lifestyle had been seriously affected on account of the passage of Marietta's ordinance. Her displeasure with the new law indicates that she was either hiring herself out for work or living on a lot to herself. Considering these factors, one might conclude that Jenny was a free black. However, the letter sent from Hansell to Carter requesting approval for Jenny to move to Atlanta implied that Jenny was not free to make decisions concerning her place of residence. This letter also mentioned that Jenny would have to return home if she was not permitted to move to Atlanta. The use of the word <em>home</em> indicated that her inhabitance of the dwelling in Marietta was only temporary. ","This incident shows the types of measures local governments in the Antebellum South took to deprive African Americans of what little freedom they had left to enjoy. Due to the passage of Marietta's ordinance, a free black community, like that of Israel Hill in Virginia that historian Melvin Ely describes in his book <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, would never be realized in Cobb County. On Israel Hill, free blacks were permitted to live independently and hire themselves out as laborers. Ely does note, however, that as the issue of slavery grew on the federal level in the 1850's, whites tried once again to reduce the status of free blacks down to a level very close to slavery. It is quite possible that this retrogression of attitudes towards slavery was what the slaves and free blacks of Marietta saw with the passage of the Ordinance in the early 1850's.

On board were 145 bales of John A. Quitman's cotton. However, only 17 of the bales actually reached New Orleans as expected. The <em>Vicksburg </em>had an accident, and one hundred and twenty eight of Quitman's bales were unaccounted for. An accident such as this would have been very bad news for any southern plantation owner. Fortunately for Quitman, another ship picked up about two hundred bales of cotton out of the Mississippi River, some bearing the mark of Quitman's plantation, the Palmeya. Quitman could have only hoped that the remainder of his cotton would be recovered. "," On September 20, Quitman received a letter from A&J Dennis, the firm in New Orleans through which he shipped his cotton. The firm obviously had not received his shipment and had heard of the accident. A&J Dennis hoped that only a small portion of the cotton was actually damaged. Luckily for Quitman, he held insurance on his shipment. The insurance would cover the cotton at thirty-five dollars a bale, which would have been close to the value of Quitman's cotton. "," The destruction of the <em>Vicksburg </em>would have been very harmful to Quitman if his cotton had been lost. The importance of cotton in the 1830s cannot be overstated. The staple was the major cash crop of the Mississippi delta, and losing such a large shipment would have a negative economic impact on a plantation owner. The cotton trade had boomed in the beginning of the nineteenth century, making cotton the most important crop in Mississippi. "," The steamboat provided an efficient means to transport Mississippi's large shipments of cotton. In 1812 Steamboats began to run between Natchez and New Orleans. The new boats were cost-effective and fast. Steamboats carrying slaves and cotton inundated New Orleans, bringing vast wealth to the region. By 1830 the steamboat was vital to the economic wellbeing of the Mississippi River area. Although Quitman held insurance on his cotton, and would not have been economically devastated by the loss of a shipment, his correspondence shows that cotton and the steamboats that carried it played a very important role in his life."],"display_date":"September 1842","search_date":"1842-09-15","locations":[{"id":6925,"lat":31.4831695494,"lng":-91.3531349834,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2156,"title":"Indian Removal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1832-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On January 30, 1832 The <em>Woodville Mississippian</em> published an extensive letter from Lewis Cass, the Secretary of War, to Andrew Jackson, the President of the United States. Cass was concerned about the policy that the government would take regarding the Native Americans living in the United States. Cass admitted that whites had harmed the Indians for the past two centuries, and he saw the need to make up for this damage. It would be best for the Indians, he declared, if they were moved west of the Mississippi River. Certainly if they remained in white communities their race would be eventually be destroyed. Cass argued that the average Native American was lazy and stubborn and feared the anger of the Great Spirit should he depart from the customs of his fathers. Because of these characteristics, Cass said, Indians would not realize that whites were genuinely attempting to help them. The best course of action would be to remove the Indians and let them learn from the example of the white settlers. "," The subject of Cass's letter was an important issue in Mississippi in 1832. Until 1830 the Choctaws and the Chickasaws possessed the majority of the land in Mississippi. This began to change immediately after Andrew Jackson assumed office. On January 17, 1930, Mississippi extended its governance over Native American lands, which forced the Native American tribes to move westward if they wanted to maintain their independent government. In the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek the Choctaws agreed to move westward, and in 1832 the Treaty of Pontotoc Creek removed the Chickasaws as well."," The removal of the Choctaw and the Chickasaw changed Mississippi on economic, social, and political levels. White males looking for new opportunities would have been ecstatic to open their local newspaper and see Cass's suggestions to the president. According to historian John Ray Skates, The Indian cessions tripled the public lands available for settlement and provoked explosive changes for the state of Mississippi. Suddenly a huge expanse of land was open and ready to be transformed into cotton fields. "," The plantation owners of Mississippi Delta, however, may have been less excited about the new abundance of land. As more and more people flooded into the remainder of the state, the old plantation owners in the river counties were quickly outnumbered and began to lose political power. Most of the new settlers were Democrats, unlike most of the politicians from the Delta. The new settlers moved the state capital out of the Delta, from Natchez to Jackson. Then, in 1832, the government of Mississippi declared universal suffrage for white men and terminated property holding requirements for office. The plantation owners of the Delta no longer had political control over the state. Although citizens of the Delta probably agreed with Cass that the Indians should be moved, ultimately, they were not happy with the political changes that resulted."],"display_date":"1830 - 1832","search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":7336,"lat":31.1610416216,"lng":-91.3109144316,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKINSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2157,"title":"Improvements in Transportation\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-01","end_date":"1838-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On December 15, 1837 the citizens of Vicksburg were very excited to see a new notice in their newspaper, The <em>Vicksburg Register.</em> J.R. & P.

The old line to Jackson was still running, so Mississippians could count on two coaches running between the cities. In addition, U.S. mail coaches ran three times a week from Grand Gulf to Brandon, stopping in Jackson. This meant that citizens of Vicksburg were able to go to Jackson to get their mail. This news would be thrilling in a time when transportation was dangerous and mail delivery was unreliable. "," The coaches provided a safe form of land transportation. Most southerners were very concerned with the poor quality of roads in the region. A large portion of the roads in the South were barely usable. They were narrow and overgrown, and high humidity caused the ground to stay muddy, trapping wagons. Ground transportation was impractical, but plantation owners in the Mississippi Delta had little motivation to develop better roads. Canal and river transportation was both more efficient and less expensive than road transportation. In the Delta, boats could be used to travel along rivers and through swamps. Steamboats on the Mississippi River were used to ship cotton and other goods, so plantation owners did not feel pressure to expand inland transportation for trade. "," Because the Mississippi Delta relied on rivers and canals so heavily, other forms of ground transportation also failed to develop in the area. By the end of the 1830s, at the time of J.R. & P. Jefferson's notice, railroads were becoming more and more prevalent across the nation. However, a railroad system failed to fully develop in the Deep South, where water transportation seemed more practical. Although Mississippians mostly used rivers for travel, the addition of a stage coach to unite the state was significant. J.R. & P.

Johnson Barbour and Caroline H. Watson had little else on their minds than what the next post would bring as they anticipated November 7 - the day when they would finally be united as husband and wife.  The distance that separated the young couple heightened their anticipation, for Caroline lived in Richmond while Barbour lived in the rural county of Albemarle, northwest of the state capital.  To overcome this hardship, Barbour and Caroline relied on letters to remain intimate and plan for their future.  While Barbour's visits to his betrothed were carefully chaperoned or in the presence of social parties, he took advantage of the private nature of letters to express some of his deeper feelings for Caroline and establish a closer relationship.  Barbour shed any shyness he may have had and wrote explicitly of his love, even employing poetry and metaphor to describe to Caroline his anticipation of the day when You have promised to resign, One half of that dear name, And thenceforth own no other, Name but mine. Despite his zealous love, Barbour never violated the rigid expectations of decorum and addressed his letters to Miss Caroline H. Watson, not daring to refer to her by her Christian name until only a few days before their marriage when he wrote, As this is the last letter I may write you before our union I beg leave to salute you as - My Dear Caroline.","Barbour was not entirely sentimental, however, and also wrote practically to plan for their future. Concerned about how Caroline would adjust to a country life, he warned his future wife that she might have to face the dullness, the tedium, the monotony of country life and renounce the busy, alluring society of Richmond.  Albemarle County, as a largely agrarian county, differed greatly from the colorful excitement of Richmond and was clearly a concern for the future groom.  He worried if a lady of her social status could truly adapt to become the happy wife of a country gentleman - an apprehension common to brides as well.  In marrying Barbour, Caroline was sacrificing her social life, friends, and family to move to Albemarle and lead a largely quieter life despite Barbour's insistence that it was social enough for all of its inhabitants. Barbour assured his betrothed however, that they would overcome those trials with their love. ","As opposed to couples on the frontier or in a less developed area of the south, Melinda S. Buza notes that Virginian couples such as Barbour and Caroline were fortunate that the commonwealth had a fixed system of roads to allow for travel and mail by the time of their romance.  Regular written correspondence, Buza argues, allowed for Virginians to distinguish themselves from other engaged couples in the antebellum South because it provided them with the opportunity to establish intimacy and love within the South's rigid social system. ","Adhering to the propriety demanded in southern society, Brenda Stevenson observes that courtship involved a series of intricate social expectations and conformities for all concerned parties. Barbour's mother, Mrs. Lucy Barbour, felt inclined to extend a proper welcome to Caroline, assuring her of her son's wonderful qualities and of her confidence in the couple's future happiness. Parents like Mrs. Barbour tended to be proactively involved within their children's future marriages as they hoped to find companions of compatible character, solid education, moral standing, and economic stability to advance their family's own social standing and reputation.  Many historians have consequently questioned if love was a true facet of antebellum courtship and marriage or the institution became solely an instrument of social and economic improvement.  Virginia, however, appears to have allowed for a greater degree of love within the personal advancement associate with marriage; Lucy Barbour's desired to be involved in the courtships affairs of her son, not primarily as a schemer of economic gain, but as a guardian of his happiness in finding true love with Caroline.  While other southern couples were restricted by the existing social norms, Buza argues that the roles of Southern lady and male patriarch clearly did not hinder the development of deep bonds between many husbands and wives. Buza holds that due to greater access to mail and a growing emphasis on love, nineteenth century Virginia was one of the earlier states to witness real romantic love between husbands and wives of the South."],"display_date":"August 26, 1844 - October 30, 1844","search_date":"1844-09-27","locations":[{"id":13596,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2185,"title":"Thomas Jefferson Randolph&#39;s Controversial Opportunity to Assist the Choctaw Indians\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-03-08","end_date":"1837-03-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When the mail arrived in Albemarle County on March 8, 1837, Thomas Jefferson Randolph may have been surprised to receive a letter from R. G. Nicholas informing him that he had been nominated and accepted as Com[missioner] for settling claims to reservations under the Choctaw Treaty.  As a prominent gentleman from a well-established Virginian family, Randolph was a natural choice for the position except that the Choctaw Indian tribe lived in Mississippi, far removed from his native state of Virginia.  By the 1830s Virginia no longer had internal incidents with Indians because the nation's frontier lines had expanded and pushed tribes farther west.  But even residents of Albemarle County would have been very interested in the future of the Indians because these tribes lived on very precious land within the South's cotton economy.  ","Although the Choctaw tribe had recently earned distinction in the War of 1812 and had been declared the perpetual friend of America on October 24, 1816, when Mississippi became a state in 1817 the Choctaw Indians threatened the American identity of the new state.  They not only proved a problem for settlers wishing to move to the frontier, but moreover, by continuing to act as an independent nation within the United States, the Choctaws threatened the authority of the Mississippi state government. Grateful for the stability and unity of their own community, Albemarle County residents and other southerners would have expressed concern that the Choctaws posed an obstacle to greater prosperity of the South.  For this reason, political leaders throughout the 1820s and 1830s searched for ways to push the Choctaw westward onto territorial lands that were not officially part of the United States. ","In September of 1830, Andrew Jackson's administration finally concluded the treaty referred to by Nicholas as the Choctaw Treaty. Officially known as the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, the treaty removed the Choctaw Indians west of the Mississippi River and claimed all lands east of the river as the property of the United States.  But Article 14 of the treaty decreed that if any Choctaw Indian agreed to become a citizen of the United States, the U.S. government promised to give them a parcel of land on which they might live and farm.  Nicholas' letter alerted Randolph that he had been nominated to assign these pieces of land to those Choctaws who chose to remain. In presenting him with all of the particulars of the position, Nicholas informed Randolph that his pay would be three thousands dollars a year and that though there would be little personal risk involved the position would require ten or twelve months of his time.  But overall his letter drips of resentment towards the Indians who tried to remain in Mississippi because he considered it a cowardly last attempt to avoid removal.  His bitterness was obvious when he commented to Randolph that, if he accepted the position, his job would require him to assist some of the greatest scoundrels in the world. Nicholas doubted the sincerity of the Choctaw who had chosen to remain and suggested that he would be relived to hear that Randolph had declined accepting the appointment.","A week later, on March 14, 1837, Randolph received the official offer from R.B. Poinsett officially offering him the position of Commissioner to adjust claims to reserves of land under the fourteenth article of the treaty with the Choctaw Indians.  While there is no sign of Randolph's acceptance or refusal of the appointment within these two letters, as seen from Nicholas' letter, such a position would certainly have been debatable in southern society.  While some, like Nicholas, might have resented the Indians as a threat to the unity of the South, others would have defended the Choctaws' rights to the land and would have been grateful for the government's merciful offer to the Indians.

He cleaned the knives, swept the floors, and later tended to the sheep, cows, and hogs. Robert's mistress thought a great deal of him and kept him around the house as much as possible. In Robert's words his mistress felt that nothing went right if I [Anderson] did not have something to do with it. His mistress even allowed him to be taught how to read until she found out this was against the law. His place in the household was one of a very responsible and dependable slave, and this influenced him later in life. When Robert was close twenty years old, his master, Dr. Anderson, decided to move to Glynn County, Georgia. Robert decided to go with him even thought it was hard for him to leave his home. However, it did not seem that he was forced to leave, because he stated in his own autobiography that he went with Dr. Anderson because the doctor was his master and they thought a great deal of one another. An episode that shed light on at least one aspect of their relationship was when they were traveling across the Ocmulgee River. The ferryman struck Dr. Anderson's horse and they argued for a bit and then left the ferry. When they got off, Dr. Anderson asked Robert what he would have done if the ferryman had struck him [Dr. Anderson], instead of his horse. Robert replied vigorously that he would have knocked the ferryman into the water. His master replied thankfully, and pledged that since they were in a strange county now he would make sure to also defend Robert whenever necessary. He firmly stated he would not let anybody take advantage of Robert. Thus on the banks of the river, they pledged themselves to one another and remained so until he [Dr. Anderson] departed this life.","It may seem surprising that a slave and his master seemed truly fond of one another, when in many cases slavery was brutal and did not seem to have a warm, emotional side to it. However, it is important to remember that many masters told themselves it was their duty to take care of their slaves and to be fatherly caretakers. Also, it is important to remember that Robert, and other house slaves, were in close proximity to their masters for most of the day, if not night. This obviously led to some sort of bond, though unequal, to their master and mistress. White women and children across the South often became very attached to their household slaves- people who cleaned for them, nursed them, and raised them. Field slaves often would not have enjoyed this privileged or warmer relationship with their masters. Even though the slave-master relationship was in no way equal, and whites would not like to admit it: both masters and slaves (especially house slaves or slaves on smaller plantations) depended on one another, and were more intimate than one would guess. Both Dr. Anderson and Robert probably felt safer together with someone they had known for decades, since they were in a strange new county. Of course their relationship was imbalanced, as all master-slave relationships were, but it was obvious in many cases that slaves were a form of comfort to their masters. Many slaveholders felt that their slaves were their own people and sometimes had a degree of sentimental feelings towards them. Many whites felt that they really knew what was best for their slaves. Slave-owners often defined themselves by their slaves and whether this brought about a semi-good or bad relationship, it brought out a relationship nonetheless. No matter how unequal the relationship was and no matter how rare it was for slaves and masters to have this affection for one another, his fondness for his master and his master's apparent fondness for Robert made a lasting impression on the future Reverend Robert Anderson for the rest of his life. He was not the only slave in the South who had a more positive relationship with his master than many people would have believed was possible, but it is still important to remember the brutal aspects of slavery, and that even these positive relationships were still not equal or just."],"display_date":1836,"search_date":"1836-07-01","locations":[{"id":1836,"lat":31.0887336961,"lng":-81.4509546531,"zoom":9,"place":"GLYNN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2214,"title":"Railway Disaster Prevented by the Courageous Deeds of One Man\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-01-14","end_date":"1882-01-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["  If it were not for the courageous actions of Mr. I. P. Irving one Wednesday evening in 1882, disaster assuredly would have befallen the railway system outside Waynesboro. Four trains were supposed to meet and pass four sections of extra trains traveling in opposite directions on the C. &. O. road. When the extra trains were tardy, eleven trains on Waynesboro's main tracked were unable to travel as they had to wait for the arrival of the extra trains. Three of the extra trains finally came and so the number 14 started out on the main track, probably rushing to make up for lost time. Unfortunately, inclement weather made the climb up the steep grade to the tunnel difficult for the train and it needed help. Mr. Irving, engineer of the train following the number 14, detached his engine from his own train and hooked it to number 14 to push it up the hill. He had just begun to reverse back to his own train when he spied a section of the number 14 speeding down the track toward him. The uncoupling of these thirteen cars on the steep seventy-five foot slope of the track created a treacherous situation as it seemed very likely that the cars would ram into Mr. Irving's train at a very high speed, resulting in a loss of life and property.","  Mr. Irving acted quickly and with confidence, starting his engine toward the oncoming cars in order to reduce the strength of the impact. He pushed the train engine to full power and then reversed immediately prior to the collision to lessen the crash. He braced himself for the collision of the runaway cars and his engine, enduring a crash likely greater than the shock of an avalanche. His plan succeeded and the escaped section of number 14 ceased its flight. While one car was pushed up over the boiler of the engine and another wrecked, these were minor damages compared to the tragedy that would have resulted without Mr. Irving's courageous intervention.","   Railroad development was one of the most commanding attractors of Northern capital, helping to unify the North and South through a common interest in the progression of transportation. Construction rapidly increased in 1879, a period in which the amount of rails laid per mile doubled that of any previous year since 1873. The North invested huge amounts of money in the Southern railway system, suggesting why this event was of enough significance to be published on a national level in both Washington, DC and New York. This wide publication supports historian C. Vann Woodward case that Southern railroads were more important that Southern land for generating capital by showing a widespread interest in the accident that would not occur if the disaster was with a tract of land. Mr. Irving's heroism was applauded because it helped to save thousands of dollars in damages. Though the newspaper mentioned the bravery of Mr. Irving's actions, it never specifically mentioned what injuries he sustained as a result of the violent collision. Of interest to those Northerners reading the news article was not the individual survival of a railroad engineer, but the amount of money his heroism saved them. The development of the railway system was necessary for the technological progression of the American South by making transportation and migration much simpler and shortening the effective distance between cities.

On September 19, 1856, the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> reported a peculiar incident involving a Northerner who had made his way South. The captain of ship from Maine docked his ship in the port at Alexandria, Virginia. Upon hearing the results of the election in his home state, the captain hurrahing as he went had [his ship] hauled out into the middle of the Potomac, let go her anchor, ran up his bunting and fired his guns all night in honor of his home. The sailor boisterously put forth his pride in the Abolitionist outcomes of the elections in his free home state for all his Virginia hosts to see."," The <em>Tribune </em>also reported on the coverage the occurrence received in the local <em>Alexandria Gazette</em>. The <em>Gazette</em> claimed the sailor's actions proved an insult to the great state of Virginia. The Northern paper proceeded to attack the <em>Gazette</em> for its indignation of the captain's actions by saying, The dignity of the honorable states of Virginia and Maryland is insulted by the infernal noise of a half-mad sailor glorifying over the elections of Abolitionists in Maine Poor <em>Gazette</em>, it don't understand that the heart of a sailor...beats rapidly at the sound of oppression, and always rejoices when the right is the victor "," The <em>Tribune</em> berated the Southerners attack on the half-mad sailor as pathetic and unnecessary. However, for those living in the South, any influx of Abolitionist rhetoric had to be viewed as a threat. As William Link contests, in the years directly before Secession, slaveholders had to constantly protect the institution of slavery from ideological threats, both from within the social system of the South and from the invasion of radical antislavery Northerners. While to the journalists from Chicago, the actions of the captain could simply be viewed as the patriotic expression of a free spirited man of the sea, to those in Alexandria, anxious to protect their way of life based on slavery, the actions of a man celebrating the victories of abolitionists, had to be viewed as a threat. Even if the election took place in the far-away cold North of Maine, any victory for abolitionism was a loss for the cause of defending slavery."],"display_date":"September 19, 1856 - December 31, 1856","search_date":"1856-11-09","locations":[{"id":14383,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ALEXANDRIA CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2234,"title":"Adie and the Railroad\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-01-08","end_date":"1888-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["B. W. Adie wrote to his sister from Camden, Missouri on Janurary 9, 1888 after a lull in their family correspondence. He told his sister that he was recently employed by the Chicago Santa Fe and California Railroad. His main concern regarding this job was the weather in Missouri: you can rest assured it's cold enough. I have caught a bad cold and am not at work this morning. Adie did not mention much else of consequence in his letter except to inquire if another relation was also still employed in the Railroad business. He signed off the short letter by saying, give my love to all. I have nothing to say that would interest you so may as well stop writing these few lines excepting to let you know I am still in the land of the living. "," Before the Civil War, 96 percent of railroad manufacturers were northern based, and throughout the war, the North used their railroads much more successfully than the South. After the war, southern railroads were, almost devastated; much of their rolling stock was gone, and many tracks, stations, and bridges were ruined, according to the Robert O'Brien. But with the help of the federal government that sold cheap military railroad property to the South, along with, northern money and northern iron being poured into the south, by the 1880s and 90s, the railroad industry was at its peak growth point: 70,000 miles of track were laid in the 1880s alone. Historian John B. Boles observed that at this time the railroad grew to an extent matched by few independent nations; and trade networks proliferated and the volume of goods increased apace. The same text acknowledged the growth of railroads not only in places like Missouri where Adie was, but other southern states like Georgia, They quickly understood that railroads held the key to economic development: the rails that carried lumber out could also carry persons and goods back in. As the population of the region grew and the open range shrank, commercial agriculture took root with the railroads."," Adie was reasonably proud of his position on a railroad, since it was one of the only booming southern industries at the time. However, working conditions were still tough on actual railroad workers, especially with such a high demand for railroads in the late 1800s. Places like Missouri were often cold in comparison to the deep South, and men like Adie who were subject to the outdoor physical labor that railroad work required could easily get sick. Labor conditions for railroad work were often less than satisfactory, causing the railroad industry to be one of the first birth places for worker unions. There were particularly violent strikes in 1877 and 1894 over work wages, hours, and conditions. Adie reported working on the railroad just after the first strike, and a year after the Federal Railroad Administration was commissioned to ensure that safety regulations were followed for railroad labor in 1887. In this temporary lull of appeasement in between the strikes, even though he might have been prone to catch cold, Adie's actual labor conditions should have been better than before. "," As the twentieth century drew near, railroads became more regulated. In 1887 The Interstate Commerce Act put railroads under the financial supervision of federal institutions. By the Progressive area (post-1900s), the railroad became such a hugely prominent money making industry, that it eventually developed into a popular breeding ground for corruption and monopolies.

Their son, Glenn, worked nearby on a tugboat that went up and down the Mississippi, and Frank, a tinsmith from New Orleans, continued a desperate search for work throughout the year. Alice, also out of work, remained on the houseboat most of the time, except for a few explorations of the city of St. Louis on foot to entertain herself. Both Frank and Alice wrote regularly to their brother and sister, Arthur and Ellen P. Thrasher. The correspondence from Frank and Alice to Arthur and Ellen illustrates the fact that Frank and Alice are having serious financial troubles harbored in Missouri, from which they cannot seem to get out from underneath. Alice wrote to Arthur on August 2, 1897, not a thing to complain about, only the lack of income. And consequently running behind financially. Alice spends much of her letter to Arthur relating to him how she felt blue and worried almost obsessively over finances, although she was very proud of Glenn for having a job, which was not easy to come by in St. Louis in that time. ","Alice made it very clear in her letters that the living and working conditions of St. Louis were uncomfortable and poor compared to other cities she lived in before that were farther south, like New Orleans. In her letter of August 2, And if we ever succeed in getting out, I think we will give it a 'wide berth' in the future. Alice and Frank had plans to sell the boat to the first buyer and head for home via New York City, but as Frank observed in a letter written on August 24, 1897: There don't seem to be anyone around here with money enough to buy a boat yet but I still am thinking there will be before many weeks now. Frank, who was a little more optimistic in his letters to his relatives than Alice, wrote in a letter postmarked July 12, 1897, Business is about the same with us. I have no work yet but think will have some soon. I put an ad in the paper and may hear something from that but will not be surprised in case nothing comes of it as money is sure scarce. ","From living on a houseboat, the Thrashers were able to get a broader perspective of conditions up and down the Mississippi than most southerners. Alice was aware of St. Louis in relation to other cities in the North and South, which she made clear in her August 2 letter: I am convinced this is the very largest city I was ever in. I have found just that it claims nearly 700,000 population. And since Brooklyn has helped to swell New York city's population, St. Louis has become the 4th city in size in the U.S. New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago being greater; they, running up into the millions in counting their population. She was also aware of the conditions in New Orleans because of her family there. When Mrs. Alice Thrasher wrote to their relations in New Orleans, she indicated that they were well off, and at times was slightly jealous in the letters to her sister, Ellen, Your letter was 'breezy and hopeful': I only wish I had some of the of the work that you and Aunt Lil each do. But while I have not, I am not so one- sided in my sympathies that I can't feel glad that you are prospering. "," Frank and Alice were well-traveled, and could see the differences not only between the cities of the northern and southern parts of the South, but the differences between the North and South as a whole. They often noted in their letters that their poor economic standing was not uncommon in other southern cities in the nineteenth century. Instead of a middle class, the South and its, conservative form of urban industrialism after the Civil War gave birth to a fairly economically polarized society. Factors that caused this gap between the very wealthy and very poor might have been a combination of economic, social and political factors which kept the region off what Jonathan M. Wiener called the classic capitalist path that had been blazed by England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and followed by the northern states. There was a large expectation for the South during Reconstruction to quickly join in the industrial revolution of the North. But cities like St. Louis, although big and bustling, did not always provide enough jobs for skilled craftsmen. Factories wanted men who could act as cogs in textile mills, not men like Frank Thrasher who was a skilled tinsmith. Even if Thrasher took a job in a factory, wages were shockingly low. Historian William H. Nicholls argued that perhaps, had the pace of the South's post-bellum industrial development matched that of the earlier industrial Revolution of England or New England... The Southern middle class would have flowered more profusely. Some historians, like Wilbur J. Cash, argue that because economics in the South were originally based on plantations, the region's middle class remained subservient to the values of the planter, the result of which was an economy that only benefited a small but powerful coalition of planters, merchants and industrialists. Cities like St. Louis in the nineteenth-century urban South did not get the economic boom for middle class men like Thrasher that the North did."],"display_date":"1895 - 1898","search_date":"1896-12-31","locations":[{"id":8037,"lat":38.6358212793,"lng":-90.2450510752,"zoom":11,"place":"ST LOUIS CITY, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2263,"title":"North Carolina Needs Capital-Not Labor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-09-17","end_date":"1877-09-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By September, 1877, Governor Vance of North Carolina, elected in 1876, called upon the immigrant laborers of Northern cities, such as those currently on strike in Baltimore, to venture to North Carolina to fill what he perceived to be a labor shortage in North Carolina manufacturing and industry.

Important enough that it was stored with the Duke family's personal belongings, one postcard from the late nineteenth century displayed a famous Timothy O'Sullivan photograph taken of the McLean family seated on the steps of their home. The postcard told the story of April 9, 1865, where Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant in the house of Wilmer McLean at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. The two Generals met in a room on the left side of the house and drew up the articles of surrender that marked the end of the War Between the States. The interesting part of the Surrender House history was just beginning as shown by the last line on the back of the postcard - This building was torn down to be rebuilt a St. Louis World's Fair.","The discovery of the postcards in the attic added to the history of the Surrender House. In 1867, the McLean family sold the house and moved to Alexandria, Virginia where Wilmer McLean had been born and built his fortune before marrying the widow Virginia Mason and moving to Appomattox County, Virginia. After transferring hands a few times between the Pascoe and Ragland families, M.E. Dunlap of Niagara Falls, New York, who had lofty plans for the property, eventually bought the house. Originally, his zealous plans were to move the house either to St. Louis as stated in the quote of the postcard or to Chicago for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893.","Instead of hiring New York architects and contractors, Dunlap kept the process local and hired a Lynchburg, Virginia contracting company by the name of Hardy and Hancock Contractors to draw up blueprints of the house in order to have it successfully dismantled, moved, and rebuilt in its new location. In February of 1893, C. Hubbard of Hardy and Hancock Contractors made five blueprints of the building: the basement plan and house section, the front porch cornices and columns, the window and mantle details, the first floor plan, and the second floor plan.

It was hardly a triumphant parade of U.S. naval power. The Sailing Master of such a flagship was one Edward C. Anderson, and he took in the alien landscape as it passed on either side. Upon arriving at Miami, he found it to be little more than a collection of armed occupants, so called, receiving from government a certain quantity of land as a grant, in a suffocating tropical environment. Possible fertile river bed soil was made worthless by layers of limestone, and the horizon stretched off into a pine barren land. Worsening an already unspectacular picture were the horseflies and mosquitoes that infested the region; all animals must be covered and kept in dark stables or the insects would make the blood trickle from every pore.","Indeed, Miami's future did not seem bright, but the settlers there were still very sanguine of establishing eventually a flourishing settlement and have laid out a town yet to be built. Anderson was not so hopeful. He did not see it possible that Miami could become much more than it is for there are few facilities and no capital either at present or in prospect. In geographical terms, Miami is situated between the Bay of Biscayne to the east and the vast Everglades to the west. The area is a virtual swampland, abundant in peat and humid soil and averaging 65.5 inches of rainfall per year. Miami was not adapted for general agricultural development, and outsiders, such as Anderson, gave the settlement up for dead in 1844. The story of how Miami came to be one of the leading cities in Florida, the South, and the nation in the twentieth century is one of natural resources and an adaptive economy.","The antebellum history of Miami is marked by the same patterns as other Florida cities: Indian attacks, hurricanes, and poor agriculture. Miami became the seat of Dade County in 1844, the same year Master Anderson visited, but the county's population would decrease from 446 in 1840 to 85 in 1870. To put this in perspective, Dade County is almost the size of the state of Massachusetts. This mass migration was due, in part, to Seminole hostilities; the settlement did not recover. Miami's identity as a city would begin to take shape after 1870. Pioneers won their lands from the jungle around Miami and soil was reclaimed through canal drainage systems. Population rose to 861 in 1890, 3,322 in 1895, and would explode in the twentieth century with the extension of Henry M. Flagler's East Coast Railroad to Miami in 1896. Miami emerged as a resort and tourist destination and remains such to this day. ","Florida was very different from the rest of the South: stormier, swampier, less networked by railroads, and ravaged by Indian wars. With the exception of the Cotton districts in west and central Florida around Tallahassee, Florida failed to be a major cash crop producer. It excelled in citrus plantations but little else. Early on, Miami just did not fit in the mold of a prosperous southern city. The economic system was agricultural, and Miami could not function within that system and was pushed out of it. Even in 1880, Miami was practically nonexistent. Anderson would have seemed to be correct about the city and its settlers. Miami, along with other Florida cities, adapted with the system, and the advent of sophisticated railroads and the tourist industry gave Miami a specialization it could do well. A look back at Miami in 1844 shows how the physical surroundings and geographic location of settlements are the most important determinant of how cities develop, when they develop, and how they will be judged as a success by outsiders."],"display_date":"May 25, 1844","search_date":"1844-05-25","locations":[{"id":1317,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DADE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2289,"title":"Bradley Tyler Johnson&#39;s Woodlands\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-08-21","end_date":"1899-08-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1899 Bradley Tyler Johnson posted a flyer titled For lease on Ninety-Nine Year Terms that advertised a 99-year lease on his property, the Woodlands, located in Amelia County. Johnson had a very specific vision for the property; I want a colony of ten families from the Northwest to settle here, he wrote. Traditionally Southside Virginia, including Amelia County, had a rural background with very few towns of any size. In both the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries until the end of slavery, Southside Virginia had borrowed from the Chesapeake region the tobacco economy based upon slave labor, only lacking the wealth and sophistication. Johnson knew that the area would not attract those seeking great wealth, so he aimed his advertisement towards families committed to a rural lifestyle.","Bradley Tyler Johnson promoted the property through its location and land attributes. First, Johnson advertised on his flyer that the Woodlands was located only two and a half miles from the Amelia County Courthouse and 36 miles southwest of Richmond by the Southern Railroad. Other benefits the property based on its location included receiving mail twice a day, two newspapers - one from Baltimore, Maryland and the other from Washington, D.C., and telegraph service. Next Johnson went into detail in describing the many land attributes such as the red clay soil, the alluvium river bottoms, the oak forest, and plentiful streams and springs. He said that the Uplands have never been ploughed since the flood 'Before the Wah'. I suppose they were scrathed for an inch to an inch and a half, in depth by a mule and a n----r, but below that depth has never been stirred by the hand of man, and is just as virgin, as the morning Noah landed on Arabat. Johnson made plans to divide the Amelia County land into farms of 150 acres each and suggested that the settlers grow orchards of apples, grapes, pears, plums, and cherries.","Although it was not entirely clear whether Johnson would have leased the land to sharecroppers, sharecropping was a very common practice during and after Reconstruction. Sharecropping was leasing land to families who would pay their rent by giving the owner a portion of the crop grown on the land. During Reconstruction not only freedmen and women but also poor whites without land practiced sharecropping in Virginia. The practice continued strongly after Reconstruction especially in rural areas formerly based upon the labor of slaves such as the tobacco farms in Amelia County. Sharecropping exploited the people who worked the land by charging high interest rates on borrowed goods and by demanding large portions of their crop. Plantation owners in rural areas found themselves without labor after the Civil War and the practice of sharecropping helped to alleviate the burden of labor.","Johnson was a wealthy man who owned land in Amelia County while spending much of his time in his Richmond, Virginia home. He had a strong desire to lease his land to a colony of families who are neighbors and friends at home and would be so in a new country instead of Virginia locals who were likely to be freedmen and women. It is clear from the language of the advertisement that Johnson only planned to lease the land to white families based on a discussion of black labor and the use of derogatory, racist language. Johnson told the story of rural farmland and woodland where a family could find happiness but not riches instead of telling the story of sharecropping and how difficult life could be."],"display_date":"August 21, 1899","search_date":"1899-08-21","locations":[{"id":13617,"lat":37.3359551661,"lng":-77.9760581709,"zoom":10,"place":"AMELIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2298,"title":"A Relaxing Trip down the Bayou\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-03-22","end_date":"1845-03-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Lisa Rhinelander and her brother George, of New Orleans, were traveling along with some friends to a house party at a plantation on the Barataria Canal. They first traveled by railroad, then steamboat, until arriving at a point twenty miles down the river from the home they were to visit. It looked as though they had a long row ahead f them. But it turned out that their host had sent slaves to pull the boat along the canal. The slaves were put into harnesses like horses and began to drag the boat, canal-boat style, for the first ten miles of the journey. Lisa worried a little about the slaves working and toiling too hard but soon saw that that it was fine fun for them and that there was nothing they enjoyed more. She then lay back to relax and reflected on the beautiful day upon the bayou, enjoying how black moss hung in festoons from the cypress and oak trees, giving one the sense of being beyond [the] reach of a human being.","Lisa's solitude was short-lived, however. Her brother George decided to take the opportunity of a relaxing day on the bayou to engage in alligator hunting. George actually sho[t] and kill[ed] five alligators, the largest of which measure[d] twelve feet George was thus quite distinguished and applauded by his traveling companions. Lisa wrote to her mother in New York that she wished that her little brother had been there to see the excitement. The boat in which Lisa and her brother traveled down the canal on was most likely a keelboat. Keelboats originally were used to transport goods up and downriver, but in the late eighteenth century, planters began to used keelboats as pleasure crafts in coastal areas of the South. These boats usually had pavilions for the planter and his family and were usually oar-propelled or dragged by slaves. The boats were convenient; they could be used in shallow water because they only drew two to three feet when fully loaded. They were also more maneuverable because of their narrow beam and because they could be poled or hauled.","Hunting for sport was popular with both men and women in the South. Although alligator hunting was mostly confined to the lower coastal regions of the South-places such as South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana-other types of hunting flourished all over the South from Maryland and Virginia to Louisiana. Fashionable, less-serious, hunters, both men and women, usually only hunted fox and deer, while more serious hunters preyed on bears, fowl, rabbits, possums, and wild turkeys. Hunting for sport was usually the game of the upper class in the South. Most hunts were conducted on horseback, riding with hounds. When men went alligator hunting, they went on foot, but still brought with them packs of trained dogs. Throughout the South, slavery made possible this culture of upper-class leisure that Lisa and George enjoyed. According to Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, the quality of life that upper class Southerners enjoyed rested upon the labor of servants. The time that upper-class men and women spent reading, visiting friends, going hunting and on other various leisurely activities depended upon the slaves' performing all of the basic house and field work. Historian Walter Johnson says that slavery enabled a white woman [to be able to] skate lightly across the surface of daily exigency, her own composure unscathed by the messy process required to produce the pleasing tableau of her own life. Johnson also points out that the ability to own enough slaves to have this lifestyle is what distinguished the upper class from the lower classes. To be able to afford enough slaves so that one's wife only had to worry about leisure and gentility was something that marked out the class hierarchy and was something that men of wealth often made a point of telling their friends to emphasize personal wealth, wealth based upon the enslavement of other human beings."],"display_date":"March 22, 1845","search_date":"1845-03-22","locations":[{"id":5544,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2314,"title":"Kicked Out of Virginia?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While some slaves were able to gain their freedom in nineteenth century Virginia, they were often by law forced to leave the state shortly after their emancipation. Many went to the free states of Ohio or Pennsylvania. However, several petitions made by the residents of Loudoun County reveal that the newly freed blacks were often inclined to stay in Virginia. As the petitions disclose, they received both support and some resistance from their neighbors in Loudoun County.","In 1848, thirty-nine petitioners requested the help of the state legislature in permitting William Watson to remain in Virginia. Watson had been emancipated by his owner and had proved a man of good character, of industrious habits, charged with the support of large family. Additionally, the petition stated that Watson was a convenient and useful person to [the] community in the capacity of a day laborer. A similar petition, signed by 93 residents, was written in Leesburg in 1850, requesting that Harriet Cook, a free black, be permitted to live in the state. The document stated that she possessed a high character and was a valuable member of Society. The petitioners elaborated on her value to their lives when they explained that she provided laundry services to many in the town and her loss would be a great inconvenience.","Despite these petitions, not every citizen in Loudoun County supported the residence of William Watson and Harriet Cook. A 1850 petition asked that the two free blacks be removed from the county and that the law should serve as the remedy in such cases where it ought to be in the city and county courts. Twelve residents of the county put petition. As pointed out by the historian Joshua Rothman, Virginia law required free blacks emancipated after 1806 to leave the state permanently within one year of manumission, unless they received a petition from the state legislature. While some fought to keep their families together and retain the already mangled pieces of their lives, Rothman states others made the difficult move and left a state that didn't want them anymore. That didn't want them while they were free. As the above-mentioned petitions demonstrate, some freed slaves received help from their white neighbors in their fight to stay in the state. This situation reveals, that in race relations, whites did not act like whites were supposed to act and blacks did not act like blacks were supposed to act, when personal relationships complicated the idea of stark racial divides. However, while some in Loudoun County thought the presence of Billy Watson and Harriet Cook proved good, in fact somewhat essential, for community life, others thought it necessary that they leave."],"display_date":"1848 - 1850","search_date":"1849-07-01","locations":[{"id":14002,"lat":39.0907154711,"lng":-77.6357306744,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUDOUN, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2330,"title":"The Transfer of Information in the First Seminole War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1818-01-01","end_date":"1818-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The arrival of anyone new at a frontier fort like Fort Gadsden in Florida meant an influx of long-overdue news of the rest of the country and state. With the coming of Major Hogan, the new paymaster, in April of 1818 in the heat of the First Seminole War, came startling news of Indians murdering whites in Alabama and on the Sapulgue River. With the entrance of a sloop later in the month came more frightening news. There was a significant number of Indians gathering in nearby Pensacola, Florida. Upon hearing this news and concluding that the United States army would move to counter this build up of Seminole strength in Pensacola, Colonel Gibson ordered three thousand rations to Fort Scott. General Jackson then ordered his quartermaster to Mobile. He gave him instructions to gather and bring artillery and ammunition to Fort Montgomery and to ready his troops for war.","Information traveled slowly and irregularly on the frontier, especially on one like Florida's, which had no major newspapers or trade routes. Even so, news on the edge of United States territory typically traveled faster and more reliably by word of mouth and personal letters than it did in newspapers. This imperfect and slow communication system, while frustrating in peacetime, often proved fatal in times of war.","General Jackson, and General Gaines before him, made decisions during the First Seminole War based on imperfect and out-of-date information. Although some Indians in Alabama may have murdered a few whites there, and although Indians may have been gathering in Pensacola, it was by no means absolutely warranted for General Jackson to begin his build up of arms and preparation for war. Although Chief Neamathla of Fowl Town warned General Gaines in 1817 not to cross the Flint River and that the Seminoles would meet such actions with an appropriate response, he had also sent a letter via Major Twiggs to D.B. Mitchill entreating him to a compromise and peace settlement just a few months before. Had General Gaines waited just a few day or weeks, perhaps Mitchill would have had time to respond and begin negotiating with Chief Neamathla, thus preventing the first, or perhaps all three, of the bloody Seminole Wars.

She claimed to have knowledge of the whereabouts of Peter McQueen, an Indian prophet whom the United States Army had been pursuing for some time. General Jackson had recently just narrowly missed capturing his at Natural Bridge. As per his quick temper, the general was enraged. This Seminole woman presumably heard through word of mouth-there were some Indians serving under General Jackson's command-about his near miss. She offered to turn McQueen over to the United States in return for General Jackson to allow her people to be transported to the land of the upper Creeks, with sufficient provisions to tide them over until they could establish themselves agriculturally. In his furor, Jackson readily agreed to this pact, and she departed with a letter to the commanding officer of Fort St. Marks detailing the agreement. This was, however, the last recorded sighting of her. She never upheld her end of the bargain, nor did she seek further assistance from General Jackson in the relocation of her people. McQueen was, indeed, never captured.","The Seminoles, including the unnamed woman, were directly related to the Creeks. They were in fact originally members of the Creek confederacy in Alabama and Georgia. They migrated to Florida, however, in three distinct phases. In the first half of the eighteenth century, they executed small invasions of Spanish territory, but with the intent to raid white villages, rather than to establish settlements of their own. In the second half of the century, they began establishing villages; by 1812, the Seminoles inhabited at least six towns in Spanish Florida. From 1812 to 1820, the political and cultural tensions in Georgia and Alabama led many Creeks to move to Florida and join the Seminoles already living there. So when the Seminole woman asked General Jackson to help her people move back to the upper Creek nation, she was not asking for him to help her people invade another tribe's land. She was just asking to go home.","This incident is also a clear indication of the growing power of Seminole women. From 1812 to 1820, they experienced a significant increase in their ability to exist formally outside of the household. With the migration of Seminoles to Florida, they came increasingly into contact with whites, allowing them to enter into small trade with them. These agricultural business transactions-primarily involving Seminole women growing and selling oranges, melons, corn, rice, and peaches to whites-greatly increased the political legitimacy of these women, thereby giving the unnamed woman the authority to strike her deal with a general in the United States Army."],"display_date":"April 18, 1818","search_date":"1818-04-18","locations":[{"id":1280,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2340,"title":"John Dewery in Prison\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-07","end_date":"1836-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John Dewery, a bright mulatto...nineteen or twenty years old, found himself in a precarious situation. As he was sitting in the Clark County Jail in Alabama on January 7, 1836, the Mobile Commercial Register published an announcement about his capture and arrest as an escaped slave. This was problematic because he swore in vain that he was a freed person. Nevertheless, the paper reported that if his owner would not come to reclaim his property, he will be delt with as the law directs.","If this young mulatto boy was currently or at any point a slave, that means he was the child of a sexual relationship across the color line in which an enslaved mother was the partner of some white male. This is evident because southern state laws established that children of any mixed relationship would follow the status of their mother, regardless of who their father might be, keeping them enslaved on the plantation. Of course, this gave white male slave-owners the opportunity to freely engage in elicit sexual relations with their female slaves without fear of the repercussions of unwanted, illegitimate children as these children would still be classified as their slaves. According to Joshua Rothman, such occurrences fed to the complexities and contradictions of a southern society founded on racial domination-which some sexual relationships could only serve to reinforce-and alternately undermined by interracial sex.","On the other hand, it is possible that this young boy was not a slave nor was enslaved ever in his past. Because of the maternally-inherited status-which meant slaves who had a white father were still born as slaves-on which the southern plantation functioned, some mulattos were free while some, born of enslaved mothers, were still slaves. In other words, an individual's physical appearance essentially gave no indication of being free or enslaved. Therefore, many slave traders kidnapped and sold free blacks who were not slaves at all. Notably during the fall months, when planters had money from the sale of their crops, slave traders in Alabama took such illicit action in order to make their own profit. Within the interstate slave trade, numerous free blacks and mulattos were arrested under the assumption that they were escaped slaves and then allowed to be sold simply because traders could presumably legitimize this through the color of their skin. As John waited in his prison cell in Clarke County, his fate was more than likely to be sold in order for the county to pay for jail fees-an embodiment of unpredictable and often times tragic outcome of sex across the color line."],"display_date":"January 7, 1836","search_date":"1836-01-07","locations":[{"id":77,"lat":31.6619891322,"lng":-87.8428758708,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2341,"title":"Sylvia, the Runaway Slave","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-09-30","end_date":"1836-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1836, Sylvia, about twenty years of age, of common size, very likely and almost black, was sold from her plantation in Conecuh County, Alabama to the plantation of Thomas L.

After several months with no sign of Sylvia, her owner finally decided to make a more public announcement. On September 30 of that same year, the Mobile County Register published a 10 reward pending the return of this runaway slave. Sylvia's rightful owner expected her to return to her former plantation in Conecuh County and whomever she missed there.","Across the South, the domestic slave trade daily uprooted slaves from their homes and dropped them into some foreign land without regard for their personal well-being. Of all the interstate slave sales leading up to the Civil War, twenty-five percent destroyed first marriages and fifty percent destroyed nuclear families. Essentially, slaves were property, and property could be bought and sold at will-whatever was economically profitable.

Therefore, Mr. Stark valued Sylvia as one of the highest commodities in his fortune-one that he could not let run away.","Surely, Sylvia knew that punishment was awaiting her upon her return. In Alabama, most small infractions were handled on the plantations, while more serious crimes were handled within the legal system. Essentially, corporal punishment was a way for white southerners to demonstrate their power and keep the system of slavery functioning to their advantage.

Away at Lagrange College in Franklin County, Alabama, it is possible that William had not seen Mariah in quite some time. Possibly being wrapped up in the spirit of the holiday, William sat down to write Mariah a letter. Already betrothed, William pleasured in the duty of writing this letter to his fiance, stating that words could not do justice to the love and affection he felt for her. Their absence from one another, to William, was both painful and pleasant as he knew that Mariah felt the same for him. He concluded the letter with hope that they would soon be reunited, gushing that it is truly flattering to my vanity that one so esteemed could love him so dearly.","This letter brings out the essence of true love in the marriages of southern spouses. For centuries, marriages had been about filial alliances and personal financial gain.

True love is evident as William poetically pours out admiration and desire for Mariah, both of whom have exchanged pledges of eternal love for one another.","Nevertheless, courtship between William and Mariah was still as structured and traditional as it had ever been. Eligible bachelors would have to prove to the bride's family that they were economically stable enough to be considered a suitable husband. Furthermore, even though William's letter dripped with affections, it was not in any manner physical or sexual. Unmarried couples could never proceed with any vaguely physical contact or sexual behavior. Lewd behavior could even foster criminal charges.","Even though William and Mariah were in love, they still would have to foster a functional marriage.

Horace Maynard, the Chairman of the Sub-Ku Klux Committee of Florida, faced a difficult predicament in late November of 1871.  The members of the Young Men's Democratic Club of Leon County, Florida, were in extreme state of alarm and this was brought to the committee chairman's attention.  They were worried about the recent outing of the Ku Klux division of their political club before the Committee-they were afraid of the consequences of their exposure.  Many members of the Democratic organization were planning to flee to Texas, fearing that the same fate might be in store for them that their South Carolina sympathizers experienced.  Republicans in Leon County were also concerned, since people blamed them for exposing the Ku Klux men's secret to the Committee.  The Chairman considered his responsibility to protect the Republicans of Leon County from Ku Klux persecution and likely put a plan for their safety underway.","       The Ku Klux Klan originally started in Tennessee, but infiltrated into bordering regions of Alabama in 1867 or so.  From there it quickly expanded into the state, forming dens that covered the entire former Confederacy by the end of 1868.  Members of the Klan came from all different economic and social levels, but they were united in that the vast majority of them were young men and almost all of them were in some way affiliated with the Democratic Party.  The Klan tended to thrive especially well in rural areas of the South, like Leon County in Florida.  Therefore, it is not surprising that Klan affiliations were found within the Young Men's Democratic Club of this county-the members were perfect candidates for Ku Klux recruitment.  ","      It is also predictable that the Klansmen were turned in by Republicans, who tended to be more in support of African American rights and less active on their inner racist beliefs than the Democrats.  The idea of running away to Texas to escape punishment was a common idea for those who needed to hide in the late nineteenth century, as well.  Texas was a brand new state and, because it was so rural, it provided a great hiding ground for criminals and refugees.  The Klansmen of the Democratic Party in Leon County most likely did run away to Texas for a while to escape the consequences of the revelation of their KKK affiliations.  Their experience shows that Klan membership was a common political faction within many sections of the Democratic Party and reveals the reaction to KKK involvement in post-bellum society."],"display_date":"November 24, 1871 - November 30, 1871","search_date":"1871-11-27","locations":[{"id":1397,"lat":30.4585161351,"lng":-84.2751559802,"zoom":9,"place":"LEON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2372,"title":"Land Allegation Dispute in Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-12-27","end_date":"1885-12-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Alabama's Attorney General, while celebrating the Christmas season in his Gulf Coast home, received notice that he would need to institute a test suit as soon as possible in order to determine the title of government grated lands. In 1885, both timber businessmen and railroad executives repetitively brought cases to the Secretary of the Interior concerning the cutting of timber in certain areas of Alabama. These lands, amounting to some 200,000 acres of fertile soil and dense forests, were granted to the state in order to aid the construction of the Mobile and Girard Railroad in 1856. The Alabamians that wanted to cut timber on the lands claimed that the railroad had no valid title to the area because Mobile and Girard failed to abide by the terms upon which the land was given to them. The Secretary requested that the Attorney General get right to work because the conflict between these two interest groups had been steadily growing, and the state government needed to make a finite decision concerning the issue so as to pacify the competitors for the land usage.","A case of a land controversy such as this would have been common in the late nineteenth century as railroads were becoming an increasingly important means of transportation and focus of development. In 1881, Alabama formed a railroad commission to deal with issues such as land allotment for the building of railroads. The commission helped to organize and solve many problems with the railroads development, but they also created problems with citizens, such as the conflict with the timber producers.<em>The Mobile Register </em>frequently featured articles and commentaries against the commission, saying that from everywhere arose the cry of an oppressed people against the arbitrary rule of the great railroad corporations. Therefore, like the timber producers in 1885, many citizens of the Gulf Coast area felt that the railroad companies had unfair privileges and took advantage of the state, and frequently opposed the development of more railroad funding and support in local and state government.

After numerous invitations from an old Annapolis, acquaintance, Thomas Randal, the wheelwright and millwright from Maryland made the trip south to assess Jefferson, Leon, and Gadsden counties for himself. Wiggins needed a boat, a train, and a horse carriage to complete the 900 mile journey from Annapolis to Belmont, Randall's plantation just south of Monticello Village. To the skilled machinist, except for want of religious society, Florida seemed quite an agreeable place, both in climate and economic opportunity. Though Wiggins had just completed a long voyage he did not have time to rest. Randal, his host, immediately put him to work constructing a screw press. Wiggins had been at work the whole week trying to complete the project. Timber had to be heved for the frame of the press, and many people were needed put the press in its final place. Though he was satisfied with his work, Wiggins did admit the press worked rather slowly. The end price had been 100 dollars. After little more than two weeks in the territory, Wiggins recognized the abundance of money making opportunities. Wiggins, acting in a mindset that would later take him to California in search of gold, made notes in his journal about the potential profitability of plying his trade in the Florida Territory. He remarked at how few mechanics there were in North Western Florida. Those he saw most were inclined to disapation and idleness. Doing some rough calculations, Wiggins figured that an industrious man would make about 10 dollars per day at such work. Having considered the profitability, Wiggins planned to put up a press of his own design and making, which he vowed would work much better then those now used. After reviewing the undertaking as a whole, Wiggins made a projection about his future. Given he stayed well, Wiggins calculated making a fortune in a little time. ","Wiggin's mindset and motivation was similar to many of the frontiersmen who immigrated to Florida and other newly opened areas of land across the south. The abundance of cheap land and high price of cotton brought risk-takers south from all parts of the country, including the North. However, as Wiggins's account highlights, once these initial plantation owners arrived, a huge demand developed for specialized tradesmen. Wiggins, like many, saw his path to a more comfortable future by gaining a piece of this wealth. It is too easy to conclude that all the eventually successful men in antebellum Florida came from wealthy, educated, aristocratic families in the upper and eastern portions of the South. On the contrary, many of larger land and slave owners shared little more then ownership status of those two commodities with the aristocracy of the Upper South. Many frontiersmen had failed at other ventures or were men of modest means. The frontier offered an opportunity for industrious and able men to rise rapidly in the economic spectrum. This was the first and most important step on the way to political and social status among their peers. However, it would be the children of these successful frontiersmen who would enjoy a more privileged lifestyle."],"display_date":"November 5, 1838","search_date":"1838-11-05","locations":[{"id":1380,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"JEFFERSON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2383,"title":"Train Crash in Clarksville, Tennessee","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-08-14","end_date":"1869-08-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Eight miles outside of Clarksville Tennessee, a train shattered into splinters. The railroad bridge the train intended to pass over collapsed and the train plummeted thirty feet below into Rudd's creek. The impact was so severe that it killed four people and wounded forty to fifty people. The locomotive, caboose, express and baggage car, two passenger coaches, and one sleeping-car all burned down and creating 300,000 worth of damage. "," By the time of the train crash in1869, Tennessee railroads were dangerous because they were poorly kept. Historian Robert Corlew noted approximately 1,200 miles of railroads were built in Tennessee during the decade of the 1850s. They of course offered great potential for improvement and expansion of the state's economy when the Civil War came. The state of Tennessee invested a significant amount to build railroads all over Tennessee throughout the eighteenth century. Yet the damage from the Civil War was so detrimental to the railroad companies that after 1865 many of them could not continue construction. The state-aid system of Tennessee went into a debt of forty-three million dollars, much of which was attributed to their investments in railroads. "," Private railroad companies tried to pick up where state-aid funded companies left off. Their main focus was to connect the old railroad parts built before the war and form greater networks. Edward Ayers in remarks Throughout the 1870s and early 1880's Southern Railroad companies experimented with ways to accommodate themselves to the different widths of track between North and South Thus, the old and new railroad tracks built by various companies varied in size durability and reliability."," With such a high priority on connecting networks and small allotment of funding, companies sometimes overlooked the upkeep of the railroads. Even with the economy still in debt from railroad spending, Tennesseans still relied on the system. Consumers frequently used it overlooking the risks. Railroad companies prioritized the rapid networking of interstate transportation over safety. Few wanted to expend the time or money to inspect the durability of the tracks built before the war by other companies; all they wanted to do was connect them and get them up and running. "," Once they accomplished this, the railroads were very popular, despite the dangers. Southerners depended highly on railroads throughout the South for trade, commerce and rapid transportation. Private companies struggled to improve the economy building a network of train tracks as fast as they could. They filled the gaps between old tracks, but lacked in their focus on keeping the old tracks secure. Nobody checked the status of the bridge outside Clarksville before passing 300,000 dollars worth of goods over it.

The newspaper's editor wrote that Strobach, an Austrian who had been appointed to oversee the Federal patronage of Alabama, should not be trusted to this office. The newspaper claimed that he came to the United States originally as hostler to Prince Salm-Salm. The writer adds, most likely as a suggestion to the President, that if the position is still available, Strobach ought to be blacking Arthur's boots, instead of naming men for Federal offices. Clearly Mobile citizens were not only uncomfortable with Strobach's appointed position, but they were angry and verbally hostile as well.","Mobile residents were not pleased with a foreign immigrant working in a government office that wielded power over their city. The prejudice against immigrants expressed in the local newspaper was not unusual in this time, nor has it been in any time in American history. In historical studies of American reactions towards foreign immigrants, sociologists have found that in the past there have been four primary stages of treatment towards the new Americans. First, people were curious about the new and different immigrants; next, they extended to them an economic welcome; the third stage was characterized by industrial and social antagonism; fourth, the Americans sought to harm the immigrants via legislation; in the fifth stage Americans displayed fair-play tendencies; finally, quiescence was achieved.","The influx of European immigrants in the nineteenth century undoubtedly triggered the onset of new forms of racism and cultural elitism, as evidenced by the Alabamians' attitudes towards the foreign official. Residents of the Gulf Coast would only have interacted with immigrants on an economic level, and therefore they were uncomfortable with Strobach's position of authority. Surprisingly, 18.7 percent of the mining work force in Alabama consisted of European immigrants. The Republicans of the state saw political advantages in importing laborers, whereas the Democrats wanted less dependence on black workers-thusly, immigration of Europeans was encouraged. However, the traditionally white-black dynamic in Alabama was not easily compatible with immigration influxes, resulting in racial and cultural stereotyping and discomfort. The Gulf Coast residents seemed to think that Strobach's European culture made him unfit for government duties, and they assumed his kind would be better suited for working low-pay jobs, like shoe-shining. Though seemingly cruel, the Mobile Register writers were simply displaying the discomfort that would have existed among a people who had only know immigrants in the capacity of mine and factory working. This stage of industrial and social antagonism is a natural phase of reaction to immigration, and the antagonism was most likely heightened by the South's already difficult race relation issues."],"display_date":"November 12, 1881","search_date":"1881-11-12","locations":[{"id":287,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2388,"title":"Diversity in the Houston Saturday Evening Market\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As the sun lay low in the evening sky, the Saturday market in Houston sprang to life with a diverse and vivid collection of venders and products. Lee Hardy described how the area was full of venders alone representing every nationality, Americans being far in the minority. Open from 5 PM to 10 PM in the summer, here German traders, who had often traveled more than twenty miles to be present, set up stands with their fresh produce. A negro market gardener offered turkeys, some ready to cook and others still alive. Hardy walked by a Chinese peddler, who displayed his hand-made creations including fans, teapots and brushes in front of him, while German and Irish women patrolled the rows of vegetable stands. Though the meat market was largely dominated by German butchers, along with a few French and Americans, Italian vendors were also present selling wild game such as squirrels, partridges and prairie-chickens. Black, white, brown, and yellow-- negroes, Americans, Mongolians, Irish, Dutch, French, Germans, Italians, and Spanish-- they are all there, laughing, talking, quarrelling, gesticulating, bargaining, gossiping, staring, keeping appointments and making new ones, being proper or improper, polite or rude, as the case may be, Hardy noted.","In the years leading up to and following the Civil War, Houston, like many cities throughout the South and the nation, experienced a large influx of immigrants. As a consequence, it acquired an increasingly diverse population. Individuals came from all over Europe due to various push and pull factors, including the search for land, freedom and the promise of a better life. Texas saw its population grow 173 percent between the years of 1870 and 1890; this was largely due to a migration of fellow southerners searching for relief from the ruin of other southern states coupled with German immigrants arriving in large numbers. As word spread in Europe of the promising land of the West, Germans quickly became one of the largest ethnic groups in Texas; some estimate that during the 1800s, the populations of Galveston and San Antonio were anywhere from one-third to one-half German.","Cities, especially those in the North, were receiving the bulk of immigrants in the 1890s and early 1900s; however, the crowded conditions, competitive job markets, and even government plans were often incentives for people to move out into more rural areas. Texas saw its population of German and Russian Jewish residents escalate greatly in the early 1900s due to the Galveston Immigration Plan. This program aimed to relieve the crowded conditions in the Jewish ghettos in cities by sending newly-arrived immigrants to be resettled in rural western areas and other interior states. In addition to Europeans, a new wave of Chinese immigrants came to the United States and the West in particular during this time period to work on railroad construction projects.","Post-war southern cities also saw a flood of newly-freed black citizens coming in off of the plantations in neighboring counties. While this caused the actual numbers of black residents to increase in many cities, Texas saw the amount of black residents as a proportion of its population actually decrease as they could not keep up with the rapid influx of white immigrants. Yet, despite the implementation of segregation laws and various forms of discrimination and racism, cities continued to see an increase in their black populations; harsh climate conditions and economic instability seen in the agricultural realm at the end of the 1800s drove people into the cities to find work and augmented the population swell, especially when work became available in the railroad and lumber industries. Despite its reputation as being a lily-white South, the region was actually the site of much diversity and many members of the various groups coexisted in a peaceful, mutually beneficial manner."],"display_date":1890,"search_date":"1890-07-02","locations":[{"id":12839,"lat":29.6873298033,"lng":-94.957827752,"zoom":9,"place":"HARRIS, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2389,"title":"A Woman&#39;s Valiance on the Battlefield\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-05-02","end_date":"1863-05-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Mrs. Holstead became a widow when her husband died in the Civil War.

She left her two daughters at home in Knoxville, Illinois, and for over a year helped the wounded at war directly on the battlefield. "," Mrs. Holstead tended to Union soldiers in hospitals and tented fields. During an evacuation provoked by the confederates in Corinth, Mississippi, she paused during all the chaos to stop and care for the wounded during the battle.

Trail roads were rough, there were high rivers to cross, diseases to contend with, and of course the possibility of meeting up with Indians. Mary Maverick was making such a journey in the summer of 1837. She was traveling by wagon train from her home in Alabama to the new land of Texas. One day when her party was moving camp, 17 Tonkawa warriors surprised them. Still in war paint, the Indians greeted Maverick's party brandishing several pieces of human flesh. Maverick remembered the Indians coming up to her carriage and asking to see her baby. She denied the request and made sure to show the warriors her pistol and bowie knife. Maverick expressed annoyance when the 17 decided to ride along with the train instead of leave. The 17 Tonkawas did eventually quit the party much to the relief of Maverick. She was certain that had they gotten a hold of her baby, they would have eaten it. ","Meeting Indians was a regular occurrence as whites encroached more and more on tribal lands. The fear and aggravation Maverick experienced was common among settlers who encountered Indians. Maverick's fear that the Tonkawas might eat her baby was not completely unfounded. Tonkawa warriors did have a reputation for cannibalism. Accounts described warriors cutting off the hands and feet of their victims and then eating them. This, along with other obvious cultural differences and bad blood, made the two groups wary of each other. ","From the earliest days of Texas Stephen F. Austin anticipated conflict with Indians in the new settlements. In his first presidency (1836-1838), Sam Houston passed laws providing for frontier defense against both Mexicans and Indians. Houston wanted both protections for his people and to stay on friendly terms with Indian allies. There were, however, problems with the Indian land claims; the Texas government refused to recognize their legitimacy. When Mirabeau B. Lamar became the second president of the Republic of Texas in 1838, Indian tribes found him to be no friend of theirs. Lamar called for, an exterminating war on [Texas Indian] warriors; which will admit no compromise and have no termination except in their total extinction or total expulsion. Lamar wanted the Indians gone because he saw them as dangerous people and competitors for prime real estate. Lamar's attitudes mirrored those of the Texas people. Maverick was afraid of what the Tonkawas might do to her party and just wanted them to go away so that they could camp in peace.

Here he saw a settler arriving in Texas with a group of slaves. The large band of black enslaved men and women moved about without cares; they laughed and joke as they ate their biscuits. A man only identified as the entertainer of the group created comic relief when he whipped a donkey who in turn kicked the hind quarters of a very fat man. The slaves laughed uncontrollably, spewing out pieces of biscuit and some nearly choking because they were laughing so hard. ","As the train left the wharf, Sheridan could not help but pity the jovial slaves who were ignorant of what lay ahead of them. Go your ways, he wrote, go your ways my happy thoughtless party - happy because thoughtless, the time may not be far distant... when your quips & cranks will be turned into tears, wails & groans. Sheridan predicted the break up of the happy group as members would be sold as property to repay debts and satisfy the needs of their master.","Texas's close proximity to Louisiana and the New Orleans slave market, the largest in the country, made Sheridan's predictions viable. Walter Johnson poignantly describes the slave trade as, the story of separated lovers and broken families, of widows, widowers, and orphans left in the wake of the trade, only, perhaps, to be sold themselves at a later date. The interstate slave trade separated families and friends all the time; there was no reason to think it would be different for this group of slaves. Being sold to other slave owners was a fact of life for slaves, and Sheridan believed the thought of this should have sobered up the band of slaves and made them more serious and reserved. ","Like many other white people of this time, Sheridan depicted the band of slaves with condescension. There were conventional topics that white writers focused on when describing slaves: 'the skin, the odor, the dialect, the shuffle,' and even the endearing 'imbecile good nature.' Sheridan primarily focused on the nature of the black slaves; they were funny, loud, and grotesque. Sheridan could not look past these things and see the vibrant African American culture as a way for slaves to deal with their enslavement. Sheridan's entry shows that he had a good knowledge of the slave trade an the hardships slaves face, but that he was ignorant of black culture and how it related to their condition as slaves.

Rampant disease intensified the difficulty of the escape. Harris's sister fell ill and died after the trip across the river. Her family buried her in Liberty, one of the cities through which they passed. Texans continued to move northward until they heard news of the Texas victory at San Jacinto. ","This flight of the Texans from their homes became known as the Runaway Scrape. Texas had involved herself in a war with Mexico, its goal being an independent Texas. Trouble had been brewing between the Mexicans and Anglo-Americans for some time. Cultural differences played a part, as did the emancipation of slaves in Mexico in 1829, and a law of 1830 which stopped colonization of Texas, and provided for the collecting of custom duties and garrisoning of troops in Texas. Once involved in the conflict, Texas found herself up against Santa Anna's powerful army and not faring well. After the fall of the Alamo, Houston feared the worst for Texans and wanted them out of the way of the Mexican army. ","The Runaway Scrape was complete bedlam as a mass of Texas families packed up what they could and took off in their wagons. Many men were gone fighting, and so the women had to do the best that they could on their own. The conditions were poor as people were confined to the close quarters of their wagons. Highly contagious diseases like measles and whooping cough afflicted many of the refugees, and families were forced to bury dead members en route then continue on their way. The Runaway Scrape was fraught with fear and danger and became a defining event in the history of Texas. Harris's tale shows the harsh conditions of the frontier and the determination of Texans not to let Mexico utterly destroy them.

In the winter of 1879 Eleanor decided to visit her mother and family in Baltimore, Maryland for Christmas. She took with her, her daughter and Margaret Blake. Blake quickly caught a cold that grew into erysipelas. Mrs. McC. left her with her family in Baltimore expecting her to return to Chicago when she was well; however, the sickness grew worse and they sent her to the Baltimore Infirmary.

B. families existed during the period after Reconstruction when African Americans were exposed to greater freedom from the days of enslavement but also new forms of repression. As Edward Ayers describes, segregation existed but was not completely nor universally defined. There was heavy racism and separatism, but also advancements in the black community. Race relations were complex and varied; friendships and positive relations could exist while being entwined in race traditions. This environment allowed for a variety of race relations to exist, including ones like that of Margaret Blake and her employers. ","Just how positive or negative Margaret Blake's relationship was with her employers is unclear. She spent years with them, becoming a constant in their lives. While Mrs. Walter B.

His proposition required the formation of a joint stock company in which the State and private stockholders would split the 2 or 2.5 million price tag.  In the Governor's estimations, 500,000 North Carolinians would benefit from the railroad extension.  He predict advantages not only for those living within 50 miles of the line, but also for residents in seven counties beyond the Blue Ridge mountains, who could save three days of travel in reaching the State Capital at Raleigh.  ","    His plan required that both the state and private individuals commit between 1 and 1.25 million in equal increments.  The state, he argued, could afford this cost by transferring its deteriorating Raleigh-Gaston Railroad, valued at 500,000 to a new North Carolina Railroad Company.  The State's remaining balance would be paid from the issuance of 30-year State bonds paying six percent per annum.  The state would present its first 500,000 of assets, he argued, only after individuals had first purchased the same amount.

Graham, the third of four consecutive Whig North Carolina Governors, was continuing an era of progress with internal improvements that sought to solve the State's dire need for improved transportation.  Even among Southern states, where transportation greatly limited most states' economic horizons as compared to Northern states, North Carolina was considered backward.  Stephen Goldfarb explains the tardiness of Southern industrialization as a consequence of poor transportation to coastal ports.  Distances of one to two hundred miles between the fall lines of rivers and their coastal outlets, a feature of the North Carolina Piedmont, required the advent of railroads. The State's earlier attempts to organize a productive rail line between Wilmington and Raleigh remained a money-losing venture for the State.

He began the 26 mile journey from Gaston to Fayetteville on foot and let the coach catch up with him along the way.  By one o'clock, though he had covered almost ten miles, he doubted he had passed even half a dozen farms.  Olmsted took lunch at the Banks' plantation where fresh horses for the stagecoach grazed in the field.  To Olmsted's dismay, the fresh horses could do but little more than stand up.  At last the stagecoach arrived but its ineloquent driver could only mutter distressed comments about the horses: There ain't a man in North Car'lina could drive them horses up the hills without a whip. With the help of several black men, the driver at last thrashed and verbally harassed the ostensibly-fresh horses into action.  Three miles later, using real, outright, old-fashioned, uncompromising English oaths, as loud as he could yell, the driver again resorted to violence as onlooking passengers idled.  This time he used a rail.  Exasperated by the wait, some of the weary passengers offered assistance. Olmsted resorted again to his own legs and by eight p.m. arrived at Mrs. Barclay's inn where his fellow passengers did not arrive until three a.m.","In this vignette from North Carolina and in many other instances throughout the South, Olmsted journeyed down isolated, poorly-maintained roads, detailing the poor condition of transportation.  The roads he traveled often comprised little more than deforested trails.  At points, he traveled for several days and never saw two dwellings of mankind within sight of each other. Several plantation patriarchates were miles apart. He recorded his many experiences and minute-by-minute conversations in over seven-hundred pages, which he gave to the New York Daily Times.  That Northern editors considered Olmsted's observations exotic enough to be published attests to a communication gap between the North and South.","Olmsted's accounts of Southern transportation deficiencies support Stephen Goldfarb's analysis of geographical isolation as a limiting factor to Southern industrialization.  He endured the same arduous traveling conditions as Piedmont farmers who sought distant markets for their produce.  Writing for a Northern audience, at points Olmsted takes pleasure in contrasting the efficient transportation networks of the North with the ridiculous networks he encounters in the South.  He was also struck by the low density of homesteads; Edward Ayers explores a similar phenomenon of slave-holding counties in comparisons between Virginia and Pennsylvania during the Civil War.

They applauded the satiric criticism as the severest and most truthful against Stowe and her British supporters. The poem was written as if by a British aristocrat who both commends Britain for banishing slavery and yet also foppishly implicated British class differences as equally, if not more, merciless than American slavery.  <em>British</em> peasants, it reads, are not our slaves, and 'tis tickingly pleasant, / To think they have <em>free</em>dom - to die in a ditch The eight stanzas levelled many shocking attacks against British institutions.  For example, the article implied that Britons permitted their women to work in coal shafts on hands and knees without clothes.  One line, which would have particularly resonated in 1853 read, Though Irishmen rot in the fever and famine, / Which we have created- we speak it with pride- / <em>That, if you will calmly and fairly examine</em>, / You'll find they were perfectly free- when they died","    Stowe's novel introduced further turmoil to a tumultuous era of United States History, during which embittered pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions bemoaned the Compromise of 1850.  Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrants, fleeing the distresses of famine and poverty in Ireland inflated America with visible proof of English oppression.  The North Carolinian editors' concise but harsh attack against Stowe, similar in logic to James Henry Hammond's 1858 Mudsill Theory speech, argues that slavery eliminates the need for downtrodden white peasants in societies.  ","In the larger context of understanding how white Southerners justified slavery, this article exemplifies one method of neutralizing Stowe's potent attacks against slavery.  The <em>Register</em>'s editors attempted to devalue <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> by showing that other civilized nations were themselves reliant upon impoverished labor.  By this logic, Stowe's supporters abroad had no right to comment upon American institutions.  Wendy Hamand writes of a similarly anti-British response to incidents such as the Stafford House Address, a document from British ladies requesting an end to slavery.  Mrs. John Tyler from Virginia responded that the Duchess of Sutherland should tend to her own dependents and leave American ladies to attend to theirs.  Clearly, the tendency to reject Stowe rather than re-evaluate slavery prevailed among pro-slavery factions."],"display_date":"June 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-06-18","locations":[{"id":9843,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2433,"title":"First North Carolina State Fair\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-10-18","end_date":"1853-10-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Visitors filled every hotel and boarding house in Raleigh. Replete with music fanfares, banners, and daily crowds of over 4,000 people, North Carolina inaugurated its first-ever State Fair in Raleigh on Tuesday, October 18, 1853. Local newspapers hailed the watershed event as a triumph. For North Carolinians, it was as much a matter of state pride as agricultural interest. For years neighboring states had ridiculed North Carolina for its undeveloped agricultural infrastructure. Farmers, merchants, mechanics, entrepreneurs, artists and assorted people converged on the state capital to display and observe livestock, minerals, improved agricultural implements, carriages, and many other exhibitions of North Carolina enterprise. Auctions were held for livestock and implements. The <em>Raleigh Register</em> stated that it had never gloried more in the fact that we were a citizen of North Carolina, than when, on the opening of this Fair, we beheld the evidences of a greatness, prosperity, and progress... North Carolinians congratulated themselves not only with pride in their state's current achievements, but also with the anticipation of progress into a more enlightened future."," The Honorable A.W. Venable imbued the event with its sense of occasion in a well-received address to a large crowd. He began by placing arduous agricultural efforts in the context of Adam's fall from innocence in the Book of Genesis. He further connected farming to a daily awareness of an overruling Providence on whom farmers relied for their produce to grow. The core of the speech addressed the phenomenon of soil depletion and poor land management. In harsh terms, he challenged North Carolinian farmers to take responsibility for replenishing farmland and investing in the quality of their soil. Venable spoke of a growing change in this respect that would move farmers away from unsustainable practices which left base deserts of farms. The process of clearing, exhausting, and abandoning land was denounced. In another challenge to farmers, Venable requested their support for cheap methods of interstate transport that would allow better utilization of North Carolina's resources. "," North Carolina had been pejoratively called the Ireland of America in the earlier nineteenth century as a result of its agricultural under-development. Lacking many basic internal improvements like canals and good roads, farmers devoted considerable portions of their income to merely freighting their produce to markets. People along the coast received goods from Maryland by water less expensively than from the interior of their own state. Furthermore, the soil of the Old South had been depleted by monoculture nutrient-intensive cash crops with little replenishing fertilizer. Avery Craven deems the efforts of Venable's contemporaries as unsuccessful in the long-run. Despite Venable's exhortations, the optimal balance between immediate agricultural profits and soil conservation seems never to have been struck. While North Carolina's first State Fair offered an encouraging sense of economic development, it may not have been as effective in revolutionizing entrenched practices."],"display_date":"October 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-10-18","locations":[{"id":9843,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2456,"title":"THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS: Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad Foreclosure\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-09-30","end_date":"1876-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In antebellum America, railroads were the fastest and most popular means of transportation either of goods or passengers. Railroads remained important for supplying goods to others for economic profit. However, poor track conditions often made for delayed trips and spoiled products. Train delays plagued the Alabama and Chattanooga Railroad. The A&C tracks were in horrible condition following the Civil War and in need of funding for improvements.","In conjunction with the endorsement law, the Alabama legislature found the necessary funds to reequip the railroad, restoring it to working order. However, what the state supplied was not nearly enough. Trustees and bondholders in the business incurred significant debt to be paid off over time to the state government of Alabama. Those related to the A&C began searching for land to acquire in hopes of eventually expanding the entire railroad system. Friends of the railroad system ironically enough were those who had a substantial strong hold on state politics in Alabama. Internal corruption commenced when these friends did political favors for the railroad. Fraudulent funding and land purchases orchestrated by insiders, trustees and bondholders were made by the thousands. With every false purchase came a false promise that led to deepening the debt of the railroad. The total debt, bonded and floating, amounted to nearly 11 million dollars. ","Unable to deal with the mounting debt, trustees called a meeting to discuss the future of the Alabama and Chattanooga railroad. Visibly shaken and incredibly nervous, the trustees conducted the meeting. Unbeknownst to them, this meeting would be their last. The content of the meeting foreshadowed the company's subsequent foreclosure a year later. Demands for payments on improvements and to employs could not be met. After intense deliberation, the trustees were forced to succumb to the U.S Circuit Court of appeals order and foreclose on their endeavor in order reimburse the federal government. The courts confirmed the sale of A&C citing its untimely liquidation and limited protection of property. ","Important in this foreclosure was the fact that the federal government intervened in a state project. The limits of state and federal involvements were not clearly defined. The A&C railroad foreclosure initiated conversations about the greater role of the federal government in private endeavors that affected the public. Reconstruction was an effort to solidify the nation while acknowledging the identity of the South. At the time, southern politics supported a lack of federal involvement in local and state affairs. The railroad foreclosure was just one example of the federal government's continued and unwanted involvement in southern states and local politics.

After docking, Cullmann found his way to Cincinnati, Ohio where we managed to reconnect with friends from the old country. Realizing his dream, a colony for immigrants specifically from his country, Cullmann ventured south in early 1871 in search of land and resources. ","Cullmann came to rest in Florence, Alabama where his efforts were assisted by Governor Robert M. Patton. Patton provided Cullmann with men and horses enough to explore the northern areas of Alabama. After a significant search, Cullmann found land, but lacked the money to acquire it. Cullmann mustered the courage to call on a railroad official for the outstanding funds. The official's aid enabled Cullmann to acquire several hundred thousand acres of land on which he would establish his colony. ","Cullmann's land extended from Decatur to Montgomery, 15 miles on each side of the railroad. In the days that followed, Cullmann scoured the property, documenting and observing the terrain in preparation for the arrival of immigrants. Despite advertising efforts in both Europe and America, people were slow to reply to Cullmann's colony. But on January 5, 1873, Cullman managed to interest 15 Cincinnati families to colonize in the South. In the months that followed, families filtered into what now stands as Cullman City in Cullman County, Alabama. Steady growth and immigration cause Cullman City to thrive on its diverse population. The city had physicians, ministers, and numerous persons of other trades. The city eventually elected its own officials and acknowledged itself as a reason for Alabama's growth. The addition of a hospital, public works, roadways and improvements on existing railroads increased the appeal of Cullman City, making it a popular destination for both immigrants and non-immigrants alike. Cities began to spring up on the outskirts of Cullman City, expanding its boarders.","The establishment of Cullman City was met with resistance. Cullmann's project was opposed by Alabama legislators and citizens alike who were uncertain as to the benefits of opening their southern, secluded state to immigrants. The price of the land he obtained for the venture was also in question. Skeptics wondered if Cullmann had acted legally when acquiring the land, but supporters of the effort appreciated Cullmann for his attempts to better northern Alabama. ","Cullman City provided a tangible example of entrepreneurship coupled with immigration. Nationally, the 1870s welcomed thousands of immigrants to the United States, but few ventured toward the South, preferring to settle in northern, more urban areas.

Dr. Edson believed X-rays would accomplish the same for an atrophied optic nerve. Before the treatment, Martin could only discern the difference between night and day. By the end of the week, Martin could distinguish 'a sort of green', and Dr. Edson felt confident in his procedure."," There does not seem to be a follow up article to this one, so it is hard to know whether this treatment actually cured Martin or if the green he saw was simply a side effect from the X-rays penetrating his eyes. The article made no mention of the patient or doctor showing concern about the treatment, nor did it explain any safety measures Dr. Edson took. Augusta County's weekly, the <em>Staunton Spectator and Vindicator</em>, did not have much to report other than the above about an event as important as a blind person's increase in sight. Maybe the paper was reserving the celebration for more proof. "," The nineteenth century held the revolution of modern medicine in America and the world, according to Todd Timmons and W. F. Bynum. Discoveries occurred in germ theory, the importance of inoculation, and use of anesthesia for surgery. The founding of medical schools and the first health advisory board occurred. Most importantly for John Martin, Wilhelm Rontgen discovered x-rays in November 1895, only about a year before Dr. Edson used them to cure blindness. X-rays became widely popular very quickly for burning moles, treating acne and lupus vulgaris, and carcinomas in various organs. Extended exposure to x-rays left the skin browned and sometimes burned, only nurturing the developing idea that brown skin is healthier than white. Bynum does not cite the use of x-rays for eye problems, but Dr. Edson recognized the potential for x-rays for other health issues. Staunton was a small city with only 7,289 inhabitants in 1900, but within one of the most populous counties in Virginia. In 1886, one newspaper even ran an article boasting of the city's attributes: electricity, lights, telephones, music band, and opera house. Now, the city could boast that they had a doctor current to the science of the world because of their connections to other cities and states from the railroad that ran through it and telegraphs.

One letter, written by An Eastern Virginian to <em>The Lynchburg Virginian</em> in 1854, stressed the vital need to fix the railways running between Norfolk and the Valley of Ohio. Though transporting goods to the Valley of Ohio was possible, the route was extremely difficult due to the railway's lack of gauge uniformity. Norfolk's neglect to correct this problem greatly diminished its export potential. The current railway route was divided into five separate sections that totaled 520 miles. Very inefficient when hauling large loads, the divided railway needed to be unified. An Eastern Virginian was convinced that the commercial prosperity of the entire state hinged on this railroad. Since Virginia was experiencing an economic slump, the state's revival rested on the shoulders of the Norfolk line. Due to the Norfolk railways' present state, Baltimore and the North were shipping all of the goods to the West. An Eastern Virginian found this despicable and intolerable. If gauge uniformity were achieved, economic prosperity could be shifted back to Norfolk and Virginia. The Eastern Virginian even set out future plans to connect Norfolk's rail system to St. Louis, Louisville, and Memphis. Furthermore, the Eastern Virginian even discussed the advantages of the railway as a great military road, as it would create a direct route through the heart of the Union to the West."," The improvement of Norfolk's and Virginia's rail systems was a necessity to help boost the lagging economy. Inferior to other Northern and Western railway systems, the Norfolk line and many other Southern railways were unable to transport goods at a profitable level. The problem stemmed from the economic depressions that hit the nation. The depression of 1839 and the crop shortages of 1846, 1847, 1850, and 1851 greatly affected the South's agricultural output. Since the Southern economy depended on agricultural sales, the shortages hit the South much harder than the industrially dependent North. During these hard times, as the other railways grew and improved, Southern railways remained stagnant. Another problem that slowed Southern railway development was a lack of engineers. Engineers were scarce during wartime, as the Union shipped them to aid in the Mexican-American War. By the time they were released, the South was still in economic depression, and was unable to find the capital for railways. Meanwhile, the North and West had high-capital projects waiting to be constructed, and thus hired the engineers. When the South came out of its depression, it was essentially a decade behind the North technologically. This further hurt the railways' development, as Southerners often built their railroads with glaring technical flaws (such as Norfolk's gauge problem). The need to improve Southern railways was a significant task during the mid-nineteenth century.

On January 2, 1849, the newspaper of Suffolk, Virginia, <em>The Suffolk Intelligencer</em>, printed an article entitled The Great Question. This article examined this turmoil, and pleaded the Union to mend its internal strife. The author explained that Northern fanatics in Congress were imposing abolition notions on the nation, efforts that threatened to bring the nation to the verge of disunion. Two new propositions were being discussed in Washington. The first was a proposal to abolish slavery in the nation's capital, and the second was a motion to bar slavery in California and New Mexico. The article contended that these two proposals had created a kindred feeling among all Southerners, regardless of their political orientation. The Northerners' proposals questioned the equality of a Southern man's property rights; it was hypocritical to allow a man from Ohio to move to Virginia with all his possessions, but to forbid a Virginian from bringing his property (slaves) into Ohio. The author attributed the source of these problems to the recent land acquisitions in the west, most notably the annexations of California, Texas, and New Mexico. The Great Question continued to examine this dilemma by describing the political stances of the Whig and Democratic parties. Though it was too late to quarrel over what has been done, the article claimed that the Whig party initially opposed the acquisition, and that the Democratic party supported the expansion. Therefore, the Intelligencer attributed the current turmoil to the Democrats. The article ends with a glimmer of hope, as the author believed that the councils of Congress would succeed, and reunite the North and South once again.","The article clearly summarizes the nation's state during the time of expansionism, and exposes the beginnings of clear sectional division. Though the nation had yet to split politically, the significance of these proposals would soon divide the Whigs and Democrats, creating sectional rifts that would weaken each party. The article describes proposals that would eventually help form the Compromise of 1850, a plan that would leave both Northerners and Southerners angry and unsettled. This turmoil would continue to heighten tensions between the regions. On a regional scope, the article's description of a newfound Southern unity is extremely important, as Southerners began to unite and to view the North as a common enemy. The mention of equal rights highlights one of the main issues bothering the Southerners, as many were angered that the Northerner's proposals threatened to take away their property. The seeds of disunion were beginning to sprout during this time period, and the nation was slowly moving towards bloody conflict."],"display_date":"January 2, 1849 - December 31, 1855","search_date":"1852-07-02","locations":[{"id":14073,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2486,"title":"The Exodus from Suffolk\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-02","end_date":"1855-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Throughout the mid-nineteenth century, adventurers seeking gold and quick riches hurried to the West as fast as they could. This excitement was not lost on the people of Suffolk, Virginia, as many citizens joined this exodus to the new frontier. An article in <em>The Suffolk Intelligencer</em> noted the departure of Suffolk citizens, and publicized the author's disdain for their departure. The article, printed on January 2, 1849, referred to the Gold Rush as the Yellow or the California Fever, and contended that Suffolk was just as victimized by this epidemic as any other city in the nation. If myths of gold fields and instant wealth were not persistent enough, the War Department in Suffolk had several specimens of gold ore, some as large as two ounces, on display to further feed the frenzy. The author questioned whether any permanent benefit from this California rush would materialize, as the chances of unearthing a substantial amount of gold were slim to none. Furthermore, the effects of these citizens' departure affected the local Suffolk economy. Due to the decrease in work force, farms and workshops in the Suffolk area became deserted. On a broader scale, the author worried that this national craze was diverting the nation's attention from developing a solid economic base. The Yellow was not only weakening the stability of Suffolk, but also drying up the true springs of national prosperity.","The Gold Rush created a wild exodus of people to the frontier. By the end of 1849, nearly 80,000 settlers had arrived in California seeking opportunity. The migration of people from Virginia, and other Southern states, played a significant role in the development of new territories in the West. The arrival of these journeymen helped develop the area's resources, infuse more wealth into the territories, and add political importance to the West. The Gold Rush was not the only factor that drew Southerners to the new frontier; the feuding in Bleeding Kansas during the 1850's provoked Virginia and North Carolina to send 4, 721 people to help support slave interests. However, the West was not the only region affected by this migration. With everybody traveling to the frontier, there was nothing to offset the population losses that hit Virginia. Therefore, the Old Dominion faced a decrease in the national House of Representatives and in the Electoral College, weakening its national power. Though the West presented economic opportunity to many people in the Union, the craze to migrate west had a negative effect on the economies of local communities and the political power of Virginia.

Also, the Arkansas family was wealthy, and this woman came from a plantation, which owned around 200 slaves at the war's commencement."," Levering's proposal was initially rejected by Mrs. S? who even cried at first sight of Levering and during various parts of their tense conversation.She feared he would take her house and her livelihood from her in order to benefit the Union army with a residence full of supplies and food.In addition, Mrs. S-- had already planned to provide her only spare room for her cousin who was returning from the Confederate army after receiving a severe injury."," Levering flatly informed her that this ex-Rebel soldier would not be moving into her home.Levering's adamancy eventually coerced her into submission; Mrs. S-- had no choice but to agree to co-inhabitance with this northern family.Levering asked her at what time they would dine every night; when her answer did not satisfy his schedule, Levering mandated a later supper time.At this point, Mrs. S-- was very discontented and greatly feared what others in society would think of her housing a Yankee colonel."," Eventually, a friendship grew between the Levering family, Mrs. S-- and her Arkansas lady friends who visited the house often.Mrs. Levering and Mrs. S-- became very intimate and both women were melancholy when the Union army left Little Rock and, in turn, the Leverings returned to Indiana. Levering notes his gratification of witnessing an earnest expression of regrets for my leaving, as were manifest, upon my coming. "," Dallas T. Herndon narrates that on September 10, 1863, Little Rock, Arkansas became a Union-controlled city, and everything north of the Arkansas River fell under northern control.Consequently, the inhabitants of the city adapted to northern presence, but the hearts of many Little Rock residents were overflowing with animosity and disdain.When Levering demanded to take up residence with an Arkansas lady and her family, the northern power over Little Rock, and other southern cities, was quite evident.Women, in particular, experienced Union occupation, as they remained at home while their husbands fought in the war.Many homes housed Union soldiers who entreated these women to accommodate them.Levering, for example, listened disconcertingly to a southern woman?s wishes.According to Herndon, women in Little Rock continued to aid the Confederate cause, sewing and helping as much as possible; and a monument in Little Rock even honors the ?Mothers of Arkansas? for their sacrifices and labor.Both northerners and southerners alike found their new relationships challenging and confusing, but they adapted to the times.As the Civil War dragged on, southerners found themselves living side-by-side with Union soldiers, as southern cities fell across all parts of the South."," The peculiar relationship between these two families illustrates the possible transgression of regional and ideological differences that many people faced during the Civil War.Levering is shocked that a clergyman?s family could descend from a plantation bearing such a large quantity of slaves and also fight with religious zeal for slavery?s continuance; the cultural differences between Levering and his southern tenants reflect the tensions, which were widespread during the occupation of an antebellum city.Their flourishing friendship, however, offered hope that large ideological differences could be bridged and the Union eventually might be reunited."],"display_date":"September 10, 1863 - December 31, 1865","search_date":"1864-11-04","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2498,"title":"The Revolution of the Immigrant Vote\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-08","end_date":"1861-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Political propaganda was not unique to the nineteenth-century South.

Yet nativism and alienation of rights were undermined when local and national politicians needed the vote of the new immigrants.

Of the thousands in attendance, it is believed that famous poet and author, Edgar Allen Poe saw Mr. Mills's balloon ascension.

For example, there was a law that stated that for each twenty slaves a man owned one man from his home would be excused from fighting. Rich men were also able to buy others to substitute their spot in the troops. There were also heavy taxes on farms, even on farmers who had little to spare.

While it remains unclear whether Pitts referred to the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, or Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish days, his observance of this Jewish tradition positively identified a Jewish population living and working in Perry County, Alabama in 1882. Pitts concluded his diary entry by listing the various goods he purchased including a brass handle and a monkey wrench. ","Jewish immigration into the South was divided into four phases from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century. Jewish immigration to Alabama began in the late nineteenth century during the third wave of Jewish settlement in the South. Abraham Mordecai was the first European Jew to travel further west of the early centers of Jewish life in Savannah and Charleston. While the exact date of his arrival is unknown, he settled in what would become Montgomery, Alabama in 1880, pushing the Jewish population further into the South. ","As Jewish immigrants continued to settle in the South, they progressively gained economic influence in society. According to social historian Ralph Melnick, the collapse of the rural plantation system transferred economic and political power to southern cities and townships. With this economic shift, the Jewish population began to earn clout working as professionals, businessmen, mill operators, commodity brokers, and farm owners. In these roles Jewish workers increased their economic status in times of relative instability throughout the South. Reconstruction and the depression of the 1890s further increased Jewish wealth as they continually offered incentives over gentile competition. Jewish business transactions were strictly cash-only, eliminating the vicious cycle of debt for the consumer and decreasing the merchants' risk of financial loss. The economic prosperity enjoyed by these southern working Jews unfortunately led to an increase of anti-Semitism and resentment across the South. ","  Between 1848 and 1980 Alabama lost half its Jewish population to bigotry and hate crimes. In 1868, the Ku Klux Klan was founded in Memphis, Tennessee and formally began its reign of terror throughout the South. In 1871, the KKK publicly murdered a Jewish shopkeeper in Memphis and established the Jewish population as a target of the organization. Though many Jews fled both Alabama and the South others remained. Despite anti-Semitic sentiments in the South, many Jewish families lingered in the region of their American roots.

Horticulturist, W. G. Fraser spent four weeks in the South during the winter of 1900 testing a new market for Californian oranges. Upon returning to California he reported to the <em>Los Angeles Daily Times</em>, The result of my trip was most satisfactory. I found a very active demand for California fruit... Fraser attributed this demand to the remarkable prosperity of the South giving the citizens the purchasing power needed to facilitate exportation of California produce. The Birmingham economy was of considerable interest to Fraser. He noted, In Alabama, especially, was the industrial activity great. At Birmingham the iron works have government contracts that keep them employed for two years. The skilled operatives earn from 4 to 16 per day. Extrapolating from these estimates, Fraser deemed the Birmingham market worth cultivating. Upon seeing the profitability and stability of the Birmingham iron industry, Fraser only expressed regret that this market had not been studied and served earlier. "," Birmingham's economy was booming at the turn of the twentieth century. By 1899, Alabama's iron industry produced more than twice that of her nearest rivals, Tennessee and Virginia combined. Fraser's account of Birmingham's industrial success was only one of many that were narrated in newspapers at the end of the century. The tale of Birmingham and the greater Alabama industrial revolution remain integral to the state's history. In the mid-1880s Tennessee Coal Iron and Railway Company supported Birmingham's industry and the city soon left all southern competitors in the dust. However, as Fraser applauded the economic success of Birmingham, the iron capital of the South faced an industrial decline. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, [Alabama's] need for vast sums of capital outside the South...conspired to keep Birmingham from attaining what had seemed so close at hand in the early 1890s. The capital that did flow into Birmingham went directly into the production of pig iron and relied upon Northern investment. This capital did not directly enhance the personal wealth of the Birmingham labor force as Fraser suggested. The labor forces of the Birmingham iron industry, while comparably compensated to northern employees, engaged in backbreaking work for marginal personal gain. Additionally, according to Ayers, the volume of cheap labor that flocked to the industrial capital of Birmingham stunted the city's need for technological advancement. With little need to adopt labor saving technology in Birmingham, the city fell behind to northern competitors willing to update their systems. Fraser was correct in mourning California's past oversight of a new fruit market in Birmingham. Yet, Fraser visited the South approximately five years too late to capitalize on the southern industrial revolution.

Would the Chicago news reach her parents back home in Tuscumbia before she made it home to tell them in person? On May 17, 1890, the Chicago Tribune ran a special on the miraculous case of Helen Keller; a blind, deaf and dumb child from Alabama. Keller's wealthy parents had sent her up north to a special institution for the blind. According to the article, Keller's parents had heard of the great progress made by another student, Laura Bridgman, and hoped for the same results for Helen. Her success however, far exceeded that of Ms. Bridgman and in the first year Helen acquired a vocabulary of 3,000 words. Her teacher, Miss Fuller, gave her instruction as to how to place her tongue and the child would feel of her teacher's throat and lips when she was talking, thus learning the mechanical elements of articulation. The Tribune reported that Helen subsequently spoke quite readily and praised her remarkable accomplishments. After announcing Helen's feat to the entire city of Chicago, the Tribune concluded, The child has kept her wonderful recovery of speech secret, as she wishes to surprise her parents, whom she is to visit in the South soon. "," Born a healthy baby in Tuscumbia on June 27, 1880, a fever rendered Keller deaf and blind at the age of eighteen months old. Despite all odds, Helen Keller had achieved an international reputation even before studying under Sarah Fuller in 1890. By 1888, at the tender age of eight, Keller was recognized in the Chicago Tribune for her wonderful power. The article spoke of Helen's education in Tuscumbia with Miss Anne Mausfueld Sullivan. At the age of seven, Helen's parents hired Miss Sullivan to teach the child in Alabama. Subsequently, Helen traveled north to continue her education with another teacher, Sarah Fuller of the Horace Mann School. Helen Keller's story became a widely recognized and heartwarming tale by the turn of the century and her dedication to learning earned her both a spot in the public eye and that of history. "," Helen Keller's first educational breakthrough occured at home in Tuscumbia. Why then would her parents then send her away from Alabama to continue her learning? The Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind was established in the 1860s and served as a special needs school close to home. And yet, Keller traveled north to further her education at various private institutions including the prestigious Horace Mann School. Though Keller proved an exceptional case with respect to her achievements in education, she was not alone in her journey north to further her schooling. Many wealthy Alabama natives sent their children north at the end of the nineteenth century in search of higher education. The ill-defined school system and educational deficiencies throughout Alabama led many to look outside the state for higher educational purposes. Furthermore, racial segregation throughout the South created similar education problems as those faced in Alabama. State biographer William Rogers observes, In Alabama, as in the rest of the South, the problems of educational support were compounded by the decision to establish parallel institutions for whites and blacks. Due to racial tensions throughout the South, many southern families turned north for the best educational opportunities. If families had the private funds to find the best education available, many southerners looked north during times of educational and racial turmoil in the South.

Recently re-stationed to the city from New Orleans, he found the best hotel in town uncomfortable and unsuitable for a Union officer. In January 1865, Levering encountered a desirable solution. Levering casually visited a local, celebrated lady of society, a Mrs. S--, and informed her that he and his family would be moving in to her house. Levering cited several reasons in his diary as to his selection of this residence. Firstly, it was the comfortable looking home of a clergy man. Levering was informed that Mrs. S--'s religious husband was away from home fighting for the Rebel army. Also, the Arkansas family was wealthy, and this woman came from a plantation, which owned around 200 slaves at the war's commencement. Levering's proposal was initially rejected by Mrs. S-- who even cried at first sight of Levering and during various parts of their tense conversation. She feared he would take her house and her livelihood from her in order to benefit the Union army with a residence full of supplies and food. In addition, Mrs. S-- had already planned to provide her only spare room for her cousin who was returning from the Confederate army after receiving a severe injury. Levering flatly informed her that this ex-Rebel soldier would not be moving into her home. Levering eventually coerced her into submission; Mrs. S-- had no choice but to agree to co-inhabitance with this northern family. Levering asked her at what time they would dine every night; when her answer did not satisfy his schedule, Levering mandated a later supper time. At this point, Mrs. S-- was very discontented and greatly feared what others in society would think of her housing a Yankee colonel."," Eventually, a friendship grew between the Levering family, Mrs. S-- and her Arkansas lady friends who visited the house often. Mrs. Levering and Mrs. S-- became very intimate and both women were melancholy when the Union army left Little Rock and, in turn, the Leverings returned to Indiana. Levering notes his gratification of witnessing an earnest expression of regrets for my leaving, as were manifest, upon my coming. Dallas T. Herndon narrates that on September 10, 1863, Little Rock, Arkansas became a Union-controlled city, and everything north of the Arkansas River fell under northern control. Consequently, the inhabitants of the city adapted to northern presence, but the hearts of many Little Rock residents were overflowing with animosity and disdain. When Levering demanded to take up residence with an Arkansas lady and her family, the northern power over Little Rock, and other southern cities, was quite evident. Women, in particular, experienced Union occupation, as they remained at home while their husbands fought in the war. Many homes housed Union soldiers who entreated these women to accommodate them. Levering, for example, listened disconcertingly to a southern woman's wishes. According to Herndon, women in Little Rock continued to aid the Confederate cause, sewing and helping as much as possible; and a monument in Little Rock even honors the Mothers of Arkansas for their sacrifices and labor. Both northerners and southerners alike found their new relationships challenging and confusing, but they adapted to the times. As the Civil War dragged on, southerners found themselves living side-by-side with Union soldiers, as southern cities fell across all parts of the South. he peculiar relationship between these two families illustrates the possible transgression of regional and ideological differences that many people faced during the Civil War. Levering is shocked that a clergyman's family could descend from a plantation bearing such a large quantity of slaves and also fight with religious zeal for slavery's continuance; the cultural differences between Levering and his southern tenants reflect the tensions, which were widespread during the occupation of an antebellum city. Their flourishing friendship, however, offered hope that large ideological differences could be bridged and the Union eventually might be reunited."],"display_date":"January 1, 1865 - January 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-01-15","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2563,"title":"Brazil as the New South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-06-08","end_date":"1867-06-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For southern whites, the end of the Civil War ushered in a period of poverty, dependence, and hate. The Union soldiers had confiscated or destroyed much of the plantation owners' valuable property, and without property or the system of slavery that had sustained the South for so many generations, the agricultural economy plummeted and became extremely vulnerable to carpetbaggers and scalawags. Those southerners who had held jobs in the political or other public sphere found themselves replaced by Yankees or Yankee sympathizers. Many once-affluent whites quickly grew frustrated with their forced dependence on the Yankees - for whom they had nothing but contempt and hatred - and the sense of desperation and hopelessness that pervaded the defeated South. Horace Buckner, the young son of a white Louisa County, Virginia planter, traveled throughout the South in the midst of Reconstruction and expressed his horror at the devastation wreaked upon the entire region. Writing his father in Louisa from Mobile, Alabama, in 1867, Horace expressed woe for both himself and the other southerners he observed. As a public school teacher, he worried that although I employed a competent teacher to serve in my absence with the consent of the board...if they are changed, which I think is very probable, I may lose my position. The military authority, which controls this state, seems determined to throw out every Southerner who has any public office and put Yankees in their places. Within the last week, they have removed the entire city government and replaced then with notorious Yankee sympathizers. ","He expounded upon the hopeless conditions in Mobile, writing times are very hard in this city. There is nothing doing. Money can hardly be obtained at all. The clerks in the stores are idle more than half the time. Hundreds are out of employment and are willing to work for almost nothing. He also worried that the registration of blacks to vote will distract them from agricultural work, and that the depressed economy in the South would discourage foreign capital from the region in the future.","After describing these conditions to his father, he proposed a rather radical solution for his own situation and asked his father's advice and counsel. Rather than stay in the ruined South and attempt to rebuild his life under Yankee rule, Buckner considered the idea of emigration out of the United States. During this period, a small number of southerners chose to leave the country rather than live in defeat. A good many seem to be immigrating to Brazil, Buckner writes. They all seem to be well-pleased with the country. I received a letter from a friend of mine out there, urging me to come out, promising me a good and easy situation among a flourishing colony of Southerners. Buckner's friend had promised him a job and a salary equivalent to 1,200 greenbacks and a place in a community of relocated southerners along the Amazon. In fact, over nine thousand southerners did end up relocating in Brazil. John Lowe, in his article Reconstruction Revisited: Plantation School Writers, Postcolonial Theory, and Confederates in Brazil in the Mississippi Quarterly, discusses this phenomenon. Lowe writes that even before the war, Brazil held appeal to many southerners for its perceived similarities to the American South: namely, an institutionalized system of slavery, warm, agriculture-friendly climate, and the nation's later sympathy to the confederate cause at the outset of the Civil War.","Buckner did not end up leaving the country, but instead spent many years traveling through the South and West, never truly settling into a permanent home. However, the fact that he considered - and other southerners actually went through with - leaving the country completely for a land as foreign as Brazil demonstrates the level of disenchantment and frustration felt by white southerners during Reconstruction. In the book Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction, James M. McPherson wrote extensively about the tensions in the postwar South between Northern and Southern whites. He concludes that most often, Southerners' pent-up rage could not be taken out on the Yankee soldiers themselves, and thus Southern white Unionists, or the notorious Yankee sympathizers, about whom Buckner writes, as well as free blacks, absorb the brunt of Southern anger. McPherson also details the corruption and exploitation of many Yankee officials. The federal government instated a cotton tax of 2.5 cents per pound, which was not revoked until 1868. Often, Yankees sent to collect cotton from Southern farmers for distribution throughout the Union instead simply stole it and sold it for their own profit - or accepted substantial bribes from southern planters not to do so.

Mrs. Brown wrote her sister a short letter explaining why she could not stop and visit, and that she would be away from her native Charlottesville until the end of June. When she wrote the letter, Mrs. Brown was traveling through Lynchburg. She relied on southern railroads to take her where she wanted to go.","Mrs. Brown's went on her trip at a time when southern railroads companies were repairing the damage inflicted upon them by the Civil War. The southern railroads at the end of the war were severely dilapidated. Virginia was one of the first southern states to court northern capital investment in railroads. Without that help, Mrs. Brown might not have even been able to travel as she did in 1868. However even by 1868 southern railroads did not have enough capital to make marked improvement. A large amount of railroad graft involving carpetbaggers also took place that year. The Panic of 1873 made hurt the struggling companies even more. The Richmond and Danville Railroad was one of many southern railroads that Mrs. Brown went on her trip. That year the railroad company registered costs at 61.8 percent of receipts. Railroad travel in south was very significant because southern railroads were absolutely inadequate in comparison with the North. Their lesser capabilities were clearly evident during Civil War and prolonged economic recovery after the Civil War. Mrs. Brown's railroad trip in 1868 exemplified the most modern means of travel, and the possibilities for modernization in the South.

In a letter to his father, Burton Randall discussed his journey and most significantly, displayed empathy for the precarious handling of American Indians by the United States government.  Concerned with the forced removal of the state's indigenous population, Randall bewailed how the American Indians were driven by whites from the graves of their fathers in Mississippi.  Randall spent time serving in Florida and Louisiana and was no stranger to culture clashes with the native populations of America. Yet this specific conflict sparked his empathy, a conflict thirty years in the making.  ","    As early as 1805 the Choctaw Indians began relinquishing lands to settlers in the Piney Woods region (what is now southeastern Mississippi). Over the next 15 years, the tribe continued to surrender lands, most particularly after the War of 1812.  According to Bradley Bonds, the War of 1812 settled several Native American conflicts and Indian lands increasingly opened up to settlers.  This gradual removal came to a head in October of 1820 when American politicians Andrew Jackson and Thomas Hinds harangued Choctaw leaders in Canton, Mississippi.  In 1820, Americans occupied a third of the Mississippi Territory while Native American tribes comprised the remaining two-thirds.  Jackson bargained with Choctaw leaders: Thirteen million acres in Arkansas plus food, guns and ammunition for their five million acres in Mississippi.  The Choctaw tribe acquiesced and forfeited their acreage in west-central Mississippi to American settlers. ","However, it was not until 1830 that Mississippi legislation refused to recognize the independent powers of the Native American tribes and as John Skates states, the politicians, in reality, told the Indians that, to save their tribal government and to maintain their tribal freedoms, they must leave Mississippi and head west to Indian Territory. The mass exodus, from the graves of their fathers to the Choctaw territory where Burton Randall found himself, tripled the amount of public lands for Mississippians and land-hungry settlers.  The removal of the Choctaws was not unlike the Jacksonian handling of other American Indian tribes across the South."],"display_date":"June 18, 1835","search_date":"1835-06-18","locations":[{"id":7363,"lat":33.6257974076,"lng":-89.382351072,"zoom":7,"place":"INDIAN LANDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2621,"title":"Railroad Revolution\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-07-04","end_date":"1860-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Railroads were the transportation craze of the nation during the 1840s. In the early 1860s, tracks exceeded 30,000 miles in length. The North was certainly far more connected than the South, simply because they were more industrialized and had the money to do so. Often in the South, the majority of money spent was for land purchases or slaves. The railroads of the South were not evenly dispersed. Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia often supported the development of the railroad while other Gulf states were more in favor of transportation via waterways to ship their products to seaports. According to the <em>Encyclopedia of the Antebellum South</em>, on the eve of the Civil War, Southern Atlantic coast states railway mileage was in excess of 5,000 miles while larger states such as Louisiana Mississippi, and Alabama had less the 1,800 miles of track. Tracks were often dead ends, leading from a plantation to a waterway and nowhere else. Similarly the railroads in Texas and Arkansas were equally as sparse. Tennessee and Kentucky were far advanced in comparison having strategically placed 1,300 miles by 1860. ","There was no uniform plan for railroad development at this time; however, both lines did met in Richmond, which provided the only direct line to the nation's capital in Washington, DC. The first railroad on the Eastern Shore was an infamous tease. There were parties where guns and bells rang and flags waved in celebration of the passage of a bill in the legislature that allowed for its creation. However, because of a financial depression, no tracks were laid, only some preliminary surveying done. Twenty-five years later, the first actual railroad emerged, owned by a company named the Eastern Shore Railroad Company. Delaware's railroad ended at the state line and Marylanders organized its extension to the town now known as Crisfield. (John W. Crisfield of Princess Anne County was the lawyer and Congressional associate of Abraham Lincoln, of whom the town was named.)","Two years later, and on the brink of the Civil War, the railway finally was completed from Delmar to Salisbury. A celebration was in order; for twenty-five cents, passengers could travel on a three and one half mile trek aboard the small steam locomotive. Many on the Eastern Shore had never seen such a sight in their lives. There was fear, excitement, and hope in the air. People traveled from miles around to join in the celebration of the opening of the railroad on July 4, 1860. ","After the celebrations, the train began to run on a regular schedule. The extension of the railroad through the Eastern Shore created many opportunities for entrepreneurs. Hotels were established for guests to stay after arriving from their journey on the train and trade became far more accessible for the watermen and farmers of the area. After the war ended, the railroad was extended further southward to include Princess Anne and Cape Charles Counties. Marylanders needed and wanted a direct line from northern manufacturing cities for expansion to more southern markets.  The railroad allowed for dramatic improvements in trade and communication. Even so, there were often problems in connecting networks. Differences in track width, lack of maintenance, and weak bridging technology all caused major slow downs. Inefficient braking prohibited trains from exceeding more than twenty-five miles an hour without risking derailment. Even with the twenty-five mile per hour limitations, railroads still drastically sped up the economy of the South. Technologically, railways were still extremely primitive, but they were a modern marvel of that generation.

Boynton in a hot air balloon above the clouds. The bride was an orphan, born in Northampton County, Virginia, and adopted by Mrs. J.L. West of St. Louis as an infant. With over 6,000 spectators present, the bridal party left the Fifth Avenue Hotel for Central Park. His sister and the owner of the balloon accompanied the young bride and her fiance for the ceremony. They floated away from the Park, exchanging vows and signing the marriage contract while ballooning through the sky. Such a fairy tale wedding made reality for a young girl who once had no hopes for such a comfortable future. Social status was determined in large part by family and as an orphan she was left in the cold. She had little hope for education, medical care, and would have most likely been forced to work in a factory to support herself even as a teen. She was so lucky to avoid all of that. ","During the years preceding the war, slavery continued to fade away and forced by low profitability of small scale farming, many men were forced to find other means of work. Often these farmers could not produce enough substantial crops to feed their families, much less enough to commercially sell at market. Livestock also required larger treks of land to sustain profitability. Fishing and hunting were often alternate ways that the poor obtained food. Economic expansion created a great struggle between the classes. As lumbering, steel, and iron industries emerged, employers began to look past racial lines, hiring whites and blacks as equals. Many men who saw their skin color as the only valuable asset they possessed were stripped of their pride when forced to work side by side with newly freed African Americans. ","Occupation, residence, religious affiliation, and such too often determined much of one's societal value. The poor worked for minimal wages while the socially elite could afford luxuries such as Mary West's wedding dress made of the richest of poplin, trimmed with rich velvet, with a silk hat and gloves to match. Wealthy southern aristocracy shared many of the same privileges as those of the north, but often gaining their wealth by use of slaves. Many owned plantations, but other chose to invest in industrial endeavors. The Duke and Winston families prospered from the tobacco market in North Carolina and Mary Ann Todd, wife of Abraham Lincoln was from a Kentucky family that made its money from banking. Southern wealth was no longer the result of solely slave labor.","Mary West's marriage to Dr. John Boynton was certainly one of exceptional status. They were both highly educated. She attended Monticello Seminary in Illinois and was quite talented in music and drawing. John graduated from a medical institution and was well known for his lectures in geology. He also at one time held government office. Their wedding was elegant and very original even by today's standards. Her dress was rose in color and the hot air balloon was adorned with lace curtains and tassels in the colors of the American flag. After landing at sunset, they took a train back to the Fifth Avenue Hotel to share their first night as husband and wife. Mary West was fortunately raised by a loving mother that was more than able to give her all the comforts that she would have never experienced as an orphan on the eastern shore of Virginia. While Mary West's economic prosperity did not make her happiness, it was far more promising than the life that she was born into.

He wrote about how unimpressive Atlanta was and stated that he could not gather a single item of interest about the city to write about. He was able to see a show while in the city. He observed that people in Atlanta responded well to the play because the theater was full and there were many demands for an encore presentation. He noted that the cotton and guano markets were not doing well there due to the overuse of fertilizer. The presence of fertilizer being sold indicated that farmers were trying harder to produce the cash crops even though the markets were bad. He repeated information from an article from New Orleans in Atlanta's newspaper saying that people were encouraged not to buy goods like sugar and molasses from the North because of additional shipping costs. Overall, he was not impressed by the city of Atlanta.","Urbanization and industrialization were important ideals of the New South after the Civil War in order to make their region more appealing to the North according to Jeanette Keith. Large urban centers would make the south more appealing for Northern investors, and then the economy of the South and the nation would improve. This process was most often accomplished by bringing railroads into the area. According to James McPherson, railroads allowed for Southerners to transform this kingdom from open-range grazing and the long cattle drive to...more scientific methods of livestock agriculture. Farmers made products like cotton or other crops and shipped them to other parts of the country with the availability of railroads. The railroads also allowed for products to be brought into urban centers from other places, even from the North. McPherson noted that shipping could be costly, however, in places with access to only one railway line because the owner had a monopoly on the shipping. Thus, it would have been likely that shipping costs were high for goods from New Orleans as the reporter warned people of Atlanta. The historian Lewis Nicholas Wynne wrote that the railroads and the increasing commercial centers resulting from the railway system were created with the intention of making the South a part of the national economy. Although the Southern cities that were created allowed the people more independence with increased wealth, Wynne argues that the Southern cities were looking to be incorporated into the nation as a whole.

He saw political corruption especially in the Governor's office. The governor was suspected of having unethical intentions with the State railroad. He seemed to have had financial investments in the railroad that benefited him greatly, but he observed that overall the railroad benefited everyone in the state. The traveler judged that Reconstruction [had] been a complete failure there due in part to the controversy in the city. ","After the Civil War, Republicans designed policies intended to increase the productivity of the South and industrialize the area. Eric Foner noted that the Southern law...was redesigned so as to encourage the free flow of capital in the South for industrialization. These policies left the state governments that were controlled by Republicans in charge of distributing the capital in ways to improve the economy. This made the situation more complicated by creating opportunities for corruption. According to Lewis Nicholas Wynne, people in Governor Bullock's office had the opportunity to accept bribes and Bullock was able to use the capital to reward loyal followers as patronage, which made many people suspicious of corruption in his policies. Democrats were unhappy with the Republicans because of their supposedly corrupt practices and the harsh policies of Reconstruction. The political tensions between both parties made it easy to start accusing people of corrupt practices, especially the governor.","Railroads were the focus of Southerners' attention during the years after Reconstruction. According to the research of Edward Ayers, there were many reasons why the railroads had such an impact on society. First, he showed that the creation of railroads that would stretch across the country created the need for making time zones and creating a standard time. Also, he noted that the railways were important for bringing commerce to the South that created new towns. This commercial aspect of Southern towns made them more similar to Northern towns and allowed them to assimilate with the rest of the nation. Another impact that Ayers noted was the creation of segregation laws concerning the railways. White men disapproved of the idea of black men being able to sit near white women because of the threat of sexuality between whites and blacks. Thus, Ayers wrote, the more closely linked to sexuality, the more likely was a place to be segregated. Railroads were growing in importance in society because they affected many different aspects of people's lives."],"display_date":"1870 - 1875","search_date":"1872-12-31","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2670,"title":"Connection of a Railways Through Augusta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-05-01","end_date":"1884-05-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Port Royal railroad company came into conflict with the city of Augusta when it intended to build a railway through the city which would be in competition with local transportation providers.

The business owners in the city were upset that the company would have the sole rights to transportation within the city. Thus, the company had to stop building until the city reached a decision.","City governments had to make policies to encourage economic growth in the area. During Reconstruction, a veritable mania spread among white Southerners that building railroads provided the key to economic recovery according to David Donald, Jean Baker, and Michael Holt. The building of the railway would have improved the local and state economies by allowing farmers to make products that could be shipped on them. It would also allow people to produce only cash crops and then buy things they needed that would be transported on the railways. As historian Eric Foner noted, direct trade routes could be established with the North. The southern states could benefit from the industrialization of the North and the products made there while the North could benefit from the agriculture of the South. This would integrate the commerce of the nation and create a greater sense of unity. Local businessmen, however, felt that the railways would take away from their economic profits by monopolizing transportation. There was political corruption concerning the railroads and businessmen were justified in their feelings that some might have been given unfair advantages. Foner noted that Republicans in charge of making railroad assignments were able to accept bribes for control to railway access and distribute based on patronage. Although the railway system had benefits for the greater economy, there were local problems that made legislation on the issue difficult.

They ran away for many reasons. They suffered from the brutal treatment of their master. They sought to be reunited with relatives or friends that lived in the North. They could run away just to experience the taste of freedom that had been stripped away from them. Most slave holders posted news about their runaways in the local newspapers. Most of the rewards for these fugitive slaves ranged from 100-1,000 dollars. The value of the slave depended on how crucial the slave was to the slaveholder. In Fairfax County one such notice reported that a slave named William Lee, described as a bright mulatto who had escaped from the plantation of Virginia slaveholder WM. H. Guenell.

In order to help this concern, The American Colonization Society was founded in 1817. Border States such as Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia had the most chapters because of their locations and ideas about slavery. In Virginia, many prominent men were members of this society, including James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and John Hartwell Cocke of Fluvanna Country. The Society was a national club and needed to keep its members bonded together on one common cause. One way that they accomplished this was to send out a newsletter called the Circular. "," The 1819 Circular, informed John Cocke of a colony that was in the works of being established in Africa so that the Society could finally put its thoughts into action. Despite only being two years old at the time, the society already had strong ideas and a plan to bring about colonization. They worked out their plan in great detail to ensure that it would work and go over well; they knew minute details such as which port the slaves would leave from and where the former slaves were going. The colony that the Circular publicized was Liberia. In 1821, Liberia became the colony of African American colonization in Africa; the city of Monrovia was the major city of this colony, named for President James Monroe. This letter was an informational letter sent to all of the members to show progress in this endeavor; many other letters followed to keep the members posted on development in the project."," This Colony was formed out of fear that if slavery were abolished and the slaves were left in America as freedmen, they would revolt against their former owners. Virginia, Cocke's home state, was the first place in America to hold slaves and had already experienced turmoil from unhappy slaves. Virginians feared slave revolts like the Gabriel Revolt of 1800 and the Denmark Vessey Revolt in Haiti in 1822. They feared that since they had held slaves for so long that they slaves would have a strong vengeance against the slave owners. Colonization seemed like the perfect alternative; it would slowly ease the slave holders away from slavery and get the enslaved people away from the land of their former masters and back to their homeland."," Colonization was a dominate idea in the United States in the era before the Civil War. Some southerners favored colonization because they did not want to have their slaves turn on them after they were freed, and northerners did not want African Americans in their country because of racist feelings that were prevalent in the North in the early nineteenth century. Both regions could agree on this alternative to abolition, despite their obvious differences about slavery. The American Colonization Society combined these regional fears into a club with a common cause that all Americans could relate to and support."],"display_date":1819,"search_date":"1819-07-02","locations":[{"id":13904,"lat":37.7601235969,"lng":-77.4908797136,"zoom":9,"place":"HANOVER, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2718,"title":"Feuds Between the North and South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-26","end_date":"1895-01-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Judge M.L. Buchwalter lived in Cincinnati, Ohio. He convicted a prisoner and sent him to Kentucky. Once he arrived in Kentucky, not long after he got off the train, the prisoner was lynched. This greatly disturbed Judge Buchwalter, and the next time Kentucky asked him to send his prisoner to their state, he worried about what would happen to the prisoner. He first contacted Kentucky and pleaded that the prisoner, before being harmed, be given a fair trial."," Reverend A.H. Hampton, Buchwalter's prisoner, was accused of shooting and wounding a white man with intent to kill. Kentucky once again asked Judge M.L. Buchwalter to send the prisoner to Kentucky for the decision of what to do with him. Buckwalter hesitated in sending this man to Kentucky. He first wanted to make sure that the prisoner would be protected until the court made a decision, and that he would be guaranteed a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the United States. Judge Buchwalter did not want to send the charged man to Kentucky and have him lynched before he even had a chance to defend his life. "," When Kentucky could not guarantee such a request, Judge M.L. Buchwalter discharged the prisoner. In this case, Judge Buchwalter represented the beliefs of Ohio as a state. According to The Richmond Planet, Ohio refuses to act as an agent for murderers and will not deliver a black man into the hands of lynchers. "," This article, published in Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, showed the North's beliefs on lynching without a fair trial. It also showed the difference of opinion in Virginia and the South as well. The disapproval or support of lynching seemed to have reached a peak in the 1890s and newspapers all over the nation, such as this one, stated their opinion on the situation. "," Southerners, however, maintained the argument that the lynching was not unwarranted or unexpected. They wouldn't lynch a black man for something that was not harmful, such as communication with a white woman. According to William Brundage, that was only a trivial infraction of racial etiquette. But there were different levels of what was deserving of lynching. Mob vengeance was incited by more serious infractions. Theft was more serious, although it did not elicit mob violence. Minor and implicit sexual crimes incited mobs sometimes. Murder, however, got whole white communities together to lynch blacks. "," The emotions derived from each crime determined the severity of the actions. Rev. A. H. Hampton's actions would probably elicit a strong emotion from a group of whites in Kentucky, and thus he would probably be lynched. Judge M.L. Buchwalter was probably right then, to have not sent him back to Kentucky, because he would not have received a fair and impartial trial, as the Judge had wished he would, before the mob decided that he was undeserving of such a trial.

In 1881, Talladega  County proposed a vote on the outlaw of alcohol consumption and the African American population allegedly voted in a bloc against the prohibition. The article blamed the African American population for the failure of passing prohibition in the county.  As the surrounding counties of Clay, Calhoun, St. Clair, and Shelby had previously outlawed the sale of alcohol, the Christians of Talladega County feared their county would be overrun with the scum and scuff of the other counties if they did not enact the same prohibition.  The Baptists of Talladega County greatly feared the community would become a cesspool of drinking and crime, as the only county in the area to permit alcohol sale and consumption.  Thus, the Baptists of Talladega County beseeched the community to protect their region from alcohol consumption and its consequences by outlawing alcohol trafficking in the county.","The <em>Christian Index</em> emphasized the depraved nature of drunkenness and the tendency for indulgence in spirits to encourage crime and lewd behavior, suggesting that those who consumed alcohol were depraved criminals and delinquents.  Thus, the article's accusation that the African American community voted in a bloc against the prohibition measure suggested that African Americans were depraved for their desire to drink alcohol or protect the right to do so.  As they vehemently condemned alcohol consumption, the <em>Christian Index </em>rebuked the African Americans in Talladega County for their part in the prohibition's failure.","The Baptists' fear of Talladega County's inevitable degeneration through alcohol consumption supports historian Robert Handy's argument that nineteenth-century Baptists believed that drunkenness was the cardinal sin of the land.  According to Handy, total prohibition was the primary and ultimate Southern Baptist position by the 1880's.  Historian Edward Ayers also argues that whites believed blacks were swing voters on the issue of prohibition, but black voters did not actually vote consistently against prohibition. The article portrays whites' view of African Americans as swing voters, as the writer condemned the African Americans for altering the outcome of the election.

The two ladies were invited to spend the night at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Nugent, but declined the offer because the women did not want to inconvenience the family because the Nugents were already hosting many other guests. The women also wanted to travel with their three male friends in order to find a place for them to stay together. After the incident, a citizen of Church Hill circulated a rumor that the women declined the Nugents' hospitable offer because couple lived in a log cabin. A lengthy article ran in the <em>Rogersville Press and Times</em> denouncing the man who spread the rumor and calling him a noodlehead with the innate proclivity to tell lies. The <em>Press and Times</em> defended the women's character, stating that they would never spurn a kindness and then speak ill of those who offered it. The women told the newspaper that Mrs. Nugent's hospitality was the primary subject of their conversation after leaving her home, stating that she was extremely kind and generous.","The supposed insult of a community woman launched a scandal in Hawkins  County, pitting the communities of Church Hill and St. Clair against each other, and prompting a four-column article in the Rogersville newspaper. Thus, the conflict seriously impacted upon the communities in Hawkins  County. The newspaper emphasized that the Church Hill community was an honorable community with good citizens, but argued that the community was beset by the presence of one citizen who spread deceitful rumors about the St. Clair women. The article suggested that many attacks and accusations occurred between the communities, as the conflict set the citizens of St. Clair against the citizens of Church Hill. ","The conflict centered around the supposed violation of female dignity and propriety. The article protected both the respectable and high toned women of St. Clair and the kind lady of Church Hill, Mrs. Nugent. This protection of female dignity supports historian James C. Cobb's argument that white womanhood was a symbolic assertion of white southern manhood in the late nineteenth century. According to Cobb, men sustained their own dignity and manhood by protecting female dignity. Cobb argues that this symbolic protection of dignity stems from the southern man's failure to protect women during the Civil War, leading them to ardently protect female dignity in response to their failure. The newspaper article sought to protect the honor and dignity of the females involved in the conflict, while deriding the honor of the male who spread the rumors against the women's character.

Sharp concealed her pregnancy until the birth, attempting to protect her reputation for as long as possible. When her father discovered her secret, he erupted in anger and demanded vengeance upon the man who impregnated her. She initially refused to reveal the name of her child's father, but eventually revealed that her impregnator was Thomas Nation, a Mormon convert who was her sister's husband. Mr. Sharp rushed to Nation's house, threatening to kill his son-in-law and then himself. Upon arriving at Nation's residence, Sharp discovered the dead body of his other daughter, as she had perished that same day in the delivery of her own child. Meanwhile, Nation realized his adultery had been discovered, and he fled from his home and his wife's corpse. After the funeral of his daughter, Mr. Sharp offered a 100 reward for Nation's arrest and the entire community joined in the hunt for the villain. Nation was eventually discovered with two other Mormons on a train going to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The sheriff of Catoosa County sent a deputy to pursue Nation, and they arrested him as he stepped off the train in Chattanooga on August 13, 1880.","It is impossible to determine whether Martha Sharp's intercourse with Thomas Nation was forced or consensual. Nonetheless, Sharp possessed much shame about her pregnancy. Her father's reaction to the incident reveals the severity that nineteenth-century southern society bestowed upon such a scandal. The fact that Mr. Sharp was willing to kill his son-in-law and then end his own life, suggests that Sharp lost all desire to live because of his family's disgrace. However, the community blamed Nation's membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as the reason for the scandal, accusing Nation's religious associations as the cause for the Sharp family's problems.","The <em>National Police Gazette'</em>s article on the scandal supports historian Sarah Barringer Gordon's claim that most Americans of the nineteenth century believed the Latter Day Saints were an uncivilized and barbaric religious group. According to Gordon, anti-Mormon and anti-polygamy Americans argued that no civilized group could disagree about the fundamental question of domestic relations, declaring the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to be an inhumane, undemocratic, and un-American church. The article supports Gordon's argument, as the story castigated Nation more for his Mormon affiliation than for his adultery. Nation was, in fact, practicing adultery with his wife's sister and was not practicing polygamy. However, the article and community emphasized Nation's crime as a Mormon polygamy problem, rather than a problem of morality in general. The article's attack on the Latter Day Saints displays the Protestant community's desire to frame the incident as an isolated Mormon problem, rather than a moral problem that breeched religious divides.

Before his move to Alabama, Walton aided African Americans in Southern Missouri and hoped to soon retire from his missionary work.  However, Walton attended the Quaker Illinois Yearly Meeting, which inspired him to resume his responsibilities as a teacher of underprivileged African American children.  Walton stated that he heard both the African Americans and his Heavenly Father calling him to assist the destitute.  Walton organized two First-Day Schools in Stevenson without public school funds.  He repaired the schoolhouse, provided new books for the pupils, and personally paid for many of the students' tuition fees.  Walton temporarily refused a salary in order to lighten the financial burden of the African American families.  Walton personally financed the education of orphans and the children of indigent parents who were unable to work because of sickness.  On November 17, Walton wrote a letter to the Quaker journal, the <em>Friends' Intelligencer</em>, requesting aid for his school, asking for donations of Bibles or Testaments, juvenile reading books, First-Day school books, tracts, and papers.  ","Walton emphasized the religious aspect of his work with African Americans, underscoring the belief that God called him to help the mentally, religiously, and financially impoverished children of Stevenson.  In his letter to the<em> Friends' Intelligencer,</em> Walton wrote that his work often caused him mental and physical hardship, arguing that hardship was necessary for fostering spiritual growth.  Walton also implored the <em>Friends' Intelligencer</em> readership to sacrifice for the sake of others, saying that religious work should not be confined to those with great ministerial gifts, but should be employed by all Christians.","Walton's sacrifice for the African American community in Stevenson, Alabama supports historian Edward Ayers' argument that those who took Christianity seriously recognized equality among believers and often developed a feeling of fellowship and tolerance towards others.  As Ayers argues that some people within churches tried to reach across racial divides, Walton broke through those divides by teaching the needy children of Alabama. Walton felt great tolerance and even love for his schoolchildren, as he perceived his work as a call from God to help the children plagued by injustice.  In addition, Walton's experience fulfills what historian Robert Handy calls the most significant development in evangelical volunteerism in the post-Civil War era: the growth of Sunday school work lead by lay teachers.  Walton's principal distinction was his expansion of this pattern of Sunday school teaching to African American children in Alabama.

McDowell's plow struck the side of a heavy object and he dug through the ground to discover a burnt clay sepulchre. He pulled a small portion of an arm out of the dirt and waited for a scientist to properly disinter the entire sepulchre. The sepulchre was a long slab, almost seven feet long and four feet wide and the underside held the complete cast of a human body. McDowell surmised that a people group in the distant past had buried the sepulchres in shallow graves, covered the bodies with clay, and piled wood upon them to consume them with fire. As a result, the burnt clay sepulchres became hardened slabs. McDowell found several similar sepulchres several years earlier when he first farmed his land in Macon  County, but he destroyed the relics through plowing his field. Initially, no Native American scholars trusted the authenticity of McDowell's discovery, as they did not believe Native Americans buried their dead in such a manner. Nevertheless, McDowell's discovery of the sepulchres in 1872 proved the validity of his find. ","McDowell acquired his Macon County land in 1821 after Cherokee Indian communities abandoned the region due to white American expansionism. In a letter to the Scientific American, McDowell emphasized the pleasure he experienced when he first acquired his own land, expressing the spirit of romance he felt when pioneering his small farm. McDowell greatly benefited from the removal of the Cherokee natives from North   Carolina and expressed great interest in their practices.","Historian Steven Conn argues that mid to late nineteenth-century historians developed interest in the study of prehistory and formed the belief that Native Americans were living examples of prehistory. The academic scholarship in late nineteenth-century America began to treat Native Americans as objects of anthropological science. However, the late nineteenth-century historical movement concurrently served to write Native Americans out of the romantic narrative of American history. Thus, Native Americans were treasured for their ability to provide glimpses into the deep American past and were simultaneously removed from the American historical future because of their inability to fit into the white majority's view of American identity. McDowell's story supports Conn's view of the dichotomous treatment of Native Americans. McDowell prized the importance of the Indian sepulchres he discovered, and yet, felt blessed by the land he acquired from the Cherokees' migration in the early eighteenth century. McDowell failed to recognize the dichotomy that existed between his passion for ancient Indian artifacts and the personal benefits he obtained through the oppression of Native Americans."],"display_date":"June 16, 1872","search_date":"1872-06-16","locations":[{"id":9598,"lat":35.237570606,"lng":-83.4949345538,"zoom":9,"place":"MACON, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2752,"title":"Emily Austin Endorses Industrial Education for African Americans\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-01-01","end_date":"1883-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the 1870's, Northerner Emily Austin founded the Austin School for African American children in Knoxville, Tennessee. When Austin moved into an African American neighborhood, the white community in Knoxville ostracized her for her work and the area in which she lived. While the community did not object to educating African Americans, they believed that only a very destitute and lowly woman would fraternize with blacks. Initially, Austin worked under the Freedman's Bureau, but when the Bureau was dissolved, she financed the school with personal funds and donations from northern friends. When the school became overcrowded, she erected a large schoolhouse, which she donated to the city, requiring that it always be used to educate African American students. In 1881, Austin grew to believe that she needed to reform her curriculum, as she believed that teaching the arts and sciences left the black students idle, thriftless, and contemptuous of work. Thus, Austin began to declare that industrial training was the only practical education for African Americans, because African Americans could only find employment in the industrial sector. She established industrial training for her students in the departments of sewing, gardening, domestics, and carpentry, but she faced much opposition from the students' parents. The African American parents opposed their children studying different subjects than white children. Austin continued to teach the industrial classes, but split the school day into sections of traditional teachings and industrial teachings.","Austin faced much difficulty in her profession, as both whites and blacks snubbed her for work. Austin said that her greatest difficulty was the African American opposition to her work, but she continued to educate her students because of her strong belief in the importance of industrial education for African Americans. Austin argued that African Americans held a great disadvantage in professional studies, making it impossible for them to compete with white students and gain professional positions. She also argued that education in the arts and sciences lead black students to despise manual labor. Thus, she argued that African Americans needed industrial training to convince them that good, honest work was the only way to make them good citizens. ","Historian Edward Ayers argues that the majority of educated African Americans in the South were limited to employment in manual labor because of their skin color. Ayers states that many educated African Americans despised manual labor, as they believed they were wasting their education if they accepted such work. This hatred explains Austin's belief that educated African Americans had grown to despise the only kind of labor they could acquire, leading her to assert the necessity of African American industrial teaching."],"display_date":"1881 - 1883","search_date":"1882-07-02","locations":[{"id":12158,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2763,"title":"Liberia and American Colonization Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-06-27","end_date":"1858-06-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After reading the works of John C.

Having slaves required added work and responsibility for slave holders that outweighed the benefits. It was her preference that all the slaves be freed and sent to Liberia.

They argued that being a slave holder was, in fact, an agonizing personal burden. The American Colonization Society said that not only was being a slave holder overly demanding, but simply freeing slaves was impossible.

The masked men took the accused and slaughtered each and every one of them. While the law enforcement had not yet decided whether to take action or not, blacks in the community felt the incident was critical enough to call a town meeting. They intended to discuss plans of a mass emigration from the South Carolina county in order to avoid further racial intimidation and discrimination.","At the end of the nineteenth century, race relations worsened as racial violence replaced efforts to harmonize blacks and whites in the South.

Most private mob lynchings, such as this one, actually got their victims from the law enforcement itself. In fact, over 80 percent of those lynched had previously been in police custody. Therefore, it was not extraordinarily unusual for a group of men to enter the jail and remove its inhabitants without question.

Though most of their neighbors were engaged in farming, twenty citizens of Athens, Georgia decided to break the mold. In January of 1849 they announced in the Athens <em>Southern Banner</em>, that they were joining together to form a new business: The Athens Manufacturing Company. In the announcement the company stated, [we] have associated ourselves together as a body corporate for the purpose of engaging in the business of manufacturing cotton and wool yarns and goods, and yarns and goods of which cotton and wool form component parts, and also of the manufacturing of flour and meal, and the repairing of machinery. ","The Athens Manufacturing Company was one of many new cotton-manufacturing companies established in Georgia during the 1840's. This sudden increase in industrialization was largely due to a series of developments over the early 1800's that came together to create a favorable environment for industry in Georgia. Manufacturing companies in Georgia were beginning to exist, but in 1849 they were still few and far between. It took a significant amount of money to start such a business and not many people could afford such a large investment. In the 1810's the change in national business law helped overcome this obstacle. Before this time, individuals or partners owned most businesses. This changed in the 1810's when the government began to recognize new corporate organizations that were composed of multiple investors. ","This group of investors was willing to take its chance at manufacturing but they needed a source of power for the machines they would use to make the cotton and wool products. During the 1820's, people in Georgia successfully harnessed waterpower, which became the source that provided the power for the Athens Manufacturing Company and other industrial businesses. In order to make a profit from the cotton and wool products, the Athens Manufacturing Company needed customers. Without a sufficiently-sized market such a company was not worth investing in; the number of buyers from Athens and the surrounding counties were not nearly enough to support the company. The rapid improvement of transportation systems across the nation in the early nineteenth century was responsible for increasing the size of markets, especially for inland companies such as this one. The Central Rail Road built in the 1830's provided an artery of transportation from central Georgia where Athens was located, to Savannah, an important national and international port on the Atlantic. ","Though Georgia was at the forefront of the textile industry in the South, the North had a significant head start and continued to dominate the national industry throughout the antebellum period. This regional disparity in strength caused political disagreements between the South and the North. This can be seen in looking at the increased tariff on foreign imported products in 1828, which was referred to in the South as the tariff of abominations. The tariff on foreign products was economically beneficial to American manufacturers, who were mainly found in the North, because overseas competition was decreased and they could raise prices. In the South most people were farmers, not manufacturers, and so the tariff was economically harmful because they had to pay more for manufactured goods. The increased price of manufactured products from the North was one source of motivation for the South to move from an almost entirely agricultural economy to a somewhat industrial one. The Athens Manufacturing Company provides an example of this change.

The Salisbury Truth article was composed of statements and facts gathered by a person who has given the subject a great deal of thought. The piece described how, with the help of modern machinery, one man and his two sons were able to complete work that had required 11,000 spinners only a few years ago, while another man was able to do the work of 50 weavers at once. Other machines had greatly affected the amount of labor needed to execute certain tasks, such as cotton printing machines, which had reduced hand labor by 1500 percent, and log sawing machines, which fostered the unemployment of 499 men out of 500. In the manufacturing of paper, the article reported that 95 percent of hand labor had been replaced, and by the use of machinery in loading and unloading ships, one man could do the work of 2000. "," While it is unknown whether these statistics are in fact correct, what they reveal is the profound effect mechanization had upon the South at this time. The author's wonder and admiration at the capabilities of this equipment was profound and sincere, and he predicted correctly that such devices would only improve in number and quality over time. In a society intensely focused on agriculture in particular, these machines were miraculous for the amount of time they saved and the efficiency in which they completed some of the most grueling and labor-intensive tasks. "," The effect these devices had on the South was profound. In previous decades, North Carolina had lagged behind other southern states in agricultural productivity and economic means; Mississippi and Alabama were the only states that ranked lower. However, from 1880-1900, textile manufacturing increased dramatically, along with the development of new railroads, highways, educational institutions, banks, and tobacco factories. These economic advancements were fairly unique to North Carolina compared with other southern states, claims historian Dwight Billings, making it known throughout the South for its progressiveness in the era of the Second Industrial Revolution. However, the effects of labor-saving machinery could be felt throughout the South, inspiring improvements in communication, transportation, and productivity. Those developments brought many rural people into Southern cities to work at mills and factories, and before long, a strong and substantial middle class had emerged.

He argued that instead of sending their daughters to large overgrown establishment outside of Athens, they should take advantage of the good teachers and schools available closer to home.  There are two advantages that this Old Citizen found in using the schools closer to home: it would keep the daughters at home and it would keep the money spent on education in the local economy.  ","The Old Citizen firmly believed that daughters should receive an education, just through different means than were popular at the time. Though his editorial implies that educating one's daughters was a common thing to do, he was writing to a specific audience who could afford to send their children away for private schooling. Though there was a push for the establishment of public education earlier, it would be six years before Georgia established a successful public schooling system.  Before 1858 almost all primary and secondary education took place in private schools or from private teachers.  The ability to pay for private teachers was limited to the upper classes, but sending children to boarding schools caused an additional burden because it prevented them from helping at home.","The advantage of keeping daughters at home is likely related to the important housework women performed.  In her book The Politics of Education in the New South, Rebecca Montgomery suggests a parallel between the position of women and the position of slaves in antebellum society.  She explains that legally both slaves and women were dependent on the patriarch.  In addition she draws parallels between the functions of the two groups.  While slaves did the hard labor in the fields, the women did the domestic work.  The importance of the woman's role in the house may have prevented people from wanting to send daughters away to school where they could not help at home and would not learn the domestic skills they would be expected to perform when they got married.  In addition the Old Citizen may have believed it better to keep daughters at home so that their morals could be guarded.  The patriarchal system centered in the home was the primary source of discipline and moral values in the antebellum South. ","This editorial also reflected on the economy of private education.  The Old Citizen wanted people to school their daughters in Athens so that the money they paid went back into the Athens economy.  This implies that there was an awareness of the value of the local economy in the antebellum South.  Though transportation systems were rapidly developing in the antebellum period, there was still a sense that keeping money at home, in the local economy, was a way to benefit one's community.  This was especially true in a developed urban area like Athens, which by the time of this editorial had been established for 67 years.  The city in 1852 had much to offer its citizens, largely due to its extensive manufacturing system."],"display_date":"January 8, 1852","search_date":"1852-01-08","locations":[{"id":1656,"lat":33.8831653504,"lng":-83.4095667489,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2808,"title":"Trains Fatally Wreck at Stone Creek\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-02-29","end_date":"1896-02-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of February 29, 1896, a Southern Railway passenger train wrecked on the Stone Creek bridge, outside of Macon, Georgia, sending the railcars and the bridge into the marshy ground 15 feet below. Minutes after, despite an attempt to warn it, a freight train following on the same line met the same fate. Three men died, while at least five people were seriously injured in the wreckage. In the ensuing investigation, detectives discovered that spikes and a portion of the rail were removed on the left side heading east. They attributed this offense to train robbers or train-wreckers.","What investigators later learned was that this was not simply an act of spontaneous delinquency, but a premeditated attack to set off an insurance scheme. Thomas Shaw and Warren E. Creswell were charged and sentenced to life in prison for causing the deadly accident. Their apparent motive was to collect insurance for the injuries to their wives that happened to be on board the train. Shaw's father convinced the two women to return from a shopping trip to Atlanta on the Southern Railway train because if we were to get hurt on the Macon, Dublin & Savannah Railroad we would get nothing for our injuries. If we got hurt on the Southern we will get pay, implying that he too knew of the plan. The elder Shaw was also arrested for his involvement, but the two women, who were oblivious to the scheme, were not.","With agriculture declining and industry rising after the Civil War, railroads were an economic success. Railroad lines expanded across the country and became the preferred mode of travel, allowing owners to profit greatly. However, they still had kinks. Accidents and crashes were common along railways. While they were not always the fault of the railroad itself, certain companies compensated injured victims in such a situation. This, along with their great prosperity at the time, made them an easy target.

On Wednesday, October 6, 1897, North Carolina Governor Daniel L. Russell dismissed Otho Wilson, the railroad commissioner, for conspiring with the Southern Railway Company to promote his own economic interest. Wilson did this by appealing to the railway company to stop at his hotel in order to increase the eating-house's business. According to Russell and the witnesses gathered by him to testify against Wilson, this had a negative impact on many businesses in Hickory, North Carolina, the stop that was replaced by Wilson's hotel. The town's only restaurant was forced to close when the train ceased stopping there. Others faced difficulties in transporting or receiving merchandise, and many were inconvenienced by the extra travel now required to reach the closest railroad station. Not only did the effect Wilson's actions had on the town of Hickory warrant his dismissal, but Russell argued that by placing himself under obligations not only to the Southern Railway Company it disqualified him to act as a fair, impartial judge and juror in any controversy that might arise between such corporations and individual citizens. "," A few years later on January 25, 1899, a group of people decided to contest this decision and wrote an appeal to Governor Russell asking for an explanation, as they felt Wilson's dismissal was unjust. Russell responded with a lengthy document that described Wilson's misdeeds and explained how severely he had affected the town of Hickory solely for his own monetary gain. Russell, the first Republican Governor of North Carolina since the end of Reconstruction and the last until 1973, was chastised relentlessly by the Democrats, who took Wilson's indictment for bribery, as well as that of Dr. Moss, the Chairman of the Commissioners of Vance County, to reflect personally upon Russel's legislature since he had originally appointed them to those positions. The Democrats argued that those officials' effects on North Carolina politics and the economies of local towns was unforgivable, and must be corrected with a new Democratic governor. "," This scenario reveals a great deal about both the importance of transportation in South at this time and the politics involved with that institution. At this time, the railroad was the most effective means of transportation throughout the South. As the railroad tracks quickly lengthened, so did the population and industry of places with train stations. Therefore, a railroad commissioner usually made decisions about stopping points with great deliberation because their impact on towns would be considerable, which explains why Wilson's crime was so grave. Also, since railroads were the primary mode of transportation, the politics surrounding them were intense, and as historian Leslie Decker claims, often involved conflicts between political and economic interests. This can be seen in Russell's dilemma and in the reasons cited by the Democrats for his incompetence.

Brookes sent a letter to his father from his plantation in Jasper and Jones counties, Georgia. In the letter he discussed many problems he was facing on the plantation.  The troubles he wrote about included having to postpone planting, having to buy animals and having to deal with a fire in a field that burned a fence. He began the letter by discussing a delivery of materials by wagon that he had to send back to the city of Madison in the neighboring county.  The address did not clearly state that he was the intended recipient.  One reason the wagon's return was such a setback to Walker was that, among other things, this delivery contained two sacks of salt.  At the time salt was not only a condiment to improve the flavor of food, but a key nutritional component and a preservative. Without enough salt, Walter's health and food supply could have endangered.","In his book Salt: A World History, Mark Kurlansky recognized that salt had been an important substance throughout history.  People first and foremost had a biological need for salt.  Beyond this, though, salt was important because without easy refrigeration techniques, salt was necessary to store meat for later or to send it to sell in other places. This made salt trade and production an important element in the American economy from its earliest years. ","During the American Revolution there had been a series of salt shortages assuring that people in the years following would not forget salt's importance or the difficulty of obtaining it.  After the revolution there was increased salt production in the United States, this biggest production coming out of New York and Virginia.  Still, most of the salt in the United States was being imported.  ","Salt became especially important in the Civil War.  According to Kurlansky it was not only arms that the Southern army lacked but also salt.  For soldiers on the move salt was essential.  It allowed them to carry meat with them and served as a disinfectant during wars. ","We know that the Brookes family was wealthy, and so their financial ability to obtain salt was probably greater than most people in the South.  Since salt had to be imported either internationally or from a few places in the United States it was difficult to come by for everyone.  The shipping confusion experienced by Walker Brookes demonstrates the imperfections that existed in the system of distributing goods over the South.  Walker could not count on receiving what he needed when he expected it to come.  Having to send back a shipment of salt was not a matter of life or death for Walker Brookes, but it still provided plenty of reason to complain."],"display_date":"January 25, 1848","search_date":"1848-01-25","locations":[{"id":1945,"lat":33.3203883365,"lng":-83.69013905,"zoom":9,"place":"JASPER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2820,"title":"The Gentlemen Here Are Very Polite.

She noted that the the gentlemen here are very polite and offer their horses and attendance to the women. However, Mary did not develop as fond of an opinion for Warrenton's women.  She expressed a specific dislike for a young woman by the name of Clara, whose social conduct she perceived as being distasteful, not only to herself but to others as well. At the first of two dances Mary attended while visiting, Clara, in one of her mischievous acts, put her head out an open window and mingled her 'snorings' with the sweet sounds of twilight dews.  To this, she said the gentlemen at the party burst out laughing and retreated to another room soon after.  As a visitor, she hoped that the gentlemen would not relate Clara's poor conduct to her. Mary concluded that Clara was as wild as an untamed deer and would hesitate at nothing for attention. Mary's account of Warrenton's social life only gives a glimpse at what Virginia social life was like at the time, though it does show that strict standards of social conduct were held.  While Mary's perceptions of Warrenton's men go along with the longstanding stereotype of the 'Virginia Gentlemen', her comments about Clara do not portray the stereotypical 'southern belle'. Clara irritated the social order, which is why Mary was so aware of her conduct and the men left the room shortly thereafter. In the antebellum South, women's actions were evaluated according to unique standards for each class, race, and gender.  Being that Mary and the others at the party were probably all within the same social class they would have had similar social standards.  When Clara did not adhere to these standards a conflict arose between her and the others, who were abiding to them. Clara's conduct could also be attributed to an unwillingness to conform to the rules of society, rather than a lack of social prowess.  Either way, Clara was acting outside the social norm expected for her class.

The President was passing through on his way to Jacksonville, Florida, and he had been expected for a couple days. But finally, on April 5, 1883, his train came through. The train pulled into the station, and while it was clearly an expensive and impressive presidential car, it was not very extravagant. The observation deck made it clear that it was for a prominent statesman. However, even though many people showed up to see him, the President did not get out of his car. He waved from the window, and was dressed well in a top hat and suit. He seemed in a cheerful mood since he smiled at the car from behind the window. The train continued on its way to Florida, and arrived there the next day. Yet it was a big day in Petersburg and many were excited to have caught a glimpse of the President. "," Chester Arthur was the Republican president from 1881-1885 as a result of the assassination of President James A. Garfield. In 1882 the presidency was in shambles, with cabinet positions still waiting to be filled. Corruption was rampant, and the President was restricted by his party and had little real power. Republicans did not do well in the Congressional elections of 1882, and in reaction to this, Arthur signed the Pendleton Reform Bill. This bill began to make some changes towards reform. It created a Civil Service Commission to administer new rules and it made appointments based on an examination. While these reforms were a good beginning, they were not enough. In the beginning of 1883, it was clear that Arthur's chances for winning re-election were slim. The political climate of 1883 was not positive for the President. In general there had been a decline in the prestige of the President in the 1870's and early 1880's as a result of massive corruption and unpopular policies, especially with Reconstruction in the South. Presidents of the late nineteenth century seemed to have no real purpose once they were elected. This lack of purpose gave few results within the government. However, it was clearly still an event to see the leader of the country, even in the South. He had a strong alliance with many in Virginia, including Governor William Mahone. Arthur was one of a string of lackluster Presidents in the postbellum period, yet even with his unimpressive performance, his arrival in town still brought excitement.

Augusta was near the plantation Iveson was managing for his son in Jasper and Jones counties.  We can tell from the letter that Iveson and P.B. were not particularly involved in each others' lives because P.B. took much of the letter to update Iveson about events in his family over the past few years. Despite this relatively weak relationship between the cousins, P.B. asked Iveson, would you act the part of a Father in watching over his morals. To P.B. extended family would be an important source of security for his son if he chose to move far away from his parents. ","This instance in the life of the Brookes shows that the family, and more specifically male patriarchs, was responsible for inculcating moral values. In addition, for Iveson to play the part of the father he would make sure that his nephew was kept in line and disciplined.  At other times and places different people and institutions held the important responsibility of keeping watch over the discipline and moral education. At this moment in the South, this responsibility was undergoing a shift from the church back toward the family.  Church records reflect that over the course of the 1830's churches were beginning to give up power to the family. They shifted pew organization from gender-segregated to family-friendly and reduced the amount that they disciplined their members.","In their book Paternalism in a Southern City, Edward Cashin and Glenn Eskew show how patriarchal power relates to and results from the plantation system and the Great Awakening. They argued that even outside of plantations themselves, southern society was based on the plantation system.  In this system it was the patriarch who was in control.  The plantation system allowed the man to stay at the house as a controlling figure. During this period in the North women were often left to manage the house while their husbands were at work.

Mr. Hill, it appeared, had inherited a Civil War era relic from his father, who had received it from a member of a troop of Michigan cavalry. The relic itself was an ornamental Bowieknife with a six-inch blade, horn handle, German silver mounted. The sheath is blue velvet, German silver tipped, and on the band encircling the top has been scratched with a pin point, in fine clerical hand: Col. J.M. Wood, Mississippi Tigers. The Michigan cavalryman apparently found the knife in Corinth, Mississippi following the evacuation of that city in May, 1862. ","The evacuation itself occurred on May 29 and 30. Although, according to historian Steven Nathaniel Dossman, Corinth was absolutely vital to the Confederate war effort, as it was the site of the junction of the Memphis and Charleston line with the Mobile and Ohio, the crucial chains that linked the confederacy together, General Beauregard saw no other alternative to withdrawal from the city; after a long, grueling siege which was made especially terrible due to lack food and clean water and had turned the surrounding area into what one soldier called the most Godforsaken country I ever saw, the Confederate General decided to spare what men he had left.","Beauregard took four days to plan and carry out the action. The first step was to notify his own troops to prepare to attack in order to confuse Federal intelligence reports. Then, through secret correspondences, he meticulously laid out his plan of withdrawal. Finally, on the night of May 29, under the guises of extra campfires, as much commotion as possible to sell the ruse [of imminent attack], and even an empty train [running] in and out of Corinth; complete with whistles, bands, and cheers to make it appear large numbers of reinforcements had arrived, Beauregard completed his move out of Corinth. Having to move his men out of the area under Beauregard's very particular commands all while maintaining an air of secrecy, Colonel Wood clearly had other things on his mind than his knife; as it was found simply upon the camp ground, Colonel Wood most likely misplaced or forgot it during all the commotion. ","Thirty-seven years later, he [or his family] finally received his knife back [perhaps]. Although war relics are usually given very serious sentimental value, this particular find seemed to have no value to the finder and clearly was not seriously important to E.B. Hill. Therefore, it is fitting that Colonel Wood or his family should receive this piece of their personal history back. Furthermore, this respectful action by Mr. Hill is representative of larger efforts, still ongoing in the 1890s, to heal wounds between the North and South; relics are usually kept as a reminder of the enemy and the battle, but here it was returned in order to, in some small, individual way, erase the line between enemies and, as may have been hoped by E.B.

In 1857, however, Harriet was over twenty-seven years old and still had been not granted her freedom by Nelson's son, nor did she believe that he ever intended to restore her to her freedom unless compelled by legal process. Harriet decided to sue for her freedom, along with her brothers (who were manumitted at age thirty-one) and sisters.","Manumission, or a master setting his/her slaves free, was a fairly common practice in the early nineteenth century, when slavery was a burning moral and political issue. According to historian Lucille Griffith, many southerners wrestled with the immoral or uneconomical repercussions of slavery. One way that slave holders rectified their internal turmoil was by setting some of all of his/her slaves free in his/her will. Unfortunately, this act of goodwill required surviving members of the slave holder's family to carry out his/her wishes. In Harriet's case, the surviving member was unwilling. This stubbornness on the part of Nelson's son was not uncommon, but what is unusual about Harriet's case is that she had a case at all.

Furthermore, next to each slave's name he wrote descriptions. Not physical descriptions but personality traits. Manigault deemed Jacob smart and intelligent and Plato he thought to be good and trusty; however, his praises stopped with Young John when he described him as lazy and Moses as slow and complaining. Manigault commented on his slaves' characters and personalities, not just their working abilities. He called Bob slow, honest, good. These traits have very little to do with work ethic and mostly with character."," It's not personal, it's business has become a mantra for much of the twentieth-century corporate world. Slave owners in the early nineteenth century, however, did not have the luxury of making that distinction because they were dealing with inherently personal things: humans. Charles Manigault displayed this fascinating balance between humanity and business in many of the records he kept of his plantation, as seen in these records. Slaveholders all had to navigate between the fact that their slaves were human and the fact that they were possessions. Many slaveholders did so by recognizing families and marriages within the plantation, by giving slaves measured freedom during their few days off, and by acknowledging such humanizing characteristics such as temperament and work ethic. Slaveholders did, however, repress this humanity in their slaves. They did so through whippings and constant verbal reminders to their slaves of their enslavement, and very few slaveholders to take familial ties into account when contemplating whether or not to sell a slave. "," This repression of enslaved people's humanity had two purposes. The first purpose was to keep slaves enslaved. By constantly suppressing their humanity and treating them as objects, many slaves learned to act as such, at least towards their masters. This deference and servility most likely made the day to day operations of the plantation far easier. The second purpose of the repression of humanity was for slaveholders' own consciences. Had slaveholders dwelled on the humanity of those people whom they were forcibly enslaving, slavery would not have continued. Instead slaveholders reduced their slaves to only partly human, seeing them as children they had to care for not humans they were enslaving. "," This paradox of understanding slaves' humanity as well as treating them as possessions applied to every slaveholder as well as to many non slaveholders who upheld this system of slavery and paternalism.

And on November 1, 1860, Charleston celebrated a huge commercial step forward with the completion of the Savannah-Charleston railroad. The Charleston News and Courier commemorated the event with a lengthy history of the founding of Georgia and the opportunities the new line would bring economically for both states, boasting, For a new road it exhibits remarkable excellencies, and for its distance and cost it may challenge comparison with any road, European or American, within a maritime belt or region of country.","Accounts like this aside, historians vary between glass-half-full and glass-half-empty views of Charleston's status as an economic center in the antebellum South. Historian Ernest M. Lander, Jr., adopts the former view and concludes that Charleston was the industrial center of South Carolina in 1860, reaching a peak in 1856 of 3,000,000 in industrial production. However, his optimistic outlook is tempered in his conclusion, which notes that capital was limited, Northern competition fierce, and fires between 1856 and 1861 destroyed several promising factories. Historian Leonard Stavisky, in contrast, adopts an overall more pessimistic stance, contending that the plantation system, with its reliance on slave labor, kept an otherwise strategically positioned Charleston from achieving optimal levels of industrialization. ","Regardless of whether or not Charleston was one of the principal industrial centers in the South, this episode-and the reaction by the News and Courier-serves to illustrate the dominance of one particular economic variable in Southern life-trade-and the attempts of Southerners to use it to strengthen their economy. Indeed, as historian R.S. Cotterill notes, Time was when Charleston had been the social and industrial center of the south, but its glory had long since departed...Charleston was not ignorant of the cause of the decline, and set herself to the task of reviving her commerce by diverting western trade from New Orleans to herself. The surest way to divert western trade was to join the flurry of railroad construction occurring nationwide during the mid-nineteenth century."],"display_date":"November 1, 1860","search_date":"1860-11-01","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2924,"title":"Imposition of Colonization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-08-01","end_date":"1839-08-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["At the passing of John R. Rix of Raleigh, NC, eighteen of his slaves were freed from bondage on the condition that they boarded a ship sailing from Norfolk, VA to the west coast of Africa. One of the eighteen took a stand against these terms, and was resold into slavery. The idea for the resettlement of blacks in Africa began as a way for whites to rid themselves of African American presence to counterbalance ever increasing numbers of free blacks living on American soil. The public image that organizations such as the American Colonization Society presented was one of compassion and of Christian values. Soon it became clear that although there were pockets of blacks who looked positively on the idea of colonization, there were a great many others who questioned the professed philanthropy of its [white] promoters. Blacks who did support the movement often did so only when they decided whites would never allow them to claim full and equal citizenship. Many states, including Virginia, had instituted laws forcing freed slaves to exit the state; Furthermore, Georgia had created a system set on deterring blacks from immigrating to their state by giving free blacks the option of a 500 entrance fee or sale into slavery. ","It quickly became clear that Christian benevolence toward a debased and oppressed race was not the driving force for the movement, but rather a deep-seeded White fear of the growing free black population. John Rix's terms of manumission were not unique. The Colored American, a New York City-based African American newspaper, reported seven other conditionally freed slaves that were to join these seventeen on the ship Saluda, bound for Africa. The Norfolk Harbor was a microcosm of a nationally growing trend at this time. From 1820-1830, 1430 blacks boarded ships such as the Saluda bound for Liberia. In 1832 alone, that number rose to 1037-247 of which were manumitted under the condition of emigration. In this Land of the Free, the free people of color across the country were being pressured to leave their native soil.

It was the first steam ferry offering service across the Chesapeake, able to complete the trip in a mere five minutes, a feat that at the time was remarkably fast. Previously, ferries were man-powered or run by a blind mule or horse turning paddles by treadmill. The editors of The <em>Norfolk Herald</em> volunteered their confidence that this endeavor was certain to garner a good deal of wealth for its investors who were providing a much needed service to the Norfolk community.","This adoption of steam technology in the Norfolk harbor was quite delayed in comparison to the rest of the Unites States. By 1817, ten steam ships had been commissioned to run between New York and Albany, and steamboats were coming to be a common sight on the Delaware, Ohio, and Mississippi rivers. By the time the Gosport finally arrived in Norfolk, steam technology was already being included in plans for mass transit and exchange across the Atlantic. The Englishman John McGregor wrote a two volume work describing the great benefit to be made in creating a system of exchange using the new steamboat technology, focused largely on utilizing the vast resources provided by American land. Named in honor of that part of the Tidewater area where the navy shipyard is located, the Gosport was part of a larger movement attributable to the invention of the steam engine, which enabled not only the use of steam to power boats, but also the establishment of a national network of railways. The high pressure steam engine, developed in the early 1800s, not only enabled more expedient travel, but also aided industrialization in the North and the growth of sawmills, especially in the lower Mississippi Valley region. These innovations in effect brought the States closer geographically, and helped to fuel both local and national commerce.

At least, this was true in Georgia in 1828. On May 19, 1828 the Argus, a newspaper in Savannah, printed an extract of a letter from a member of Congress, to the Editor. In this letter the politician explained that the mood in Washington was changing in favor of removal of the Native Americans currently living where they had been for a long time on some of the richest land in the heart of Georgia. The Congressman refers to our Indian difficulties and the perplexities of Indians within [Georgia's] boundaries. The words difficulties and perplexities make the Indians sound more like pesky flies than anything else, though they had been on that land far longer than the white Americans had been."," White Georgians did not just take issue with the fact that the Native Americans occupied some of the best cotton soil in the state. Though this fact bothered them, they were far more disconcerted by some of the implications of this occupation. The United States Government had, until this point, attempted to treat the Native Americans as a separate nation. (Whether or not the government actually believed that they were a separate nation is another question.) Because the government signed treaties with the Native Americans and recognized them as separate nations, they were raising the Native Americans up to an equal footing with white males, thus destroying the idea that only white males could enjoy the full rights and privileges offered by the government. By implication, therefore, African Americans should be freed and be allowed to vote, and women should likewise be allowed to cast a ballot. Native American presence in Georgia, therefore threatened the social system that the South rested on. Furthermore, Native American territories offered a convenient place for runaway slaves to hide, thus undermining white supremacy even more. "," The government further encouraged Georgian support of Native American removal by promising to distribute the land to white Georgian farmers by lottery. This guarantee ensured near universal support from white males in Georgia. The possibility of good cotton growing land combined with the reestablishment of white supremacy proved altogether too powerful. Public opinion in Georgia forced Georgia politicians to make Indian Removal a priority in their campaigns and tenures in office, as this letter from Congress clearly demonstrates. In the North, many were opposed to Jackson's proposal. The most vocal groups, religious groups, eventually evolved into abolitionist organizations. Angelina Grimke, before becoming a Quaker or an abolitionist, focused many of her early energies on opposing the Indian Removal Bill. This evolution, though unknown to Georgians in the late 1820s and 1830s, underscores the corollary between Indian rights and African American rights.

A trip from Richmond to Tappahannock was available, as well as from Tappahannock to Baltimore (and the return travels). The proprietors stated that passengers have uniformly expressed themselves delighted with the line, in an attempt to attract new travelers. The stage coast was 3.50 plus eight cents per mile."," Traveling in the 1820s was not always an easy task, especially during the winters when roads were snowed over. Railroads in the area would not be completely finished until the late 1830s, and even then travel on rail would be limited to the emerging tracks, thus the Richmond and Baltimore Union Line served a very important and practical purpose. The only other form of transportation was by foot or by horse on one's own, which had many dangers. Across the South traveling by coach or steamboat would prove to be a valuable way to transport oneself and one's goods. This ad, however, seems to focus less on the practicality of this form of transportation and more on the luxury and convenience of the travel, as opposed to the necessity of movement across the state of Virginia and into Maryland. Fare was relatively low, but with the mileage could add up to a sum many people of the city did not have to spare on luxurious travel. This line of stages and steamboats was most likely intended for the middle to upper class of society in Richmond. "," The emphasis of no night travel on land is interesting, as it leads to the thought that this travel, across largely uninhabited terrain, would be considered unsafe. The proprietors wanted to emphasize taking a legitimate form of transportation as opposed to one traveling alone, whether on horseback or foot, through dangerous grounds."],"display_date":"October 20, 1829","search_date":"1829-10-20","locations":[{"id":13913,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2981,"title":"The Implications of Racist Railroad Policies\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-01-01","end_date":"1851-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Macon and Western Railroad adopted a new policy in 1851 which prohibited all black people, regardless of their freed or enslaved status, from boarding any train unless they could prove the legitimacy of their travel. All African Americans had to have a written pass issued by the individual's owner or trustee. The office and the conductor both required a copy of it, and if the office was not familiar with the signature, the owner or trustee had to physically present themselves and prove that they had 'lawful control' over the individual.","Although Macon and Western specifically announced that they would enforce this policy, the practice of requiring blacks to have a pass was commonplace even off of the railroad. African Americans traveling without one were often arrested under the presumption that they were runaway slaves, and then bore the burden of proving that they were free or otherwise behaving lawfully.","The apparent purpose of the law was to deter slaves from running away and to catch those that were foolish enough to do so. Very few runaway slaves, however, actually attempted to use the railroads as a mode of transportation. If they did, they had to disguise themselves or successfully forge a pass in order to avoid being caught. Apprehended runaway slaves were severely punished and sometimes killed or sold to planters in the Deep South, where plantation conditions were even worse and escaping was nearly impossible. Because of the difficulties and risks involved, runaway slaves more frequently utilized hiding spaces in wagons, boats, and ships. Much of the traveling was done on foot through unpopulated fields and mountains where the risk of apprehension was lower.","The railroad companies and slaveholders were aware of this, and so it is likely that the real purpose of this policy was to deter free blacks from staying in the South, where their rights were severely limited and their freedom often questioned. Slave catchers were heavily compensated for capturing runaway slaves, and would often apprehend free blacks and even sell them back into slavery for the monetary rewards. As a result, the free blacks who did remain in the southern states lived mainly in the cities, where the African American populations were larger and did not stand out as much."],"display_date":1851,"search_date":"1851-07-02","locations":[{"id":2029,"lat":32.4032480074,"lng":-84.0905609682,"zoom":10,"place":"MACON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2990,"title":"An Unpredictable Mail System\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-07-14","end_date":"1835-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James L.

He reported that he had expected to receive a letter from her while in Monroe, Georgia but after waiting there longer than he intended, he still had not heard from her. Not wanting the imperfections of the mail system to interfere with his plans, he left for Augusta and asked the postmaster to forward him the letter at his next destination.

During the antebellum period, as in other times during United States history, there was much disagreement about how strong the government should be. In the South, the Democratic Party pushed for decreased involvement of the government.

These developments included the postal service itself as well as the railroads, roads and canals that facilitated the ease and efficiency of sending mail. The slow and unpredictable postal system that was experienced by James Stratton in 1835 was in part a result of the reluctance of Americans, in particular southerners, to put enough power in the hands of the government that it could fund and create efficient and effective infrastructure systems."],"display_date":"July 14, 1835","search_date":"1835-07-14","locations":[{"id":2188,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3004,"title":"Jane\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1828-07-14","end_date":"1828-09-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["P. Wiltberger, while sitting at breakfast one morning, was interrupted by his overseer. The overseer angrily informed Wiltberger that Jane, one of Wiltberger's slaves, was missing. Other slaves were being questioned but so far, the overseer could find out nothing. Incensed, Wiltberger questioned his slaves further, but to no avail. He then picked up his pen and proceeded to write an advertisement to the Argus, the Savannah newspaper, calling on all whites to help him regain his property. He offered a 50 reward for the capture of his slave. He described her as a Mulatto Female Slave, named JANE, about eighteen years of age-5 feet two or three inches high-stout and well made-a pleasing and intelligent countenance-long jet black hair. The ad first appeared on July 14, and two months later, was still being printed in every issue of the newspaper. "," Wiltberger's description of Jane does a great deal to reveal why Jane had been successful in evading capture thus far. First, he described her as mulatto meaning that she had lighter skin than most enslaved people. Often, potential slave buyers were hesitant to buy lighter skinned slaves because they had a better chance of successfully escaping. Also, once away, a lighter skinned African American would have a better chance of blending into white society. Wiltberger's ad and the length of time it stayed in the newspaper, both demonstrate the basis on which these fears were founded. Wiltberger also described her as having a pleasing and intelligent countenance. Because many white southerners associated whiteness with intelligence and blackness with ignorance, lighter skinned slaves proved more of a liability and a threat to slaveholders because they were thought to be more intelligent and thus more able to run away."," One of a slaveholder's biggest concerns when debating whether or not to buy a slave was if that slave would run away or not. Many For Sale ads in newspapers made a point of stating that the slave being advertised would never run away. This emphasis shows what a huge issue it was in slave society and the lengths to which a slaveholder would go to in order to regain his property. Jane might not have been perceived as such a huge liability initially, however, because of her gender. Seventy-five percent of runaways were male, simply because female slaves gave birth and had the responsibilities of motherhood so early in life. Jane, at age 18, might already have had children that she was abandoning in her bid for freedom. Her gender also, no doubt, helped in her success because a black woman was perceived as far less of a threat than a black man in the South; therefore, she would likely have had an easier time blending into a crowd. Unfortunately, it is impossible to know whether Jane got away, or whether Wiltberger's ad succeeded.

An anonymous man wrote a letter to the editor of <em>The Argus</em> in the summer of 1828, and in his etter he clearly demonstrated his inherent mistrust of outsiders. This man owned a boarding house and was writing to the paper in search of a solution to a problem he had run into with one of his boarders-a Yankee. This Yankee had requested that the boarding house owner post a large packet of letters to Blossomdale, Vermont, free of charge. The boarding house owner wrote, Now, Mr. Printer, can you tell me where Blossomdale village is, and how I am to get these letters there, without paying postage? Is it on this earth, or in the West Indies, or that Moon? Obviously flummoxed, this boarding house owner allowed his previous misconceptions about Yankees (or, in his mind, the others) to turn this situation into a huge, public ordeal as opposed to a small matter between a boarder and the boarding house owner. Southerners were trained from a young age to mistrust those from outside of the South, particularly northerners. An algebra book used widely in the South included problems where southern students were asked to calculate the speeds of two different Yankee soldiers running away from battle, and the profit a Yankee trader made on selling bad pork. Inculcated early with this mistrust, it is little wonder that the boarding house owner acted as he did. These fears and misunderstandings grew through the subsequent thirty years and exacerbated the escalating conflict between North and South, to the point that, by the early 1860s, some southerners saw themselves as a separate race from northerners. They saw the differences in race between northerners and southerners not as biological factors but factors inherent in their characters. This idea of separate races clearly stemmed from the misguided fears of southerners so inherent in southern society."],"display_date":"December 1, 1827 - June 6, 1828","search_date":"1828-03-03","locations":[{"id":1628,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3029,"title":"Railroads; the new form of transportation in the South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-07-23","end_date":"1896-09-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Newspapers, like the Portsmouth Star were filled with railroad advertisements displaying the price and rates for which a passenger could travel from Portsmouth to Virginia Beach, Petersburg, Philadelphia, and even New York with no more than a day of travel for even the farther distances. A company called the Bay Line and Pennsylvania railroad offered to take people in Norfolk to the Niagara Falls for 14 dollars in the Norfolk Virginian, thus expanding the number of places that Southerners could easily visit. This was a new mode of transportation that had revolutionized the pace and manner that southerners conducted their lives. Railroad rates although more expensive than steamboat fare was faster, more efficient, and did not rely on weather, water levels, or other uncontrollable circumstances to operate. In addition, railroads made hard to travel geographic areas much more accessible. For example, there was a fall line stretching from Virginia to Mississippi where the rivers were easy to navigate, but above that fall line the rivers were not navigable according to William Cooper, therefore railroads would enable travel above that fall line. Railroads not only transported people, but also goods. Goods such as cotton tobacco, lumber, cattle coal, and oil became more readily available to regions that did not produce these and also economically expanded these industries. Central Virginia had several major tobacco producing counties such as Prince Edward in the state that was one of the leading tobacco manufacturers, so the railway system was truly to its benefit. ","According to Cooper, the southern railroad tracks more than tripled from the 1880's to the 1890's. By 1890, there were more than 300 companies. However, there was a downside for railroad owners. Mostly rural and agricultural, the southern railroads had peak times of good transportation such as crop harvest periods, but all other times of the year saw little demand. Since railroads connected to so many places, it soon became an enormous industry and became one of the first big business industries of the South. The larger railroad companies soon became big influences in politics and railways leaders, like J.P. Morgan who constructed the Southern Railway became big names both in the industry and in politics. The railroad was an essential for shippers and farmers in the south, and often the monopolistic railroad companies took advantage of this and charged exceedingly high rates. There was rising tension between the two groups, and this tension shifted into politics, and many called for the railroads to be transferred to public ownership. Despite the political turmoil, the railways made the South more accessible and brought it into the national economy successfully."],"display_date":"July 23, 1891 - September 1, 1896","search_date":"1894-02-10","locations":[{"id":14412,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3051,"title":"Fleeing Louisiana on a Steamboat\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-01","end_date":"1862-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the middle of the night Richard, the Fearn's son, awoke his parents to tell them that New Orleans had fallen to the Yankees.

In the panic to depart, Mrs. Fearn was too distraught. She could barely think clearly of things that she needed to bring with her. Thankfully, her slaves were of a more secure mindset. They packed all the essentials the family would need. Richard departed to return to the army and the Fearns went to Donaldsville to board their steamboat. Eighteen slaves accompanied them. That morning the Mississippi River was full of distressed Southerners fleeing from their homes to become refugees. ","When federal troops seized southern Louisiana in 1862 many white Louisianans fled to avoid Union occupation. Many who left southern Louisiana first went to northern Louisiana before they headed to Mississippi, or more likely, Texas. It was common to take along a few of the most prized slaves during flight. These refugees faced terrible conditions. First and foremost, leaving their homes and knowing that Union soldiers would take advantage of their possessions caused great psychological distress for fleeing Confederates. As city populations began to swell with the incoming refugees, resources like food and medicine, became harder and harder to come by. ","As a result of this chaos, refugee masters often lost much control over their slaves. Like their masters, slaves' lives were also turned upside down. Slave families were separated at higher rates because refugee masters only took those that were absolutely necessary. Everyday plantation life allowed the master to take on a role of extreme power, which was undermined while fleeing.

Mallory, John Farlow, Percy Donaldson, and other members of the club, the B.Y.C. is holding a regatta and cruise from June 23 to June 30. The social gathering will include the Philadelphia and Corinthian Yacht Club of Philadelphia. Getting ready for the event, many members are already sending their yachts to the clubhouse. Mr. Mallory sent his 25 foot, 35 pounds papier mache shell that was stationed at the University of Pennsylvania to the boat house. The growth of the Baltimore Yacht Club helped to garner the attention of many social elites in the area and abroad. Indicative of this is addition of Mon. Commines de Masilly as a member. Mon. Masilly was the first secretary of the French embassy in Washington D.C., and to commemorate his membership, he purchased a new steam launch.","The regatta, cruises, and luncheons held during that particular week will dominate Baltimore, Maryland. This is due mostly to the growth of the sport of yachting in America. Although organized yachting in America began with the founding of the New York Yacht Club in 1884 and continued with the establishment of such clubs as the Boston Yacht Club (1865), Chicago Yacht Club (1875), and the Larchmont Yacht Club (1880), it was not until 1885 that the Chesapeake Yacht Club on the eastern shore [was founded]. It is increasingly evident, that yachting was a Northern sport until the founding the Chesapeake Yacht Club nearly 20 years later. Yacht clubs, serve as a very important social outlet. Though, participating was reserved for the aristocratic members of society, the club served a socializing function for its ability to bring people together and experience a race on the river on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The club was intended for fellowship and discussion, and admission was reserved for the well off of society. Members would attend the clubhouse for drinks and conversation with fellow yachters or owners of other marine vessels, and discuss matters of the day before taking the family out for lunch aboard the boat. Besides functioning a social and familial role, yacht clubs were means of recreation. Similar to parks, or baseball teams, yacht clubs were competitive. Mr. Mallory bought a new engine, boiler, shaft, and deed and air pump, for one of his ships, solely for this specific event. Winning has a strong correlation to honor, thus owners were not shy in contributing money if it was attributed to their individual reputation, and the reputation of the club.

","Sometime thereafter, Captain John Bourke and Professor Painter of the Indian Rights Association located a tract of land in North Carolina of about 10,000 acres. Cherokees owned the land and 2,000 members of the Cherokee tribe lived on it, but they were willing to sell it to the Indian Rights Association. All that stood in the way of Geronimo and his tribe moving to their reservation was the approval of the Secretary of War.

Lewis Boyd, a black man, hopped up into the car to help unload the flour. As he removed the sacks of flour from the car, he happened to throw some of them to the ground. Conductor Shell reprimanded Boyd for his carelessness and Boyd took great offense. Boyd began to mutter and to curse the conductor out loud. Shell immediately responded, telling Boyd to stop. At this, Boyd snapped and he jumped onto Shell from the train car, hitting him on the head with a large stone. As Shell fell to the ground, Boyd hit him again and began kicking him. Other men working on the train rushed to the scene and restrained him. Boyd, seeing how badly Shell was hurt, ran for a nearby swampy area. However, the trainmen gave chase and brought him back. ","Meanwhile, word spread of what had happened. As Boyd was apprehended and brought back to town, a mob assembled, ready to kill Boyd for what he had done. The trainmen averted a lynching by hurrying Boyd off to the judge in Rogersville, who promptly threw Boyd in jail. At his trial, Boyd claimed Shell was the cause of the incident, that his actions were provoked. ","As railroads spread across the country in the period after the Civil War, they did more than just move goods for commerce from one place to another. They allowed people to move in, out, and around the south to a much greater degree than ever before. Thus, there were more unfamiliar faces- white and black- in towns where the railroad came. We don?t know if Boyd knew Shell personally, but it seems unlikely given the immediate hostility that arose between them on the day of the incident and given Boyd?s extreme actions. Historians have pointed out that these new social situations called for a more complex level of interaction than both white people and black people had been used to in the antebellum period. Indeed, race relations in these urban areas with people coming in and out were more impersonal and confrontational; thus a situation in which a railroad worker insulted a conductor and then attacked and severely injured him would be more likely to occur.

He began by saying that although South Carolina held an advantage over other areas in rich natural resources, these resources had not been taken advantage of to their full extent, and little interaction occurred within the state's different regions. The author of the letter stated his opinion that it was imperative that the state improve the condition of its roads and rivers. Although clearly these projects would be expensive, it would be well worth the high costs to decrease transportation costs and risks to horses, drivers, and health."," The newspaper letter expressed several suggestions for the state and the citizens as to specific internal improvements for South Carolina. The first was to consult with a state engineer and complete several surveys of the roadways for the purpose of improving passageways from Camden to Charleston. The second suggestion was for the improvement of the river systems so it would be possible for a steam boat to navigate the waterways from Camden to Charleston at any time of year without danger. However, the author also warned that the citizens of South Carolina should not expect much in the form of financial aid from the state or federal government. His reasoning behind this was that the district's representatives only made up a small proportion of the community, the legislature only met for three short weeks each year, and similar requests in the past had been ignored. Such required improvements might therefore need to be financed by town corporations, with the hopes that the state legislature would reimburse them at a later point."," Throughout the antebellum period South Carolina was the target of many different policies of internal improvement because of its economic and agricultural value to the union. According to historian John Conger the state was blessed with a natural expanse of waterways, but massive amounts of funding were needed to better organize the water routes for use in transportation and trading. The state never received the necessary federal funding for such projects because the mountains to the west and northwest made improvements difficult and kept South Carolina isolated from trade with her neighboring states, effectively discouraging the federal government from allocating funds to the state. Frustrations from the lack of funding for internal improvements eventually grew into frustrations with national tariffs because the civilians of South Carolina claimed they never received the same benefits from surplus government revenue as other states in the union."],"display_date":"June 6, 1818","search_date":"1818-06-06","locations":[{"id":11550,"lat":34.3452377501,"lng":-80.5785175162,"zoom":9,"place":"KERSHAW, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3108,"title":"Shall We Unite?

Kean, division still belied his society. In seeking those similarities which connect the North with the South, Kean made a poignant point, asking readers of the People's Party Paper to recall those 23 New York Unknown who similarly left their homes with the kisses of their mother still on their brows. He writes, What happened in New York had its counterpart in Georgia. We take a delight in fixing the graves, be it either '23 New York, Unknown,' or '3 Mississippi, Unknown' for in the beautiful strain of Osian 'It is the memory of joys that are past and gone, sweet and mournful to the soul.' Kean suggested that by putting to rest those divisions between the North and South, the South was better able to welcome the West and usher it into a new era of American history. At one point, he writes Shall we submit longer? The crisis is now at hand; shall we unite with the West? The union is offered; if we choose we can accept. The West and South are both agricultural countries. Let us accept this union and thereby declare that our actions speaking for us declare our intentions are to unite with the West. This country will be happy when it recognizes 'no North, no South, no East, no West, but loves with equal tenderness both sections and trusts. Georgia alike with Kansas.' ","It is difficult to ascertain how unique Kean was in his sentiments. How many other readers of the People's Party Paper sought a unified national identity decades after war ravaged families and communities in both the North and South? Kean mentions the community's commemoration of the 23 New York Unknown. The many battlefields and memorials like this one which dapple the space above and below the Mason Dixon Line testify not only to the devastation of the period and the subsequent need to memorialize the experience, but also to the regional identities which formed as a result of it. Just 27 years earlier, the turmoil of the Civil War ravaged the country, simultaneously confusing national and southern identity. Like Kean, many individuals questioned how the nation would be able to incorporate the West when it was simultaneously struggling to throw off the yoke of war and the fractious identities which had formed as a result of it and Reconstruction.","The loss of over 620,000 lives during the course of the Civil War far exceeded any previous American engagement. Fathers, brothers, lovers, and friends were lost and indelible and scarring experiences assumed their place, ensuring that masses of families and communities on both sides of the divide would live the aftershocks of the Civil War for decades later. The reverberations from this dramatic loss would also echo in social, political, and economic spheres as America strove to develop a cohesive identity amongst its growing pains in the late nineteenth-century. With the 1892 establishment of Ellis Island in New York as the main hub for immigrant processing and the subsequent need to expand, new questions of identity and inclusion were bound to arise. Specifically, the settlement of the West presented yet another challenge to Southern identity and unity. Kean's letter is evidence of at least some Southern support for inclusion and unity, but the well-documented racial and ethnic tension which developed at the same time point towards an equally-passionate opposition."],"display_date":"April 12, 1892","search_date":"1892-04-12","locations":[{"id":1823,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3138,"title":"Texas slaves escape to Mexico\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1861-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While slavery did not exist as early in Texas as in other states such as Virginia and the Carolinas, it still played an important role in the economy and history of Texas. In fact, by the time of the Civil War, slavery was as strongly established in Texas, the newest slave state, as it was in the oldest slave state in the Union.  One slave, James Boyd, was 107 years old when he was interviewed in 1937 in Itasca, Texas. Boyd recalled his hardships of being a slave vividly. While he was not treated awfully, he acknowledged that slaves were treated very poorly and no rights whatsoever. In fact, two of his white owners once whipped two black women to death and never received any repercussions. Boyd realized that as a slave he had no rights or legitimacy under the law as they did not have a jail because, they didn't go to the trouble and expense of buildin' nigger jails. They just whipped us when they wanted to. Under these conditions, it is no wonder that most slaves desired freedom and some attempted to attain it."," Although slavery was such an institutional stronghold, many slaves continually tried to escape to nearby Mexico. Boyd notes that many Texan slaves did run off and try to go north... most in general 'round our part of the country, iffen a nigger want to run away, he'd light out for old Mexico. Crossing the Mexican-Texas border provided instant freedom for the slaves, and, therefore, many slaves would attempt escape for salvation. The Mexican government welcomed the runaways as a way to weaken the slave institution in Texas and potentially deter further territorial assaults by the United States. In fact, so many slaves attempted escape that the congress of the republic passed a law to promote capturing runaways. Promoting the capture of runaways was not only an attempt to stifle the Mexico runaway trend, but also an attempt to counter Mexico's encouragement. Despite the escape of at least three thousand slaves to Mexico by 1851, slavery as an institution was not threatened and it continued to be as important in Texas as it was to the rest of the United States."],"display_date":"1850 - 1861","search_date":"1856-01-01","locations":[{"id":12881,"lat":31.198494943,"lng":-95.2644293385,"zoom":8,"place":"HOUSTON, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3159,"title":"New Pastor at St. Patrick&#39;s\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-02-01","end_date":"1889-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Bittersweet best characterized the attitude of his beloved congregation. Though greatly appreciative of the 15 years he spent in Washington, Georgia, the congregation of St. Patrick's deeply regretted the transfer of Reverend J. M. O'Brien to his new parish in Augusta County. Thankfully, his former congregation will not be devoid of his influence despite his physical absence. The fruits of his work - evident in the boy's orphanage and the Academy of St. Joseph - stand as testaments to his good deeds while in Washington. To demonstrate their appreciation for O'Brien and his tremendous work and religious guidance, his congregation presented him with a very handsome watch one Wednesday evening. Furthermore, Reverend Bishop Becker, formerly of Savannah, the man who was assuming O'Brien's position at St. Patrick's, blessed and dedicated the new church bell in O'Brien's honor.","While at St. Patrick's, O'Brien was tireless in his efforts to raise the standard of devotion and outreach in the county. Almost immediately after his arrival in 1874, O'Brien assumed control over the recently relocated boy's orphanage. Furthermore and perhaps more importantly, his religious zeal and moral uprightness rejuvenated the conditions of Catholic faith in the county from its original dire depths. Apparently, O'Brien arrived at a time when Catholicity was at a low ebb and prejudice strong. Unfortunately, the bell dedicated in Father O'Brien's name no longer rings. Its station atop St. Patrick's has long ceased to exist. However, his efforts to raise moral and religious zeal among the Catholic population in Washington as well as his contributions to social outreach at the time remain greatly influential."," The reputation of the South as the Bible Belt, the strong hold of American evangelical Christianity, may have some merit. Though Father O'Brien attempted and, to some extent, succeeded in rejuvenating the Catholic population in Washington, the Protestant and evangelical Christian denominations were the salient religious hegemons in the region. How was this the case given the two and a half million Catholics who arrived in the States between 1880-1900? Where did they all go? The answer is certainly not to be found in the South. The mass influx of Catholic immigrants from Eastern Europe and Ireland and the subsequent nativist discrimination which accompanied the new citizens was one of many factors which explain the relatively small Catholic population in the South. Another possible explanation exists in southern Protestant culture which dominated the region and sanctified dominant political and social hierarchies. In spite of the simmering religious tensions just below the surface of Southern society, unprecedented community outreach and social awareness accompanied the growing importance of religion in the South. Projects like O'Brien's orphanage and academy for girls continued to flourish in the South and were incredibly important to the Progressive Era's manifold community projects and activism."],"display_date":"February 1889","search_date":"1889-02-14","locations":[{"id":2377,"lat":33.7814426129,"lng":-82.7442792235,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKES, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3168,"title":"Jewish Presence in Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-09-14","end_date":"1882-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the morning of September 14, 1882, Philip Henry Pitts ran various errands around town. He needed to make a few purchases, namely tools and home goods. While in town Pitts noticed a few stores had closed signs in the window. Upon returning home to his plantation, Pitts entered in his diary, Thursday Holy day among the Jews - All places of business closed among them this day...and this is new year with them... While it remains unclear whether Pitts referred to the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, or Yom Kippur, the holiest of Jewish days, his observance of this Jewish tradition positively identified a Jewish population living and working in Perry County, Alabama in 1882. Pitts concluded his diary entry by listing the various goods he purchased including a brass handle and a monkey wrench. ","Jewish immigration into the South was divided into four phases from the seventeenth to the twenty-first century. Jewish immigration to Alabama began in the late nineteenth century during the third wave of Jewish settlement in the South. Abraham Mordecai was the first European Jew to travel further west of the early centers of Jewish life in Savannah and Charleston. While the exact date of his arrival is unknown, he settled in what would become Montgomery, Alabama in 1880, pushing the Jewish population further into the South. ","As Jewish immigrants continued to settle in the South, they progressively gained economic influence in society. According to social historian Ralph Melnick, the collapse of the rural plantation system transferred economic and political power to southern cities and townships. With this economic shift, the Jewish population began to earn clout working as professionals, businessmen, mill operators, commodity brokers, and farm owners. In these roles Jewish workers increased their economic status in times of relative instability throughout the South. Reconstruction and the depression of the 1890s further increased Jewish wealth as they continually offered incentives over gentile competition. Jewish business transactions were strictly cash-only, eliminating the vicious cycle of debt for the consumer and decreasing the merchants' risk of financial loss. The economic prosperity enjoyed by these southern working Jews unfortunately led to an increase of anti-Semitism and resentment across the South. ","Between 1848 and 1980 Alabama lost half its Jewish population to bigotry and hate crimes. In 1868, the Ku Klux Klan was founded in Memphis, Tennessee and formally began its reign of terror throughout the South. In 1871, the KKK publicly murdered a Jewish shopkeeper in Memphis and established the Jewish population as a target of the organization. Though many Jews fled both Alabama and the South others remained. Despite anti-Semitic sentiments in the South, many Jewish families lingered in the region of their American roots.

In 1870, Ella Painter wrote her Aunt Lena many letters from Dublin, Virginia, with updates and inquiries about Lena's new husband and children. On her fourteenth birthday, Ella wrote her Aunt a lengthy letter which she felt was long overdue. Ella's love and admiration for her Aunt is clear as she nearly begs her to come back and visit. She writes about her recent visitors, her grandfathers new farm, and all of the new additions to the family. The startling aspect of the letter however, is the news of the many close acquaintances living in Dublin who had contracted serious illnesses. Lizzie Cecil had contracted Consumption (Tuberculosis), Ann Martin had Rheumatism, and Julia Jackson had been ill with Typhoid fever. Ella had found out that Dr. Stearns believed Miss Jackson would die, and while she seemed to be doing better, he still believed she could terminate in Consumption. ","Each summer, towns like Dublin saw their cemeteries, dotted with graves of upper-class youth who were victim of disease. Diseases did not discriminate. Death rates in the South remained higher than that of the North for much of the nineteenth century. Without formal vaccines, southerners turned to their own forms of medicine. ","When typhoid fever was believed to be caused by soured tree stumps giving off toxic vapors, entire forests were burned. Someone who had come down with typhoid, or the slow fever, would be treated through sweating, purging, and puking. A more adventurous remedy involved cutting a chicken in half and placing each half on the soles of the feet in order to pull the fever out. ","Rheumatism describes a form of arthritis and other muscle discomforts. For this, Appalachians had more unique remedies. Rattlesnake or red worm oil was sometimes rubbed into the ailing area. Some believed that bee stings would bring relief and advised sufferers to disturb a bee's nest and allow themselves to be stung until it was unbearable. ","Very little could be done for those with consumption. Some slept with ice packs containing their own coughed-up blood on their chests, while others were told to inhale the fumes of a skunk that was placed loose in their room. These remedies most likely did very little to stop the onset of death. It would not be until 1929 that the death rates in Virginia would reach the low of eleven deaths per thousand people.

Most of the people who expired were victims of the same mysterious affliction: high fever, muscle aches, vomiting and an eventual yellowish tint to the skin that preceded death. Baffled physicians prescribed everything from doses of quinine to sponge-baths to calomel, with no telling what the results would be from patient to patient. After a hiatus period, the summer of 1853 was particularly bad for the city, with thousands upon thousands succumbing to this sickness. One Dr. J. S. M'Farlane expressed regret that the city had become complacent and fallen under the impression that the hygienic condition of our city would be meliorated to such an unparalleled degree, that yellow fever and cholera were to fly shrieking to India and Rio Janeiro... Things were so bad that the city published a pamphlet entitled The Epidemic Summer: List of Interments in all the Cemeteries of New Orleans, which, because of the staggering death toll, was in actuality the size of a slender book."," By 1853, a multitude of opinions regarding the fever existed in the medical field. Dr. M'Farlane composed the pamphlet's opening remarks, and made summarizing statements that included his thoughts: he did not believe that yellow fever was contagious, nor that quarantine regulations would effectively prevent the disease. His printed words expressed a rising conviction that yellow fever would have to be combated differently than the typical epidemic disease. Dr. M'Farlane's careful word choice, most noticeable in his presentation of these statements as opinions, still points towards a hesitation to categorize anything about this disease as absolute truth.; however, the fact that this was a city publication indicates that reasoning like his was beginning to gain some credibility. If the city was willing to support his claims by publishing them, those same claims must have been achieving more and more popularity."," As it still stood, popular opinion claimed that, since the freshest faces in New Orleans were most susceptible to yellow fever, it could also be referred to as the Stranger's Disease. The Epidemic Summer itself perpetuates this belief: of the 67 pages of small print filled with names of the dead, a significant number of them are shown to be immigrants; most often from Ireland or Germany. This common belief perpetuated stereotypes against these newcomers. Although in reality the city suffered from bouts of yellow fever because of its high volume of traffic with mosquito-ridden Latin America, the stratification of its victims played into the existing prejudices towards ethnicities and classes."],"display_date":"May 1, 1853 - November 1, 1853","search_date":"1853-08-01","locations":[{"id":5598,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3183,"title":"The Dutch Ferryman\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-01","end_date":"1835-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Presbyterian Reverend Timothy Flint had been settled with his family in Alexandria, Louisiana for 10 years when he set out at the age of 55 to explore the Red River and the people who lived along it. Commissioned by the Missionary Society of Connecticut in 1815 to preach Christianity to the masses of emigrants moving west, Flint was no stranger to such exploration. He ministered in the Ohio Valley, St. Louis and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as taking an opportunity to travel through the new Arkansas Territory in 1819. Due to ill health, he was often traveling between Louisiana and New England, seeking escape from the sweltering heat of summer and the freezing cold of winter. "," After traveling several days east along the Red River in 1835, he finally came to its junction with the Ouachita River, which could take him north through the Arkansas Territory, should he choose. Flint found, even at this remote place, small cabins dotting the landscape where just a few years before there had been no one. He employed the services of one such settler, a Hollander dressed in a shabby and crude Robinson Crusoe costume, to ferry him closer to the Ouachita. Flint was so amused by his new friend that he requested to see where this Dutchman lived. The Dutchman obliged, presenting Flint with a small two room cabin surrounded by cultivated peach and plum trees and a small garden, miles from any other habitation. His home was dug into the side of an Indian mound, which he shared with his animals. Like his clothing, all his tools, eating utensils, and dishes were crude and hand-made. The ferryman took the opportunity to express his opinion on religion as well, pushing a book of Astrology on the Reverend. Flint graciously declined, lamenting a lack of familiarity with the Dutch language. "," Whatever entertainment Timothy Flint gained from such a man, he still expressed regret that so great a proportion of the emigrants are of the class of poor, vagrant, and worthless foreigners, the scum of despotic governments. Many who emigrated to the frontier owned very few slaves or none at all and appear in the tax records as not owning property, much like the Dutch ferryman. These men and their families eked out a small living, and required, as many church officials from the East believed, a revived understanding of the Christian faith due to their removal from civilized society. ","In the same year that the Missionary Society of Connecticut sent Reverend Flint west, a New York paper, <em>The Patrol</em>, reprinted a progress report from the Louisiana Bible Society, expressing concern that the want of Bibles in Louisiana has been extreme. The Presbyterian Church in the East was greatly concerned with increasing the educational and moral principles of society at large, but particularly on the frontier, where they believed lower class migrants, like the Dutchman, were in danger of leading secular lives and forgetting God in the wilds of the west."],"display_date":1835,"search_date":"1835-07-02","locations":[{"id":5632,"lat":31.2441474516,"lng":-92.6921619821,"zoom":8,"place":"RAPIDES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3197,"title":"A West Virginians Bookkeeping   \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-01-01","end_date":"1872-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Migrants headed to the frontier in the nineteenth century were eager to work. Many, unable to immediately settle down and begin anew, worked on farms they encountered in order to make money. On the other side were the farmers who could charge these migrants room and board and pay them set wages to do the work around their farm. Franklin Osburn not only ran a farm but also a country store on his property. By looking at Mr. Franklin?s books, it is clear he had many guests and numerous transactions with each of his workers. Osburn sold the goods produced on his farm both to his workers and to those living nearby. His store sold molasses, meats, butter, and liquor among other goods. Workers were paid one dollar for slaughtering a hog, two dollars for chopping wood, and thirteen dollars for cutting corn. While Osburn received a service from most of his visitors, his books show that he profited off of all of them as he was their source of everyday needs. ","The Appalachian countryside was dotted with communities during the nineteenth century. Each community of farms was self-sufficient in supplying the goods needed for survival. Most farming families grew only enough for themselves while others, like Franklin Osburn, used his farm to make profits. These Appalachian communities were not nearly as isolated as made out to be. Like those Osburn recorded staying at his farm, ?a fairly constant stream of traffic eastward and westward kept the mountains in touch with the low country.? The frontier was in constant motion with each new settler looking for the best place to create a niche. ","The names of the laborers in Mr. Osburn?s records most likely belong to migrant workers. These ?shuttle? migrants went back and forth between the mountains and cities looking for work. During times of depression, it was especially common for these migrants to leave the cities and set up temporarily on farms. It was not uncommon for entire families to travel together looking for work. Other migrants had a preference to remain rural and instead traveled from farm to farm in Appalachia looking for work.

However, the freed African American didn't leave the Augusta area. Instead, he waited until he could purchase and earn his path outside of the region. When Henry decided to leave, Cumming, in 1819, asked for and received the signatures of many white, male aristocrats. They all endorsed the Todd family because of Harry's good conduct, diligence, and positive community reputation. Their endorsement asked for the humanity and protection of all persons whom the family would meet on their travels to search for a place to settle. Fortunately for Henry Todd, white Southern men who met him either heeded the advice of the document or believed Todd in his explanation that he and his family was free, because he lived 40 years past the day he left August. He died at age 92.","Before the Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War, masters throughout the South granted freedom to their slaves. Thousands of enslaved African Americans received the same independence as Henry Todd. In much the same way as Henry Todd, however, these newly-liberated men and women did not have many options directly after they received their freedom. They possessed no financial resources, no previous experience participating, at least as a buyer and seller, in a market economy, likely very few or no close family with which to make contacts, and no way to purchase transportation if they desired to migrate. ","Henry Todd, because of his limited opportunity as a newly-freed man, worked on the Cumming plantation until he received endorsement from the local landed gentry. Many freed slaves could only leave their plantation, or function as a free person in the South, if their former masters provided them with an endorsement or provided them with land.","Henry Todd's desire to stay with his family demonstrated the close bonds created by blacks during slavery. Slaves believed in the tight family network to such a degree that family members would extend themselves to fictive kin, who were people outside of family blood lines, and adopt them into the assemblage of relatives. Given the difficult circumstances of the peculiar institution, blacks bonded together to support each other and formed cohesive familial bonds."],"display_date":"February 20, 1819","search_date":"1819-02-20","locations":[{"id":2186,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3201,"title":"Controversial Mail in Tennessee\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1822-09-07","end_date":"1822-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 7, 1822, The Independent Gazette explained that Proposals have been issued for carrying the mail in Tennessee.

The mail was also the way for journalists to receive news from the abroad but also and above all, from other states thus local Tennesseans newspapers were full of new from elsewhere. Besides, since dislocation was difficult, the mail was also used for trade and transactions. For example, the journalist described New Orleans as such an important market place: many goods and slaves were actually bought and sold there and it would be disastrous to be isolated from this place.

On February 25, 1885 it covered the front page news, flags flew at half-mast, locomotives were shrouded, and traffic stopped, while people flooded to his funeral. The city had lost a respected citizen and a leading businessman, regarded as one of the South's best railroad men. Gittio, thinking he had a cold, had called upon a doctor who discovered pronounced heart trouble and, to the shock of the region, he died a few days later. Gittio embodied a rags to riches story, as he started his work on the Seaboard and Roanoke Railroad in 1854 as a sixteen year old boy. He would eventually work his way up to becoming superintendent of the line, and he would exert great influence in all the railroads that stretched out from the Norfolk region. Despite his personal high standing, the Norfolk paper explained, He took great pride in the advancement and the prosperity of his native city. As his wife and young boy looked on in grief, Gittio's pall-bearers, railroad men themselves, laid the forty eight year old to rest. "," Evident in the high respect afforded Capt Gittio, railroads would develop a special meaning to the postwar South, as they embodied forward progress and development. At the outset of Reconstruction, the South's prosperity lagged far behind that of the rest of the country, and people hoped railroad construction would revitalize the Southern economy. Due to political mishandling, railroad construction during Reconstruction hardly existed, but thereafter until the turn of the century, the South would build railroads faster than any part of the country. Utilizing mostly Northern capital, Southern railroad mileage increased from 16,605 miles in 1880 to 39,103 miles in 1890. Soon, 90 percent of Southerners would live in a county with railroads. In big Southern cities railroad consolidation and expansion would lead to the creation of a central downtown station, from which a vibrant business district would grow. Such improved access to this reliable, quicker means of transportation revolutionized the way business was conducted, evidenced in the boom of mass production and mass distribution during this era. "," Despite the aura that encompassed them, Southern railroads, like the one Gittio managed, did not always bring prosperity and happiness. Oftentimes railroads and railroad construction could be linked to corrupt ties with political parties, especially evident in Virginia's case. Economically, though railroads lowered transportation costs for businesses, their rates often seemed oppressive to farmers trying to ship their crops, leading to populist calls for rate regulation and government commissions. Socially, they became center stage for the separate but equal theory that would eventually manifest itself into outright segregation. Nonetheless, new railways seemed to bring new opportunities for many of those along the line, and for these reasons the Portsmouth community chose to remember Capt. Gittio and his career so gratefully.

Samuel Andrews created a notice on behalf of his brother living in Texas. His brother, John, was interested in having slaves sent to Texas for a few years to furnish the land.

By Monday morning, the ship encountered a violent hurricane in the waters around Cape Hatteras and was taking on water. All hands were at the pumps, women included, bailing out water, but the leak continued to increase. After water reached the engine, Captain Carleton White decided to beach the vessel in order to save the passengers and crew on board. At around ten o'clock in the evening, the Home struck the outer breakers a quarter mile from the shore. Roland reported, In an instant after the strike, all was utter confusion and alarm. Men, women and children screamed in the most agonizing manner, fearful of the almost certain death that lay before them. Amid all the chaos, Mr. Roland shed all his clothes except for his shirt and pantaloons and dived into the turbulent waters. Somehow, he managed to escape death and made it to the shore - though the current had swept him a mile and a half to the south.

The navigation of these sea routes enabled better access to local and national markets, fueling the economic development of North Carolina in the 1840s and 1850s. But how did the South respond to the maritime disaster of the Home? First, questions were raised about the safety of these steam-packets that were designed for luxury more than performance, in order to compete with railroad travel. Southerners looked to the steam vessels of Britain for engineering standards. A more illuminating response was the consideration of religion. One Reverend, clinging to a piece of luggage, was heard to utter these words in the frigid waters of the Outer Banks: He that trusts in Jesus is safe, even in the perils of the sea. If there was one thing common to Southern society, it was that most people found ultimate solace in religion. After the shipwreck, it was the only way to make sense of the destruction.

He notes that in the 1850's over sixteen hundred white households owned fifty-five hundred slaves within the county. With this newly gained knowledge Knoth's actions; that previously seemed rash and contingent with his insanity; now appear rational. Ayers further ascertains that slavery stood as a fundamental fact in Augusta County. In fact, its roots dug even deeper into the heart of the county when slave prices inflated dramatically in the 1850s. This inflation reassured Southerners that slaves were a good investment, and further intensified their desire to protect the institution that accounted for their prosperity from the growing threats that were prevalent in the years leading up to the Civil War.

As white America expanded west, the lives of these peoples began to be transformed forever. Many Native Americans abandoned their heritage in the pressing tide. They replaced the traditions of their ancestors with many economic, social and political practices of this invasive, foreign culture. "," In 1830, the Choctaws ceded the claims to their native Mississippi land in the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek. Most of the Choctaws were forced to leave their home soil, but approximately two thousand, many of whom were mixed-bloods, were allowed to stay and adopt white culture as a life-style.

The author of this editorial, and many other Americans of the period, saw the dramatic societal changes among the Choctaw to be an astonishing improvement from their former indigenous state.

Helm related that the trip usually took a bearable seven days, but left without a breeze in the unpredictable Gulf of Mexico, her voyage took an astonishing 31 days. The ship only carried provisions for the expected seven days and was insufficiently stocked with water. It is no surprise that under these conditions Helm fell ill. She related, after our cooked provisions had given out, crackers and hard sea bread sustained life; but when the water gave out, then real suffering commenced. ","Helm had already survived extensive travels before she boarded the Little Zoe, the schooner that took her and her husband Elias R. Wightman to Texas. The couple departed Herkimer County, New York in 1828 and set out upon a popular route to the West. They traveled by boat down the Allegheny to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the boarded a steamboat bound for New Orleans by way of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. At New Orleans, the Helms embarked upon their troubled cruise on the Little Zoe. At the time, such schooners were the primary means of travel between New Orleans and Texas because their shallow bottoms were less likely to hit the sandbars that existed along the coast of Texas. The small ships, however, were subject to the fickle weather of the Gulf of Mexico. ","Though the Helms found their voyage particularly unpleasant, it pales in comparison to the horrific passage of slaves brought from Africa to the American South. The South's economy created a great demand for slaves that fueled the trans-Atlantic slave trade even after it became illegal in America in 1808. Like Mary Helm, enslaved Africans faced hunger and sickness but also bore the added burden of generally inhumane conditions on the journey to America. Sources describe the system of transportation as gruesome and ruthlessly efficient. Such factors as malnutrition... and deprivation of sunlight from prolonged stays below deck made illness and high death rates unavoidable. And though the trade was outlawed by the United States in 1808, the illegal trade that continued through portals such as Texas brought about unprecedented horrors for captured Africans. Though most of the slaves in Texas were brought from the United States an illegal [trans-Atlantic] slave trade developed as early as 1835. The injustices that took place on slave ships occurred on the seas rather than American soil, but the blood shed on such vessels belonged on the plantations of the South. The demand for slaves created by Texas and the other Southern states led directly to the brutalities against Africans.

Tom was not black (at least not fully), nor was he a stereotypical enslaved person. He was literate and worked in a trade for a major company. Clearly, he had some advantages afforded to him that many plantation field hands lacked and which put him in the perfect position to run away.","Charleston differed from many Southern towns and counties in its freedoms given to enslaved people. Slaves often took care of their own living arrangements and food, and made some (though very small) income. Charleston did not have the large plantations and thus it did not have the high demand for manual labor. Most owners hired out their slaves (most of whom were domestics or skilled in a trade) to other individuals to use. The owners were paid in return and were able to make profit off their slaves' work. Many slaves were allowed to retain some of the payment, and thus allowed some minor freedoms. This autonomy, and the ability of many Charleston slaves to read and write, made a lot of Charlestonians fear rebellion and runaways. Black people had to wear specific badges to identify them as free blacks or hired out slaves. The lack of a badge would indicate runaway status. Badges were often traded among slaves and free blacks, or counterfeited. Tom perhaps obtained a badge or other paperwork to certify he was free. Considering his education and connections, Tom would have been able to get away with a lot of things without being questioned. ","The belief that Tom escaped via ship was reflected in a general fear of runaway slaves through the port that had led to legislation in 1822. The Negro Seaman Acts required black seamen to be locked up while not at sea, so any black man on a ship was assumed to be a run away, and to prevent the black seaman from instigating trouble among the slaves."],"display_date":"May 2, 1815","search_date":"1815-05-02","locations":[{"id":11452,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3389,"title":"Hardee Refuses to Surrender Savannah\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-12-17","end_date":"1864-12-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On December 17, 1864 Union General William Tecumseh Sherman and his army were hovering on the doorstep to Savannah, Georgia.

With Fort McAllister toppled, Sherman was poised to sack Savannah. "," He sent the head of Confederate forces in Savannah, Lieutenant-General William Joseph Hardee, a letter advising Hardee that he surrender the city immediately. As quoted from Sherman?s letter, ?Should you entertain the proposition, I am prepared to grant liberal terms to the inhabitants and garrison; but should I be forced to resort to assault, or the slower and surer process of starvation, I shall then feel justified in resorting to the harshest measures.? In a written response to Sherman delivered on December 18, Hardee refused to surrender the city. As quoted in his letter, ?Your demand for the surrender of Savannah and its dependent forts is refused.? Instead of fighting or surrendering Hardee chose to retreat unharmed, leading his troops across a readily built bridge over the Savannah River and out of the city on December 20.

They knew that it would be necessary if they wanted to remain a part of international business, and they needed efficient transportation for all the resources they were supplying.

Confederate Captain John Howard, under the instruction of Captain John McGrady completed the obstruction of the Altamaha near Lake Bluff, Georgia in late November ? successfully preventing future nautical passage in either direction. This message was relayed to Georgia Governor Joseph Emerson Brown in a letter he received from Commanding General Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard on December 2, 1862."," As quoted from Beauregard in his letter to Governor Brown, ?The general plan of obstruction I have adopted for shallow rivers is simple, easily constructed, of little cost, and I hope will prove very effectual. Any of the streams Your Excellency should consider ought to be obstructed would be reconnoitered as soon as an engineer officer could be selected for that object.? Beauregard also noted that Howard was left in charge of protecting the blockade and battery placed near Lake Bluff. "," The lack of a viable and extensive railroad system in the South meant that during the Civil War the Confederacy relied heavily on inland waterways to move goods and troops quickly from place to place. However, once Union forces penetrated this infrastructure they used the rivers to their advantage just as frequently. In southern Georgia, the Altamaha River was a main source of transportation for both sides. Formed by the confluence of the Ocmulgee and Oconee rivers near Lumber City, Georgia and joined farther downstream by the Ohoopee River, the Altamaha flows more than 130 miles to the Atlantic Ocean where it empties into the sea north of Brunswick, Georgia.  Obstructing the Altamaha River prevented inland Union troops from connecting via waterway with their fellow naval forces off the coast of Georgia. This not only blocked Federal vessels from moving further inland to penetrate the Georgia heartland but it also severed lines of communication between the two forces. With the Federal navy blockading the Atlantic coastline, the Southern cotton pipeline with England was slowed immensely, severely constricting the Confederate economy. Cutting the two forces in half gave Confederate blockade runners a better shot at breaking through the Union barricade. Before Union troops invaded the Southern states, the multitude of streams, creeks and rivers that wound through Georgia worked as an excellent thoroughfare for Confederate forces to utilize.

The specific concern those in meeting grappled with was the fact that in March 1827 the General Assembly provided a charter for corporation in Virginia to the Maryland-based Baltimore and Ohio Railroad company. The railroad would have great freedom in choosing what land to occupy, which threatened to intensify intra-regional competitions within the state. Of additional concern, the railroad could obtain a virtual monopoly of land in those counties it chose, and thereby directly threaten the state government's jurisdiction. The railroad or any other State who may, in an unguarded moment, acquire an interest and influence subversive of the great and permanent rights, influences and power of our government was how Virginians like John Coalter of Stafford phrased the problem. It was Coalter who prompted the meeting by circulating an editorial in the state's leading newspapers. He entreated editors to notify the public of the summit, in order that there may be some concert, and as general a meeting procured, from every section of the State.","Internal improvements, which included canals, toll roads, and eventually railroads, were not an all a new consideration to Virginians in the early nineteenth century. In the 1780s George Washington had initiated plans to build a canal connecting the Chesapeake Bay and the Ohio Valley, and to drain the Great Dismal Swamp. The state government chartered several road and canal by 1815, many of which connected the growing Valley region in western Virginia with the Tidewater and Piedmont parts of the state. In these early years, capital for improvement projects in Virginia was raised by public stock companies. Once chartered by act of the state assembly, a company would offer a certain number of shares to private investors. The state government also typically purchased an initial stake in these companies, somewhere between ten and twenty percent. But until the 1820s, the state did not provide any more than that partial financial support. That dynamic would change by the late 1820s. In its previous history, Virginia had generally avoided incurring state debt. The state owed some money to the federal government for the War of 1812, but paid this off by 1826. But that is precisely when the issue of internal improvements heated up. In the next twelve years, Virginia went over six million dollars into debt to encourage the growth of canal and railroad companies within its borders. Baltimore and Ohio was one of the largest beneficiaries."," The financing of internal improvements had become an issue of national scope. Eleven new states, most of which were located in the Mississippi basin, had joined the Union by 1821. Whereas Virginia earlier tried to link the eastern and western parts of the state, now the Americans tried to economically link East and West on the national scale. States directly competed with one another to attract railroad companies. Virginians saw themselves in competition with Pennsylvania and Maryland. New York's Erie Canal, completed in 1825, directly challenged Canadian trade routes in the north. National politicians battled about whether the federal government should shoulder the burden for expensive improvement projects. For example, Henry Clay successfully advanced the National Road, the biggest highway project in the country, while serving as Secretary of State under John Quincy Adams."],"display_date":"July - September 1828","search_date":"1828-08-15","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3440,"title":"A Scarcity of Goods\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1830-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The low water level made the landing of ships near the mouth of the Brazos difficult. And, fortunately for William hunter, the ship that was lost to the sand bar (he could not remember the name of the ship) was not carrying his goods. However, the incident was instructive to Hunter, as he reported to his business associate James Perry (who resided in Missouri at the time), in that after the ship's destruction he began to insure their goods against loss. Though he had not calculated on paying for insurance, he was advised by Mills and McKinstry by all means to insure all [of his goods]. Though Perry judged insurance to be a good idea in light of the uncertain marine transportation, the cost was such that he had to defer his payment to the proprietor of the schooner shipping his goods until he could sell goods to pay him [with the profits].","With the exception of the first and last sentences of his letter, Hunter's correspondence dealt exclusively with business interests and the protection thereof. Hunter proceeded to relate his most recent dealings, payments, and debts to Perry, as well the difficult time he had getting his goods through the customhouse. Such a focus on economic concerns is not surprising in a letter to a business partner, but the detailed analyses of the young Texan market serve as a reminder that the early settlement of Texas was mostly by people seeking economic opportunity. Though the history of the United States demonstrates examples of both economically and ideologically motivated migrations, the colonization of Texas with which Hunter and Perry were associated clearly aligns with the latter. One of the primary motivations for the settlement of Mexico was the availability and cheap cost of land. While land in the United States cost 1.25 per acre, land was available in Texas for about four cents per acre. Additionally, each head of a family could claim 4, 605 acres. Through the efforts of businessmen like Perry, Hunter, and Stephen Austin, settlements sprang up rapidly and Texas became a link between the stagnating economy of Mexico and the booming market of the United States. ","From 1800 to the decades after Anglo-American colonization began, Mexico's economy underwent a slight decline. America, however, saw a massive increase in economic power. The only significant economic growth that occurred in Mexico during the time period was in Mexico's far north (i.e., Texas and New Mexico), and, according to Resendez, this growth was fueled predominantly by foreign immigration, the opening of new trading routes to the United States, the availability of cheap import goods, and the region... as a crossroads of exchange. The relative prosperity of the northern parts of Mexico due to their ties to the U.S. economy is indicative of the overall growth in the American market. Resendez states that at the same time the Mexican economy was undergoing a slight decline (of about ten percent), the United States economy grew 1270.4 percent between 1800 and 1860. This growth was due in part to the increased agricultural production of the South, which spurred entrepreneurs to try their hand at developing the new lands of Texas.

The West would offer opportunities for wealth that no longer existed on the eastern seaboard. In March 1884 word quickly spread throughout Wytheville, Virginia that several country boys were leaving their small town for the vast frontiers of the West; their imaginations filled with fertile lands and crop surpluses. The townspeople had other thoughts. The boys received great opposition to their migration. The <em>Wytheville Dispatch </em>begged the boys to put the same determination they had to head west into succeeding at home. With a sense of optimism the paper exclaimed, We know this can be done It had been tried too often","Westward migration was fairly constant during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Many left with hopes of striking it rich by discovering gold or reaping the fresh soil. The intentions of the boys in Wytheville are unclear, but it is necessary to realize that there were both pull and push factors that brought people to the frontier. To John Dippel the West was something that, could be pursued, but never possessed. The frontier was all about the quest. He notes, however, that as much as these frontiersmen were looking to start anew, many were just trying to escape the old. Prior to the Civil War, a non-slave holding farmer was at an immediate disadvantage to a large plantation. Free slave labor made it difficult for white farmers to earn a wage. Creating a farm that could turn profits was nearly impossible for an upstart white farmer. The West offered these farmers an opportunity.","Race was a major push factor in westward migration after the Civil War. No doubt much of this racial discrimination was based on blacks displacing poor white farmers. In the lead-up to the Civil War, many northern factory workers also migrated west fearing the loss of their job to freed blacks. Still other whites simply could not tolerate living side-by-side with blacks, free or enslaved, and viewed the West as a pure land. Slaveholding whites, however, did not stay away for long. As their tobacco crops killed the soil, they too fled west with their slaves. Poor white farmers were consistently being displaced west by blacks while other whites chose to flee a society shared with blacks. To these migrants, true freedom and prosperity in the West hinged on keeping blacks out.

People began settling throughout the east coast, transforming transportation into an extremely important part of life. Consequently, as the economy began to bloom, items needed to be brought to different parts of the country. Unfortunately, transportation had been a major problem since the establishment of this United States and the only real roads had been sculpted from old worn down Indian trails. Something needed to be changed and more dependent routes had to be created. ","Roads were such a burden because they required a substantial amount of work to maintain and depending on the season, their conditions were unreliable due to the negative effects of weather. In the summer the dust would be unbearable unlike in the winter when they became muddy and hard to move in, making it extra difficult for travel. In some instances, roads turned into swamps and were almost impassable during nearly five months of the year. After serious thought, counties began building turnpikes with hopes of fixing this problem. Charging users at tool booths for the use of roads helped gain adequate funds to cover the necessary maintenance costs. The supplies needed to create these roadways were plentiful and cheep as well as the sand and loam necessary absorption any water that might fall on the roads and bridges. Unfortunately, there were still a few obstacles prevented the building of more roadways. The high price of labor as well as the hilly terrain was difficult to overcome and posed as a substantial problem to the engineers. In order to help expedite the process of finishing these projects, state aid for internal improvements was offered to enhance transportation and on January 2, 1830 the government granted Tennessee 150,000 towards this cause.","Transportation at this time was not limited to roads. Water transportation was an easy way to move large qualities of goods especially on the Mississippi River due to the vast number of rivers and streams and access to the ocean. The concept of turnpikes was also incorporated into water travel to maintain rivers and keep them in good shape for maximum use. As steamboats became a popular mode of transportation, major attention was aimed towards the removal of obstructions in the Principle Rivers.

Lear administrated a large fund for the education of slaves that had been established by General Thaddeus Kosciusko, a famous Polish hero in the American Revolution. Upon Kosciusko's death in 1817, he had left the fund to his longtime acquaintance and fellow son of liberty, Thomas Jefferson. In September 1825, B.L. Lear wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson Randolph, grandson of Jefferson and apparent heir to his estate, regarding a specific plan for the education of free blacks. The core of Lear's plan was to purchase young slaves and for them Education in plain literature & mechanical arts, and at a proper age transport them to the Colony in Africa to be as useful there as they may. Lear's letter also related to Randolph the following information about Jefferson's attitude toward the fund he approved very heartily the plan I then proposed to adopt, tho' he declined to give any advice or express any opinion in the matter, considering himself - now without authority."," Lear wrote this letter shortly after meeting with northern groups dedicated to the education of free blacks. The African School in New Jersey had been established in 1817 by the Presbyterian Synod of New York. New York Protestants created the school for the specific the goal of instructing blacks as preachers and teachers. Once free black people received such an education, they could be sent to Liberia or Haiti to help establish stable societies. This plan accorded with the vision of the American Colonization Society, a national initiative established in 1818, which channeled white efforts to cautiously deal with the slavery question. Whites Americans who supported plans in which education and colonization for blacks went hand in hand tended not to address a related question: If, as they believed, free blacks could become good citizens of an overseas colony through education, why could they not do so in America? Most free blacks roundly opposed colonization; they preferred to remain in the only country their family had known for generations, and work there for the freedom of black Americans still in slavery. Only about 15,000 free American blacks moved to Liberia over three decades time. Of those who did colonize, many professed a desire to spread Christianity by missionary work.","Despite the ideological support groups of white Americans sometimes afforded plans to educate blacks, and widespread backing among African Americans themselves, the support often took inadequate financial form. The African School of New Jersey ran out of money within a few years after its establishment. As it turns out, Kosciusko's fund could not be used to support it as Lear and Randolph had hoped. His family waged legal litigation for years- eventually succeeding in a Supreme Court case - to control Kosciusko's estate themselves."],"display_date":"September 1826","search_date":"1826-09-15","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3450,"title":"Perry&#39;s Detainment\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-01-01","end_date":"1831-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["An unidentified man named Perry (likely a relative of James Perry) had finally arrived in Texas. As he is mentioned in a letter to James Perry, who had a number of business interests in Texas, it is probable that he was there in a role of some relation to James Perry's investments. Unfortunately for Perry, the winter of 1831 was the worst winter that Texas had experienced for several years. Upon disembarking from his boat, he intended to venture further on into the settlements, but was detained for four days by bad weather and high water. Perry was, of course, not the only one to suffer from the adverse weather conditions and their effects on the local road systems. ","William Hunter, James Perry's agent who had been running his business in Texas commented upon the economically pernicious results of the impassable roadways. Hunter related to James Perry that he had only been able to transport two loads of their goods up from the river where they were deposited by boat. He declared that he was verry much disappointed in getting hauling done because a team that had started to the river for a load the previous week had returned empty-handed. He further noted that one or two teams were mired down on the roadways at the time. This development was clearly economically damaging, as Hunter could not sell goods that he didn't have in his possession. He lamented that if his goods had arrived before the bad weather, he could have done a good business. Like the financial fortunes of Perry and Hunter, the economic well being of the South was highly dependent on roads and other means of transportation. Well-kept roads were crucial for the shipment of goods, especially from rural areas to urban centers where they could be sold or shipped to larger markets. As a result, local governments communities throughout the South put much emphasis on road maintenance even at a time where municipal services were few. An excellent example of this facet of community cooperation occurred in Virginia's Prince Edward County. As noted in Israel on the Appomatox, the Prince Edward county court expended considerable effort responding to petitions for new roadways. Also, county surveyors, or citizens in charge of certain sections of road were enlisted for general maintenance of thoroughfares. These surveyors had the power to conscript other men's slaves (and free blacks) for several days each year in the interest of improving roads. The yearly cleanup allowed for uninhibited commerce along the county's highways and byways. Because the economy of the South produced primarily agricultural goods that had to be shipped for sale, good systems of transportation were crucial. In addition to roads, transportation throughout the South was carried out by other means such as boats or, later on, railroads. However, at the time of Perry's detainment by muddy paths, Texas was little more than a collection of settlements strung together by roads that were clearly inadequate for year-round business."],"display_date":1831,"search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3454,"title":"Technological Progress in Louisiana\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["New Orleans' geographical location made it a prime final destination for all sorts of shipable goods. The city had become one of the premier metropolises of not only the state but also the entire South, thanks to the convergence of the Mississippi with the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the abundance of water routes, the need for other methods of transportation grew along with the city. Far from being the lazy South that has been romanticized in literature, this part of the country was bustling with trade and a rapid trend towards efficiency. Out of that desire, a minority within the Louisiana Committee on Internal Improvements took it upon themselves to investigate the complete installation of a railroad line connecting Baton Rouge and New Orleans. This committee published a Minority Report in 1853 urging the state legislature to approve immediate funding of this line. Forty-six of the ninety-one mile stretch between the two cities had already been constructed and were in daily use, so it was just a matter of completing the job previously begun. The committee agreed that the New Orleans and Baton Rouge Railroad is a work of great public utility and that the line... is superior to that of any railroad in the state. They claimed that, upon completion of the railroad, travel time between the cities would be reduced to a mere three hours, and at a cost of just 3 per ride. Not only would this be an advantage to anyone living in either Baton Rouge or New Orleans, but it would be particularly beneficial to members of legislature. The railroad could now afford them the opportunity to attend their meetings at shorter notice and still be home by nightfall.","The South was truly growing at a rapid rate, and the addition of a railroad line portrays that growth quite clearly. No longer were waterways sufficient; faster overland travel was a necessary addition to the well-being of Louisiana's inhabitants. The scramble to improve transportation was being seen all over the young country, so much so that the national government became involved. Congress bequeathed land to states for the express purpose of improving travel routes, and Louisiana was no exception. Congress agreed to grant 100,000 acres to its railroad construction, knowing that the state's eventual gains meant that their economic loss would not be sustained for long. Just as a more streamlined transportation system translated into greater productivity and commerce, it also facilitated better and quicker communication within the country. No longer could the North and South co-exist in denial of their counterparts.

Taking care of day-to-day business without a husband and father in the rough settlement of San Felipe de Austin was not an easy feat. The pressures upon the family increased as time went by, and the news of him they received after his absence spanned one month was not heartening. Brown was taking part in an exploration of the upper colonies of Texas, and his party's horses were stolen in an Indian raid. However, the settlers vowed to pursue the marauders and not to return until their stolen property was recovered. Additionally disturbing was the fact that Indians had recently committed several such attacks in the upper colonies. ","The fact that even in the sparsely populated lands of Mexico's northern colonies Brown and other Anglo-Americans were involved in conflicts with Indians was indicative of the Indians' struggles within the United States. Interestingly, the Indians of the upper colonies were not all native to the area. In fact, as a result of persecution within the United States, many of the Indians with whom the Anglo-American settlers interacted were displaced members of the Cherokee tribe. After the American Revolution, a large number of Cherokee left their traditional homes in the southeastern part of the United States, and moved west to Louisiana, then owned by the far more welcoming Spanish. As time passed, more and more Cherokee who found their eastern homes encroached upon by white settlers joined their tribal brethren to the west. Following the U.S. purchase of Louisiana, many Cherokee again moved, now seeking to live under the friendlier Spanish government in Texas. As time passed, Anglo-American settlers as well as the Spanish government again threatened the Cherokee Indians. Cherokee leaders actually applied for a formal land grant in order to legally secure their lands from other settlers, but they correctly interpreted repeated delays in their application's approval as a portent of eventual rejection. By 1826, the Cherokee were desperate enough to take part in an armed insurrection against the Mexican government, along with some Anglo-American settlers and other indigenous groups. The revolt was crushed by Mexican troops with the aid of volunteers from the more established American colonies. ","The plight of the Cherokee in Texas was merely a later chapter in their great struggle resulting from the colonization of their native lands. Throughout the history of the South, Indians occupied large portions of the region's soil and directly influenced politics, agriculture, and other aspects of Southern life. It was not until approximately 30 years before the Civil War that the Indian populations of the South were forcibly removed from the area. However, with the continual westward movement of settlers, political and physical conflict between Anglo-Americans and Indians would continue to be a factor in shaping the country for years to come."],"display_date":"January 13, 1831","search_date":"1831-01-13","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3475,"title":"Traveling Epidemics Affected People in all areas of the Country\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-08-13","end_date":"1818-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As a public warning, lists of certain items that had serious potential of making one sick were often created and published in newspapers to inform the community.

Along with this warning of what not to eat, the paper informed the public that people who disobeyed these rules would be forced to pay a fine of five dollars. Provisional laws were given serious thought in regards to what people should be allowed to eat or sell with the intent of reducing the possibility of transmitting infection among the inhabitants of different communities.","Diseases were frequently established and spread by the consumption of poor food, infection, or contacting others who had contagious viruses. As trading increased and people began traveling around the world, new illnesses were found and exposed to people wherever these ships landed. In a conversation between William and John Bisland they discussed how the yellow fever began at New Orleans, and came up to Natchez by the Steam Boat, killing a great number of people. Due to the fear of contracting these unknown diseases states elected a member of their community to establish a board of health. The board of health in Mississippi was extremely concerned with the welfare of their citizens and established preventative measures to avoid the contraction of diseases, to help reduce the number of people exposed to sicknesses and determine rules regarding the presence of foreigners on their land. Incidences such as this one forced Mississippi to determine laws which were immediately enforced and stating that all empty or other boats landing [in this city], shall immediately notify the health officer and that the boats needed to immediately be cleansed, sent adrift or removed. If the possessor of a boat did not comply with the officers request, the owner of such flat or other boats [were considered] guilty of a misdemeanor and were subject to appropriate prosecution. ","Healthcare was a considerable problem in nineteenth century Mississippi because of the little knowledge communities had regarding specific diseases and the shortage of medicines needed to treat these widespread illnesses. Life became much easier for families when the creation of home medical guides were established in the late 1820's. These books were designed to serve as a guide for frontier and rural families who lived great distances from primitive medical care (McClary) so maintaining health would not require the attention of a physician. If any problems or sicknesses were identified, families could easily treat them without traveling to a major city. Books such as this one were easy helpful way to cure uncommon yet simple diseases.

They claimed to have heard of his propensity at the violin and requested to hire him to accompany their traveling circus performances. The pay was quite reasonable and Northup eagerly took on the job. He accompanied them the entire way down to Washington, D.C. without realizing that this was a cruel trick. Those circus performers were, in fact, slave traders looking to make a quick profit off of selling free men. "," Northup did not realize the true motives of his companions until he awoke one morning bound in chains in a damp and dark cell-like room. He never saw the traders again, but the nightmare to which they introduced him continued. From Washington, Northup was put on a ship with other enslaved people and relocated to New Orleans."," After arriving in New Orleans, Northup's outraged cries of his free status went largely ignored or resulted in angry lashings. He was placed in a slave pen along with many others. First thing next morning everyone received a bath, if necessary, a shave, and a set of cheap but clean new clothes. Northup experienced firsthand the degradation that occurred inside those slave pens; when the customers arrived, the traders paraded the slaves around and allowed them to be patted down, walked about, questioned and otherwise examined. Some of these prospective buyers demanded that the slaves open their mouths and display their teeth, precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. The dehumanization continued with mandatory exercise activities taking place. At one point Northup was even called on to provide violin music to the slaves' tortured dancing."," These New Orleans slave pens mocked any notion of innate or universal humanism. The slave traders and future owners translated their own discomfort with the practice of trading people into viewing the so-called 'items' for sale with repulsion. In their eyes, blacks existed purely for the purpose of making them, the whites, a profit. Because of this rationale, traders generally had no desire to attempt to keep many family ties together. Northup witnessed an instance of this: a buyer was prepared to purchase Emily, the daughter of his new slave Eliza, at Eliza's insistence. Before he could make the transaction, however, the trader firmly stated that she was simply not for sale. He wanted to keep her for a few more years until she matured into a more valuable slave.

For the county seat, Staunton, state politics became local in the August of 1816, when a statewide convention was held in the town to, according to the Columbian of New York, amend or propose amendments to the [state] constitution. The delegates came specifically to debate questions of representation in the state legislation.

Dick Howard in his article for the Virginia Law Review, 'For the Common Benefit': Constitutional History in Virginia as a Casebook for the Modern Constitution-maker sees the Augusta Convention of 1816 as a part of a larger sectional conflict between the eastern and western parts of the state. Waves of migration during the eighteenth century, into Shenandoah Valley counties like Augusta, and subsequent prosperity and population boom resulted in political tension between the two parts of the state. These stresses were further exacerbated by economic slumps in the east and a general unwillingness among Tidewater residents to relinquish the power they had held in state politics since the state's creation, as reflected in the appearance of only 12 eastern counties at the Convention.

Travelers from Virginia to Kentucky in 1830 needed the river, but fortune did not smile on Robert Whitehead. After a breathtakingly beautiful trip through the countryside to the New River, Whitehead faced water levels lower than any in recent memory. With his chances of catching the steamboat back home dashed, he turned to a precariously small skiff constructed of thin strips of wood. Whitehead simply did not have any other options. "," Whitehead's transportation difficulties reflected the broader infrastructural problem of the South. In Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the North, sophisticated urban capitalists financed the vast majority of railroads. This was not the case in southern states like Virginia. Here the state government and local investors monopolized the development of the railroad system and never pushed to cut through Appalachia. When Virginia's rugged West began focusing on using its coal endowment to build a future with industry instead of agriculture, the eastern planter class that controlled Virginia politics often ignored the West's transportation needs. More firmly entrenched in slavery than their mountain neighbors, the easterners minimized the westerners' political influence because the former feared that in relinquishing political power to the West they would invite attack on their peculiar institution. The planters also resented western Virginia's focus on developing industries like the North, so they limited transportation projects in the western region. This stifled eastern Virginia's economic connection with western Virginia and limited the state's trade with its western neighbors. "," The South's poor transportation development stymied its economic gains from internal trade as well. Well-planned railroad lines and other infrastructural improvements connected and stoked the North's economic engine enabling it to achieve technological and industrial development gains. However, the ill-conceived, haphazard transportation networks in places like Virginia were unable to help develop a large number of the localities surrounding them because they did not tie economies together. By relying on local funding, Virginia's infrastructural network remained invariably spotty because poorer areas could not afford improvements to link up with the rest of the state.

To soothe their patriarchal consciences, Lewis's family made a point in his accounts to note how they kept mothers and children together when they sold them. Lewis's story was not atypical. Upon his death, guardians had probably taken control of his estate and hired out or sold enslaved people to keep his dependents in comfort. The rising popularity of hiring out enslaved people signaled an economic shift in the South. As some basic industry entered into southern communities, it became more profitable to rent out a portion of the enslaved population to work in the primitive factories that sprouted up in the mixed agricultural economy rather than keeping them on the farms. Slave labor was cheaper than free labor, so it appealed to factory owners as well. "," Some of Lewis's enslaved people might also have been eventually sold further South from Virginia. With land better suited to produce for the booming cotton market than the tobacco-oriented Upper South, the Deep South's demand for forced labor increased even as its northern neighbors' supply of unnecessary labor rose. Deep South demand meeting Upper South supply ensured a forced southern migration of enslaved people. Sophisticated slave trading firms in big southern cities like Norfolk or Richmond used urban slave markets to oblige the economy by sending down enslaved black people from further North to New Orleans and elsewhere. Slave dealers sold the vast majority of enslaved people in direct bargaining processes with potential buyers in the slave pens. Rapid sales in massive public auctions did not occur as frequently. This massive trade in people kept Upper South states like Virginia implicated in the slave economy."],"display_date":"January 24, 1834 - December 31, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-12","locations":[{"id":14530,"lat":39.4640522698,"lng":-78.0275332326,"zoom":9,"place":"BERKELEY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3512,"title":"Blackburn&#39;s Emancipation\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-03-02","end_date":"1835-03-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["General Samuel Blackburn, a lawyer, general in the militia, prominent and popular resident of Augusta County, died on March 2, 1835. While this would be of note in itself, of special interest is that in his will, according to the <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, General Blackburn liberated his forty slaves on the condition that they would immigrate to Liberia. Their trip was paid by his estate. No mention is made if the slaves reached Liberia, or if his wife, who survived him by five years, liberated the enslaved peoples immediately following his death. The <em>Annals </em>do stress his evangelical Christianity, including an excerpt of his will in which General Blackburn writes,  I die, as I trust, a Christian, believing as I must in the doctrine for the atonement by the death, the suffering and mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ..."," General Blackburn was not alone in Augusta County in his desire to send enslaved peoples to Africa. In December of 1831, a petition with the signatures of 28 Augusta men was sent to the Virginia Legislature asking for their support of United States Constitutional amendment which would give the United States Congress the ability to raise and appropriate money to transport free persons of color to the coast of Africa, and also, the power to purchase slaves then transport them likewise."," A belief in slavery was anything but static in the white South. Rather, opinions on thepeculiar institution varied widely. Melvin Ely's <em>Israel on the Appamattox</em>, recounts how slaves from Prince Edward County, Virginia, are set free, given land, and co-exist relatively peacefully with their white neighbors for over forty years. Yet Ely also notes that Blackburn's response, Colonization, was not uncommon among whites with qualms about slavery, although informal surveys taken just after Nat Turner's revolt seemed to show that much of Virginia's enslaved black population had little desire to move from their birthplace to Africa.

According to the Encyclopedia of the South, at the end of the Civil War West Virginia was an undeveloped and rural state with a population of only about 400,000, or about one-third that of contemporary Virginia. In part to attempt to counteract this imbalance, as well as take advantage of the ongoing influx of immigrants into the United States who were moving west, J.H. Diss Debar, the State Commissioner of Immigration for West Virginia, wrote a short book. The book promoted the benefits of moving west and its author hoped to secure for it the attention and confidence of that class of honest and enterprising workers in both hemispheres, whom we are most anxious to welcome as permanent settlers to our infant state. He then proceeded to write a most complimentary compendium of West Virginia and its many assets. Debar's description of West Virginia's assets attempted to take advantage of America's rapidly expanding population, as well as its growing economic prosperity.","West Virginia was, and still is, one of the most rural states in America. Its decision to separate itself from Virginia was related, in part, to the remote and hostile nature of its geography. Slavery, though present in western Virginia, was never as prevalent as it was in the eastern half of the state. The Appalachian Mountains that cover most of the state prevented the establishment of large plantations. The lack of a viable cash crop also reduced the necessity of slavery in the area. Plus, the settlers that had moved to West Virginia prior to the Civil War tended not to be the most industrious of men. As Debar so generously put it, The genuine West Virginian is not much addicted to precipitous motion, rarely loses his temper or self-possession, and beyond the acquisition of the necessities of life, limited by almost Spartan frugality, is disposed to leave the improvement of things around him to time and chance. ","The migration of settlers to the South came to a halt during the Civil War, but picked up speed with the advent of Reconstruction. The main patterns however, usually involved movement north into the more industrialized sectors of the country. West Virginia had benefited from a small oil boom during the mid-1860s which foreshadowed the coal mining and industries that soon became a large part of the new state's identity. The industrial revolution was just beginning in the South in 1870, but, West Virginia's economy had collapsed into mostly subsistence farming around the same time. Thus, though the large coal deposits under the Appalachian Plateau were a draw for the large mining companies that flocked to the region, it was the cheap labor provided by the poverty-stricken West Virginians that provided the strongest reason for the companies to invest in the area. The optimism exhibited in The West Virginia Handbook belies the generally poor conditions of most inhabitants of the state at that time. Though a burgeoning economy would sweep most of the nation into new prosperity, West Virginia would remain one of the poorest and less developed states in America."],"display_date":1870,"search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":14858,"lat":39.2111004793,"lng":-81.5150237232,"zoom":9,"place":"WOOD, West Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3527,"title":"Slaves Drown While Fishing\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-08-01","end_date":"1842-08-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On a blustery summer day, August 1, 1842, a fishing boat in which five slaves were traveling was swamped and capsized. Because of the nature of the gale that had blown ashore that blustery Charleston day, all five were presumed dead. The slaves were: Jefferson and George, property of Mr. J. Jeannerett, Ned of Mr. Mellichamp, William of Mrs. C. Macbeth, and a slave boy, Issac, of Mrs. Hughes. Although other had occupied a boat a short distance ahead of them, it, too, was in a dangerous situation and could not come to the rescue of the slaves' vessel. The storm that took place that windy August day caused many additional losses. Because the tide rose to an unprecedented height, most of the Charleston's wharves were covered in water. In addition, many streets were submerged on the Western side of the city. Some residents had to be rescued from their homes by boat. ","The influence of the weather on the antebellum South was a great one. Many of the city's slave owners chose rice as their main crop. If rice fields, some of which were located in close proximity to the city, became too flooded, then the harvest that year would be abominable. In addition, storms like these sometimes caused some of Charleston's more precious architectural resources to be destroyed. So much of Southern history can be and has been lost in events of Mother Nature. Environmental constraints pressured the inhabitants of a city like Charleston to adapt to different ways of life depending on the natural disaster.","Another important issue brought up by this newspaper clipping, which was clipped from a newspaper and placed in the Journal of Charles Heyward, a Charleston resident, concerns the relative freedom that Charleston slaves possessed. Slaves were permitted to be hired out by their owners to others, allowing bondsmen to diversify their skills. Because they could accept earnings for their services, sometimes they were able to buy their freedom. Slaves were also permitted to attend church services with their master. In addition, they were allowed to participate in other leisurely activities, such as fishing, because many did not live on their master's property. Those who did usually lived in separate quarters, so they could come and go with relative ease. Many Charlestonian masters allowed these activities, especially around this time period, in order to appear like benevolent Christian masters in an effort to suppress the idea that slavery was a cruel institution. However, others felt that allowing slaves this much freedom would cause insubordination and deterioration of the institution of slavery, as shown by historian David R. Goldfield. He also contradicts Bernard E. Power's book, <em>Black Charlestonians</em>, by noting that even though some slaves were able to diversify their skills through this freedom, many had skill levels that remained low, even lower than slaves on working rice and cotton plantations. This newspaper article shows that, although the situation of slave freedom ended perilously for the poor men in a boat, slaves in the greater Charleston city area enjoyed many more opportunities than those in other areas."],"display_date":"August 1, 1842","search_date":"1842-08-01","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3530,"title":"Northern Abolitionists Influence on Charleston\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-25","end_date":"1837-01-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the years passed, it seemed that more and more Americans became frustrated with the institution of slavery. But there were many in the South who dissented from this opinion, who held steadfast to the ideal that slavery was a just institution. E.W. Taylor was one of them. Taylor, who moved to Charleston from the North to become a slave owner, enjoyed the perks of ownership to the fullest extent. Presumably a bachelor, Taylor realized soon after making his purchase how enjoyable it was to have a female to make his house into a home. To Taylor, having a woman to cook his meals and clean house was the best gift slavery could offer. ","However, soon after his arrival in the South, Taylor was inundated with of anti-slavery propaganda from Northern abolitionists. Concluding that the actions of these abolitionists had the potential to cause separation of the Union, he was of the belief that abolitionists should pay attention to their own affairs. Many Southerners like Taylor believed that slavery was not the cruel institution portrayed by Northern abolitionist. In an 1837 letter to Jeremiah Wilbur, a friend from New York, he recounted the tale of a minister from the North who met a wealthy slave-owning woman from the South. Up until that point, the minister had made it known that he was against slavery and for abolition. However, the minister and the woman fell in love, and the minister began to change his previous thinking. He began to rant against Northern abolitionists and Northerners in general. Ironically, he had once been an abolitionist himself.","Abolitionism was a great concern for many in Charleston. Like Taylor, prominent members of Charleston society feared that if slavery was abolished, hired labor would come to resemble hired labor in the North- a cruel, cautionary tale against capitalism. Abolitionists were only causing distress in Southern cities like Charleston. ","Taylor's views on slavery and abolitionism echoed those of many Southerners, especially those who resented being inundated with propaganda. Abolitionists accused slaveholders of many cruelties, including forced reproduction and childbearing of female slaves, and not allowing slaves to practice religion, just to name a few. According to historian Ira Berlin, abolitionists experienced difficulty proving many of these accusations, but the mere appearance of those caused uproar in the South and planted the seeds of disunion, as seen in Taylor's letter. E.W. Taylor exemplified Southerners for whom abolitionist propaganda from perceived hypocrites raised the spectre of disunion. Yet, many Northern abolitionists were, in fact, free blacks who were drawing on their own experiences in captivity for information for said abolitionist propaganda."],"display_date":"January 25, 1837","search_date":"1837-01-25","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3539,"title":"Mississippi Congressman Calls for the Annexation of Texas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-02-20","end_date":"1845-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1845, the national debate over the annexation of the young country of Texas into the Union was in full swing.  Politicians stood on either side of the debate, effectively representing their constituents in the matter.  John Henderson, a Congressman from Mississippi, gave a speech to Congress on February 20, 1845, in which he outlined all of the reasons why the Union should annex Texas.  As Congress waited for his speech, Henderson prepared to explain why the addition of Texas would be in the best interest of the country, as well as his constituents. The motives Henderson gave Congress in support of his opinion were very diplomatic in nature, and effectively called on the language of the Constitution.  The underlying reasons, however, represent his attention to Mississippi in his decisions.  Frederick Merk outlined these reasons in his article A Safety Valve Thesis and Texan Annexation, which was published in <em>The Mississippi Valley Historical Review</em>.  Merk said that northern abolitionists, such as Benjamin Lundy, maintained that the entire process of migration, defiance of Mexican law, and revolution, had been a southern conspiracy to extend the area of slavery.  This extremist view shows the contrast between the North and South in relation to the annexation of Texas.  As Merk stated, Henderson wished to obtain more land for his constituents, as well as have complete control of the Mississippi Valley.     Henderson wanted to represent his constituents well, which meant that he should help them achieve more land to expand and develop into farms and plantations.  There was plenty of land in Texas, and the people from Mississippi were very eager to exploit it for personal profit, which so happened to involve the spread of slavery west of Louisiana.

Colonel Edward Lloyd of Virginia had one such vision that he would operate a plantation in Mississippi from Virginia, and its sole purpose would be for monetary gain.  After deciding on his plan, and acquiring the land in Mississippi, he appointed John Hargon to be the overseer on the plantation in Lloyd's absence.  This was not uncommon, and most people made money from such a venture.      Given the nature of the business, though, there will undoubtedly be problems with the plantation.  Hargon dated one letter to Lloyd as October 24, 1850.  There was a problem with the shipment of cotton from the plantation on the Pearl River, which runs through Yazoo County in central Mississippi.  Hargon said that the Freight are 125 c/bale   and only one boat which carry about 400 bale makes a trip once a week when they receive 500 bales a day.  Lloyd faces a predicament that was not unique to his situation.  He put a plantation in an underdeveloped area of Mississippi, and now he cannot ship his cotton to the market. ","At the same time, Hargon was forced to work harder for profits.  Stanley Engerman illustrates the pressure for plantation overseers to reap higher and higher profits.  Lloyd wanted to get the biggest profit for his investment, which forced Hargon to use fresh, undeveloped soil. This soil was farther away from the established commerce routes, and so leads to the predicament in which Hargon found himself.  Engerman states that this expansion helped as well as hurt the plantation owners in the exact way Lloyd and Hargon illustrate.  The greater production is not immediately met with greater transportation capacity, especially in areas that are not near a railroad.  The venture for slave holders wishing to run a plantation from afar was still profitable, but due to the economic circumstances of the southwest, the true profits would have to wait until the transportation industry catches up with the plantations' expansion."],"display_date":"October 24, 1850","search_date":"1850-10-24","locations":[{"id":7158,"lat":32.6346973664,"lng":-90.0338114186,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3546,"title":"A Pennsylvania Court Convicts Under the Fugitive Slave Law\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-08-08","end_date":"1851-08-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the news of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 reached Holly Springs, Mississippi, the citizens were very anxious to see how the North would uphold the laws.

The people of Mississippi knew that slaves would attempt to escape, and hoped that these new laws would help them keep the property in which they had invested so much.

The Homestead Act eventually gave approximately 160 acres of undeveloped land in the west to any man of twenty one years, on the condition that he must build a house of 12 x 14 feet and live on the property for five years.  This would not be a problem for people to fulfill who are coming looking for a life on the frontier.  Albert G. Brown, when he gave this speech on April 28, 1852, was a Senator from the state of Mississippi.  He was a democrat, and believed that the frontier should be settled.  As the Homestead Bill came to the forefront of the Congressional debate, he felt it was his duty as a Mississippian and a Senator to stand up for what he thought would benefit his constituents, the South, and the country as a whole.  People were afraid that this would bring in an influx of foreign immigrants, but he put that opinion down, and turned it around to seem as a beneficial piece of legislation for the North, which immigrants already overpopulate.  Brown though that the Homestead Bill would eventually spread out the immigration from foreign countries, and alleviate the immigration problems in the North.

Shannon states that southerners are those persons who are supposed to have been the most bitter against the homestead legislation.  The rest of the South took the opposite view on the merits of increased immigration into the South, and needless to say, theywere not very cordial. The South, in the 1850s, was a place of white social dominance and plantation slavery. The white dominance spanned across race lines and continued to affect the relations with different nationalities.

Edward Scott had offered his land to build the first courthouse, in the hopes that commerce would develop nearby and increase the value of his large patent. The proximity of the site to a section of the James River especially conducive to crossing aided this stratagem. In the coming decades Scott's Landing developed into the most important port upstream of Richmond. Various Scotts and nearby merchants tried for years to incorporate the settlement as an official town, but none were successful until John III, in 1818; the town was called Scottsville, and contained dozens of lots on land donated by John. In the following two years the town was party to other favorable developments. The founding of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville promised to bring large shipments of building supplies through Scottsville's warehouses.

Though born in Albemarle, Scott had already lived in the South some years, practicing medicine in Alabama. Like thousands of Virginians, he may have gone down South in the years following the War of 1812, to make a life in one of the new towns that cropped up all over the territory acquired from the post-war Indian treaties. Scott probably only returned east when he inherited the Scottsville estate upon his grandfather's death. Upon receiving his inheritance, he may have discovered himself unaccustomed to estate operation, and wished to return to his medical practice. Another possibility is that the general economic atmosphere discouraged him from focusing his life on the estate. Although the factors mentioned above aided the economy in Scottsville, the overall Virginia economy had been sluggish ever since the national Panic of 1819. It could simply be that when Scott was down South he met a nice southern belle. Well-to-do families from throughout the slave states maintained complex networks of society and marriage over long distances."],"display_date":"1818 - 1822","search_date":"1820-07-01","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3574,"title":"Another Train Wreck\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-04-30","end_date":"1890-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Rather than going to bed early Sunday night after a long day of church and family time, the city of Staunton spent the evening putting out a fire, only to then have a serious train wreck in the early hours of Monday, April 28, 1890. The No. 2 train on the C&O line from Cincinnati had cars derail after losing air power to the brakes. The train picked up even more speed because there is a descent into the Staunton station. Along with the increased speed, the engineer had to maneuver the train along the curves of the rail. The engineer managed to prevent the whole train from jumping track and saved many lives. The derailed sleeper car caused the most damage by destroying the 6-inch iron columns lining the platform. As this was a night train, there were many people sleeping in this car and they suffered the most injuries. The wreck caused the death of a young girl of the Pearl of Pekin Company, a Dramatic Corps. Her body, on which there was the silver cross of the King's Daughters Organization, was taken to a local funeral home and prepared for the journey to Jackson County, Missouri. The other townspeople took the injured to two residences and the Virginia Hotel. "," This article was not the front-page headline of the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>of Augusta County. Instead, it ran as the longest column under the headline A Night Horror on the second page with mostly local events. Oddly, the news writer did not comment about the lack of a hospital. A group of local women, the King's Daughters Organization, did note this absence and started a campaign to build the first hospital in Staunton. "," This one train wreck illumines so many new themes of life in the 1890's. There is the strong danger of railroads. From 1890 to 1900, there were over 6,000 accidents involving mail-carrying trains and the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>listed train accidents and wrecks frequently. Alfred D. Chandler has explained how railroads drastically changed life in the United States. Small Staunton connected to greater America and her almost 200,000 miles of operating line in a way that horses and boats never could have. These railroad connections created opportunities for the citizens. The trains delivered mail demonstrably faster and more efficiently, and kept people who moved (increasingly because of trains) connected. There were new economic opportunities for builders, operators, and those who wanted to sell products to other cities. The grain of Staunton had a new market that enabled farmers to produce and sell more than ever. Railroads also represented the possibility of mobility. People could travel and see cities the average person twenty years before never would have and people could simply travel quicker. The girl who died originally had been a telegraph operator, another important development of the nineteenth century. The young girl imagined a greater life for herself and railroads provided the means of pursuit. She left a steady job in the Midwest and moved to New York City to become a star, as so many people continue to do so today. This one newspaper article intimated to its readers that Staunton was not just a dot on the map.

Randolph concerning the relocation of his, to that point, profitable business. At the time of this particular correspondence, George was in Richmond, Virginia and he was writing back home to Buckingham County, where Benjamin had established himself as a prudent physician and a prosperous community member. This exchange between George and his brother underscores the complexities and anxieties that a nineteenth-century businessman endured on a daily basis, placing particular emphasis on the relationship between creditors and debtors and the complications of relocation.","Benjamin loaned his brother three hundred dollars, no small sum in the 1850s, so that George would have any easier time appeasing his creditors in anticipation of the rearrangement of his business. Because of Benjamin's generosity, George was able to pay his partners fifty more dollars than he had originally bargained for, a beneficent act he stated he was particularly glad to do as [his creditors] have been liberal and gentlemanly in their conduct. One of the most important issues George dealt with before moving south was the financial status of his farm; the balance of the letter takes up the savvy entrepreneur's ruminations over percentages and dollar amounts that he considered in order to best allocate his private assets and reap the greatest benefit from his financial relationships. According to George, things went very well in his latest meeting with his business partners and he assures his brother that his new connections promise to be pleasant and profitable. Finally, despite his previous assertions of his financial wellbeing, George admitted that he may need to avail himself of a man he calls brother Jeff and accept his offer of assistance to the extent of a couple hundred dollars.","In his letter to his brother, George Wythe Randolph typifies an up-and-coming southern businessman. Bright and industrious, George was eager to succeed in his endeavor to sell his farm and move south, perhaps in an effort to capitalize on the economic explosion of cotton that supplanted the tobacco industry of Virginia and the Carolinas. Despite the bountiful opportunity available in the booming industry, moving from one location to another carried with it great risks. George was fortunate in that he was able to establish amicable ties with his peers and create good business relationships, but relocation necessitated uprooting oneself from established social networks in the form of valuable connections that may or may not be renewed. Additionally, George's dealings with other relatively wealthy men illustrate one of the spheres of relationships between men in the South; this type of horizontal, commercially driven interaction was generally limited to white, propertied men with sufficient income to live beyond the level of subsistence, though in a few very rare circumstances free blacks were able to rise to the same level of financial independence."],"display_date":"November 5, 1851","search_date":"1851-11-05","locations":[{"id":13690,"lat":37.5722194747,"lng":-78.5287114945,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3577,"title":"Address to an Edgecombe Patriot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-01-18","end_date":"1846-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 18th, 1846, the ladies of Edgecombe county held a ceremony to honor the volunteers of the Mexican-American War.  Ever since the blood of American soldiers had been shed in Texas, the call of patriotism compelled many Americans towards war.  In Edgecombe, patriotic banners and speeches had been prepared for the men who would soon be off for Mexico.  Present at the ceremony was a renowned Senator of North Carolina, Captain Louis D. Wilson.  In the name of his country, Wilson had left his Congressional duties to lead a group of Edgecombe volunteers into Mexico.  Sarah E. Howard addressed Wilson and his men on behalf of the women of Edgecombe:","Appreciating the heroism which has impelled you at the call of your country to rush to her standard... we have wrought with our hands a banner for the volunteers...  Whilst the weakness of our sex forbids us to encounter the fatigues and privations of war, it has always been deemed appropriate that women should cheer on the soldier to the field.  In this we but emulate the example of the maidens and matrons of the Revolution, that Revolution which established those political liberties and conferred those social benefits, to secure which you have volunteered.  Your fathers waged war against the haughty Britons...  You are now engaged in a contest with the perfidious Mexicans, and the flag of '76 is the flag of '46... You have enlisted under that proud banner which has been consecrated to the cause of human liberty - the glorious stars and stripes of your country - it is the precious emblem of our noble confederacy of free and independent states... Go; our hearts are with you.","Women's activism was proscribed in the arenas of war and politics.  It was not their place.  Howard's speech accepts the role of women as secondary to the masculine political issues.  Even at such a powerful event, the contributions of women were still gendered.  Like the women three generations earlier, the female patriots of Edgecombe County could only craft banners and cheers in support of the soldiers.  The references to the maidens of the Revolutionary War and the community of Edgecombe are significant because these geographical and historical communities were what bound women in their place in the South.  As Jean E. Friedman notes in <em>The Enclosed Garden</em>, Southern women maintained their kinship networks during times of war, and these communities inhibited women from developing independent women's associations.  In Edgecombe, the meaningful communities for women were social, national and geographical, not organizations of gender."],"display_date":"January 18, 1846","search_date":"1846-01-18","locations":[{"id":9431,"lat":35.868028512,"lng":-77.6521883059,"zoom":9,"place":"EDGECOMBE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3586,"title":"Florida Canal?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-01-01","end_date":"1889-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The recovering South slowly caught up to the North after the Civil War in means of transportation. In a large a state as Florida, transportation posed a serious problem in the late nineteenth century. However, politicians felt that railroads were a priority since Florida is a peninsula. More than 300 miles of land also created a challenge to connect the Atlantic Ocean and trade from Europe to prosperous ports on the gulf side of Florida, like New Orleans. ","Politicians threw around the idea at the turn of the century of the possibility of a canal through the narrowest part of Florida. Feeding the frenzy of the idea of a Florida Ship Canal was the success of the ship building industries in Florida. St. Augustine would serve as the key link for the canal, which shows the importance of this coastal town during this time period. Ultimately, a stagnate economy prevented Florida from investing millions of dollars in a canal. Then after the influx of settlers to the state during the early part of the twentieth century, the idea was pushed to the back burner and considered a moot point. The Florida Ship Canal experiment presented an exciting idea of linking the Gulf of Mexico directly to the Atlantic Ocean. Nevertheless, a canal through Florida would have been difficult for railroads to overcome, which served as the primary choice of transportation through the twentieth century for Americans.

Bailey. After his resettlement, Bailey became an active participant in government serving as Superintendent of Labor for the Engineers Department of the Eastern District of Florida and was even a candidate for Alachua County's commissioner of roads. In his personal letter to his friends and relatives back home in Alabama Bailey describes a business transaction in which he was trying to decide between a bond for title or a mortgage. This description shows the lack of bank involvement with citizens on personal transactions. It is hard to imagine writing a check for a piece of gum now without a paper trail to a bank, let alone depending on someone for documentation of your property. In addition, Bailey goes on to describe life in Florida in 1885 with trips to Augusta, highlighting the freedom of mobility created by the new railroads. And who could write a letter on Florida without commenting on the warm sunshine and delicious watermelon, both bountiful in Florida? Mr. Bailey showcases the appeals of Florida during this time period after Reconstruction and illustrates why people flocked to see this frontier of America. ","A bitter battle of Reconstruction brought an idle economy and uncertainty about the future. However, Florida Democrat William D. Bloxham believed that the woes caused by Reconstruction and the panic of 1873 could be fixed by raising property assessment values. Subsequently, the value of property rose from 31,500,000 in 1881 to 70,677,000, just four years later. Florida was an attractive location to nestle down and start a family. The pleasing Florida climate and profitable agricultural society caught the eye of many wealthy and not so wealthy emigrants who settled in Florida from the late nineteenth century on. James B. Bailey jumped on the opportunity to establish a prominent life in the illustrious Florida frontier and is an example of the emigration of United States to Florida during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The river is located near today's Jupiter, Florida and acquired its name from an assumed thought that the fighting was over between the Indians and white settlers.","Soldiers came, gathered, and removed the Indians from their homes by the river. Some Indians escaped the soldiers' clutches and ran to warn the others. After being rounded up and made to walk toward the west, the Indians were put on boats headed in the same direction. After traveling on the boats, the Indians had to walk again. It was during the walk along the Trail of Tears that the Indians knew the treaties for removal were never to be just or fair like President Jackson claimed they would be. Along the trail, many would die from lack of nourishment, dehydration, and diseases, but those were not the true horrors on the trail.","Betty Mae's great-great-grandmother, Mary Tustenuggee Tiger a Seminole from the Snake Clan, told her the true horrors of the trail. Mary and her three daughters were four of the captives at the River of Lies. Mary and her eldest daughter were raped and used for the soldiers' pleasure along the arduous journey west. The eldest daughter was raped so much that she could barely walk, and her mom had to carry her. Other young women were raped on the trail as well. The soldiers had no remorse for their actions. They were like wild beasts who laughed and kicked the Indian women around while raping them and joked about it in front of others.","Innocent lives were taken by soldiers as well. Mary recalled to Betty Mae how they were driven like cows on the trail. Mary told Betty that when older people got sick or too tired to walk, they would fall and be whipped until they got up. If they did not get up and continue walking, the soldiers would shoot them. Mary even described how soldiers would throw babies in to a creek or pond to drown or hit them against a tree if the babies cried too much from hunger. Everyone was in danger of dying because a soldier would kill them for not complying with orders or wanting to rest. They were not able to ride in the wagons, not even the most elderly or sick; resting did not exist on the trail.","The stories that Betty Mae retold in her diary from Mary's story are truly nightmares. Most people think that malnutrition, dehydration, and fatigue were the worst conditions on the trail, but those conditions were nothing compared to the rapes and murders that took place. Betty Mae wanted to help her great-great grandmother tell her story so that the whole truth could be revealed about the Trail of Tears. In addition, the story symbolized how those who survived these harsh conditions not only triumphed against the brutality of the government, but also kept their clans and clan's culture and history alive.

Miss Baldwin even noted that there were no deaths that year. She also believed that the school had succeeded in teaching the pupils practical skills for life and a deeper sense of their personal responsibility to God. The school gave awards for many different subjects, including Latin, French, German, Faithful Practice on Piano, and English composition. Seven young women received diplomas for Music and Book-keeping."," <em>The Staunton Spectator</em>, the Augusta County weekly newspaper, ran the article as the lead local article. The paper reported the programme for each day's celebration and all participants' names. For the concert section, the names were given in a standard formal formula of Misses M Bingham, C Woodard, A Wine.... For the awards section, there was a less formal tone. The professors and instructors had titles, but the paper did not list the young women's names with Miss and some were in their common form, such as Annie instead of Anne and Lizzie instead of Elizabeth. "," Some young women attended Augusta Female Seminary for health reasons, but there were women attending because they had families who believed Catharine Beecher's principle that women needed a practical education to be successful mothers and wives and, eventually, she believed, have a profession. For the expanding middle class created by industrialization and urbanization in America, there began a trend to send young women to schools because the importance of women's work grew. According to Janet James, the question of to what extent women should be educated was entertained by everyone and in magazines, novels, plays and books. Three young women received diplomas in Music, but four young women received diplomas in Book-keeping, an economically and domestically practical education. Baldwin had been a pupil at the school and her tenure as principal led to the name change to Mary Baldwin College, also reflecting the more public role of women as leaders in education in the second half of the nineteenth century and fulfilling Beecher's desire.

That much was certain as they traveled to Washington D.C. from their rural home with Margaret's sister on Christmas Eve, 1877. What wasn't quite so certain was where in the city they could go to hold the ceremony. When they came upon a group of reporters waiting outside City Hall they anxiously asked how, where, and how fast they could be wed. Luckily, the reporters were just the people to ask.  ","Some of the reporters got them through the door of City Hall and to the Marshal's apartment, while others joined forces with some bailiffs to locate a marriage license and someone to officiate the ceremony. It took hardly any time at all before the two were wed in the Criminal Courtroom by none other then Reverend Byron Sunderland himself, who had come running to perform the marriage. This was the very first marriage in the Criminal Courtroom, which was usually the site of proceedings of a very different nature. That a marriage between two black youths could occur in an unconventional location with the help of all kinds of residents of the city of Washington was symbolic of the progress that the nation was trying to make toward equality for all men. ","However, this example of a spur-of-the-moment public wedding between two young, black individuals is more of an anomaly concerning how the idea of citizenship for freed black Americans actually materialized in real life. As David Herbert Donald points out, despite the fact that racial equality had largely been legislated by the 1870s, not everyone was as accommodating as the folks in Washington were that day.  In many parts of the South, there was no one to enforce the kind of treatment the law demanded. Washington D.C. stands out, at least in this example, as a more progressive part of the South, more in touch with the ideals for which the nation's legislators were striving. The Republicans who were in office had passed many laws requiring equal treatment in public spaces for black and white alike; in the case of this marriage in the courtroom, this idea was taken a step further, and the reporters were thrilled to be catching the first marriage in a criminal court room, a marriage of two black people no less. The significance and symbolism of this event is supported by the appearance of Rev. Byron Sunderland, a prominent black clergyman who had advised President Lincoln in the struggle for the emancipation of American slaves."],"display_date":"December 24, 1877","search_date":"1877-12-24","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3598,"title":"The Debate Over Colonization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-02-28","end_date":"1890-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Bishop H. M. Turner decided to pick up a copy of the Evening Star on the night of February 28th, 1890, when a certain headline caught his eye: Bruce on the race issue. The Honorable Blanche Kelsoe Bruce was an old friend of the Bishop's who had become a Senator of the state of Mississippi and moved to Washington D.C. Each man greatly admired the other for his work and his distinguished accomplishments.  Bishop Turner was visiting the capital at the time that he came across the attention-grabbing headline, and by the time he had reached his home in Atlanta at the end of his work-related travels, he had read the article. Suffice it to say that he was perplexed by what he had read, so he determined to write a letter to The Washington Post respectfully challenging Mr. Bruce's negative stance on the issue of colonization for black Americans.  ","Let the negro go if he desires or remain here if he prefers. Let him exercise his own intellect...when you say they have no desire to go to Africa, I say, who know the real condition of our race as well as any man who lives, a million at least of them desire to go somewhere, wrote Bishop Turner. He was trying to express that though there had been some progress made in the push for civil rights for the negroes of the U.S., the nation was still very much a racially prejudiced one. He argued that for some negroes, moving to Liberia was potentially the most advantageous escape from oppression in a white-dominated society; for others, moving to Liberia would only leave them helpless, forlorn, and bereft of their livelihoods, however stifled those livelihoods may be. You, Senator Bruce, say all of you stay here and wait for better times. I say, let us pray God and man to pass the bill of Senator Butler, and let a line of steamships be started between here and Africa, and let such of us as believe that we are not monkeys, and can do something without the white man's domination, go and try the experiment. ","He ended his letter, only to find it quite a bit longer than he had planned to write; however, this issue was very close to his heart and mind, and he wished he had all the space in the world to explain to his countrymen and his fellow black American, Senator Bruce, that it was high time Congress focused on the deplorable state of the negro race in the United States. The issue in this letter to Senator Bruce from Bishop Turner is the fact that colonization was perhaps the path to a better way of life for many black Americans. There was endless controversy in the capitol over colonization throughout most of the 19th century, and by 1890 when this letter was written, many black Americans felt that it should be left to each individual to decide whether or not moving to Africa was his chosen destiny. As historian Ralph Luker then points out, the longings of southern blacks to be freed from oppression continued to feed the dream of emigration... Turner was trying, with his letter, to emphasize that continuing the existing societal dynamic between blacks and whites in the South was futile; it was true that the tension that was growing between whites and blacks in America could neither be solved by sitting idly by and hoping for gradual equality, nor be solved by shipping masses of black Americans to Liberia to begin new lives."],"display_date":"February 28, 1890","search_date":"1890-02-28","locations":[{"id":1279,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3600,"title":"Congress Returns to the Capitol\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-01-01","end_date":"1882-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the winter of 1882, Frank G.

There was everything from quiet, demure hotels for politicians who wished to be close to the White House to more raucous, lively hotels where you might find Congressmen bantering the night away. Frank knew where he could find someone in D.C. when Congress was in session. ","This session was marked with particular excitement for two reasons. First, the Democrats had become the majority party in the House of Representatives; second, the national election was right around the corner so Congressmen and aspiring politicians were already hard at work, campaigning for their very near futures. Frank was thrilled to be in the capital at a time like this one. ","Frank G. Carpenter was an author during the 19th century who traveled and wrote commentary pieces on life and society around the world. What he saw in 1882 in Washington D.C. is quite revealing about the dynamic between the city and the Congressmen, as well as between the Congressmen, and other visitors, themselves. Naturally, the city took complete advantage of Congress being in session every year. The influx meant more business, more money, more intrigue - more everything. Between the visitors and between the Congressmen it was very interesting that party lines were very much a function of geographic origin, and even more so, were very segregating. This polarization Carpenter witnessed supports a piece of historian Vincent P. De Santis' view of the political scene at the time, which involved the proliferation of Independent politicians as the parties strengthened. Men split from their parties in attempts to induce real change. The parties had become political machines, facing off with one another on every level, incapable of reacting in kind to the actual issues that confronted the federal government."],"display_date":1882,"search_date":"1882-07-02","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3614,"title":"Amherst County Citizens Petition for a Railroad \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1851-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["According to W.W. Scott's <em>History of Orange County</em>, the period of time between 1848 and 1860 was relatively serene and well-organized in that particular area of central Virginia. Following the United States' triumphant victory in the Mexican War of 1848, one of Virginia's sons and a decorated hero from the war, General Zachary Taylor, was elected President. The era that began in 1850 is known to historians as an age of industrial and public improvement; the legislature and citizenry of Amherst County, for example, petitioned for the construction of a railroad connection between the cities of Lynchburg and Charlottesville. In 1851, the citizens of Amherst County wrote a petition to the governing body in Richmond arguing the position that the state of Virginia would be well-served if a connecting branch was constructed in their district. Citing the unity, consistency, and harmony that would result from the completion of the railroad, they argued eloquently and persuasively in the three-page memorandum. Their request was granted, and the decision to improve public transportation in central Virginia was not without precedent; in the previous year, a section of the Blue Ridge Turnpike was opened to public travel. The roads were engineered by General William Mahone, a man remembered as one of countless connections and political acumen and commemorated by Scott for his exceptional work on the highways.","Transportation during the mid-nineteenth century was still dominated by horsepower, and the opening of the highways provided an easier, more efficient passage through and around the Blue Ridge Mountains. In addition, the Orange and Alexandria railroad company was given special access to a private lot off the turnpike to construct buildings and operate businesses, a provision that would have increased employment opportunities and drawn a more focused attention at that particular intersection of railway and road. In addition to desiring one grand, systematized improvement, the authors of the Amherst County memorandum cited the increased potential for economic prosperity that would surely follow the construction of the connecting branch.","During the 1850s and 1860s, railroad technology was booming. Building on the advancements of earlier rail-related endeavors, such as the Baltimore and Ohio rail line that was the first to evolve into a major system, the railways of mid-century transported not only material goods but also the promise of economic expansion and proliferation. As the railroad snaked its way through the American South, it brought with it untold benefits of increasing population and the amplified opportunity for financial benefit. The construction and opening of roads like the Fredericksburg and Valley Plank Road and the Blue Ridge Turnpike not only facilitated improved travel in central Virginia but also, through its conciliatory provisions with flourishing railroad companies, opened avenues of future economic gain. Amherst County residents were acutely aware of this and, through a strongly worded petition to Richmond, affected a fortuitous change."],"display_date":"1850 - 1851","search_date":"1850-12-31","locations":[{"id":13622,"lat":37.6048121175,"lng":-79.1451153205,"zoom":9,"place":"AMHERST, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3631,"title":"Regulators in Louisiana Dismantle a Secretive Group\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-02-17","end_date":"1893-02-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["David Stern, a prominent storekeeper in Amity City, a city in Tangipahoa, Louisiana, was the leader of a secret society. The organization - an oath-bound society, complete with grips, signs, and password and the ultimate goal of banishing Jewish merchants, wealthy residents, and negroes from the well-populated parish of Tangipahoa - was highly guarded and only wanted a very small set of people to know of its existence. In selecting members, the group had to be especially careful to not approach the wrong men to join. However, they did exactly that, thus making the clan and its goals well known. Unfortunately for Stern, regulators were notified of the group and served notice on him to leave the area. The other members of the society were given warnings as well, and like Stern, they ignored their seriousness. Nevertheless, Stern and his cohorts did not pay any attention to the notifications, and later regulators sent them more. In an effort to remain in the area, Stern showed the warnings to several of his neighbors because he knew they would stay on his side - he was only a simple business man to them. The resultant publicity of this issue resulted in angry citizens and prompted regulators to force the group not to operate in the parish. "," In the late 1800s, white men and women of the South were still becoming accustomed to living in equality with those of differing race, religions, and viewpoints. Many were not ready to make the adjustment and stood stubbornly in their racist tracts. Groups like Stern's were not an uncommon result of white Southerner's views toward their changing lifestyle. A huge wave of Jewish immigration had just hit the United States, with tens of thousands of European Jews from Russia and Poland coming into the country. These immigrants had left Europe to flee persecution, but were unfortunately experiencing it in American, as well, where they thought they would be escaping it. Anti-Semitism was normalized in the U.S. by the 1800s, just like racism towards African Americans had been. Since the Jewish immigrants had a greater opportunity to be educated in Europe and African Americans did not have as much of a chance to be in the U.S., white citizens were very threatened by the Jew's existence in their country and thought they had a greater potential to take jobs from them, and therefore intervene in the business world and the economy. The first large scale movement against the Jews and other minorities was in 1852 in the organization of the Know-Nothing or American Party, whose creed could be summed up in two words: Americanism and Protestantism. This party, however, quickly split once it entered the world of politics. Stern's group was reminiscent of the American Party's ideals. Though the Anti-Semitism that the Jewish immigrants faced in the U.S. was a serious issue, it was not as widespread and enduring as the racism felt towards African Americans. Stern's clan was a precursor to much more radical and powerful groups, like the Klu Klux Klan, a group advocating white supremacy, which emerged in 1915. Clearly, forcing his prejudice and racist group out of the parish of Tangipahoa was not a solution to the problem and was direct foreshadowing of the horrors to come.

W. deBree wrote a letter to her father to tell him some distressing news.

Thirty slaves who were passengers on the ship had form'd a plot...to murder all the passengers and crew except two sailors who [were] to steer them to St. Domingo. Luckily, one of the slaves leaked the information to the servant of one of the passengers who informed her master of the plot. To take precautions against the possible uprising, the slaves were put in irons for the remainder of the voyage. This story must have had an alarming effect on Ms. deBree, since her letter contains nothing really other than its recounting."," Why would this incident cause Ms. deBree to be so alarmed? Denmark Vessy's slave insurrection plot in Charleston, South Carolina would not be uncovered for another two years. Furthermore, Nat Turner's rebellion was nearly eleven years later. However, the fact remained that white Southerners lived in fear of a slave rebellion as long as slavery existed. The brutality of an institution like slavery would certainly only breed a rebellion just as brutal. This was the white Southern nightmare. To Ms. deBree, this story was a close call, a near realization of the nightmare. "," An interesting point drawn from the letter was the slaves' intention to sail to St. Domingo following a successful takeover of the vessel. St. Domingo, or modern day Haiti, was a sort of utopia in the minds of American slaves. In 1804, a violent slave revolt in the small Caribbean country had resulted in the creation of an independent black nation. To white Americans, the successful slave revolt in St. Domingo represented the realization of the nightmare and the example of what may happen if slaveholders refused to remain diligent."],"display_date":"January 29, 1820","search_date":"1820-01-29","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3641,"title":"The Female Orphan Society of Norfolk, Virginia Receives a Generous Donation","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-01-01","end_date":"1817-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Eighteen Sixteen was an eventful year for the Female Orphan Society of Norfolk, Virginia. The number of girls under the care of the Society was increased to twenty and a smallpox scare in the city required a visit from Society Physician Dr. Alex Whitehead for a round of vaccinations for all the girls. However, certainly the biggest event of the year happened in July when the Society received a letter from a generous citizen of the city. The letter was from the Executor of the will of Captain John Maxwell informing the Society that 2,500 had been bequeathed to them for the purpose of establishing an Asylum for Female Orphans. Additionally, Captain Maxwell's Executor had already purchased a lot on Brigg's Point for the new structure."," The 1816 annual report of the Female Orphan Society shows their elation at receiving such a large donation. The report states that they would desire... to proclaim our gratitude to our deceased benefactor & to God, the inspirer of all good, for this generous gift which promises to perpetuate our institution as a lasting honor & blessing to the community. Their happiness is well understood when one considers the average yearly earnings of a small-time farmer during the era was well under one thousand dollars. Simply put, 2,500 was a lot of money."," The Female Orphan Society was not a fledgling organization. It was founded in 1804 by Norfolk women in order to provide a temporary home, education and training for indigent white girls, orphans or otherwise. In order to stay afloat, the organization relied on the generosity of private individuals, churches, relief agencies, and finally clubs or other organizations to provide food, clothing, education for the wards, and wages for Society employees. The fact that after twelve years the organization had not yet acquired their own building shows the difficulty of financing a charitable organization such as the Society. In fact, at the time the Society received the donation, they were just deciding that they had sufficient funds to attempt to look for a lot for the construction of their own building. Such a large donation allowed the Society to build a larger building than perhaps they had hoped, enabling them to expand the breadth of their charitable work. Orphan Societies such as the Female Orphan Society of Norfolk factored greatly in the lives of America's poor children from the early nineteenth century until the 1920s. The Society of Norfolk was typical of these early institutions in that it was established to help female children and dealt mostly with children who had one or more parents living. These institutions served to help a family through tough times by providing for a child until the parent was able to do so themselves. The Norfolk Society was also indicative of Orphan Societies at the beginning of the nineteenth century in that it was entirely funded by private donations and managed by specific religious organizations. "," Orphan Societies began to be established in response to changes in the United States as a whole. During the early nineteenth century, American cities experienced massive growth due to European immigration. Cities grew by leaps and bounds and the population of urban poor grew with them. Additionally, the growth of wage labor often left many of these poor families unable to care for their children after a tragedy like the loss of a parent. Finally, improved transportation facilitated the easier spread of diseases like cholera, which led to a spike in the establishment of orphanages after an epidemic in the 1830s. By the Civil War, Orphan Societies had become very common across the United States and were thought of as being the best way to manage the upbringing and education of poor children outside of their own homes."],"display_date":"January 1, 1816 - January 1, 1817","search_date":"1816-07-02","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3645,"title":"Steamship Lines of Norfolk, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1823-12-11","end_date":"1823-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The American Beacon and Norfolk and Portsmouth Daily Advertiser</em> of Thursday, December 11, 1823 contained two advertisements that concerned a new technology that would greatly change the speed with which Americans traveled their vast continent. Both advertisements concerned the establishment of steamship lines from Norfolk to important cities in the Chesapeake Bay region. The first of the two ads described the services available from the Baltimore Steam Boat Line which operated two ships, the Virginia and the Norfolk. The two ships offered voyages from Norfolk to Baltimore twice a week. The other advertisement of note in the Beacon concerned the weekly voyages of the steamship Potomac. This vessel plied a Chesapeake circuit, beginning in Washington, D.C. and stopping at Alexandria, Virginia before heading south to Norfolk. After stopping in Norfolk, the ship continued up the James River to harbors at City Point and Richmond, Virginia. The whole circuit took exactly one week, but the passenger could choose to ride any portion of it he or she desired, each segment of the trip of costing a different price. The fares ranged from 4 to 11 and included food and drink during the voyage. Although the price may have been a bit steep for the average Norfolk resident, steam travel made the voyage from Washington to Norfolk last only a little over a day.","The 1820s saw the emergence of steamboat travel on the Chesapeake Bay. Although in the early part of the decade, steamboats did little to affect the business of packet ships, they certainly attracted the attention of the citizens of port cities who noted both the curious sight of the little boats with their steam-belching smokestacks as well as the regularity with which the infant steam lines were able to provide services. Steamers such as the Virginia, the Norfolk, and the Potomac constituted this first wave of passenger steamers that began to appear all over the Chesapeake in the first few years of the 1820s. Slowly but surely, stubborn Chesapeake planters also began to realize the value of this mode of transportation that could be depended upon to get their harvests to port within one day in a variety of weather conditions. ","Technological advances like steamship travel and the later advent of rail travel in the 1830s contributed to the emergence of American tourism and the formulation of a distinct American culture. By the 1820s and 1830s, these advancements combined with a growing interest in America's natural attractions and a wealthy population resulted in the growth of American tourism. The construction of turnpikes led to more comfortable and faster stagecoach services, while steamboat travel made water routes both a faster and more reliable option. However, the price of travel in the early nineteenth century often deterred all but the wealthy. "," Tourism also changed how Americans viewed their relationship to the land. The formation of an American culture was greatly tied to American's perceptions of the landscape. Sears writes that from the beginning Americans had sought their identity in their relationship to the land they had settled. In the 1820s and 1830s, tourist attractions helped the young nation cultivate a sense of national culture in a country without the centuries-long traditions of Europe. In essence, tourism provided a means of defining America as a place and taking pride in the special features of its landscape."],"display_date":"December 11, 1823","search_date":"1823-12-11","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3646,"title":"Annual Report of the Norfolk Bible Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-03-07","end_date":"1815-03-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In early 1815, a charitable religious organization in Norfolk, Virginia by the name of the Norfolk Bible Society published its first annual report in the form of a small pamphlet. The pamphlet, which was presented at the annual meeting of the Society remarked upon both the activities of the Society in the past year as well as the Society's plans for the future. The pamphlet stated that the principal duty of the Society was that of procuring Bibles and Testaments and distributing them to the poor. The report stated that the Society had distributed 235 Bibles and 882 Testaments in the prior year. Some of these books were delivered to the poor of Norfolk, but others were delivered to the neighboring counties of Princess Anne, Nansemond, York, Elizabeth City, and even as far away as Matthews and across the Chesapeake Bay in Northampton. Donations were also made to the children under the care of the Norfolk Female Charitable Society and to the crew of the famous Navy vessel the <em>U.S.S. Constellation</em>. Finally, the Society made monetary donations, both to The Bible Society of Virginia and the Bible Society of New York for the printing of a French language edition to be donated to the poor inhabitants of Louisiana and Canada. The Norfolk Bible Society also listed future goals in its first annual report. The chief among these was the establishment of free schools for the poor.

These groups strove to put their printed religious materials in the hands of as many people as possible. The activities of these groups coincided with and served to drive the explosion of the American printing industry in the early nineteenth century. Small printing shops soon became ubiquitous while urban printing companies grew into truly massive industries that were intimately connected to religion. Early nineteenth century improvements in transportation combined with an increased access to capital brought on by the economic prosperity of the era allowed Tract and Bible Societies to reach a national audience.

In fact, the scene was so unnerving and immoral that one passenger decided to write a letter to the <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> to express his disgust. The episode began when the steamship happened upon a small boat while traveling up the river near Fort Norfolk. Hearing cries in the wind, the passengers spotted a small boat with a sail set, and a little boy, apparently not more than nine years old, holding the sheet and managing the helm as well he could. When the steamship motored closer to the sailboat, it could be seen that besides the child at the helm, there were two grown persons inside, both apparently lifeless. The one a negro man, laying across one of the seats forward, the other a white person further aft, concealed from view by the sail except one leg which was entirely bare and hanging over the gunwale. Quickly a rescue boat was sent out by the Virginia to find that the two people were not dead but stone drunk, and the person lying with one exposed leg hanging over the side was in fact the white mother of the little boy. The two adults had ingested a bit too much alcohol and had simply passed out in the boat, the black man having given the young boy the helm. There was no real problem until the boat got out into the middle of the river where the wind picked up and the vessel became too much for the little boy to handle. Luckily the Virginia happened to be passing by just in time to save the passengers of the sailboat from a watery grave."," The person who wrote the letter to the Herald describing the event, signed only as 'Q. Z.', expressed his disgust at the scene, saying that it was not proper for a man to be so thoroughly intoxicated. However, the thought of the woman drunk and laid out in so lewd a position was loathsome and shocking. The writer of the letter continued on to comment upon the horrible vice of drunkenness which caused the woman to put not only her life in danger, but also that of her young innocent son."," Though the letter can be read as scathing indictment of the consumption of alcohol, the antebellum South certainly did not have a substantial temperance movement. On the contrary, the temperance movement in the South prior to the Civil War was rather weak, perhaps because of its Northern counterpart's links with abolitionism. Furthermore, as this episode helps illustrate, drinking and drunkenness was not confined only to white males, although they did drink more frequently than did slaves or white females. While Mr. or Mrs. 'Q. Z.' may very well have advocated for the prohibition of alcohol, he or she was certainly not representative of the population at large and probably spoke out due to strong personal religious convictions."," Adding to the shocking nature of the scene of drunkenness was the fact that the white woman was in the company of a black man while splayed out in an indecent position. Interracial activities between white and black men in the antebellum South were often frowned upon, but such relations between black men and white women were outright condemned. The United States at the time was an extremely racist nation and blacks were thought of as being not only inferior to whites but actually subhuman. Additionally, white women were seen as venerable to the perceived hyper-sexuality of black males and were to be protected from their advances at all times. The fact that the white woman in the boat had exposed private parts of her body to the black man, or perhaps even the possibility that she may have been in a sexual relationship with the man crossed the bounds of decency in antebellum America. Q. Z. and the rest of the passengers of the Virginia certainly had ample reason to be alarmed."],"display_date":"August 12, 1820","search_date":"1820-08-12","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3650,"title":"A Request from the American Colonization Society \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-07-07","end_date":"1820-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 7, 1820, the American Colonization Society took out an advertisement in the <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em>.

These colonists were free African Americans who had volunteered to set up a black colony on the west coast of the African continent. The advertisement announced that the endeavor was so far a success and that there was no doubt that the colonists would establish a permanent settlement. However, the colonists still needed various supplies including tobacco, iron, tar, pitch, nails, medicines, flour, axes, hoes, and other various tools which the Society hoped would in part be supplied by the generous donations of Americans like the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth."," But why would white Southerners be willing to donate these sorts of item to blacks free of charge? What would make the American Colonization Society believe that they would easily receive donations from slaveholding whites? The answer is simple. Southern whites believed that a society where free blacks and whites coexisted peacefully was an impossibility due to the perceived inferiority of the black race. Therefore, the solution to this 'problem' was the colonization of the African continent by the free blacks of the United States. Thomas Jefferson himself believed that the most sensible plan for emancipation included a requirement for colonization. Furthermore, Jefferson believed the national government should bear the responsibility of financing the reversed black population flow. However, this idea seemed threatening to slave states whose entire economy was based on the forced labor of blacks. The 1820s and 1830s saw the greatest push for colonization and although the American Colonization Society succeeded in establishing colonies in Africa, the United States never adopted the program of full scale colonization because the great expense and the possibility of Southern secession if such a plan was carried out."],"display_date":"July 7, 1820","search_date":"1820-07-07","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3651,"title":"Improvements to the Dismal Swamp Canal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-11-17","end_date":"1819-11-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 17, 1819, the Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald rejoiced in reporting the news that the new and improved Dismal Swamp Canal was nearing completion and was soon to be ready for traffic.

The improvements to the Canal were slowed by winter weather and heavy late summer rains, but by November the Canal was once again filled with Boats incessantly passing and repassing, laden with the produce of the country, or with foreign merchandize, present[ing] a continued scene of industry and activity as far as the eye can reach, and impress[ing] the mind of the beholder with a clear conception of the importance of this great commercial thoroughfare.","The Dismal Swamp is a great expanse of soggy land comprising over 100,000 acres in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina. Though early settlers realized the land was practically useless for farming, it was bestowed with another valuable resource: timber. Following the Revolutionary War, General George Washington formed the Dismal Swamp Company with the intention of digging a canal into the interior of the swamp so that this resource could be better utilized. The canal he constructed was a small one and it became to be known as Washington's Ditch. Later, Washington's Canal was replaced by wider and deeper waterways. The canal was important to the economy of the region because of the timber it transported out of the swamp as well as the produce that traveled through the swamp from North Carolina on its way to Norfolk and Suffolk, Virginia. The goods that were transported on the Dismal Swamp Canal were vital to the economy of eastern North Carolina and eastern Virginia.","The 1820s saw an explosion of canal building in the United States of which the Dismal Swamp Canal was a part. Along with the Erie Canal and the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal, the Dismal Swamp Canal was seen as an important economic link between the coast and the interior. As well as providing coastal markets for interior goods, these canals also served to connect states and regions in commerce, accelerating the economic growth of the period. Finally, these waterways were often the proving grounds for new technologies like the steamboat. In all, canals like the Dismal Swamp Canal factored greatly in the economic and technological development of the young nation."],"display_date":"November 17, 1819","search_date":"1819-11-17","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3668,"title":"Northern Neck of Virginia Desires Immigrants\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-01-01","end_date":"1872-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Board of Immigration from the counties of Richmond, Westmoreland, Lancaster, and Northumberland assembled to compose their forthcoming pamphlet enticing immigrants to their regions of Virginia: ...our earnest desire is to attract to it and immigration not only from the northern and north-western states, but also from Canada and Europe.

Fredericksburg & Potomac had violated Richmond's laws, the city claimed, by running its steam- propelled cars through Broad Street. According to an ordinance passed on September 8, 1873, no vehicle of any kind was allowed to traverse that specific lane, the most important and populous street of the city. The F&P Railroad Company, on the other hand, charged that when Richmond chartered the company in 1834, the city specifically granted the company's directors the power to place whatever vehicles they deemed necessary on the railroads. The court eventually ruled in favor of Richmond, deciding that the city's inherent right to guard the safety and welfare of its citizens did not violate any contract between Richmond and the F&P Railroad Company."," In the Reconstruction-era South, railroads played a prominent role, expanding in number (mileage doubled in the years from 1865 to 1880) while functioning as a symbol for urban development and economic growth. Between 1868 and 1873, white southerners touted railroad construction as the key to revitalizing their war-torn region, and indeed, Judge Christian mentioned in his opinion that when the railroad company was founded, Broad Street was a mere turnpike, neither graded nor paved, with scattered houses on the side. By the time of the case, however, Broad Street had become a site of many retail businesses and served as a bustling tourist site. "," At the same time, railroad companies suffered their share of critics. Many felt that the railroads exploited their lack of supervision to act like institutions beyond the reach of legislatures or courts. For example, railroads often charged excessively high fees, but denounced suggestions of rate regulations as violations of private property rights. In the Richmond vs. the F&P Railroad Company case, the railroad tried to convince the judge that its charter cemented a right by contract forever, and under all circumstances, to run its cars by steam, thereby exempting the company from any form of city regulatory laws.

During debates for the December Legislative session, several people, including the governor, presented their opinions to defend the bank. Benjamin Yancey, after summarizing the previous remarks, passionately defended the bank. He provided a brief history of the bank in the state and differentiated it from the national bank. He explained why the state bank has served a public good even though most citizens were unaware of it. The bank, according to Yancey, had paid profits into the state treasury department that went to pay off public debt that financed public projects. Furthermore, the bank had never been in better condition and was financially sound where all available assets met its liabilities. Another example of the public good given emphatically was the loan to the Georgia Rail Road Banking Company. This loan provided resources to a company that would build railroads that will bring more connections to the state and bring in untold millions. Finally, Yancey demonstrated how the bank had kept the prices of slaves from depreciating. He cited an example in Alabama to persuade others to realize without the bank, the economy would not be in good shape. ","As seen during the 1830's, the issue of the bank of the United States became ever more important. The historian Michael O'Brien discusses the role Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun played in matters of the bank of the United States. O'Brien provides support to the position that the bank played a very important role in politics. Jackson, against the bank for ideological reasons, fought to defeat it. He removed the bank deposits, effectively killing the bank in 1834. Directly as a result of this, the Whig Party formed in opposition to Jackson. John C. Calhoun, another opponent to Jackson, favored the bank and fought against Jackson when he removed the bank deposits."],"display_date":"December 13, 1848 - December 13, 1855","search_date":"1852-06-13","locations":[{"id":11504,"lat":33.8449766897,"lng":-81.9100531274,"zoom":8,"place":"EDGEFIELD, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3692,"title":"The California Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-08-30","end_date":"1850-08-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Following the death of John C. Calhoun, Congress passed a bill concerning the admission of California as a state. The bill, classified as unfair to the Southern cause by the Keowee Courier, was protested by Southern senators in particular Senator Badger. The Courier reflected on the prudence of how to protect Southern rights within the senate proceedings. Concerns were expressed regarding what the future would hold in store if California were admitted in the Union as a free state. The great discussion involved several senators, Badger, Downs and Pratt, and whether or not they should enter a formal protest into the bill. Debates continued in the House of Representatives and involved whether or not to establish a territorial government for Utah. Nevertheless, the Bill passed the Senate with Senator Pratt of Maryland voting against the bill and Senators Downs and Badger abstained from voting on the bill. ","The compromise of 1850 had a tremendous effect on the country. Both Northern and Southern loyalists felt the compromise weakened their positions. As argued in the book, The Civil War and Reconstruction, Henry Clay, usually given credit for enabling a compromise, did play a pivotal role, but he did not lay out all of the terms of a compromise. Clay's dramatic Senate speech early on in the year summed up his life as a politician and continued the approach that slavery was bad and evil but did little to actually bring it to an end. Calhoun, before his death, gave a speech in the Senate saying how the union had lost its old republic sense that the hostility towards the South and slavery had to be stopped or else secession could be justified. Donald, Baker and Holt provide evidence to support that point and seem to indicate that secession could be close at hand.

Born a mulatto, he experienced both the advantages of being too white and also the disadvantages of being too black. For example, while slave traders attempted to sell him, he suffered because he was considered too white and spent time in horrible slave conditions as a result. After settling in South Carolina, he decided to escape numerous times but was always caught. He received as punishment numerous floggings and lashings; he was also chained and beaten. Those conditions only made him more determined to gain his freedom. He eventually escaped because he was white enough to convince others he was not a slave. He eventually reached Liverpool, England. ","The treatment of slaves was reflected in the treatment of Roper. Slaves responded by either individual resistance or group resistance through spirituals, work songs, or general work ethic. Overall, the treatment of slaves, as argued by Donald, Baker and Holt, reflected the white supremacists' views that they were fundamentally different than whites. Roper's narrative also reflects the treatment of mulattos since even some black blood in a person meant that a person did not deserve freedom. After arriving in England, he joined a Christian Church even though he was not allowed to practice in the Christian Church in America because he was a slave.

Few people probably recalled January 4, 1853, as a significant day in the history of the United States. However, on this day a very important meeting was being held in the small town of Marksville, Louisiana, and the fate of one man was changed forever. For this day marked the release of Solomon Northup from years of involuntary servitude after being deceived and forced into slavery against his will while visiting the city of Washington.Solomon was not the first slave, nor the last, to be set free from the chains of slavery. What makes his story stand out, however, is that he was not born a slave; he had worked various jobs throughout his lifetime, always looking to better the lives of his family. It was this desire to provide a better life for his family that led him to take a job offer that would forever change his life. While working in Saratoga Springs, New York, Solomon met two white men named Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton who offered Northup a job providing musical entertainment for the circus. They said the circus was currently located in Washington, D.C., but would be traveling back North; Solomon agreed to take the trip.  Although free blacks traveling through areas where slavery was legal could acquire papers as proof of freedom, documentation was not always a guarantee of safety.  In Washington, Solomon was captured at a bar, presumably drugged, and woke up a few days later, ill from his poisoning, alone in the darkness of a basement in chains.  He had been robbed of his documents, money, and ultimately his freedom. Slave traders used a variety of tactics to illegally enslave freedmen, whether by force or physical violence, or, as in Solomon's case, by tricking, drugging, and other deceitful means.  At the threat of death, Solomon was silenced and shipped to Louisiana where he spent twelve years doing hard labor. In the novel Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson, he reiterates this harsh reality by stating that, none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known, so they were sold with new ones. Although Mr. Northup sought to bring his captors to trial, they were never prosecuted and he mysteriously disappeared. To this day, Solomon's burial site has not been identified and it is still not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured, or died of natural causes. Walter Johnson best describes Northup's experience: despite the fact that he was able to achieve his restitution of freedom, he met the same end as many African Americans from that time; unexplainable, undocumented, and seemingly unnoticed disappearance."],"display_date":"January 2, 1853 - January 4, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3704,"title":"The Changing Nature of the Institution of Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-03-12","end_date":"1857-03-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the Supreme Court case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press. In an article published on March 12, 1857, The National Era ran an explanatory article breaking down the case and illustrating its ramifications.The article pointed out that, with the Dred Scott ruling, an African American could never become a citizen of the United States. More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable. If he or she were the victim of the ever-increasing practice of kidnapping free blacks and selling them back into slavery as with Solomon Northup, a freeborn person of color, then that person would have no means to pursue any kind of defense in their name. Though it was certainly not the only account of its kind, Northup's story began in New York where he was lured with tales of lucrative labor opportunities to Washington, D.C. There, he was drugged, threatened with death if he told anyone the truth about his true identity, and put on a boat bound for New Orleans where he would work as a slave for almost twelve years. Upon reviewing Northup's memoirs, Walter Johnson concluded Northup's account centered on a single question: who can be trusted?

He expressed his disgust for the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and its architect, Nicholas Trist. This letter comes near the end of Webster's career, and the letter revealed that fatigue from a long career in politics had begun to set in. Though he was clearly disgusted over imperialist actions taken by the United States in the West, which upset the delicate balance between free and slave states, his will and conviction appeared to be weakening.Merely six days later, the Senate ratified the treaty and America gained five hundred twenty-five thousand square miles of territory at a net cost of just under twenty million U.S. dollars. Daniel Webster had every right to be skeptical of the suspicious circumstances that surrounded the acquisition of the formerly Mexican lands. Trist negotiated the treaty without President Polk's prior consent, but Polk later agreed to the treaty and sent it to Congress to be ratified. Finally, in May of 1848, Mexican officials agreed to the terms, and the war was officially over. Richard Winders, a historian and former Curator for the Alamo, even went as far as to make the point that the United States' War with Mexico doomed the two great parties of the era by forcing their associates to take sides on the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories and indirectly on the future of the institution of slavery itself. In hindsight, Webster's fear of instability stemming from the new lands was correct, but at the time, the majority of Congress disagreed and Webster settled for peace, despite his unwavering certainty that it would be short lived.

This person was no established politician providing aid for victims of the Irish Potato Famine; instead, he was a small five-year-old boy named Joseph Klemm. When Joseph's mother read him one disturbing account from Ireland, his first instinct was to run and get his moneybox. After returning with it, Joseph informed his mom that he was going to carry his money to the man in charge of collecting donations to send to damaged families in Ireland so that his money could be used to feed and clothe the little boys in Ireland. The story of little Joseph is priceless, despite its obvious intention of boosting public awareness and aid to the devastated country. The boy took all of his savings, one hundred and three cents, and gave it all away with the best intentions. The author described in detail Joseph's sparkling eyes, claiming that they showed the workings of a truly generous heart. The author of the article felt that this story was an important account to convey to the public, declaring that such acts deserve to be noticed and commended. He also observed another little boy being entertained by the same story, read by his father just like little Joseph, the boy asked if he too could give his money away to help those in foreign lands.Though relief aid was vital and absolutely necessary for reconstructing the Irish economy, there were numerous disadvantageous circumstances that arose, even with massive amounts of foreign funds pouring in. L. P. Curtis' incumbered wealth illustrates some of these problems. Curtis states that both landlords and tenants depended on an elaborate and secretive system of short and long-term goals. Furthermore, in the post famine period, after the rural economy had become completely monetized, virtually every tenant farmer owed money to someone at one time or another. Despite these shortcomings, it was still acceptable to feel the way Joseph and the other little boy did during such a crisis. After all, it was benevolent acts like these that built up America's character in the eyes of nations worldwide.

Space in the paper might have limited the lauding of the city, or there was nothing left to praise. The article mattered to the inhabitants though and could only have fostered their sense of accomplishment. "," Edward Ayers has noted Augusta County's position as a border state before the Civil War. Its position in the Great Valley created connections in the North and in the South. The Valley Turnpike provided direct access northward for everything. After the War, Augusta had the same geographic location, but a different mindset because the country held a different attitude. It enjoyed the economic prosperity that the railroads and other technology had brought, but the city was a Southern city at heart. The citizens had a relationship with the South and its customs but there was a constant exchange of ideas, people, and products with the North, too. They could not ignore the stories of Northern events in their newspapers or the information a traveler on the B&O brought from Cincinnati. The Northern influence was strong, but so was that of the South. The Virginia Central Railroad connected the cities in Virginia and strengthened the Southern hold. It is important to note that in the late 1880's when the North and South were separating culturally, the city boasted of their opera house and band in relation to the South. This statement was a sign to the readers that the citizens of Staunton still firmly held their connection to the South, even if they used technological inventions that held greater prominence in the North.

In the late 1830s, Mrs. Randolph divided ownership of several plantations and a considerable number of slaves in her will. The bulk of her slaves went to her son Charles, but Beverly spent extra time dividing slave children to her other designated heirs, noting, \"to my daughter Lavinice I also give a girl called Caroline and a boy called Richard, the former the child of Maria and the latter a child of Fanny...\" This casual reference of forcibly removing children from their families reflects the fragile position of slaves, especially children, in the plantation South.","            While some planters gave the impression that they cared for their slaves and did their best not to separate families (especially children and their mothers), in most cases, simple economics won out over good intent. Records of slave traders indicated that sometimes 25 percent of their overall sales were of children sold individually in order to make the most profit. The division of slave families was also a regular occurrence when an owner died and passed his or her slaves down to their heirs or designated slaves to be sold in order to pay off debts. As in Beverly Randolph's case, children were completely separated from both of their parents in order to equalize her daughter's inheritance with no regard for the personal welfare of the slave mother or child. This unique vulnerability of slave children lent itself as one dark aspect of slavery, the destruction of a child's family despite the supposedly well-intentioned owners.

The Quakers completed this petition during their annual meeting in November of 1838.  The petition stated, \"we entreat you to legislate for the termination of slavery in this state.\" Nathan Mendenhall signed the petition, and Senator J. T. Morehead from Guilford County, North Carolina presented the petition to the Senate. The Senate received the petition a few days before its adjournment.  The Western Carolinian Newspaper reported the petition to the general public on January 17, 1839.  The journalist from the Western Carolinian did not write positively about the abolition attempt, and was shocked that the movement was happening \"at home.\" ","    A petition to Congress about slavery was very common at this time.  Congress was force to issue a gag rule to end the constant debate about anti-slavery petitions.  The major issue however, was that the Quakers pushed this petition from a very prominent slave owning state. Quakers were very vocal about their religious beliefs against slavery, which sometimes got them into a lot of trouble. The Quakers strongly upheld the idea that all men are equal in the eyes of God. Quakers also felt the need to obey the law and be moral citizens.  However, these two conflicting beliefs did not stop the Quakers' fight. Many Quakers, such as Nathan Mendenhall, were active in the manumission society.  This was a society that Mendenhall and his fellow Quakers created in attempt to set up new areas in Liberia for freed slaves to live.  Other Quakers owned \"freed slaves\" to keep them from being resold into slavery, worked directly with the Underground Railroad, and were active in court cases dealing with possession of slaves. Due to this obvious protest of slavery, Quakers faced many conflicts with their slave-owning neighbors.    Quakers received harsh treatment and persecution for their actions as well.  These problems caused many Quakers to flee to the new frontier.  The majority of the Quaker population ignored their neighbors' resistance and continued to fight slavery from within North Carolina.  Although the North Carolina Quakers were a peaceful and moral religious group, they still played an important role in the abolition movement from their location in a slave holding state.

A leather-bound book as tall as a man's forearm with robin's egg blue pages was then opened reverently, and a man's voice read aloud the last meeting's minutes.  After he finished, his hand held a pen poised above the first line of a new page, ready to record in flowing script the minutes of the newest meeting of the Philosophian Society.  ","The Society met to discuss important philosophical, historical, and contemporary issues.  During a typical meeting the members decided on a small question to discuss immediately and another question to more seriously and thoroughly debate at a later time.  For the postponed debate, specific members - often teams of two or more - were assigned positions in favor or against and given several weeks to prepare.","The March 22, 1861 meeting exemplifies the Philosophian Society's typical blend of topics.  The immediate discussion questioned whether Joan of Arc was an enthusiast or imposter.  For official debate, the men considered if \"a man [was] justified in obeying a law of his country which he [felt] to be morally wrong?\"  While the Philosophian Society covered both ancient and current issues, the minutes reveal that its members felt the latter to be more important because of the ratio of time and effort spent on each.  At the conclusion of the debate on April 5, 1861, the secretary recorded the Philosophian Society's decision: a man was <em>not</em> justified in obeying laws he felt morally wrong.  The Society's emphasis on contemporary issues also included the admittance of free  states into the Southern Confederacy, the taking of Fort Sumter immediately following secession, and the prohibition of the slave trade in the Southern Confederacy's constitution.  ","Furman's Philosophian Society mirrored the larger trend by addressing the divisive and emotionally charged topics of religion, politics, and war.  According to Jonathan Daniel Wells, debate was not limited to collegiate societies, like those at Furman or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but spread into the wider southern population.  Southerners established literary and debating societies to open dialogues in which they willingly and safely discussed such controversial issues for both education and entertainment.  Stephen Ash's depiction of John Robertson illustrates the importance of a safe forum.  John Robertson, an East  Tennessean who supported the Confederacy in a largely Unionist area, experienced violent and destructive persecution because of his beliefs.  Wells suggests that debating societies allowed people of different opinions to present their contradicting views in a civil manner without fear of retribution.","These southern societies applied their northern predecessors' models of organization and operation even as the gap widened between northern and southern states.  They grew in number and popularity as the middle class enlarged, serving an important centralizing and community-building function in a south divided by limited transportation systems and scattered populations.

In <em>The Mariner's Chronicle</em>, one gentleman on board described the scene in the boiler room as a \"complete wreck - a picture of destruction\".  He witnessed one man with \"the whole of the forehead blown away: the brains were still beating.  Tufts of hair, shreds of clothing, and splotches of blood might be seen in every direction\".  Outside the boiler room \"on every side were to be heard groans and mingled exclamations of grief and despair\" as men and women dealt with the injured.  One man's face \"was entirely black; his body without a particle of skin.  He had been flayed alive\".  To witness such horrors - fellow passengers in pain, near death, and begging for death to \"free them from present suffering\" - devastated the survivors.  The gentleman judged that between forty and fifty people perished either instantly, from injury, from inhaling steam or gas, or from drowning.  "," No doubt people faced danger when traveling during the 19th century.   John Burke in \"Bursting Boilers and Federal Power\" stated that between 1816 and 1848 about 233 steamboat explosions occurred.  The lack of regulation on the boilers at that time contributed to most of the accidents.  Steamboat explosions caused the loss of goods affecting the economy as well as the loss of lives affecting each individual and each family.  Ultimately, the loss of lives and goods played a crucial role in affecting American history.  The number of lives lost compelled American legislation to question how steamboats could become safer and whether federal power had the right to create regulatory agencies.    ","In 1824, the <em>Gibbons v Ogden</em> ruling handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that \"the power to regulate commerce, so far as it extends, is exclusively vested in Congress\" allowing Congress to regulate private business and to interfere where government had never interfered before.  As more steamboat explosions killed more lives, the American people reacted.  In 1830, Secretary of Treasury Samuel D. Ingham gave money to The Franklin Institute to experiment and inspect steam engine boilers.  The combination of the number of deaths due to explosions and the data from the experiments forced the Steamboat Act of 1838 to become law.  The Steamboat Act of 1852 established the Steamboat Inspection Service, one of the first federal agency to regulate private industry, allowing the Act of 1838 to be enforced by a government agency.  Aside from safer traveling, the impact of this legislation still affects Americans.  John Ward in \"The Future of an Explosion\" further explained, \"From that distant carnage on the rivers of the West came the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and all the other government regulatory and investigative agencies that seek to protect us today\".  A steamboat explosion occurring in 1830 changed the lives of Americans far after other transportation replaced steamboats.

The previous morning, railroad workers had started running the engines of the cars before it had begun to snow, yet the tracks were already frozen with a \"sheet of hard frozen sleet.\"  This situation would normally have caused a huge problem even in Richmond and Norfolk; however, because of recent improvements in the railway system and the car's standard motor and double gearing, however, the problem did not exist in Lynchburg.  The first car was easily able to move at a quick speed and remove all impediments on the track.  Not only did it clear the path successfully, but also made it possible for other trains to run safely for the entire day.  The article stated that the system had not only been improving drastically for the past two months, but also that shortly all the cars would be equipped with the double gearing, making the Lynchburg and western Virginia railway system would be \"second to none.\"","    The reason for this strong success in the railroad system was because of the recent purchase of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Company by the Norfolk and Western Railroad Companies.  While the Norfolk and Western Railroad Companies took indirect control of the Shenandoah Valley Company in 1883, improvements were slow, and because of bad tracks and still uneven tracks, profits hit an all-time low.  Money intake increased, and this final purchase in1890 was the key to success.   The new owners had a strict development policy and were attempting to improve the lines for the general welfare of the people and the growth progress of their towns.  This new and improved system meant a safe and successful route from Washington D.C. to Tennessee, encompassing many important counties in western Virginia.  Consequently, the Lynchburg newspaper had articles like the previous one as well as many comments made by citizens of the town in the \"Items of Interest\" section about their excitement for easy and safe travel as well as future growth of industrialization in their counties.  More specifically, almost every day The Daily Virginian reported the increasing profits of the Norfolk and Western Railroad Companies.  The people were proud of both the improvement of the railroad system and the growing development of their western proportion of Virginia, and were excited to talk about it frequently in their newspaper. ","    These same developments were occurring all throughout the South in the early 1890s as well.  While railroads had been prevalent for many decades, they were never completely safe and successful.  Because of the multitude of railroad companies, tracks were uneven, times were uncoordinated, and wrecks were frequent.  However, the post-Reconstruction period brought a time when the railroads could improve not only in large cities, but also in the less populated counties throughout the southern states.  In Lynchburg and surrounding counties, the Norfolk and Western Railroad companies attempted and later succeeded in doing this exact thing. Essentially, the railroad made it possible for Lynchburg and other small towns in western Virginia to further industrialize and grow in many ways that they were incapable of doing before.

Siller wrote a letter to his friend J.L. Twyman, a resident of Buchanan County, Virginia. From his room at the Washington Hotel in Lynchburg, Virginia, Siller described the details of his train ride to Anderson, South Carolina two weeks earlier. His three-page letter discussed in great depth the landscape of the various towns he saw, as well as the agricultural production of each farm he saw. Evidently, the type of soil – whether it was healthy red clay or nasty swampland – was very important to him and his letter's recipient since nearly half of the letter was a commentary on the fertility of the land. Siller additionally described the crops grown in each area, a reflection of his obvious interest in farming. Despite the fact that Twyman was a doctor and Siller presumably a businessman, this interest in agriculture was not uncommon at the time. ","Siller's account of the route his train took comprised a significant part of the letter.  He went into great detail to describe the fares – ranging from three dollars to six fifty per leg – as well as the length of the journey in miles and hours.  His account of the train ride was extensive in part due to the considerable number of stops and connections that the voyage to South Carolina from Virginia required.  Siller described many different towns along the route and mentioned constantly getting on and off the train to have a meal or take a break. At one point during his journey, he was required to descend the train and meet at a steamboat, where the boat took him to switch railroad services. ","The last portion of his letter to Twyman was a description of an accident on the train before the passengers reached Anderson. A piece of iron from the train track broke from the worn out trestles and caused the passenger car to flip and fall into a sand bank. The injuries Siller sustained were worse than most passengers' because his seat was in the front of the train; while most travelers left without a scrape, Siller dislocated his left shoulder and broke his arm. Although he was thankful that his life was spared, Siller was aggrieved by his eventful journey; his letter mentioned that his injuries caused him great discomfort and he was unable to sleep at night. ","Siller's letter to Twyman illustrated that transportation through the antebellum South by train was neither an effortless nor an enjoyable undertaking.  The South did not have a well-organized rail system that allowed for people and products to be moved around the region effectively. According to John Majewski, author of A House Dividing, \"Southern railroads took weeks to transport supplies and raw materials between eastern and western theaters.\" From Siller's emphasis on the agricultural rather than technological aspects of the train voyage in his letter, he demonstrated how much the South relied on agriculture. To a Southerner, farming was the main source of revenue and was considered the single most important aspect of life; technological development did not seem entirely necessary in the mid-nineteenth century. However, Majewski notes that \"a bountiful harvest counted for little if local railroad tracks were destroyed by foes… or if wagons… were impressed to serve the army\". The issue became a major setback for the Confederacy during the Civil War when the South's obsolete railroads created a severe disadvantage against the North's highly industrialized system.

A group of prominent Americans convened in December 1816 and established the Society.  Many liberal citizens advocated for the freedom of African Americans, yet few wanted their company as fellow citizens of the United States.  Returning the freed blacks to Africa seemed to be the perfect solution.  ","The underlying racial prejudice of colonization was covered by the attractive notion of spreading Christianity and civilization to Africa.  The <em>Elizabeth City Star </em>declared that Liberia was to be more than just an \"African asylum,\" it was to be a \"light, which we trust in God, will light all of Africa with its fires.\"  Ships sent to Liberia carried many freed blacks and also missionaries in the hopes of forming a Christian colony and redeeming Africa.  ","The article briefly mentioned the idea that taking freed blacks away from their lives in America and sending them to Liberia, a place unfamiliar to most, may be \"a system of cruelty worse than slavery itself.\"  However, on the whole, the newspaper thought that the goals of the American Colonization Society were divinely ordained and beneficial to all.

Dated December 21, 1822, the letter described some of the details of Perkins' journey, including an illness that befell one of his traveling companions, Betty: \"...all well exept bety and she has bin very sick on the road hardly expected her to liv and was very trobesom on the road with that not in her side....\"  The description of the \"not in her side\" seems to imply that Betty suffered from some kind of pain, or possibly even a bulge, on the side of her body.  Historian Thomas Wertenbaker asserts that medical knowledge in the antebellum South was rudimentary at best.  Especially in rural plantation societies like Virginia and Maryland, doctors were hard to find, and even if found they were not always likely to be consulted.  Many in the South believed that doctors did more harm than good, which is probably true considering their widespread use of such treatments as bloodletting and their lack of knowledge concerning germ theory.  In this light it is understandable why Perkins did not hold out much hope for Betty's survival.","      According to F. N. Boney, a number of Southern doctors in the antebellum period performed medical experiments on slaves.  Doctors used the prevailing belief that blacks were inferior to whites to justify the often grotesque procedures to which they subjected slaves.  They performed many experiments, including the trial of a new (and highly dangerous) vaccination procedure and even an effort to discover an effective surgical method for sealing clefts that caused bladder leakage.  Slaves endured unimaginable pain and suffering due to such atrocities, but in the doctors' minds it was all in the name of science.  Regardless of the means through which discoveries were made, medical science in the antebellum South left much to be desired.  Concepts that are considered self-evident today, such as germ theory, were unknown at the time.  Perkins described most of his traveling as such: it \"...was water Bound three times and was very mody....\"  Frequently surrounded by water and mud, his traveling party must have come into contact with an untold amount of pathogens.  Although these days it is viewed as common knowledge, many people in the antebellum South may have had no idea that such conditions could be breeding grounds for disease.  Unfortunately, Betty suffered the consequences of this lack of knowledge.

This ad placed by slave traders Franklin and Armfield, requested slaves between \"12 to 25 years of age, field hands, also mechanics of every description;\" they were \"determined to give higher prices for slaves than any (other) purchasers...\" This small example from one Virginia newspaper represented the growing trend during the 1820s and 1830s of selling slaves from the border states to traders who sold the dismayed slaves \"down river\" to labor on highly profitable cotton, rice, or sugar plantations of the Southwest and Deep South. Being sold to the Deep South was possibly one of the greatest fears of many Upper or Border South slaves. The prospect of being sold away from family and friends was considered by some, a worse punishment than whipping. ","            According to historian William W. Freehling, economic growth, booming land sales, and the invention of the cotton gin encouraged the interstate slave trade as cotton was very profitable and grew more productively in more tropical climates. Freehling also notes that \"between 1790 and 1860, Border and Middle Souths lost close to 750,000 slaves.\"  This drain was especially prevalent in the 1850s cotton boom, comprising a substantial percentage of the slave population of these states. In comparison, after the \"tobacco bust of the eighteenth century,\" the Border South was much more industrial, grew a wider variety of crops, and was more economically diversified and willing to sell their slaves \"down the river\" for a high profit. Most slaveholding southerners claimed to look down on these slave traders who made transactions possible, but according to historian Jeanette Keith, Isaac Franklin and his partner John Armfield were two of the most affluent and successful slave traders in the United   States. They later retired wealthy, purchased their own plantations, and married into elite families in Tennessee. They were also prominent Methodists. Many factors encouraged the slave trade during the 1820s and 1830s. Economics and profit to be gained in the cotton boom provided ample reason for traders to invest in this market.

James and his wife, Betsey Blackwell, had moved to Cooper County, Missouri in the late 1830s from Virginia, with Octavia, Betsey's sister, and her husband. James' letter in 1842 was one of several written by him, Betsey, and Octavia to the rest of the Blackwell family, who remained in Fauquier   County, Virginia. In these letters, they described their new lives in Missouri and enquired after their greatly missed relatives and friends. ","James and Betsey did not fare well in Missouri at first and James had to write to Elizabeth Blackwell in 1842 to ask for money. He described how he had to buy everything on store accounts because he had no credit, and as a result, store owners charged him more than the normal price. James had sold three of his horses to pay for the journey to Missouri and his remaining horse had gone blind, further impeding him from making enough profit to buy some land. Reflecting on his misfortune, James advised Elizabeth to \"tell everybody that wants to come here not to come if they have no money.\" In another letter written to Elizabeth Blackwell, her cousin, Sarah, also described the challenges of moving to Missouri, saying that \"in this new country Virginians have to encounter many hardships and undergo many privations...all who are well situated in Virginia had best stay.\" ","The Blackwells were one of many thousands of families who moved to Missouri in the nineteenth century. As described in \"Westward Expansion\", immigration began on a large scale after the War of 1812 reduced the Native American threat and as reports of prosperity in Missouri spread across the country. The letters do not explain why the Blackwells moved to Missouri, but usually immigration was motivated by economic reasons and possibly the Blackwell family was too big for them to all remain in Virginia. However, the Blackwell family would not have been the very poorest in society, for as James' description suggests, it was not possible for the poorest to move. The trip was costly, so the Blackwell family must have been relatively wealthy to be able to get to Missouri in the first place. James' letter also demonstrates that not all were immediately successful when moving to the new land.","Missouri settlers from the Old South brought with them the values of the society they had left behind. This meant that religion and slavery came to dominate Missouri life. Octavia wrote to Elizabeth in 1848 telling her that \"we are not in a heathen land but we have preaching and praying in abundance.\" Betsey described in 1842 going to a church in Missouri and feeling delighted, as it reminded her of home. The Blackwells' views on slavery are not clear but it seems that some blacks, who could possibly have been slaves or servants of the Blackwell family, travelled with them to Missouri. Octavia included in her letters messages from \"blacks\" to their family and friends in Virginia.  ","Immigrating to Missouri posed challenges for the new settlers but life did not change drastically. Life still centred on births, marriages and deaths, with all three consistently mentioned in the Blackwell's letters.  In addition, the health of each family member was still a main topic of conversation in the letters. Even though the Blackwells could not see each other frequently, family ties were still strong. Each letter contained a plea that their relatives in Virginia write back to them with all their news.

This particular article discussed how Central America would potentially provide the United States with routes of passage for naval ships.  These naval transit routes, specifically a possible Nicaraguan canal, would better enable the United States Navy to protect the nation from the threat of other nations.  Of particular interest to the United States was the Straight of Isthmus, which connected North and South America, for \"to us, on account of its geographical position and of our political interest as an American State, of primary magnitude, that Isthmus is of peculiar importance.\"  This strip of land was of great much importance to the maritime nations as it could potentially provide a water passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  ","At the time of this article a new Nicaraguan president, William Walker, was elected.  He called for an alliance with the United States, including an initiative of annexing Nicaragua to the United States as a slave state.  Soldiers from the United States went to Nicaragua in an effort to aid Walker in his bid to power for the Isthmus as a maritime transit route that would benefit both Nicaragua and the United States. William Mason, who went to fight in Nicaragua from the Virginia Military Institute, was passionate about the Nicaraguan issue and journeyed through Mississippi and Louisiana to gather other men who wished to fight for this cause.","Nicaragua's call for annexation to the United States was clearly an important issue at the time.  Its acquisition would have given greater power to the United States in its effort to obtain this transit route that would ultimately have given more power to the nation.  Ultimately the unstable political situation in Nicaragua posed too much of a hazard to the United States' troops and therefore the United States looked for different options in an acquisition of a canal.  The Nicaraguan issue's prevalence in the newspapers and in the passions of men such as William Mason, who willingly gave his life in Nicaragua, gave insight to its importance and the importance of a maritime transit route to the American people.

Siller wrote these words in a letter detailing a recent trip he had made from his home in Lynchburg, Virginia to Anderson, South   Carolina.  He was on his return trip, just outside of Petersburg,  Virginia, when his train car ran off the track and fell from a fifteen foot trestle.  He was thrown from the rear of the compartment all the way to the front.  ","            In the mid-nineteenth century, train tracks were made of flimsy wood and traffic traveled both ways on a single rail.  There were essentially no rules or regulations because the government was much more concerned about extending the infant infrastructure.  Between the years of 1850 and 1870, the web of tracks grew from 9,000 miles to 53,000 miles. Thus, all accidents were considered to be \"of human creation.\"  Luckily, accidents were rare because relatively few people traveled by rail and night travel was almost non-existent. The unfortunate thing was, however, that when someone died from a crash, it was not considered to be of much concern.  The death of livestock incited much more concern than the death of a traveler. According to historian Barbara Welke, \"this is the context in which belongs the sense that accidents were a fact of life which men bore individually and the celebration of American liberty and independence of action unrestricted by law and technology.\"   ","            In April 1861, on the eve of the Civil War, Virginia's railroads were still in very poor condition.  In addition to limited regulations, they suffered from \"multiplicity and limited mileage,\" as well as varying gauge sizes whose junctions sometimes resulted in \"a bottleneck where desperately needed freight cars often waited days or even weeks for their contents to be transshipped to other lines.\"  The railroads were also \"uncomfortably close to the land and water frontiers of the state,\" areas where Virginia was most vulnerable to attack.  \"Leading to its very heart,\" notes historian Angus Johnston, \"their possession was sure to be hotly contested by friend and foe.\"  And, of course, it was.

Eli Thayer for the free white recolonization of Old Virginia has revived the agitation of a great question which will never be stopped until the old State is revolutionized, repopulated, and restored to something of her ancient glory in the Union.\"  Indeed, Eli Thayer and his Homestead Emigration Company had, since his tour of western Virginia in 1856, eyed this region as potential land for his settlement of free, non-slaveholding whites.  Thayer was thus attempting to carry out his \"Plan of Freedom.\"  The newspaper had discovered that \"landowners of Virginia have offered over five million of acres to Eli Thayer, 'as cheap as dirt,' for cash.\" ","            Amongst this, Thayer could have relied upon several other sources of encouragement for his new colony.  The Mormon settlements in Illinois and Impresarios in Texas both demonstrated the successes of mass movements.  The migration of white settlers to western Virginia was not a novel exploit.  In Upshur County, New England farmers and stockmen had already settled the French Creek community in the early nineteenth century.  Thayer's own partner, John C. Underwood, had migrated from New York to a Clarke County dairy farm where he prosperously hired only free labor.","            Thayer and Underwood preferred to enable a large migration that could provide sufficient internal discipline to withstand pressures to \"become orthodox on the slavery question.\"  They wanted to provide a \"test of cultures\" so that free labor would promote the eradication of slavery.  Both Underwood and Thayer privately predicted that economic prosperity in a free labor society would show that unlike slaves, free laborers \"neither malinger, nor intentionally misunderstand, neither 'run away' nor 'steal ham and chickens.'\"  Underwood conceded that white migrants would push 'perhaps inferior' blacks from the Upper South to the \"cursed Lower South.\"  He wrote that because of slavery's \"injurious effects to the white race\" that Virginia should be \"deAfricanized & settled by white men with all the energy, love of Freedom, order, & education characterizing the Anglo-Saxon Race.\"","            The <em>New York Herald</em>, Thayer believed, would be essential to his success, because it had a large circulation within the slave states and its editor avoided \"inflammatory pronouncements on the slavery issue.\"  The paper clearly states its support for Thayer: \"Eli Thayer is now about trying the experiment of waking up the old State to her senses.  Depleted, poor, and crippled with debts, she is now in a good frame of mind for the application of the remedies of common sense.\"  Other papers, such as the <em>Wellsburg Herald</em>, expressed convictions that the people of western Virginia would accept the introduction of free labor.  Thus in the fall of 1857, Thayer established and began physical development of an industrial town in Wayne County where white New England emigrants worked as free laborers.  He named it Ceredo, after the Roman goddess of agricultural fertility, Ceres.  ","            The experiment would eventually fail when money came into short supply from national economic depression and the inability of some investors in Thayer and Underwood's company to contribute.  Both men had certainly \"tried the question,\" but never truly posed any threat to the Southern slave system.  Yet, as historian William Freehling noted, Thayer and Underwood emphasized that the buying, selling, and working of land, not the buying, selling, and working of slaves fueled most economic interests in the Upper South.  By introducing southern upper class land sellers to northern middle-class land buyers, Underwood and Thayer's company attempted to boost the economy.  Underwood once promised to a western Virginia entrepreneur that \"my northerners will double the value of your lands, make your neglected hillsides bloom with cultivation\" lead \"your hitherto neglected waterpower\" to ring \"with the music of the wheel,...and cause your desert to bloom like a rose.\""],"display_date":"April 21, 1857 - December 31, 1868","search_date":"1863-02-24","locations":[{"id":14833,"lat":38.1460994742,"lng":-82.4270334246,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4056,"title":"The Advent of Refrigerator Cars in the City of Richmond\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-07-15","end_date":"1874-07-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    Fruit growers all over the state of Virginia rejoiced on Wednesday, July 15, 1874 when <em>the Daily Dispatch</em> of Richmond reported that two refrigerated cars arrived in the city.

It makes sense that a Southern newspaper would not pay much attention to an oil company because the South was not nearly as dependent on oil as the rest of the country was.

In particular, there were still a disproportionate amount of railroads in the West and North compared to the South. The attempts to remedy the disparity had been largely unsuccessful up until this point. State legislatures gave railroad subsidies to companies hoping to spur railroad development; while the subsidies did add railroad lines throughout the South, the companies also abused the subsidies, using them for other purposes. Also, the lines were owned almost exclusively by companies in the North, so their effects on the Southern economy were limited. The difference in industry between the North and South was one of the things that lead to Southern secession from the Union, and even after the states were reunited the inequality in industry still remained a problem.

The treaty, or rather collective of three treaties signed at Medicine Lodge, Kansas in October of 1867, was a comprehensive peace settlement between the U.S. government and the Plains Nations of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.  Major provisions in the treaty were that the nations would move onto reservations in the Indian Territory and that the United States would help them become \"civilized,\" providing them with necessary supplies and instruction.","            At Medicine Lodge, most of the Native American nations wanted peace, but did not agree with the constrained reservation system that limited autonomy and pushed white civilization upon them.  Among the more outstanding spokesmen of Medicine Lodge were Chiefs Ten Bears and Satanta, who represented two of the most prominent nations, the Comanche and Kiowa, respectively.  Their two voices well addressed specific problems with the proposed reservations, but also addressed broader issues of Native American identity, prospects, and the nature of their relations with whites.","            Satanta, one of the major figures in the armed conflicts leading up to Medicine Lodge, argued very emotionally and emphatically: \"I love the land and the buffalo and will not part with it. I want you to understand well what I say.  Write it on paper.\"  Satanta argued that the land, the hunt, and the independence from \"medicine lodges\"-the churches and schools advocated by whites-were essential elements of his culture, his means for happiness.  Secluded from this lifestyle, he said, \"We grow pale and die.\"  He also emphasized the way in which whites interacted with Native Americans, saying that while he was open and honest with the commissioners, they were deceitful and unreliable.  Yet far worse for Satanta were the U.S. troops who, he said, \"cut down my timber; they kill my buffalo.\"","            Ten Bears was more ready for peace and as such his speech was gentler in tone, beginning with an expression of warm feelings towards the commissioners.  Yet he too blamed the United States for a great deal, saying that it was they who started the conflict: \"There has been trouble on the line between us...but it was...you who sent out the first soldier and we who sent out the second.\"  Ten Bears also broadly criticized the plans of the commissioners, rejecting the reservation scheme with houses and medicine lodges.  He stressed the freedom and happiness of life in the prairie and contrasted it with living and dying as the whites suggested, hemmed in by \"walls\" and \"enclosures.\"  ","            Ten Bears reiterated Satanta's consideration of culture, saying: \"I lived like my fathers before me, and like them, I lived happily.\" He further defended his right to this life based on the promise made by the \"Great White Father\" (the President), which guaranteed the permanence of land rights as they then stood.  Finally, Ten Bears argued that far from removing his people to a better location, the proposed reservation site was \"too small\" and that the Texans had taken away the land and timber that best supported prosperity.  The final words of his speech summarized the plight of Native Americans in powerful, fatalistic terms, saying, \"The white man has the country which we loved, and we only wish to wander on the prairie until we die.\" ","            Though not actually faced with extinction, the nations of Medicine Lodge were in the midst of such upheaval that the period could justifiably be called the end of an age for their peoples.  Arguments like those of Satanta and Ten Bears at Medicine Lodge were not new; Native Americans had long defended their essential rights, sovereignty, and freedom-political rhetoric that is itself very telling as it specifically caters to Western ideology.  Yet the virtue of these values were not enough to protect Native Americans in a seemingly intractable clash of cultures, wherein they were opposed by both U.S. governmental policy and the very real \"shock of civilization\" that saw the buffalo hunted almost to extinction while frontier settlements swept across Native Americans' lands, dominating them in trade and constantly fighting with them.  In the twenty years after Medicine Lodge, Native American sovereignty and their free, unsettled lifestyle, as espoused by Satanta and Ten Bears, were both rejected by the United States.  The two major blows came in the shape of a Congressional act in 1871 that ended treaty-making with Native Americans, and the Dawes Severalty Act in 1887, which divided up the communal land into individual allotments and made Native Americans U.S. citizens."],"display_date":"October 19, 1867 - October 20, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-19","locations":[{"id":4553,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Unorganized, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4088,"title":"Exiled From Florida\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1812-01-01","end_date":"1845-01-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Florida was originally settled by Spaniards, in 1558.  With the arrival of the British colonies, the Carolinas attempted to enslave the Indians in and around the Florida and Georgia territories.  A boundary was formed between Carolina and Florida, but slaves, Indian and African alike, crossed the boarder into Florida and further into Indian Territory.  The numbers of exiled slaves became so great in 1736, they were acknowledged by the Floridians, being referred to as Maroons, and also became allies in defending the territory.  Georgia was formed as a free colony between South Carolina and Florida and used as buffer colony to protect the Carolina planters' slave interests.  However, in 1750, a Creek Indian Chief named Seacoffee left the tribe with a large group of followers.  They traveled from Alabama to Florida, and under the Spanish colonial policy, they were incorporated into the Spanish population and entitled to land in the territory of Florida.  They settled near the area of the Exiles and refused all Creek laws.  These exiles were called \"Seminoles\" by the Creek Indians, meaning \"runaways.\"  They elected their own chiefs and became their own tribe.  Some members intermarried with members from the Maroons, as the groups merged into one entity.  They lived together in villages where the Blacks could build their own houses and farm their own fields.  The Maroons paid a tax of corn, vegetables, and meat to the Seminoles in exchange for their protection against slave catchers.","            By 1812, Georgia pushed for the Federal government to annex Florida in order to control the Indians in the region, and to control the new problem of slaves escaping from Georgia to Florida.  With no response from the Federal government, Georgia declared war on the Territory of Florida in order to occupy the territory and ensure the safety and welfare of their people.  They searched to find Creek Indians and the Exiles, who were all thought to be runaway slaves by Georgians, and ended the struggled in May 1813, with nothing to show for it.  ","            This conflict went unnoticed to the rest of America because of the War of 1812, and British involvement in North America.  The British allied themselves with the Exiles and the Indians, trading and supporting them through weapons.  When the British withdrew from Florida in the spring of 1815, they left the Exiles with their fort and the entire magazine of military stores.","            Even though British troops withdrew, a portion of America soldiers remained along the Georgia frontier to maintain peace with the Indians.  General Gaines commanded the Southern frontier at Fort Scott.  Growing sentiment within the army to return the Exiles to their slave owners lead to the first slave-catching expedition, undertaken by the Federal government.  Meanwhile, Andrew Jackson urged that the Exiles in Florida were a threat to the security of America's boarders, especially since receiving weapons and a fort from the British.  Jackson wrote a letter to President Monroe explaining the need for annexing Florida in order to emigrate the Indians west of Arkansas.

Having completed its cross-country trip more than four hours ahead of schedule, the Transcontinental Express finally ground to a halt.  The <em>Friends' Intelligencer </em>claimed that the trip, leaving from Jersey City at 1:00 A.M. on June 1, 1876 and arriving in San Francisco approximately half past nine on the morning of the 4th, was made by a speed train in \"26 minutes less than 84 hours,\" or three and a half days. Such a journey in a normal locomotive would have taken seven days. The <em>Scientific American </em>professed the Transcontinental Express \"to be the longest and fastest continuous run that has ever been made on any road in any country.\" This statement reveals the sentiment favoring technological innovation and record setting pace that prevailed in the society during that time. ","Historian Sarah Gordon claims that \"express trains\" were passenger trains that carried express packages and did not stop at every station. She states that these trains \"usually traveled about thirty miles an hour, somewhat faster than other through trains.\" Due to America's burgeoning economy during the 1870s and 1880s, most trains carried a combination of passengers and goods for exchange in other areas. However, slower passenger trains that stopped at every station were available for those who needed it. According to Gordon, these \"accommodation trains ran along through routes, usually at ten to twenty miles per hour.\" While practical use usually dictated the speed of trains, the social status of passengers usually dictated the service, luxury, and safety found onboard, at least initially. The luxurious Pullman cars, decorated in the style of Victorian England, and various private cars were often used by the rich for extended travel. These cars stood in stark contrast to the rancid, poorly lit, and anachronistic passenger cars and day coaches that were frequented by the poor, who often used the railroad for transportation over shorter distances. Eventually, as Gordon postulates, \"the railroads sought to draw all lines under the same rules of operation, regardless of passenger needs. Beginning in the 1880s the science of railroading began to displace remarkable social diversity of passenger travel.\"","Therefore, as railroads such as the Transcontinental Express became faster, more powerful, and more widely used, problems in the system led to the need for regulation and standardization. \"Especially between 1870 and 1900, railroads leaned in the direction of national standards in ticketing, time, track gauges, baggage, the structure of train cars, and the behavior of passengers.\" Not all attempts at standardization were successful. For instance, the Master Car-Builders' Association suggested standard brakes, seats, couplings, heating apparatuses, and ventilating systems on cars during the 1870s, but not all railroads could afford such upgrades to be made. At the same time, attempts were made to set ticket prices, yet none were very successful. On the other hand, many efforts at homogenization were successful. Standard time was universally adopted in 1883, making scheduling significantly easier and more predictable. Also in 1883, railroad companies placed a 250-pound limit on passenger luggage. Three years later, between May 31 and June 1, 1886, most railroads conformed to standard gauge of four feet eight and one-half inches wide, vastly improving the efficiency of transportation as railroads could connect with one another. By 1890, \"a new national standard of reasonable behavior\" permeated the railroad as employees, as well as passengers, were called to abide by a pragmatic code of conduct, \"to make public behavior compatible with urban technology and with the needs of crowds rather than the needs of the individual,\" according to Gordon. While trains such as the Transcontinental Express were setting transportation records, the standards on faster and more powerful trains \"developed to promote the efficient and safe transfer of passengers in all parts of the country.\""],"display_date":"June 1, 1876 - June 4, 1876","search_date":"1876-06-02","locations":[{"id":8523,"lat":40.7416518725,"lng":-74.0773468609,"zoom":11,"place":"HUDSON, New Jersey"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4128,"title":"Ambush of Round Mountain\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-11-19","end_date":"1861-11-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Many Indians disagreed to Secession, but not necessarily agree to abolition, either. Families owned slaves and continued to throughout the Civil War. Opoethleyohola, a Muscogee Creek Chief also known as Gouge, wished to remain neutral. Many other neutral Creeks followed him North of Indian Territory, which is now Oklahoma.","Colonel Douglas H. Cooper had been persuaded that 'Gouge' was a threat and had been offered support from E. H. Carruth, Indian Agent for the USA. He took 2000 troops, and began pursuing the refugees. His spies told him that there were more followers than first believed, so the Ninth Texas Cavalry joined them in their pursuit. Their Commander, Lt. Col. William A. Quayle, believed there \"to be 1500 strongly posted\" Indians, including 500 Jayhawkers, but later they numbered 9000. The Confederates numbered 2500; both they and the refugees were \"ill equipped for the winter march or for military action.\"","Gouge camped with everyone near the Creek Council at Thlobthlocco when he heard about their pursuit. He began to \"fire the prairies,\" leaving nothing to be foraged; thus slowing down Cooper. With the burning, it was still \"so dark [they] could not distinguish an Indian from a white man at three paces,\" which didn't help any whites, but it was easier for Indians as they are better at seeing in the dark. The flickering of the many bush fires and the moving of the tall grasses contributed to the confusion.","Late November 19, the front of Cooper's men, believing they had made contact with Gouge's pickets, followed the fire-trailers who lead them into an ambush. Near to Round Mountain the Texans gave chase. They were fired upon by the fire-trailers and dogs were sent through the ranks to disturb the men; they got into rank as quickly as the situation allowed. The Indians fired the bush to surround and shepherd Cooper and his men to where they wanted them, a \"timber-lined, horse-shoe-shaped prairie,\" where Cooper was welcomed with hot lead and whizzing arrows. They were \"fighting by the flash of the enemy's guns … on three different sides,\" but this did not affect the death toll. Six Confederates died, four were wounded, while one went missing; Opoethleyohola lost approx. one hundred and ten men. Cooper also lost six horses, some killed, and some stampeded.

Flagler was one of the wealthiest men in the world.  He was a partner in the Standard Oil Company with John D. Rockefeller and Flagler spent much of his wealth on expanding the state of Florida.  In the winter of 1884, Flagler came to St. Augustine, Florida to spend his honeymoon with his second wife.  The city left a mark on Flagler and he returned in March of 1885 just in time for St. Augustine's annual Ponce de Leon celebration.  Each year the city of St. Augustine would put on a great pageant to celebrate the landing of Ponce de Leon in Florida.  The celebration so impressed Flagler he was inspired to build a luxury hotel, The Ponce de Leon hotel.  Along with the young architect Thomas Hastings, Flagler had a big part in helping to create the plans for the hotel.","The Ponce de Leon hotel formally opened to the public on January 10, 1888.  The hotel cost two and a half million dollars and in its time it was reputed to be one of the finest hotels in the world.  The hotel attracted the wealthy and, President Grover Cleveland attended a ball held at the Ponce de Leon hotel.  In the year the hotel opened, the city's population almost doubled.  Flagler continued to expand the city building two more hotels, the Alcazar and the Cordova, across the street from the Ponce de Leon in the same season.  When Flagler realized transportation to the hotels to the south of Florida was difficult, he turned his attention to building railroads in Florida.","The Ponce de Leon was so well-built it still stands today.  In 1968, after 11 million dollars worth of restoration, the Ponce de Leon reopened as Flagler College, a small liberal arts college named for the man who originally built it.  Flagler's crew constructed the hotel so soundly it has survived all hurricanes that have passed through since 1888.  ","Henry Flagler made a huge mark on the state of Florida.  One of his most impressive structures still stands as a primary structure in the historical city of St. Augustine: The Ponce de Leon hotel.  Though it is now Flagler College, Floridians will remember it for the man who originally created it. Flagler's initial building of the hotel changed the history of Florida as it sparked Flagler to build many hotels all over Florida and railroads to transport tourists throughout Florida.

This was a road that led to economic prosperity for the South.  This was the Blue Ridge Railroad.  In 1860, the President of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, Edward Frost, in a report to the stockholders and the state legislature, reported on the condition and growth of the line, proposed a plan for its expansion, and requested renewed assistance from the government of South Carolina.  Frost started his report with a proposition to finish the railroad form Walhalla, S.C. to Clayton, S.C. Then, he reported on the past development of the railroad; noting that from 1859 to 1860, the government instructed and only provided the company with enough of a grant, 310,000, to finish the line up to Walhalla.  The railroad was initially planned to run all along the Southeast, from South Carolina to Knoxville, Tennessee.  But, the company ran into work stoppages and reduced state funding in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.  In this report, Frost proposed that the South Carolina legislature provide funding to finish the line to Clayton.  He argued that this would provide the other surrounding state governments with the incentive to fund the completion of the other proposed sections of the railroad, the sections in western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and northwest Georgia.  But, the railroad would have to be finished to Clayton, because it was a connecting city to these other areas.  According to the report, the completion of the road would be a major economic advantage, linking markets throughout the South.  Frost argued that the completed road would make this section of the South competitive with Northern industry and transportation.  Frost estimated the cost of the line from Walhalla to Clayton at about 1.5 million to 2 million and the total cost of the road to Knoxville at 4.5 million.  He asked the state legislature to provide 1 million in bonds to continue construction to Clayton.  Finally, Frost made a plea to his stockholders:  \"...in case the work should be discontinued, the officers of this company should be exempt from any aspersions of bad judgment or ill faith...\"  This report was intended to show his proposition and his plan, but if the state legislature didn't grant the bonds, Frost wanted to ensure the security of his position. ","    There was a major disparity in railroad transportation between the North and South; this lack of a developed transportation system would later be seen as a major cause of the Southern loss during the Civil War.   The case of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company is indicative of this trend of struggling railroads in the South.  Historian James Ward showed that Southern railroads, especially in the 1840s and mid-1850s, received less government aide and investment than their Northern counterparts.  He argued that this disparity in financing was due to the long-ranging effects of an economic depression in 1839, the reduced market price of cotton, and finally weakened European markets in the mid-1850s, due to the Crimean War.  These events depleted government resources in the South, creating this decline in government support of transportation infrastructure.  The reduced funding led to the work stoppages that hindered the completion of the Blue Ridge Railroad, and many other railroads in the South.  When the state had money to reinvest in railroads, the South was already technologically trailing the North by a decade or more.   The Civil War was approaching and the South didn't have enough time to complete the development of its railroads. If the South had more peace time to catch up with Northern technology, the Civil War could have played out very differently.

The slaves were brought to Savannah in small convenient groups. \"Half a Negro stock on major butlers plantation, fell to one of the 2 heirs of that estate\" Kembles noted.

It was Bryan's job to keep the slaves fed, housed, and healthy up until the day of the auctioning. Slaves were placed in cages before they were sold. The floors that the slaves slept and ate on were bare and cold. The clothing they received during this transition phase was minimal and uncouth. The children were more carefully dressed and cared for than adults.

The Ocklawaha River flows north from Central Florida, ending near Palatka, Florida. The river stretches over 100 miles, flowing into several large lakes in the Central Florida region. In the 1860s, the Ocklawaha River was cleared to provide a steamboat transportation route to Silver Springs, Florida, the end of a popular tourist journey (especially for Northerners) on the river. Many of the people who describe the entrancing nature of Ocklawaha River traveled it by steamboat.

The lyrics were published on May 25, 1881 in Sanford, Florida and later published into a book of poetry titled <em><u>Love, Home, and the Southland</u></em>. The lyrics describe the people who traveled the river, such as the Indians who \" 'Gainst the white man here rebelled\", and Hudson writes about how the white man pushed the Indians to vacate their land. Again and again, Hudson reiterates the beauty of the Ocklawaha, \"What though we bade young Spring adieu, there's left a still more glorious hue\".

The statement is only one of many Hardy presents in his 1887 book, <em><u>Oranges and Alligators</u></em>, that illustrates the verbal abuse other U.S. regions heaped on Florida. In defense of the state, Hardy wrote about the exotic nature and beauty of Florida that he discovered on his own journeys through the area. ","            Hardy relays an interesting personal story in this document about the assumption that Florida was malaria ridden. While Hardy was traveling in Orlando, one man in his group fell ill with a high fever and aching pains. The group assumed he had contracted malaria. In response one gentleman said, \"Malaria?...He can't have malarial fever, for there is no malaria here-Unless, he has been imprudent enough to be out-of-doors after sunset.\" ","            Insurance companies were as particular then as they are now. To the Hardy group's dismay, they discovered that because of the risk of malaria, most insurance companies declined to provide life insurance below a latitude line of 30° south. At that time the group was traveling considerably below 29° south. The rumor that malaria was rampant in Florida was not entirely false. Gordon Patterson's scientific journal stated that mosquitoes bred well in the many bodies of water covering the state. It took a yellow fever epidemic in 1888, one year after the publication of Hardy's book, for the government of Florida to develop a board of health for disease control. ","            Alligators were a big attraction for Florida tourists in 1887, just as they are today. While Hardy was traveling by Lake Maitland, a young man in his group heard of an alligator that had been spotted by the bank of a lake near a neighborhood. The young man, thinking it was dangerous, found it, shot it, and brought it home to display. Soon after, a resident wrote him a letter, saying he had, in fact, slaughtered a pet alligator the resident had raised from a baby. Hardy's description of the whole scene includes the observation that at the time, alligators were popular domestic pets in South Florida. Hardy also states that it was possible to mail an alligator to the North (alive, unless it died in the process); all it took was a box to put it in.

These correspondences explain that on February 28 the ship Black Warrior stopped in Havana on its way from Mobile to New York as it had done numerous times in the past and upon arriving delivered its manifest to customs as was required. The captain listed his cargo only as ballasts as he had ordinarily done since all other cargo was in transit. However, the Black Warrior also carried 1000 bales of cotton and the customs officer, upon learning of this, seized the ship and cargo without giving the captain an opportunity to change the manifest. The correspondence explained that the outrage stemmed from the fact that under Spanish law a captain had twelve hours from the time the ship arrived in which he could make corrections to the manifest if an error had occurred, a time which had not elapsed when the ship was seized. The captain immediately informed the U.S. Consul in Havana who attempted to resolve the matter by petitioning the Captain General of Havana to release the ship and cargo. But the correspondence states that the Captain General responded \"the law must take its course\" and so made a speedy end to this affair impossible.","Normally such a minor customs battle would hold little importance for the people of Charleston and the nation as a whole, but the escalating political interest in the affair is best explained by tensions between the United States and Spain around this time. The bulk of this tension was the result of the United States' continued interest in acquiring Cuba from Spain; a sentiment especially strong among Southern Democrats who saw it as an opportunity to create another slave state out of Cuba and among some moderates who hoped that the acquisition of Cuba would ease the growing tensions between the North and South. Also, some hoped that a war with Spain over Cuba would turn the nation's attentions from internal divisions onto national affairs and so alleviate the growing regional crisis in the United States. Thus, it is not surprising that in his essay Henry James tells \"Of the sensation created throughout the length and breadth of the Union by the detention of the Black Warrior.\" Many newspapers portrayed the \"Black Warrior Affair\" as an outrage and a slight against American honor that deserved retribution. Strong political pressure was exerted on President Peirce to act, and Peirce himself was not totally indifferent to the political possibilities this crisis created. While sentiments in the correspondence were not so strong, the author did emphasize the idea that the United States had been wronged in some way. He too called for action by the government to intervene in this \"outrageous affair.\" However, the Spanish government, realizing the political implications, quickly resolved the issue by releasing the ship and cargo. While there were some lingering political repercussions, American interest in the affair ebbed with this resolution and emphasis shift back to the problems of the nation.

The first Transcontinental Railway had only been completed a few days earlier but already there were calls from southerners for a route that was more suited to their needs. A southern transcontinental rail route was not a new idea though, and, in fact, there had been serious discussion about choosing it as the primary route before the Civil War. A Southern route became feasible after 1848 with the annexation of Texas and the vast territorial acquisitions from Mexico and in 1853 with the Gadsden Purchase. Moreover, this region's geological features seem exceptionally good for rail building. As the editorial notes, surveys conducted during the early 1850s painted the southern route as the far superior when compared to the northern or central routes that had been proposed. And southerners during this time had their own motives for preferring this route. Many hoped a southern transcontinental railway would liberate the South economically from the North by making the North reliant upon the South for access to the Far East. Additionally, it was hoped that a Southern route would open up the West to southern political influence and possibly pave the way for the spread of slavery. As it was though northern influence put plans on hold and politics leading up to the Civil War were enough to kill the idea for a period.","But shortly after the war hopes for a southern route were renewed. Many still believed that the southern route was the most feasible and efficient route, and the concerns voiced by the author of the editorial about the First Transcontinental Railway were valid ones. Snow has always been a challenge for trains and winters in the Rocky Mountains always have an abundance of it. The conditions the author describes of high, impenetrable snow drifts were not uncommon and long delays were always a possibility. Another problem not mentioned in the article was that of avalanches which could bury or destroy tracks and any locomotive unlucky enough to be in their path. The railroad companies did erect sheds and snow fences in an attempt to alleviate these problems but often times, as the author describes, these proved ineffective. More importantly these structures were expensive to build and maintain and only added to the costs of the already expensive railroads. Even so, the author's hopes for a southern route were not met quickly, for it was not until December of 1881 that the Southern Pacific railway was finally completed.

As one of the survivors of this horrible episode in history, she wrote a letter to Levi Fosdick on May 22 of the following spring recounting her experiences.  Her concluding remark was \"I have told the bad news, and bad as it is I have told the best.  No tongue can exceed in description the reality.\"","            Mary Ann Graves, along with her large family of twelve, left for California in the fall of 1846 and joined with the Donner Party, bringing the total number of the party to 81.  Reaching the mountains later in the year than anticipated, the emigrants were forced to make camp because the snow rendered the trail impassable.  Mary Ann remained in the camp from November 4 until December 16, where they barely survived on \"poor beef.\"  She and fourteen others left to seek help for the starving and desperate emigrants on the sixteenth of December.  On the eighth day of their fifty mile journey, the small party got lost in the snow-covered mountains.  Completely out of food, the men of the party had no choice but to kill two of the Indians traveling with them.  For the rest of the journey, they lived off of the meat of their former companions and acorns.  Mary Ann's father died Christmas night.  They finally reached the settlements on January 18, but only seven out of the original fifteen members of the party saw this day.  After hearing of the terrible sufferings of those still at the original camp, men from the settlements left immediately to go back and assist the survivors, including Mary Ann's mother and young siblings.

Davis of Gadsden,  South Carolina had to do some calculations.  While planning for his trip he took out his 1838 edition of <em>Mitchell's Traveller's Guide through the United States</em>.  The brown three by five inch book contained the mileage for all common stagecoach routes in the country as well as information on the few established railroads and canals.  The book was published in Philadelphia and lists the routes in an interesting order.  Rather than going alphabetically by state, the guide started in the Northeast, traveled down the coast to the Southeast, then moved North into the old Northwest.  In the back was a fragile foldout map of the Eastern United States. While generally accurate, there are several geographical defects in a Midwest scattered with the names of relocated Indian tribes.  Additionally, since the book was written in 1836, but not printed until 1838, Texas was included as a part of Mexico even though it was considered and independent country by the publication date.  Jonathan used the blank pages inside of the cover to work out travel plans and decided the best route was to go through Branchville, Augusta and Warrenton.  Doing some quick math, he found that the 149 miles to Warrenton would cost him 6 cents per mile or 7.94.  He then added the 7.40 it would cost for the 74 miles from Warrenton to Milledgeville, bringing Jonathan's journey to a total of 15.34 for a 223 miles.","            As the United States grew larger and more interconnected, transportation systems also grew more elaborate.  In 1838 the main mode of transit was the stagecoach, but canals and railroads were also beginning to transport both people and goods on more regular schedules.  By the 1830s travel for the sake of enjoyment or adventure was available due to lowering stage coach fees. Travel guides promoted exploration by offering descriptions of different areas along with practical information such as the mileage between routes.  Despite the varying lengths of stagecoach routes, it was customary to leave at four or five in the morning before the sun came up because at the start of a journey neither passengers nor stagecoach driver knew exactly what they would find on the road or how long the journey would take.  Weather conditions alone could change a short, quick journey into hours of jostling down a rutty, muddy road on the verge of flooding, and it was not rare for stagecoaches to flip if they encountered deep water.","            On multi-day journeys travelers like Jonathan stayed overnight at taverns along the way when there were no friends or family in the area.  Along with distances and fares, Jonathan also used the margins of his travel guide to jot down the names of acquaintances with which he might stay, as well as the names and rates of some friendly local taverns.  Many of the largest and best furnished taverns in the South had been standing for over a century, and specific locations might be known by travelers for particularly good food or rum.  Taverns fed and lodged visitors of all kinds.  They served as a unique venue where famous statesmen and ordinary men might share a newspaper (those unable to read pretending to understand), dine together, and enjoy the same entertainment in the taproom for a night.

Led by Major Buford, the diverse group consisted of pro-slavery activists of all stripes. They came from several Southern states, including Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, and Tennessee.  Leaving to much fanfare, the settlers departed after a reception at the Farmer's Hotel in Westport. There, Major Buford, the group's leader, was presented with a horse by a wealthy, pro-slavery citizen of the town. A banquet was held in the settlers' honor and a crowd cheered as a band played in celebration of the group's mission: advancing the pro-slavery cause in Kansas.","    Kansas was a flash-point for the national divide over the issue of slavery. Still a territory, its admission into the Union as a free or slave state would have dramatic consequences for the national balance of power. Resources, funding, and activists from both sides flooded into Kansas in an attempt to influence the territory's politics. Wealthy activists and groups funded and organized parties of settlers to emigrate into the territory. Migration quickly gave way to intimidation and violence as \"Border Ruffians\" sought to influence state government in any way possible.","    Pro-slavery advocates had good reason to celebrate as Major Buford's party left for Kansas. A correspondent for the pro-slavery newspaper, the Saint Louis Republican, wrote \"They are a fine looking set of young men, and if they make as good settlers as they are doubtless good fighters, Kansas will be greatly indebted to the originator of the expedition.\" Concerns over whether or not they would make \"good fighters\" made clear that the party's goals included a little more than just peaceful settlement. The band would indeed need \"good fighters,\" as well as hardy and resourceful young men; they aimed to jump into the fray that had become \"Bleeding Kansas.\" The departure of Major Buford's group was but one of hundreds of similar parties that poured into the territory from both sides of the divide.

In the spring of 1887, William M. Heard, an African American, brought suit against the Georgia Railroad Company after he was obligated to move into a segregated \"Jim Crow\" car. This action set into motion a series of court cases that specifically dealt with racial segregation in railroad cars and attempted to fight against the general ideology of Jim Crow.  Interstate Commerce Laws had been passed by congress in an attempt to deter such segregation, but Jim Crow was strong in the South and growing more powerful every year. Heard was one of the many brave men who attempted to fight the growing and terrible trend of racial segregation. ","Purchasing a first-class ticket in Philadelphia, Heard peacefully road the train until it reached the Georgia border at Augusta. The Atlanta Constitution describes how, at this location, Heard was compelled as a black man to vacate his car and ride in another car where \"the accommodation[s] were second class and inferior in every way\" to those in the first class car that the white passengers occupied. This segregated car to which he was banished was what became known as the \"Jim Crow\" car. Heard had been involved in a similar incident over a year before which had resulted in a successful suit against the company. The Constitution relates that he decided to bring additional suit against the Georgia Railroad Company in order to obtain further confirmation of the Interstate Commerce Commissioners' opposition to such practices by the railroad companies. The Georgia Railroad Company quickly objected to the suit based on \"various grounds\" including the \"jurisdiction of the courts,\" said the Constitution. The company quickly responded to Heard's petition by saying that the cars for the \"colored passengers [were] equally as safe, comfortable, and clean...as those provided for the whites.\" The suit was postponed for a significant period and eventually halted at a stalemate. However Heard had done his part in the fight against segregation of railroad cars. ","Heard was not the only sufferer who decided to fight back. Another suit was filed to the Interstate Commerce Commission by a man name William H. Councill. According to the May 31 Constitution, Councill was seeking 25,000 worth of damages for being \"forcibly ejected from a first-class car after having paid for a first class ticket.\" He was subsequently subjected to riding in the \"Jim Crow\" car. The trend had been set, and the Georgia Railroad Company soon found itself mired down with court cases. The ranks against the Georgia Railroad Company and railroad segregation began to swell even more with the key addition of Rev. George C. Rowe of Charleston. The Constitution describes how Rev. Rowe began a nationwide campaign after he and several other colored passengers were forced to ride in the \"Jim Crow\" car after purchasing first-class tickets. The purpose of Rowe's campaign was to rally support, both moral and financial, with which to bring suit against the Georgia Railroad Company and against racial segregation in general. While the efforts of men such as Heard, Councill, and Rowe may have fallen short in achieving racial equality, their fortitude certainly helped establish precedence for the long and difficult fight against inequality."],"display_date":"1887 - 1889","search_date":"1888-07-01","locations":[{"id":2193,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4306,"title":"Railroad Matters\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-10-13","end_date":"1873-10-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["1Thomas Scott was about to be one step closer to his ultimate dream. The President of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, Scott had an ambition to build a second transcontinental railroad, and even though he would never achieve this dream on Oct.  30 1873 talks began on a deal that would hand over the rights of the California and Texas Railway Company to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. For 10 days now rumors had been swarming about a merger but they were not confirmed by officials until yesterday.  They hope to come to an agreement that will benefit both parties equally. 2The Pennsylvania Railroad Company was in the height of its prosperity and a new and long awaited investment opportunity to build a second transcontinental railroad had just presented itself.  All of this was part of a railroad boom in the post-Civil War era that would come to be known as the \"age of the railway\" in American History.","            3Scott played an important role in the Civil War leading up to this time. He was appointed Assistant Secretary of War to oversee transportation in 1861.  He would later resign and then serve another term as a colonel for Major-General Hooker's forces in 1863.  Scott was able to lay the foundation for a wartime mobilization scheme that would eventually win the war.   He would later become Vice President of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in 1861 but act as president until he acquired the title in 1870.  Scott presided over the \"greatest period of expansion in the country's history.\"  Under his control the company became a major railroad trust that had many holdings all over the United   States.  These holdings even listed the Southern Security Railway Company which strived to connect Richmond and Atlanta with one continuous line.  This line would eventually create the I-85 corridor, relevant to the 21st century.","            2The growth of the railroads in the 19th century not only furthered American transportation for the time but also helped further the economy by creating tens of thousands of jobs for local and immigrant workers. State funding for railroads would quickly dry up as states demanded more and more control over the railroads that the railroad company's retained.  Regional tensions over where the second trans-continental railroad should be laid caused the dream to die at least for the time.  The railroad provided economic booms for local cities that had been previously unimportant but they also cause economic disasters on a national level.  The railway company's have even been blamed for some economic depressions such as the one in 1873, triggered by the failure of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company.  Also the bankruptcy of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Companies contributed to the Panic of 1893.  \"Regardless the attitudes, railroads became the dominant form of transportation and a major business enterprise.\"  It is clear now in hindsight that due to the work of great industrialists like Thomas Scott the railroad ruled America for over 50 years after the Civil War, and it continues to serve a pivotal role in 21st century America as well."],"display_date":"October 13, 1873","search_date":"1873-10-13","locations":[{"id":11231,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4311,"title":"Boston&#39;s Predicament: Women in the City\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-08-18","end_date":"1889-08-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["According to the Boston Daily Globe of August 18, 1889, \"Too Good to Lose Are Boston's Surplus Women.\" This article pertains to a matter of utmost importance, the eligible bachelors of the Wild West heroically discovering a solution for the \"marriageable femininity\" and the \"confoundly delicate matter\" of the over 80,000 surplus of women in Massachusetts. Belle Eyre even reports that these men are so \"self-sacrificing that they would solve the problem by marrying the whole 80,000.\" Belle Eyre also graciously published a letter, in the form of a poem, from ten dressmakers sending their solitude to the gentlemen of Tacoma Washington for the \"lovely life in that far-off part of this great and glorious land,\" and promising to \"Olympia there, ere summer does close,\" all with the post script \"We are all white women.\" ","Perhaps, though, the real heart of the matter comes towards the end of Belle Eyre's investigation when Gov. Andrew of Oregon expressed his views on the matter. Should women be \"driven to the competition of the market force with men, or where men are left unsolaced by the presence of women, society is alike weakened and demoralized.\" Hence, should men continue to desire their place at the head of the households, they should take immediate action to curb this surplus of women, should these women get out of hand and act rashly, such as trying to secure their right to vote, or other such nonsense. Hon. M. M Cunniff says though he doubts there actually is any danger of a surplus of women in Massachusetts, he should be glad for there to be double their present number. In fact, he adds, he would willingly give women \"greater opportunities than they have now,\" but he doubts this is what they actually wants; he sees their personal missions as producing \"men, not measures.\" ","Sarah Deutsch, in her book Women in the City: Gender, Space and Power in Boston, 1870-1940, finds women's roles in Boston in the late 19th century to be quite different than Belle Eyre's account. She discovers that Boston women, in fact, were not merely passive women, looking for domestic roles and adventure out west as mothers and wives, but active women who deeply cared about staking a claim in their male-dominated city. These women insisted upon creating an urban space that could meet their needs as individuals, in a society, which historically, denied these interests. Through her accounts of women through all socioeconomic stratifications, Deutsch expresses how these women formed female associations, overcame ethnic and racial diversity, expanded all conventional boundaries, advocated for playgrounds and settlement houses, and crossed all gender boundaries to create their own city in the spirit of \"urban femininity.\" Deutsch's study of Boston, M.A. throughout this pivotal time period, displays a character of the Boston women who, unlike Belle Eyre's account in the Boston Globe, chose to invest their faith and determination within their city, to create a modern city that could, in deed, meet the needs of a gender whose opportunity for equality and respect had finally come.

E. Burchell was traveling on the Pacific Express train headed toward Chicago during a heavy snow storm.  As the first engine, \"Socrates\" crossed the two hundred foot bridge, the iron trusses broke, causing the bridge to collapse. His eye-witness account describes the accident as the second engine and eleven cars were tipped into the creek seventy feet below and the wood and cast iron frame of the bridge twisted. He recalled, he heard cracking in the front of the car, \"then came a sickening oscillation and a sudden sinking, and I was thrown stunned from my seat. I heard the cracking, and splintering, and smashing around me.\" When the train reached the frozen creek at the bottom of the ravine, cars closest to the engine burst into flames. Burchell describes people attempting to escape the raging fire by smashing windows or crawling out of the shattered cars. He also witnessed several people die horrible deaths in the blaze, because they were unable to free themselves from the debris. Rescue efforts were abandoned when the strong wintery winds caused the fire to escalate. Passengers and crew on the train by J.E. Burchell's estimate was as many as two hundred fifty people.  Ninety-two people died due to injuries sustained from the crash or from the fire that plagued the wreck."," J. E. Burchell's account was published in the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em> on December 30, 1876, the day after the accident. The next day his story ran in the <em>New York Times. </em>Both of these newspapers were able to advertise the severity of the death rate and damage from the accident, because of the personal account of one of the survivors. The Ashtabula Bridge Disaster caused the public to wonder about the stability of the Railroad Companies and their constructional efforts to connect railway systems throughout the East Coast, and toward the West. <em>The New York Times</em> completed a follow up story at the request of their readers to address reasons why it had collapsed; \"the result of defects and errors made in designing, constructing, and erecting it; that a great defect, and one which appears in many parts of the structure, was the dependence of every member for its efficient action on the probability that all or nearly all the others would retain their positions.\" People were horrified that Railroad Companies, in hast of construction, neglected to administer safety codes or inspection. "," By the 1870s the American public was use to iron bridges collapsing, but the railroad was more of a public commodity, then in its earlier days. The more deaths caused by the railroad, the more people expected payment for their losses. Some railway companies sought to avoid having to pay the damages by sticking with wooden trusses, but the application of cast iron was cheap and easy to get then. The Ashtabula Disaster awakened the feeling of national shock. The reality that ninety- four people had died in the horrific accident and forty-three passengers of the Pacific Express were burnt beyond recognition became a catalyst for the government to eradicate these problems. In 1887 the Interstate Commerce Act was passed by Congress to ensure safer methods of construction. Ashtabula Bridge Disaster became one of the most publicized bridge collapses.

The Native Americans of Georgia were forced from their homes and lands because the state government saw the land as being underused and mismanaged by the Indian tribes.  This act of selling Indian lands was known as the Georgia Land Lottery and in 1832 it again sold off native lands to white Georgia citizens.","    The land sales started in 1805 as a way for the state of Georgia to grant land to qualifying citizens, white males.  This was an effort to try and stimulate the states economy and settle lands that the government had little to no real control over because they were occupied by Native Americans.   The system of selling land in a lottery format was unique to Georgia.     In 1814 the land sales came to a dramatic event when Creek Indians resisted land sales.  The conflict was won by Andrew Jackson and land sales continued.  In 1829 gold was discovered on land sold in the lottery and a gold rush followed which made the 1832 sale more dramatic.","    Prior to the 1832 sale of lands, the Cherokee people filed and won a Supreme Court case which ruled that Cherokee lands could not be taken from the Natives and sold by the state of Georgia without compensation.  President Jackson who had fought the Creek over the Georgia land lottery decided to ignore the Supreme Court ruling and continue with the land sales in the state.","A December 1832 article in the Columbian Star newspaper calls the sales of land in Georgia the \"Gold Lottery.\"  In the years prior to this particular land sale, gold had been discovered on the Cherokee and Creek lands resulting in a gold fever that  Georgia was happy  to spin into state profit.  Unfortunately for the state, the profits from the land sales only covered the actual costs of selling the land and little to no profit was actually made.  In 1832 Georgia sold 40 acre parcels dubbed \"gold lands\" capitalizing on peoples gold frenzy but not guaranteeing the lands would contain gold.   The obvious result of the land sales in December of 1832 was the displacement of hundreds and thousands of Cherokee Indians and the creation of a greater refugee population in the state of Georgia.","    The state and federal government solved the growing refugee problem with one of the most infamous Indian relations acts in United States history, the Trail of Tears.

Toy opened by providing a brief summary of his life, saying that he had spent many years traveling, often in the company of Africans, who had shown him much kindness.

The assumption by Toy that race prejudice would hamper the lives of free blacks in the future was well-founded One can see evidence of the kind of racial pseudo-science that had given the European powers the pretext to colonize Liberia in the first place.  Toy reminds his readers that there are three basic kinds of climates in the world, with the black race being best suited for the tropics, in which Liberia is located. Elaborating on this, he describes Liberia as a land of perpetual perfect summer days. Specifically, he says that even though it seldom rains, there is an abundance of green vegetation under a sun that is \"not too hot.\" ","As would be expected of any sales pitch, this pamphlet exaggerates. All in all, Toy makes Liberia sound like Eden itself, down to an abundance of trees with valuable lumber. As for water, there are apparently so many good rivers that \"no one ever suffers even inconvenience from want of good water in Liberia.\" Regarding crops, Toy says that lima beans grow so well in Liberia that little work yields a good harvest and there is so much palm oil that in a few years Liberia will make more money off palm oil than Maryland makes off tobacco. Even today Liberia is \"richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture.\"","As for government, the author states that the government of Liberia has been recognized by many of the Great Powers, with whom they share good trading relations. He also says (as our Founders would put it) that the Liberian government is run by Africans, for Africans. Later on, he states that this will forever be the case because of \"African Fever,\" a malady deadly to whites that blacks are naturally immune to (again showing use of racial pseudo-sciences). Prior to this, however, he tells his readers that the government of Maryland will gladly pay for their passage across the Atlantic. Here we can see just how desperate even the Northern public was to get rid of the Africans. After all, few governments of any era are willing to pay for anything (especially anything expensive) when there is little profit expected in return. Of course, this claim may be another one of the actual truths in this pamphlet. As modern sources report, colonization was \"a costly affair, and the [American Colonization] Society's founders strongly believed that any colony...would have greater viability if it [was paid for] by the United States Government.\"  ","Toy ended his pamphlet by anticipating and answering any negative stories his audience may have heard about Liberia. That answer: in a word, homesickness. He then goes on to add that within a few years people that are homesick will wonder why they ever stayed in Maryland. Finally, the author closes by praising Liberia's infrastructure, asserting that it has fine schools, mechanics, doctors, etc.  "],"display_date":1859,"search_date":"1859-07-02","locations":[{"id":5931,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4424,"title":"Ursuline Nuns Relocate their Convent outside the City of New Orleans\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1823-03-25","end_date":"1824-09-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1824, a dispute with the city of New Orleans drove the Ursuline nuns of New Orleans to leave their century old convent in the city for a new location outside the city. A drawing of the \"new\" convent shows an elaborate building with elements of classical architecture consisting of a three story convent, orphanage and chapel. Designed by architectural firm Gurlie and Guillot, the convent was decorated with galleries, columns, and Baroque ornamentation. Facing the Mississippi river, it rivaled many of the surrounding plantation homes in both size and construction. ","Before the Ursuline nuns relocated to this new convent from their previous location in the middle of the French Quarter, they had been an important presence in the city of New Orleans for almost a century. They arrived from France in 1727 to establish a school for girls in what was then a French colony. They provided an education not only for white girls of the colony, but also for slaves, free girls of color, and Native American girls. In addition, the Ursulines ran an orphanage and a hospital. In the years immediately following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Ursuline nuns experienced several conflicts with both federal and city officials. One such conflict with the United States government concerning property ownership within the city, led the nuns to purchase property two miles outside New Orleans with the idea of moving. In 1819, the nuns experienced a different conflict: as New Orleans expanded, a closed off street going right through the convent compound had become an inconvenience to the public. In response, city officials decided to open this street to the public, despite protests from the Ursulines. This decision was what drove the nuns to sell some of their city property and to construct a new convent outside the city. The new location gave the nuns the ability to expand as well as the advantage of both being outside the jurisdiction of city officials and of being out of the way of city development.","The convent cost 83,172 to build, and the chapel was an additional 23,635, a total equivalent to about 2 million today. Emily Clark argues that by spending this much money to build an extravagant convent, the Ursuline nuns were making a statement as self-governing Catholic women in a Protestant country that valued a woman's submission to the authority of a husband. In an ironic repetition of the city's attempt to encroach on the nun's interests in favor of development, the 1824 convent was demolished in 1912 to make way for the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal linking the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain. At this time, the Ursuline nuns again moved their convent and their school, both of which are still in operation."],"display_date":"March 25, 1823 - September 1, 1824","search_date":"1823-12-12","locations":[{"id":5595,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4423,"title":"Yellow Fever Responsible for Christian Miltenberger&#39;s Success in 19th Century New Orleans\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-01-01","end_date":"1838-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Situated at the intersection of Royal and Dumaine Street in the heart of the New Orleans, the Miltenberger House still stands as a testimony to one immigrant's accumulation of wealth and to medical advancements in the South during the 19th century. ","Little was known about yellow fever, especially ways to prevent or treat this disease. Almost annually, it seemed, the Gulf Coast and in particular, New Orleans, suffered mass outbreaks of the fever and any aid that could be offered from doctors in surrounding areas was much appreciated. Municipal medical examiners in New Orleans were quick in issuing licenses to practice medicine to refugee doctors, including Christian Miltenberger. While during his time in St. Domingue, serving as a surgeon for a British garrison, Miltenberger treated many cases of yellow fever and was well equipped to handle the outbreaks in New Orleans. ","With his experience in dealing with yellow fever, the Mayor of New Orleans saw great potential in Miltenberger and appointed him to supervise indigent health care for the Mayor's district. Miltenberger also had the opportunity to present a paper before the Medical Society of New Orleans in 1819, theorizing that yellow fever was not a contagious disease, thus changing the understanding and reaction to the outbreaks of yellow fever.","With this great influence on the medical community came great reputation for Miltenberger. He was an active mason and served as president of a commission to raise funds for the construction of a Masonic hospital in the city of New Orleans. Miltenberger also acted on an opportunity to merge 120 acres of his property with 320 acres owned by Madame Joseph Bayle, creating a rather large sugar plantation just outside of New Orleans. After buying her out three years later, Miltenberger became one of the wealthiest men in New Orleans, and by far the most reputable St. Domingan refugee in New Orleans.

The \"once free, always free\" argument was frequently used to the great benefit of enslaved blacks, in many cases leading to their freedom.

McLean discussed the horrendous traveling circumstances during the winter and spring seasons when crossing the different rivers and traveling over roads.  Some rivers could use steamboats, but the steamboats could not run when the rivers were full of ice.  Other rivers did not have steamboats because the rivers were too shallow, such as the North East, Big Elk, and Little Elk rivers.  The carriages transporting mail had to travel across the rivers at their shallowest points.  McLean reported that on one occasion a horse drowned, and several times the mail almost fell into the water.  McLean proposed that bridges be built over the North East, Big Elk, and Little Elk rivers to improve the quality of travel when delivering mail.  McLean also discussed the atrocious state of the roads that connected the different rivers.  The only turnpike that the mail carriers could use was the Baltimore and Havre de Grace Turnpike; the rest of the way was made up of poorly designed roads.  McLean asked whether better quality roads could be built and kept in good condition throughout the year.","John McLean was appointed postmaster general during the administration of James Monroe and continued his position into the John Quincy Adams administration.  McLean also had a close relationship with Henry Clay, Speaker of the House of Representatives.  Clay supported a bill called the Bonus Bill that would have called for a national system of internal improvements to roads.  The bill was passed by Congress in 1817, but it was vetoed by President James Madison.  Then in 1822, Monroe vetoed a similar bill that called for tolls to be used to collect money to help pay for internal improvements, which he deemed unconstitutional.  When McLean wrote his letter to Clay, Congress had already been debating for years whether or not the federal government should build post roads, for use by the post office.  These roads would be built by the federal government, and Congress would have the duty of upkeep and maintenance of the roads. ","In the early nineteenth century, states started to build turnpikes all over the United States.  This craze lasted until about 1825, when states started to cut back on their turnpike building; this was also the year that McLean wrote his letter.  Since states had mainly spent their time and money building turnpikes, smaller roads that needed to be built never got the chance, or if they were built, they were neglected.","Many states also focused on canal building, which left large numbers of small rives with no access across them.  Pennsylvania's rugged terrain made it very challenging to build canal successfully.  The state built canals much later than many of its neighbors.  It was hard to travel on canals when they were filled with ice, which meant that people had to find other means of transportation.  Building bridges over rivers was a solution to the problem because most bridges could be used at all times of the year.  ","McLean's letter discuses the debate during this period over who was responsible for building and maintains of canals, bridges, and roads in the United States.  Clay was a supporter of the federal government's helping with the building and maintenance of canals, bridges, and roads because states were not able to keep up with ever growing demands of transportation.  Others though, felt that the federal government should not be involved.  McLean's letter pointed out that states did not have the funds necessary to build and maintain different types of transportation all at the same time.  The only way that states could keep up with the demands of the times was if the federal government was willing to help with such ambitious internal improvements."],"display_date":1825,"search_date":"1825-07-02","locations":[{"id":5928,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4428,"title":"Immigration and Settlement Patterns, New Orleans, 1940","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/40","end_date":"12/31/40","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Although the second wave of immigration was a trickle by the 1940s, there were more immigrants than ever in New Orleans. The places immigrants settled were dictated by shifting physical and social geographies, conjunctures of the past, and the unique qualities of New Orleans. The distribution of settlers also reflected old settlement patterns as well as transformations the city underwent with growth.  ","Settlement was not random: it hinged on finding places that were available, affordable, and near jobs.  In the 1800s, immigrants settled in undesirable locations with the most environmental nuisances, the semi-rural peripheries. The peripheries offered the best housing and low skill employment, advantages that outweighed the undesirable characteristics of these locations. As immigrants put down roots, they established social and religious institutions and drew in more immigrants via those networks."," During the early 1900s, industrialization and the rise of centralized business districts transformed New Orleans.  New streetcar networks gave the inner city upper class the means to easily move in and out of the city.  Because they could afford to leave, they fled to the periphery, which was the most desirable area to live after A. Baldwin Wood designed a drainage system that eliminated swampland hazards and created more usable land. They left many nice town homes in the middle of the city. At the same time, unskilled jobs moved from the periphery to the core of the city, and immigrants began to move into the abandoned town homes, forming what would be called the \"Immigrant Belt\".","            The ethnic and racial history of New Orleans also dictated settlement patterns. As the city grew, Anglos settled in the upper periphery, and Creoles settled in the lower periphery, closer to the unskilled labor and cheap land. The Catholic tradition and festival ambience of lower New Orleans attracted many immigrants from the Caribbean, Latin America, France, Italy, and Eastern Europe. Jews, Scandinavians, and emancipated African Americans typically settled on the Anglo side.  This divide was perpetuated as immigrants moved into the inner city.  ","            New Orleans mirrored national trends of urbanization and also strayed from them. It was like many cities of the time in that it expanded, filled with immigrants, and experienced clumped settling patterns. Although people tended to gravitate towards others of their same ethnicity, New Orleans was unique in that it remained very intermixed and multicultural. Its reputation of being more accepting and diverse drew immigrants in and made New Orleans one of the oldest multicultural cities in the nation.

Like other immigrants in America, the Chinese in New Orleans had to balance the ongoing connections and relationships back home with the opportunities presented in assimilating fully into the dominant American culture.  Unlike other immigrants, however, Chinese immigrants were barred from becoming citizens of the United States due to the Burlingame Treaty of 1868, and so felt a strong obligation to obey decrees and laws of their homeland.  On December 26, 1910, in the final days of the Qing Dynasty for instance, the provisional national assembly decreed that all citizens should cut off the traditional long braid, or queue.  On January 13, 1911, the New Orleans <em>Times-Democrat</em> reported that the Chinese population of New Orleans welcomed the decree because the braids were \"burdensome as well as troublesome.\" ","Around one fourth of New Orleans' Chinese immigrants, including prominent members of the community like Hom Kin, had already cut their queues by this time, and most Chinese had ceased wearing traditional Chinese attire.  Furthermore, with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 restricting the flow of new Chinese immigrants into New Orleans, the younger generation of Chinese-Americans within the city began to lose touch with their cultural heritage.  Kin's son, also queueless, expected \"to be more American in his ways than his Father,\" and American-born Chinese readily adopted the language, dress, and customs of the interracial neighborhoods of Chinatown.  ","Many Chinese immigrants lived in nearby interracial neighborhoods, though most worked in laundries located throughout the city.  According to period photographs and research conducted by Richard Campanella, the core of China\"town\" only consisted of a handful of shops, grocers, and restaurants along the 150 foot long 1100 block of Tulane   Avenue.  Several other Chinese establishments dotted the surrounding cityscape.  The district was popular with New Orleanians of all races and social classes, who ate at the restaurants, shopped at the stores and grocers, and took their clothes to the laundry mats.  They also compelled many Chinese immigrants to abandon their customs in order to attract more business, and, in turn, the distinct Chinese influence on Tulane Avenue slowly disappeared.

In his speech, Everett discussed the reasons for the ACS, such as stopping the slave trade, and discusses their inspirations which include the spread of Christianity and American ideals.","Historian Irving H. Bartlett regarded Everett as \"conventional among Americans outside of the South\" in his views on slavery.  He knew that slavery was an \"unfortunate institution,\" but that it was protected by the Constitution.  This made Everett a relatively neutral party in assessing the accomplishments of the ACS.  Everett showed that the ACS had succeeded in its original goal which was to stop the slave trade.  He said that many other civilizations had attempted to stop the trade, but the ACS had actually done it by giving slaves that were on captured slave ships a place to settle and possibly assist them in finding their original homes. ","He later talked about the many reasons civilizing Africa had been a failure and why the ACS would correct this failure with their plans.  Everett believed that the white man could not civilize Africa because disease and cultural and environmental differences in Africa would not allow it. He went on to say that with all of the natural endowments of Africa, it had to be civilized because it was a waste of such a fertile continent. The argument of many of the critics of the ACS was that Africans were too inferior to Europeans to be civilized.  Everett said that this was not entirely true, and cited the example of the Egyptians and of many intelligent Africans who had been given appropriate education. Everett argued that if the lower classes of white men were compared with the African race then the superiority of whites may not be so apparent.  He compared the accomplishments in Liberia by the colony set up by the ACS to that of the first colonies in America such as Jamestown and Plymouth.  In Liberia they had already established a Constitution of organized republican government, courts, schools, communication to the interior, agriculture, and most importantly churches.  These accomplishments outstripped those by the first colonies of America in their first twenty-five years.","One of the main arguments by Everett was that Christianity guided the Africans into civilization and by the African Americans teaching the natives Christianity all will be civilized.  He said that the \"blessings of the Christians\" can be shown to Africa through the newly established colonies.  He thought that the influence of \"pure, unselfish, Christian love\" was the only influence that could never fail and that this alone civilized the world. Everett liked the idea of the spread of the Christian and American ideals to Africa more than the civilization of the Native Africans."],"display_date":"January 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-18","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4484,"title":"Failure of the Arcade Railway","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the second half of the nineteenth century, two of New York City's most prominent citizens, A T Stewart and William \"Boss\" Tweed, were also at the heart of city's constant growth and subsequent overcrowding.  Men like Stewart and Tweed invested in new construction projects throughout the city, which in turn brought more people into the city.  Meanwhile, New York's horse-drawn street cars, already carrying over 35 million passengers a year by 1858, were littering the streets with horse manure; early elevated trains were quickly filling to capacity and blocking sunlight and ventilation of the streets along which they ran; and immigrants continued to poor into the city's Lower East Side, almost 400,000 in 1873 alone.  The city needed new and innovative ideas to solve its problems and a number of interesting solutions came before the New   York state legislature.  One proposal to alleviate the crowded streets was the depressed Arcade Railway, which would have run along Broadway before branching out to the East and West Sides.  The plan, as portrayed in a color lithograph in the New York Public Library's Moving Uptown Exhibition, also called for the conversion of the cellars of street-level buildings into new subterranean shops to line the railway at an estimated cost of 2,296,950.00 per mile.  ","Extensive coverage by the New York Times shows that the Arcade Railway was opposed from its inception by A.T. Stewart who feared construction would disrupt the business of his department store.  The proposition was also opposed by Boss Tweed, who had introduced legislation to the senate for a pneumatic tube transit system just one day before the introduction of the Arcade bill.  While Tweed would have received large kickbacks from the pneumatic line, the Arcade line, which would have alleviated crowding and decreased travel time for many of his constituents, would not have been in the back pocket of the Tammany Hall political machine. ","The construction of an underground line was feasible for nineteenth century engineers, but was almost twice as expensive as an elevated line.  The Arcade railway would have required considerable alteration of sewage, water, and gas lines in the city, and would have caused major disruptions to street traffic during construction.  Despite construction complications, the Arcade idea was extremely popular both with the masses and with state legislatures.  Stewart and Tweed were influential men however; Stewart held protest meetings at his department store and led a delegation of concerned business owners to the governor's mansion, meanwhile Tweed manipulated New York politics to dissuade the project's popularity.  Their tactics worked as the bill passed through the legislature four times, only to be vetoed by Governor Hoffman, and New York's first subway, the IRT, only opened after the turn of the century."],"display_date":"1865 - 1875","search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":82,"tag":"A T Stewart"},{"id":134,"tag":"Boss Tweed"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4540,"title":"Tramps Attack Trains at West Chester Station on the Pennsylvanian Line.","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-01-01","end_date":"1877-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Desperate wageworkers after the Civil War had taken to riding the American train networks looking for work.

Chester County, as well as neighboring counties Lancaster, Delaware and Columbia are arrested more tramps and punished them severely. Despite the increases in punishments and arrests, the desperation of the tramps meant that their attacks did not abate, and they continued to act more lawlessly than previously.","The phenomenon of 'The Great Army of Tramps,' would continue plaguing railway lines and station towns well into the next century.

When prosperity returned after this gilded age, newspapers thought the end of the tramp was near.

A <em>New York Times</em> correspondent noted, “…when we arrived in Chicago we found every hotel full.” The first 100 miles of the journey took the excursionists through several major towns along the Illinois and Michigan Canal. Enthusiastic crowds met the trains with flags, marching bands, and even cannons.

The incredible speed, power, and efficiency that railroads afforded as a means of transportation soon became common knowledge among average citizens, businessmen, and politicians. The incredible potential for generating profits drew businessmen to invest in railroads. Railroads also promoted a growing industrial economy and served a military purpose when needed.

Boosters claimed that a hundred trains daily served their city.”","At the time, the horse was still viewed as a reliable and relatively fast form of transporting people from one place to another.  Over the next few decades, however, the slow modes of transportation would be ushered out, and the new modes of transportation would become more efficient, connecting regions which were hard to travel to in the past and opening up new opportunities for the American economy to blossom.","Alex Mackay traveled to the United States from Britain to tour the burgeoning country and write down his findings.  On a cold night in the winter of 1846, he made the voyage between Boston and New York, a voyage which can be made in mere hours by car or train today.  In order to breach the 215 mile distance between the two cities, Mackay had to carefully plan the route which he would take.  There were three routes that were possible at the time, and all of them included a slow-moving train and a steamboat.  Being that he was travelling in winter, there was ice in the Long Island Sound.  Taking this information into account, Mackay decided to choose the route which used the least amount of passage over water to reach the destination of New York.  Mackay recalled the factors that led to his choice in the book he published about his journey upon his return to his home; “The Long Island Railway being blocked up by snow, I selected the route by Norwich in preference to that by Stonington, the former curtailing the sea voyage by about thirty miles, a serious consideration, as the navigation of the Sound was then rather perilous, owing to the masses of ice with which it was obstructed.”","Apart from the possibility of meeting danger on sea with chunks of floating ice obstructing a steamboat’s way, Mackay ran into discomfort and warnings of danger on the rails as well.  Aside from the mere bulk of the itinerary, the configuration of the train cars had to be adjusted due to the cold weather.  “In winter, two or three seats are removed from one side to make way for a small stove”.  The cars were described as packed already, but the chance of being scalded by the only means of heating a car which would otherwise be frozen added to the danger of travelling in a cramped, slow, dirty mode of transportation.","In an attempt to escape the horde of people crammed into the cars of the train, Mackay ventured outside into the frigid winter night.  On an outside platform of the train, he met a conductor, and had a brief, amusing conversation with him.  The conductor suggested that the author venture back inside the car, being that if there was some sort of accident, he wouldn’t stand much of a chance outside.  Shocked, the author asked if such accidents were frequent.  ““We do sometimes run off the rail, that’s all;” said he, without the slightest emotion; and then passed into the car without deigning to know how I received the announcement.”  Mackay’s travels between Boston and New York only ended up with the threat of danger, as he reached his destination tired and drawn out from the ordeal of making and executing the plans of transporting himself to get there.","Mackay’s voyage illustrates the tediousness of travel before the invention of the internal combustion engine, electrical power generation, and the ambitious networking of train lines throughout the country.  The lack of easy mobility in the United States of 1846 lent to troubles with the expansion of trade and industry.  The story of Mackay’s voyage from Boston to New York is only one part of his travels through the United States.  When he told the conductor on the platform of the train of his expansive traveling, he was met with apathy.  Such an idea wasn’t an enjoyable one back in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century.  As the railroads would spread to the west, steel would become mass produced by the 1870s, and more transportation options came to fruition throughout the continental United States, intra and inter regional travel would be taken upon without the burden of unwieldy options which were often dangerous.  As America became more inter-connected, with those connections running smoother as the years went by, the economy would follow in suit, forging the way forward with industrial innovations which would eventually create a very powerful country.  The time of Mackay’s voyage marked an end of an era in which travel options in America were poor, took extraordinary effort on the part of the travelers, and included an increased probability of danger or delay."," "],"display_date":"January 30, 1846","search_date":"1846-01-30","locations":[{"id":6208,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":666,"tag":"Railroad"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5103,"title":"<strong>Full Steam Ahead;

the advent of large steam ships in place of sail ships made migration easier, which in turn increased the population of the country.  The immigrants provided cheap labor, which the new, growing American industries needed to produce massive amounts of steel, etc.  So, the immigrants who showed up to work in American factories produced more volumes and better additions to the transportation industry, which fostered the ability for more immigrants to pick up from where they lived before and establish new roots in America.","The advent of steam power and the Industrial Revolution which followed on its heels changed the way life was lived in the United States.  These innovations increased the allure and therefore the power of cities, which could provide a large number of people in a concentrated area for a workforce in the industrial factories which arose during the Industrial Revolution.  Before the massive immigration to American shores and the advent of steam power in ships and trains, the United States was a largely agrarian country, with farm communities linked to each other by muddy roads which were travelled mainly on foot or by horse.  As the train lines expanded across the country over the course of the century, and immigrants poured into cities, creating new opportunities to chase the American dream in a new economy, the balance of what we would consider an average American life shifted to something that looked much more urban than it had in the past.  “Wherever it occurred, the Industrial Revolution shook people loose from traditional ways of life. It made factory workers out of artisans and, even more dramatically, turned millions of rural farmers into urban wage-laborers. Most of those migrants from countryside to city, from agriculture to industry…”","If it weren’t for the steamships like those which Edmund Patton travelled on across the vast Atlantic Ocean, the United States may have become a different, less diverse place.  The Industrial Revolution that followed made the country into an economic power, and it connected the country in a way that it hadn’t been in the past.  Shorter transport times meant more fluidity of movement throughout the country.  If it was for leisure or for the search of a better life, the steamship and the Industrial Revolution that followed allowed people to pursue their free will of travel in a country that was established on the belief that people are entitled to that kind of freedom."],"display_date":"June 22, 1852 - July 29, 1852","search_date":"1852-07-10","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5161,"title":"Immigrants Who Couldn’t Get on The Train","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/14","end_date":"12/31/14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1914, Stephen Graham, a traveler from Britain, was riding a train towards Chicago. Upon arriving at the station, he was comparing the American rates with the Russian rates and Great Britain rates: “The cost of working is more in America than in Russia, and the trains are twice as fast; but that is not enough to set off against the enormous differences in fares. . . It is absurd to compare the prices of fares in America with the prices of fares in Great Britain. It is bad enough with us, but ours is a small territory; it does not cost much to go from end to end. But America is a vast country.” The comparison he made was truly correct. The wages paid in America were much higher than in Russia. Unfortunately, the railway fares were as well. The engineering of the railways had always been appreciated, but did it really benefit all Americans in the 19th century?","Railway fares usually were set quite high since the building cost of the railways was so expensive. For examples, it cost $39.60 -- equivalent to $712 nowadays -- to go as far as Denver, Coloado, which was about 2000 miles from Chicago; and $76.20 -- equivalent to $1307 -- to go to San Francisco. As Graham noted, “It costs almost a year’s wages to pay the fare of a family across it [the U.S.].” More importantly, the wages that Stephen refers to were the wages of American citizens. For those immigrants who were paid in lower wages, the fare might cost much more than they earned. Therefore, compared to Americans, immigrants had to think twice before determining to travel even a thousand miles.","Railways did bring many benefits to the United States. They sped up the development of the Industrial Revolution; they transferred gold, coal, and other materials at a very high speed, yet charged their customers a relatively low price; they brought a lot of jobs within the railroad sector; and they could take any immigrant to a place where he would not be a hireling but, during that period of time, “the high fares deter the immigrant, he is cooped up in districts which he would like to leave, but cannot; in districts where he must remain foreign and not American.”"],"display_date":1914,"search_date":"1914-07-02","locations":[{"id":17541,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":666,"tag":"Railroad"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5312,"title":"Immigrants Massacred in the Meadows","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-09-07","end_date":"1856-09-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A bloody massacre of immigrants on route to California by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons) and aided by local Native Americans occurred in Mountain Meadows, Utah.

Throughout the 1850s, distrust towards Mormons and their practice of polygamy intensified within the federal government. Historian Kenneth M. Stampp stated “Northerners and Southerners, whether Democrats, Republicans, or Americans, could unite wholeheartedly in condemning it.” The impending threat of federal government intervention created wartime hysteria for the Mormons in Utah.","The Mountain Meadows massacre exemplified how far the Mormons were willing to go in order to protect freedoms that they believed the federal government threatened. The emigrants engaged in a conflict with the Native Americans and then were received by the Mormon militia, who they thought had arrived to give aid to them. They followed the advice of the Mormons and gave up their goods to the Indians and marched to Cedar City with the militia. The group never made it to Cedar City; the Native Americans attacked the defenseless emigrants by order of the militia. The massacre resulted in the death of around 120 men, women, and children. <em>The Pittsfield Sun</em> claimed that the Massacre occurred due to the wealth that the emigrant party had and the desire of the Mormons to gain it. Historians have since argued that the true reason for the massacre was to protect Mormon religion.","<em> The Pittsfield Sun</em>, located in Massachusetts, certainly held some type of prejudice against the Mormons, as did the majority of U.S. citizens at that time. However, regardless of bias, the end result of the massacre remained the same, it resulted in a tremendous loss of human life with little provocation. The United States’ relationship with its territories during the 1850s was a time of high tensions and mistrust. The fragmented federal government in the late 1850s could not respond appropriately to the massacre due to the internal tensions between the North and South and a long-standing mistrust of the Mormons. Therefore, justice was never fully received for the victims of the massacre. John Lee was the only Mormon charged for the crime and he received execution by a firing squad at the location where the massacre took place. The Mormons felt justified in defending their religion and the safe haven that they established for themselves in Utah from government interference and a hostile U.S. populace."," "],"display_date":"September 7, 1856 - September 11, 1856","search_date":"1856-09-09","locations":[{"id":13381,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"IRON, Utah"}],"tags":[{"id":1094,"tag":"Church/Religious Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5342,"title":"Professor Frederick A.

P. Barnard, originally educated at Yale to become a teacher, became interested in Mathematics and Astronomy, eventually becoming a professor of Mathematics, Astronomy, and Civil Engineering at the University of Mississippi.  After a while, he “found himself embarrassed in his Southern position, and in 1861 he resigned his chancellorship and his chair in the university, and returned to his native North.”","Born in the North, Barnard had strong Union loyalties.  His loyalty to the North and its ideologies can be observed in a letter he wrote to the University of Mississippi’s Trustees, defending the actions of an African American.  Due to his letter, the Trustees held a meeting on February 29, 1860, where amongst other accusations, he was charged with being “unsound on the slavery question.”  Upset by such disloyalty from the people he had worked for, he eventually headed to Norfolk, Virginia, in 1861 and remained there until Norfolk fell to the Union in 1862.  He then moved to Washington, D.C., and in 1863, published his “Letter to the President of the United States by a Refugee,” which attracted both Lincoln and Columbia University’s attention.  This letter helped him obtain the position in charge of lithography and chart-printing for the United States Coast Survey.","In the department of lithography and chart-printing, Barnard was responsible for the printing of war maps for the Union that were to be used by the Navy.  Afterwards, he became the president of Columbia College of New York, in 1864, and helped to establish Columbia’s School of Mines.  If it was not for such opposition to inequality and southern ideals, it is possible that the Confederate navy could have had more success due to this accomplished astronomer and academic."],"display_date":"1860 - 1864","search_date":"1862-07-02","locations":[{"id":7117,"lat":34.3506393226,"lng":-89.4893655369,"zoom":9,"place":"LAFAYETTE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5348,"title":"J.E.B.

Stuart’s most celebrated act was his encirclement of the Union General George McClellan’s Army of the Potomac in June of 1862. Newly appointed commander of the Army of Northern Virginia Robert E. Lee and Jeb Stuart devised the plan to circle around McClellan and gather intelligence. The aggressive strategy stemmed from the knowledge that McClellan was hesitant to attack the Confederate troops, which he believed to be incredibly large in size and powerful in strength.","In a message to Stuart on June 11, 1862, Lee expressed caution, stating that he should be careful not “to hazard unnecessarily your command or to attempt what your judgment may not approve but be content to accomplish all the good you can without feeling it necessary to obtain all that might be desired.” The letter from Lee to Stuart stressed the importance of the reconnaissance mission and the need for discretion. Stuart saddled his troops, consisting of 1, 200 men from the first, fourth, and ninth Virginia Cavalry, and the Jeff Davis Legion, on June 12, 1862, to determine if the Army of the Potomac occupied the land between the Chickahominy and Totopotomy Rivers. The value of the land between both rivers was essential for the Confederacy and the Union. During the reconnaissance mission ordered by Lee, Stuart realized that his position had been discovered, forcing him to find an alternate route back to Richmond. The alternate route led Stuart’s infamous ride around McClellan’s troops. Historian James McPherson stated Stuart gained fame from this event as well as “great personal satisfaction from the enterprise, for one of the opposing cavalry commanders was his father-in-law, Philip St. George Cooke.”","Stuart’s mission resulted in his troops spending four days behind enemy lines in which they covered over 100 miles. The troops captured 165 prisoners as well as 260 mules<em>.</em> Stuart fulfilled the desires of Lee, who stated in his letter the importance of “gaining intelligence of his operations, communications, &c., of driving in his foraging parties, and securing such grain, cattle, &c., for ourselves as you can make arrangements to have driven in.” The encirclement of McClellan resulted in the recognition of the need for a reformed Union cavalry. After the successful raid commenced, Stuart felt that he had the capability to outride and outfight any Union cavalryman, boosting Southern morale even more. The intelligence that Stuart gathered allowed Lee to attack at Mechanicsville, which was the first of the Seven Days’ battles, and contributed in the failure of McClellan’s Peninsula campaign."],"display_date":"June 12, 1862 - June 15, 1862","search_date":"1862-06-13","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}}]}
