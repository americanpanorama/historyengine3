These places of worship were the hub of not only religion, but community, politics, and commerce as well. Palaces like the Notre Dame cathedral served as the heart and soul of the town and its people. In modern times, the center of commerce and congregation has shifted far away from the church and landed on the temples of retail, the department store. Much like the church did in medieval times the department store offers people living in modern villages the chance to gather together, connect, and socialize with people from their community. One of the best examples of this can be seen in the landmark that is Macy’s. Macy’s of New York first opened its doors on October 28, 1858. This iconic New York landmark serves as not only a department store but a tourist attraction as well. Like their famous advertisement says, “If you haven’t seen Macy’s, you haven’t seen New York.”","Historians like Vincent Miller argue that retail is the new religion of the modern age. People go to their local temple and worship the gods that are wealth, status, and luxury. They claim that socioeconomic status has become the new measure of a person in Western society. Some go as far as to say that people have become walking billboards for various brands by sporting logos and trademarks on everything from their shirt to their shoes. Department stores and other various retail outlets have been vilified for everything from sales practices to profit margins.","In his book, <em>The Practice of Everyday, Life</em> the French author Michel de Certeau poses a very different argument. He suggests that the “ordinary man” is the one who is in control. Certeau uses the poetic example of maps and walking down a city street. A city, like New York, finds its heartbeat in its inhabitants. While walking down the street all of the sights, sounds, and smells you encounter are completely subjective. This is also true for a walk through a department store like Macy’s. He goes on to say that maps exist as a way for people to pin down a cityscape, a feat that can never really be accomplished because it is composed of the people who are ever changing. Certeau argues that executives, leaders, and even academics are disconnected from the city by their offices that are high above the rest of the world. Therefore, they are virtually powerless over the public who use various tactics like alteration and mobility to process the world around them in a unique and unknowable way.","In either case, Macy’s has managed to become and remain an iconic American institution for over 150 years. Whether it be in films, commercials, or the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the “magic of Macy’s” will continue to bewitch the American public for generations to come."],"display_date":"1859 - 1876","search_date":"1868-01-01","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1254,"tag":"Macy's"},{"id":1255,"tag":"consumerism"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":6820,"title":"An American Educational Exclave","course_id":189,"status":"P","start_date":"11/3/46","end_date":"12/31/69","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 22nd, 1965, the New York Times ran a special feature on the presence of a large brick building in Kyoto built in the mold of American colonial-era architecture. Amherst House, apart of the Doshisha University campus, stood in stark contrast to the traditional wooden homes, tile-roofed temples, and the ornate palaces populating the primordial former imperial capital of Japan. The educational institution, which is attached to a Japanese-style tea house, is host to a unique synthesis of Eastern and Western subject matter and methods of inquiry. Though Doshisha University was supported by the eponymous Amherst College of Massachusetts, it owed its American traditions to its founder, who in 1875 defied the law of the land to pursue an education in the United States. Adopting the name Joseph Hardy Neesima, he eventually returned to his homeland to proliferate the knowledge he obtained abroad. At the time of the article, Doshisha University provided Japanese students living in a majority Buddhist country with a Christian education from kindergarten onwards. (NYT, 6)","The popularity and success of the school was due in large part to the reordering of the Japanese education system following the country’s defeat in the Second World War. The new Japanese Constitution, ratified on November 3rd, 1946, stripped the emperor of political authority, handed power to a democratically elected National Diet, declared human rights inviolable, and forbade war. (Saito and Imai, 584) The U.S government also brought over American education experts with the mandate of promoting democracy and steering the Japanese away from a “pre-war education based upon militarism, nationalism, and the Emperor system.” (Saito and Imai, 584) The time between the end of the war and the 1960s is sometimes referred to as the “Period of Love/Hate” because while many Japanese sympathized with anti-occupation protests, there was a general yearning for the American way of life. (Yoshimi and Buist, 434) In September 1945, just a month after Japan’s surrender, the Japanese-American English Conversation Booklet became a national bestseller, demonstrative of the underlying allure of Americanism within the urban middle class. (Yoshimi and Buist, 435) American military bases and the soldiers who inhabited them exerted powerful cultural influence, inducing the spread of Western fashions like jazz, denim, and animated cartoons. (Yoshimi and Buist, 434) The 1960s, a decade characterized by miraculous economic growth, brought about a demographic shift towards urban life, allowing for increased access and consumption of American material and cultural exports. (Yoshimi and Buist, 434) The shifting social landscape strengthened the connection between education and socioeconomic standing in post-war Japan.
