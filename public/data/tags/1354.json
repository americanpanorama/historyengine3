For years, many had simply lived with the pollution as an everyday part of life. However, in 1971 the County Health Department issued pollution alerts on two separate occasions with daily particulate counts well above national averages. These measurements collected over separate areas of the city could not be ignored any further as a thick blanket of pollution covered the cities skyline for several days. As Alabama’s largest city and a southern industrial hub, Birmingham served as home to many steel and iron producing plants that accounted for much of this pollution. In response to the crisis U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer of North Alabama issued a temporary injunction on twenty-three local industries and prompting the intervention of a federal strike force of environmental specialists by recommendation of the still new U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.","However, when the Birmingham News announced the arrival of a congressional subcommittee to hold a hearing, the question of most concern was determining if federal action was either too extreme or not aggressive enough, in spite of claims that local industries had been slow to act accordingly. If voluntary action from industries weren’t in place, then feds would exercise emergency powers of the Clean Air Act of 1970. While The Clean Air Act enforced EPA standards, it was The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 that paved the way for the institutionalization of environmentalism. NEPA was enacted as a means to assure safe, healthy and esthetically pleasing surroundings, while attaining the most possible benefits devoid of compromising unwanted consequences.  At the height of the pollution crisis, particulate counts measured double the national average. Even after the count dropped following the shut downs, local industries still complained the order was carried out with little evidence any individual industry was to blame. Though the injunctions did not demand the complete shutdown of industrial plants, the dramatic reductions implemented brought production to a crawl. With so many employed by these industries and such huge cutbacks, worker’s jobs and their livelihoods were placed on the line. According to historian Thomas Wellock, up until recently any though of limiting industrial growth was considered “civic heresy.”","Nestled in the Deep South, Alabama has long been a state of proud independent character with a long political history preferring little to no federal intervention. However as Wellock points out, in the seventies politicians were aware of the publics demand for federal action, and Alabama’s leaders knew better than to alienate their constituency. Major legislations, like NEPA, were passed that would instill environmental values within local, state, and federal bureaucracies’. With Vietnam War, Civil Rights movement, and so many dividing issues during those times, the environment became one topic of bi-partisan support. To politicians, this was a win, win scenario that everyone can benefit from especially when it comes to votes."],"display_date":"November 18, 1971 - November 20, 1971","search_date":"1971-11-19","locations":[{"id":35012,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1355,"tag":"Clean Air Act"},{"id":1354,"tag":"Air Pollution"},{"id":1353,"tag":"NEPA"},{"id":1352,"tag":"EPA"},{"id":1351,"tag":"Environmentalism"},{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":84,"school_id":10}},{"id":6129,"title":"<strong>Smog Madness: Remembering the Vacuum Carburetor Era</strong>","course_id":127,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/73","end_date":"12/31/73","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The 1973 edition of the <em>Chevrolet Emission Control Systems</em> reference manual is a special supplement to the standard mechanic’s repair reference. General Motors produced this manual as a guide for its dealer-level mechanics, who would be tasked with repairing and adjusting emission control systems for Chevrolet owners. The manual contains a host of novel names and corresponding acronyms for parts of the new emissions-control system: Air Injector Reactor (AIR), Controlled Combustion System (CCS), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), Coasting Richer System (CRS), and many others. These new technologies represented the industry’s best short-term effort for reducing toxic exhaust gas emissions. However, their acronyms would be liberally intermixed with swear words throughout the 1970s, as both mechanics and their customers struggled to adapt to the new technological regime.","The main problem with 1970s emission controls proved to be the difficulty of keeping them in tune. In the era before inexpensive, compact microprocessors revolutionized engine management, emissions control systems relied on comparatively crude technology. Copious lines of fragile vacuum hoses, complex mechanically actuated carburetors, and hot-burning catalytic converters were virtually impossible to maintain in concert with one another. Datsun equipped its cars with “Floor Temp” warning lights, to keep catalytic converters from igniting the floor carpeting. Other manufacturers warned consumers not to park in tall grass for the same reason. Vacuum carburetors were notoriously devilish devices, with a tendency to produce stalling at the worst possible moments. Newly established emissions testing frequently devolved into shouting matches and frustration. To add insult to injury, these emissions-control systems actually made cars less fuel efficient in the short term, at a time when gas shortages and embargoes were menacing the land. In short, the 1970s proved to be an inauspicious time to own a car, or to be a person that worked on them for a living.","As Kevin Borg writes in <em>Auto Mechanics:</em> <em>Technology and Expertise in Twentieth-Century America</em>, mechanics bore the brunt of consumer criticism of the new technology. When the cars of the 70s stumbled and stalled in traffic, their drivers naturally blamed the men responsible for maintaining them. Auto mechanics were forced to choose between tuning their customers’ cars to meet emissions standards, or to run well in everyday use. The <em>Chevrolet Emission Control Systems</em> manual is a relic of this era of hard choices, and a reminder of the difficulty of introducing complex technological systems quickly."],"display_date":1973,"search_date":"1973-07-02","locations":[{"id":35437,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1544,"tag":"automobile"},{"id":1354,"tag":"Air Pollution"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1919,"tag":"1970s"},{"id":599,"tag":"Technology"},{"id":2296,"tag":"emissions"},{"id":2297,"tag":"mechanics"},{"id":2298,"tag":"regulation"},{"id":2299,"tag":"car"}],"course":{"name":"Fundamentals of Environmental History","school":"Auburn University","course_id":127,"school_id":73}}]}
