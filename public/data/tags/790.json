The memorial service was held at the chapel of Stanford Memorial Church. Ira S. Lillick and fellow members of the board of trustees of Stanford University delivered the eulogies. His family was present, most notably his three children, Dr. Carl Shoup, Jack, and Louise Shoup. His sister, Mrs. A.S Robinson, his brother, Guy Shoup, and his two nieces, Miss Frances Shoup and Mrs. W. Byron Bryant were also present. Friends, admirers, and employees of Southern Pacific Railroad Company also attended the funeral. Shoup was the President of Southern California Inc., President of the Los Angeles Merchants and Manufacturers Association, President of two oil companies, and a Stanford trustee. He was a contributing writer to the <em>New York Sun, Overland Monthly, Black Cat, Illustrated Monthly</em>, and<em> Sunset Magazine. </em>While serving as President of the Southern Pacific Railroad Company, he was instrumental in the development of Los Altos.","In 1904, the Southern Pacific Railroad Company was expanding its subsidiaries and electric railroad services in northern California and wanted to connect Mayfield, San Jose, and Los Gatos through the interurban line. However, this became problematic, as Southern Pacific would have to build their interurban railroad line through land owned by Sarah Winchester, who did not want to give them the right of way at first because it would destroy the integrity of her ranch. After negotiations, Winchester decided that she would sell Southern Pacific the right of way but only if they bought all her land. Once Southern Pacific bought the land, Paul Shoup and Walter Clark saw a great opportunity to build a new city. They created the Altos Land Company, raised money, and filed the city blueprints for Los Altos in 1907.","It took time for the city to grow, but once the interurban railroad was built and operational it attracted different types of businesses, families, Stanford professors, and wealthy San Franciscans to Los Altos. The electric railroad linked the Bay Area cities together and made traveling and commuting within the Bay Area  more comfortable, faster, and cheaper for passengers."],"display_date":"July 30, 1946","search_date":"1946-07-30","locations":[{"id":25347,"lat":37.4562619895,"lng":-122.096750388,"zoom":9,"place":"Santa Clara, California"}],"tags":[{"id":666,"tag":"Railroad"},{"id":789,"tag":"Urban Life/Boosterism"},{"id":790,"tag":"Paul Shoup"},{"id":791,"tag":"Sarah Winchester"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":49,"school_id":40}},{"id":5107,"title":"The Interurban Railroad of California","course_id":49,"status":"P","start_date":"10/18/01","end_date":"10/18/01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Southern Pacific Railroad Company Traffic Department announced on October 16, 1901, that Paul Shoup would be replacing Thomas A. Graham as division freight and passenger agent with jurisdictions south of San Francisco, Oakland, and north of Santa Barbara, with his headquarters in San Jose. J.C Stubbs, Traffic Director; William Sproule, freight traffic manager and E.O McCormick, passenger traffic manager, approved the appointment. The appointment took effect on October 18, 1901.","Paul Shoup rose to a prominent position in the Southern Pacific Railroad Company through his management of the railroad’s electric interurban lines. As the roads were unpaved and traveling was predominantly by horseback or wagon, the electric interurban made traveling comfortable, faster, and cheaper for passengers. The electric interurban lines in California and other cities in the United States connected cities together by making more stops at urban centers than the larger railroad lines that traveled further and hauled heavy cargo. The Southern Pacific Railroad interurban lines were predominantly located in the Los Angeles area linking the City of Angels to Long Beach and Orange County. The Interurban Electric Railway (IER) connected Berkeley, Oakland, and San Leandro, while the Peninsular Railway connected San Jose and Palo Alto.","However, the success of the interurban railroad led to its demise. As the economy improved due to the construction of the interurban railroad, people in the Bay Area were able to afford automobiles and the interurban railroad usage declined.  Many of the companies responsible for its success ended up filing for bankruptcy."],"display_date":"October 18, 1901","search_date":"1901-10-18","locations":[{"id":52284,"lat":37.4562619895,"lng":-122.096750388,"zoom":9,"place":"Santa Clara, California"}],"tags":[{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":790,"tag":"Paul Shoup"},{"id":666,"tag":"Railroad"},{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":49,"school_id":40}}]}
