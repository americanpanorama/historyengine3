McMinn and Jack Evans, joined forces to oppose the naturalization process of Ricardo Rodriguez claiming he was “’not capable of becoming an American citizen’” due to his race.  These tactics were proclaimed throughout Texas in order to garner support for their opposition to Tejanos’ eligibility of citizenship and to discourage other Tejanos from applying.","After a year of legal maneuvers, on May 3, 1897, Judge Thomas S. Maxey ruled in favor of Ricardo Rodriguez, bestowing the right of citizenship and “thereby legally affirming the civil rights of Texas Mexicans to vote.”  In his ruling, he pointed directly at three distinct documents: The Constitution of the Republic of Texas, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.","Under the Constitution of the Republic of Texas Maxey recognized the granting of citizenship upon Mexicans living within Texas on Independence Day.  To further this reasoning Maxey directed his findings to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, specifically to Article VIII, that states Mexicans who “prefer to remain the said territories may either retain the title and rights of Mexican citizens, or acquire those of citizens o f the United States” under the agreement that the decision must be made within “one year from the date of the exchange of ratifications of this treaty.”  The treaty goes as far as stating that those who do not make their decisions voluntarily after the deadline “shall be considered to have elected to become citizens of the United States.”  Ultimately, Maxey revealed that it was the Fourteenth Amendment that “granted citizenship to all people born or naturalized in the United States, regardless of color or race.”","Through this landmark civil rights case, Judge Thomas Maxey’s confirmed that neither race nor special levels of education could be used to deny U.S. citizenship to anyone.  The argument that Mexican Tejanos were not eligible to vote because they are not white or black could no longer be used to alienate them from becoming citizens.  According to Zaragosa Vargas, a Mexican American historian, in essence, the decision confirmed the “legal right of Mexicans as ‘white,’ further cementing their right to vote."],"display_date":"May 1, 1896 - May 3, 1897","search_date":"1896-10-31","locations":[{"id":12547,"lat":29.4490384361,"lng":-98.519907109,"zoom":9,"place":"BEXAR, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1042,"tag":"Mexican-American"},{"id":1046,"tag":"Treaty Guadalupe Hidalgo"},{"id":1052,"tag":"Texas-Mexico border"},{"id":1048,"tag":"Borderlands"},{"id":1059,"tag":"Tejanos"},{"id":1060,"tag":"Texas Independance"},{"id":1061,"tag":"Judge Thomas S.

L. Kearny on the morning of the day of election, and did not think of voting until he came out to the stable where I was attending to the horses and advised me to go to the polls and exercise a citizen's privilege.”  Peterson also revealed his vote in this election, “As I advanced to the polls one man offered me a ticket bearing the words \"revised charter\" and another one marked, \"no charter.\" I thought I would not vote to give up our charter after holding it so long: so I chose a revised charter ballot.”","The citizens of Perth Amboy, New Jersey later awarded Thomas Mundy Peterson a medallion in 1884.  The medallion had the face of Abraham Lincoln engraved on one side.  While the side opposite to that the medallion reads “presented by citizens of Perth Amboy N.J. to Thomas Peterson the first colored voter in the U.S. under the provisions of the 15<sup>th</sup> Amendment at an election held in that city March 13, 1870.”  These Reconstruction Amendments and The Emancipation Proclamation freed all African Americans in the Confederate States while the Fourteenth Amendment granted citizenship of the United States.  After the end of the war the Fifteenth Amendment gave every citizen of the United States the right to vote regardless of race, color, or previous servitude."],"display_date":"March 30, 1870","search_date":"1870-03-30","locations":[{"id":8547,"lat":40.4819398451,"lng":-74.3437571554,"zoom":9,"place":"MIDDLESEX, New Jersey"}],"tags":[{"id":1066,"tag":"Right to Vote"},{"id":1570,"tag":"Thomas Peterson"},{"id":1571,"tag":"Fifteenth Amendment"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":6259,"title":"Maryland Woman Suffrage Assocation","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/04","end_date":"12/31/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Maryland Women Suffrage Association was formed in 1867. At that time, there were two national organizations for women’s suffrage at the time the Maryland chapter was formed:  the National Women Suffrage Association and the American Women Suffrage Association. While both had the same goal of achieving full voting rights for women, they tended to have different arguments and different tactics. The NWSA, headed by famous suffragette Susan B. Anthony, wanted a constitutional amendment granting voting rights for women in every state. The AWSA favored state-by-state change. Eventually, in 1890, both organizations combined to create the National American Women Suffrage Association, which approached women’s suffrage as part of women's traditional role. Women should vote, they argued, so they could \"clean up politics.\"","Maryland was one of the first states to have a state suffrage association, and Maryland activists were rather distinct from those in the national organizations. By the turn of the 20th century, Maryland's suffrage leaders were not only demanding the vote, they were making a strong case for women's independence and professionalism. Emma Maddox Funck became President of the Maryland organization in 1904. Funck and her sister were accomplished and independent women. Emma Funck had created a name for herself in the music world. She graduated from the Peabody Conservatory of Music of the Johns Hopkin’s University in Baltimore, Maryland. However, rather than focus on her musical career, she joined the Baltimore Suffrage Club and the National American Woman Suffrage Association in 1894 to become a full time activist. Her sister, Etta Maddox, was also a suffrage and women's rights activist. Etta Maddox had also attended the Peabody Institute, but she eventually switched from singing to law school. On June 6, 1901, Etta Maddox was the first woman to graduate from the Baltimore Law School. Although 37 other states allowed women to take the bar, Maryland did not. Etta Maddox fought for the right of women to practice law in her home state. She lost a case in the Maryland courts, so she pursued it as a federal issue. Under pressure from Etta Maddox and a group of her peers, the Senate passed a bill on March 4, 1902, establishing a federal right for women to practice law. The House passed a similar bill on  March 31, 1902.","Despite such strong, feminist leadership, the women in the Maryland Woman Suffrage Association faced many obstacles. Their agenda was diverse. In addition to demanding access to the vote, they also fought for co-education, and equal pay for equal work. Ironically, even after passage of the federal woman suffrage amendment, women in Maryland still had a fight ahead of them. The state did not ratify the Suffrage Amendment. Nonetheless, women in Maryland won the right to vote after the Amendment was ratified."],"display_date":"1904 - 1920","search_date":"1912-07-01","locations":[{"id":51922,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"Baltimore City, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":2548,"tag":"Suffrage Association"},{"id":2547,"tag":"Maryland Woman Suffrage"},{"id":1066,"tag":"Right to Vote"},{"id":280,"tag":"Maryland"},{"id":632,"tag":"woman’s suffrage"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}}]}
