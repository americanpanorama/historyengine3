Zora once said:","\"I was born in a Negro town.  I do not mean by that the black backside of an average town.  Eatonville, Florida is, and was at the time of my birth, a pure Negro town-charter, mayor, council, town marshal and all.  It was not the first Negro community in America, but it was the first to be incorporated, the first attempt at organized self-government on the part of Negroes in America.\"","Zora’s life reflects the same “attempt” as did the formation and incorporation of Eatonville; she paved the way for all female writers in America, specifically those of African descent, through the strength of her own story.","Throughout history, Zora can often be found on the frontier of African American accomplishments. In 1927, she was the first African American to be admitted to Barnard College. After graduation, Zora immediately set out to explore “Negro” folklore. Through her strong determination and interest- and after only a few months- Zora had amassed the largest collection of “Negro” folk tales in her field. She used her extensive research into African American life and history to construct plays which recalled traditional “Negro folk-lore.” One such play is her famous <em>From Sun to Sun</em>, an adaptation of <em>The Great day</em>, a theatrical revue- a theatrical performance involving short satirical and topical songs, sketches, and monologues- written in 1932.","Zora frequently worked with Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida to construct and perform her creations. The concert program of “Negro music” for <em>The Great Day </em>was built through Zora’s collaborative effort with the creative literature department of Rollins College. The John Golden Theatre on Broadway housed the first performance of <em>The Great Day</em> on January 10, 1932- Zora had made it to Broadway. On February 11, 1933, she staged an adaptation of <em>The Great Day</em> called <em>From Sun to Sun</em>, “a program of original Negro folk-lore,” at Rollins College with “Native Negro Singers and Actors.” The event program included a brief biography about Zora Hurston, an outline of the play, and specific descriptions and explanations of each song included in the revue. At 8:15 pm, “Negroes” and “white friends of the Negroes” gathered at Rollins’ Recreation Hall to “experience the richness of the material at their own doorstep.” The play was a success, as many college and local newspaper write-ups from the period suggest, and Zora continued to display her creations at Rollins in front of captive audiences for years to come.","Though she fought and stood against racial prejudice throughout her life, Zora Neale Hurston stands as one of America’s most celebrated authors.  Zora’s creative path began in Eatonville, and by the mid 30s, it brought her to all the way to Broadway. Her story stands to tell: Zora indeed took her mother’s advice to “jump at de sun.\""],"display_date":"1910 - 1935","search_date":"1922-12-31","locations":[{"id":16531,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":129,"tag":"Eatonville"},{"id":458,"tag":"African American Authors"},{"id":460,"tag":"African American Folklore"},{"id":459,"tag":"Female Authors"},{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4887,"title":"The Rebirth of Zora","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["<strong><br /></strong>","The collaboration between Zora Hurston and the Directors of The Museum in folklore entitled “From Sun to Sun” was revolutionary for both the museum and for the African American population at the time. The Museum was known at the time at Rollins to be “a house for the arts”. The theatre worked together with Hurston to present a series of one act plays, musical programs, and various dance and poetry readings in a creative endeavor to help expand and discover new ways to present the arts to local residents. In the document, which is the program presented for “From Sun to Sun” there is a biography of Zora Hurston’s career. In the biography it is revealed that she was born in Eatonville, Florida and later attended school in Baltimore Maryland. In 1927 she was the first black person to be accepted in Barnard College. She became involved throughout her academic career in “Negro folklore” and became what can be considered a legend in this genre. Most of her folklore was published by the American Folklore Society. She also went further in her career to publish more stories and research articles which were published by prestigious journals such as  <em>The Survey Graphic</em>,  <em>The World Tomorrow</em> and <em>The New Negro.</em> Hurston came to Rollins in order to collaborate in an effort to establish “Negro theatre for her own people”.  We can infer from this that because of the time period, despite her large success at as a writer, poet, and director she was still in search for a place where she could truly express her work in a theatre environment without the perhaps discrimination from the outside world. She needed a location where her work could flourish and just plainly exist as art.","In an article written by Joanne Braxton details the autobiographical tradition of African American women, including Hurston. African American women began writing autobiographies in the 1940’s. However these stories did not start gaining publicity and serious attention until the 1970’s.  In the 1980’s critics began to reevaluate autobiographies that were overlooked in the 40’s and when they began to be published. One person that is noted that deserved re-evaluation of her works was Zora Hurston. In the Rollins program “From Sun to Sun” she expresses the need to find a place where she can call her own in an artistic environment. Hurston was in a constant search to indeed find a place in which she could “re-create, restore and re-invent the self” . It is also expressed in many of Zora’s own personal writings accounts of feeling extreme loneliness and isolation and how she so badly was striving to fit in and feel like everyone else.","In an article by Joyce Irene Middleton which is entitled “Where to look for Zora” there is a reoccurring theme which suggests that Zora was an insightful talent that was shamefully overlooked by other scholars at the time that she was publishing. A person by the name of Alice Walker started a movement to “Remember Zora” in the 1970’s which worked to understand Zora’s material to a clearer extent and to uncover reasons why she was once overlooked. In  Walker’s essay “Looking for Zora” she revealed many of Hurston’s memories and tried to uncover why in fact Zora was so influential and powerful as a black woman author. The most significant point in which people seem to be enthralled with her work is because it came so strongly that she was in fact in charge of her life and her unique emphasis on self possession. This was most interesting because of the time period in which she emerged which was a time in which African American women were still facing the hardships of discrimination.","Zora was an inspiration because of her persistency to be heard and intense drive to find her authentic self in a theatric environment. She was on a personal quest of liberation and more importantly strove to share her story with people, including her local native people of the greater Orlando community which was demonstrated by her association and collaboration with Rollins. This was both revolutionary and inspiring for the local community."," "],"display_date":1970,"search_date":"1970-07-02","locations":[{"id":36752,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":503,"tag":"From Sun to Sun"},{"id":459,"tag":"Female Authors"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":5113,"title":"Women's Rights Activist Experiences Effects of the Communication Revolution","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-01-01","end_date":"1872-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the first of three visits to America in the fall of 1872,  Emily Faithfull, an Englishwoman and women's rights activist described the problematic state of affairs that existed in the American government. During her stay, she closely followed the news articles published in the <em>The New York Daily</em>, <em>The Boston Herald,</em> and <em>The Chicago Tribune, </em>which all related stories of corrupt government officials and the perversion of justice that threatened America's democratic values. Emily Faithfull expressed specific concern over the abuse of justice that pervaded the courts, and in particular, the juries which she believed were placing its citizens' freedoms at risk. In the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> she read of the unqualified men that sat in the juries;men who were either too illiterate to properly \"weigh evidence\" or too apathetic to uphold the proceedings of a just trial. Other men, she learned, \"sympathize\" with the criminal class and withheld the execution of justice (that defines American values).<br /><br /> In her writings, Faithfull asserted that anyone who read the newspapers on a regular basis understood the amount of effort required to improve the situation. Accordingly, she related that in response to such news, \"some young men of the best families have awakened to a sense of their individual responsibility with regard to public matters and have organized a club with the view of encouraging an active participation in political movements.\" Outraged and troubled, Faithfull emotionally warned of the consequences of inaction that allowed those conditions to exist. She continued by urging those who \"love America\" and care for their \"nation's well-being\" to take on proactive measures to keep unscrupulous juries out of the courtroom in order to protect their democracy.","Her description and strong opinions regarding the daily events in American life reflected the effects of the widespread dissemination of information (telegraphs, publication of newspapers, magazines, pamphlets and books), which swept America in the 19th century. Historian Robert Brown regards the effects of the new found  public awareness as the \"communication revolution\" and credits the dramatic changes to technological advancements in transportation and commercialism. The communication revolution, he explains, profoundly impacted every area of society including politics, journalism, education, social movements and commerce. An informed public was now in a position to more actively participate in politics, assemble with others of similar views, voice their opinion, as well as petition and protest. Like Emily Faithfull and the men she describes, having the news at one's fingertips not only empowered aristocrats, farmers, women and slaves but also transformed much of society's outlook and behavior. People could now utilize the power of communication to influence the public and shape the world."],"display_date":1872,"search_date":"1872-07-01","locations":[{"id":2540,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"COOK, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":484,"tag":"Juries"},{"id":450,"tag":"Powerful Women in History"},{"id":800,"tag":"Communication Revolution"},{"id":459,"tag":"Female Authors"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}}]}
