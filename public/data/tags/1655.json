Construction for the original center, the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, began in 1948 and the center opened in 1953. On November 4, 1997, a groundbreaking ceremony was held in honor of the new clinical research center that would be opened as an addition to the 44-year-old Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center. This center would be a 4-wing, 250-bed hospital and would be able to conduct the most advanced clinical research and better cater to patients’ needs. Among federal buildings, the two buildings constituting the NIH Clinical Center, are second in size only to the Pentagon.","The ceremony for the new center, to be named after Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, was attended by Sen. Hatfield himself, as well as Vice President Al Gore, along with more than 500 guests and dignitaries. At the ceremony, Vice President Al predicted that the NIH Clinical Centers would be able to make medical breakthroughs in research. Among the noted speakers at the groundbreaking ceremony, several patients of the Clinical Center gave testimonies to their benefits from the research advances.","The construction of the NIH Clinical Center marked a significant change in medical history, as much of the research that was being done was basic laboratory research, and the greatest gap was in clinical research. Once people recognized that collaboration between disciplines could result in the true advancement of medicine, the scope of laboratory and clinical research expanded to meet the changing techniques and demands of the medical field. The opening of the original Clinical Center in 1953 marked a decade long transformation of the NIH from a local, small federal agency to the powerful research center that fueled all biomedical research. This redefinition of the NIH was due to 3 US Public Health Service officers being able to convince both the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, along with the US Congress, to allow the NIH to expand, develop a research hospital, and establish a national program of grants.  At the time, doctors proposed the need for more changes in the NIH system to reinvigorate the tradition of clinical investigation and incorporate more innovation. With this came the establishment of the NIH Clinical Center, and though it was originally believed that the amount of research must be kept relatively small to be an outstanding research institute, the great success of the NIH Clinical Center and the invaluable medical advances warranted the expansion of the center and the growth of the research.","During Senator Mark O. Hatfield’s service in the United States Senate for 30 years and service as chairman of the committee on appropriations for 8 years, he developed a commitment to medical research. With the support from influential government figures, such as Sen. Hatfield, such expansions and advances in medical research were possible and the Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center was able to become a reality. The Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center opened in 2005 and is a $596 million technological spectacle. This hospital space consists of 4 patient care wings with 242 inpatient beds. The two clinical and research wings of the new building meet at a crossroads, which is designed to function like a town square. In this space, there are alcoves for meetings, floating staircases and open walkways with areas for chairs and couches to allow individuals to interact, encouraging normal interactions between patients and researchers as well. There is a glass-enclosed atrium, lending views of the landscaped courtyards. In the patient rooms, there are large, low windows that allow the patients lying in bed to see views of the courtyards below them. In the children’s unit, unique light fixtures were designed with colored marbles, so children could recognize their own rooms, and paw prints or stars were painted on the ceiling to amuse and comfort children while they were lying in bed. The redesign and modernization of the new Clinical Center demonstrates the growing importance and emphasis on clinical research in the medical field."],"display_date":"November 4, 1997","search_date":"1997-11-04","locations":[{"id":40842,"lat":39.1365976774,"lng":-77.2045056739,"zoom":9,"place":"Montgomery, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":1655,"tag":"Space"}],"course":{"name":"Making the Modern Hospital","school":"Vanderbilt University","course_id":107,"school_id":60}},{"id":5681,"title":"The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 and its Deinstitutionalizing Effect on Saint Elizabeth's Hospital","course_id":107,"status":"P","start_date":"10/31/63","end_date":"10/31/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Due to a growing need for mental health services, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was built by the United States Congress as a result of the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation Act of 1852. The Institution opened in Washington, DC in 1855 as the “Government Hospital for the Insane”. A prominent leader in the mental health field, Dorthea Dix, lobbied for the construction of the facility and founded the facility with the goal of providing the \"most humane care and enlightened curative treatment of the insane of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia.” Before this, many of the patients that could be considered “insane” were simply put in jail and were not receiving the care they needed. The name of the facility was later changed to Saint Elizabeth’s in 1916 because it temporarily provided medical care for wounded soldiers during the Civil War and those that were being treated were reluctant to tell people that they were being cared for at a mental institution. Instead they used the name of the colonial area the hospital was originally built on, Saint Elizabeth’s. Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was the first government-run mental institution in the country and was one of the largest mental institutions in the country. The hospital was a pioneer in mental health care at the time of its existence. At its prime in the 1940’s, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was home to over 7,000 patients.","Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital now operates with a small fraction of that number of patients, largely due to a certain historical event, the Community Mental Health Act of 1963. This Act, fully titled the “Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963,” promoted community-based health care and provided federal funding for such facilities. One of the main purposes of this act to was provide government assistance “in improving mental health through grants for construction of community mental health centers.” The government began to fund the construction of outpatient facilities in order to allow mental patients to live more normal lives. Prior to this, mental hospitals were what Erving Goffman would consider “total institutions,” meaning that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was a place in which all of the patients’ activities took place with a large group of others on a schedule, which shut the patients off from the rest of society. This act led to a considerable amount of deinstitutionalization all over the country. The total number of mentally ill patients that were institutionalized went from 650,000 in 1955 to less than 150,000 in 1983. The act, in conjunction with the quickly deteriorating living conditions at the hospital, meant that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was no exception.  With the passage of the Community Mental Health Act of 1963, more patients opted for outpatient care and the number of patients at the hospital steadily declined."],"display_date":"October 31, 1963","search_date":"1963-10-31","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":1655,"tag":"Space"},{"id":267,"tag":"Health"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Making the Modern Hospital","school":"Vanderbilt University","course_id":107,"school_id":60}},{"id":5683,"title":"Autopsy Dictates Asylum Goals: New Traditions from Unique Events","course_id":107,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-07-08","end_date":"1882-07-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After Dr. William W. Godding, the 2<sup>nd</sup> superintendent of Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, DC, witnessed the autopsy of Charles Guiteau, his viewpoint on the pathology of the insane was solidified and, therefore, resulted in the drastic alteration of the mission, practices, and clinical direction of Saint Elizabeth’s. The hospital was established by an act of Congress in 1852 and opened in 1855 as the first federal mental hospital and the first public mental hospital in DC. It was purposed to be a model of humane care and enlightened, curative treatment practices[1] as it strove to bring high-quality psychiatric attention to the poor.[2]","The autopsy in question was a result of events stemming from the 1881 assassination of President Garfield.[3] On July 2 in Washington, DC, Guiteau shot President Garfield who died 79 days later from botched medical care.[4] The murder trial of Guiteau was the first highly publicized forensic battle, pitting leading psychiatrists and neurologists against each other, as Guiteau said a deity instructed him to kill Garfield for the good of the nation.[5] Guiteau demonstrated other seemingly insane antics throughout his trial hinting that he was “off his nut.”[6] Despite these antics, the prosecution argued that Guiteau’s only affliction was “moral depravity.”[7] At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Guiteau capable of discerning right and wrong and, therefore, condemned him to death.[8]","After Guiteau was hung, Dr. Godding witnessed the autopsy performed by D.S. Lamb, MD; the results of which were published on July 8, 1882.[9] Despite rejection of the insanity plea, the autopsy found “pathologic changes suggestive of chronic disease of cerebral vessels,” resulting in a flood of articles claiming Guiteau had suffered from a mental illness.[10] Afterwards, Dr. Godding altered his mission for the hospital, to depart “in the direction…of pathological changes left behind by insanity”[11] in order to better understand and treat mental disorders.[12] Dr. Godding’s decision was revolutionary. In the late 1800s, pathology was developing as a basic science, yet neuropathologic correlation with clinical and demonstrable mental health behavior had not developed.[13] To further the new goals and mission of Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital, Dr. Godding appointed Dr. Isaac W. Blackburn as special pathologist to the hospital in 1884;[14] the first full-time pathologist in a public mental health hospital in the United States.[15]","This autopsy and appointment had long-lasting effects on the physical facilities at Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital as Blackburn established a tradition of innovative research and training that flourished at Saint Elizabeth’s for 100 years.[16] Also, Dr. William Alanson White, the 4<sup>th</sup> superintendent, established a psychology laboratory and formed the first psychotherapy department in any mental hospital in the United States.[17] In conclusion, despite the cessation of the research mission at Saint Elizabeth’s, the legacy of this tradition is still mediating the experience of practitioners, researchers, and the mental health population today.[18]","[1] Jogues R.

It was one of only two African-American medical schools to meet the academic standards of the Flexner Report. It offers degrees in dentistry, medicine, and public health.[1]"," ","In fall 1997, the president of Meharry went to the vice chancellor for health affairs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center with a proposition to form a “strategic, mutually beneficial alliance”[2]. Beneficial, because it would allow both institutions to continue providing services to Nashville’s medically underserved population. One year later, the board of trustees of both institutions approved the alliance[3]."," ","Chatman identified several factors affecting the decision to form an alliance- the need for an efficient public hospital, shared challenges presented by TennCare- primarily its reimbursement rate, and commitments to enhancing medical education, research, and the health of the community[4]"," ","On Jan. 1, 1999 Meharry Medical College and Vanderbilt University Medical Center announced an alliance converging at Nashville General Hospital- sharing the facility, their collective staff, and the patient population. It was described as an “unprecedented partnership”[5]. It was a uniquely beneficial merger because Meharry and Vanderbilt focused on distinct areas of care- Meharry more on family medicine and primary care, while Vanderbilt was highly specialized.[6] As a result, they complemented each other very nicely."," ","During the time of the merger, some of Meharry’s faculty and administration worried that it would be engulfed and lost in the larger institution that was the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. As the president of Meharry’s Faculty Senate stated, “We can compliment each other, but we have two different missions and we need to be careful.”[7]"," ","This, along with the financial benefits of the merger helped to quiet the criticisms. Said E. Ramone Segree, senior vice president for institutional advancement who used the alliance to raise money toward Meharry’s five-year $124 million capital fund-raising campaign, “It’s a masterful partnership.”[8]"," ","Thus, this alliance was born out of a desire to provide better and more stable care to a medically underserved population. The economic model of serving this population with low reimbursement rate of TennCare was unsustainable. In order to maintain the cultural practice of treating this population and the educational requirement of having medical students work in the hospital providing this care, this alliance was formed."," ","[1] Vera Stevens Chatman, Juanita F.
