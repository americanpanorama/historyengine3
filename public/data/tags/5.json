the summer of 1856 tensions ran high between pro slavery and free soil groups in the territory of Kansas and thus trickled into the nearby, slave state Missouri.  Although allowing Kansas to be a slave state would have violated the Missouri Compromise established in 1820, pro slavery forces fought to add yet another state to their' side.  Free soil groups vehemently opposed instituting slavery in this territory not due to moral objections, but rather because they wanted to create an all white state where plantations wouldn't usurp all of the wealth of the land.  In addition, they just didn't want blacks in the region.  In addition to these two groups, there was a group of abolitionist, striving to quash the spread of slavery to the territory, but this group was admittedly the smallest of the three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a measure to thwart the efforts/travel of others, pro slavery advocates blocked the Missouri River, obstructing Free State travel.  In response to the blockade, abolitionists opened what became known as the Lane Trail which passed from Topeka to Iowa in order to allow a passageway for Free State travelers.   The passageway allowed travelers to avoid Missouri altogether.  Another such skirmish in the area involved Missourians and Carolinians crossing over into other territories such as Kansas and Nebraska to similarly block roads, prohibiting passageways for travelers once again.  Clashes became more frequent and more violent as the summer progressed.  These incidents along with others involving the areas of Kansas and Missouri showed the unwillingness of the pro and anti slavery forces to come to any sort of compromise on the issue."],"display_date":"August 12, 1856","search_date":"1856-08-12","locations":[{"id":7734,"lat":40.4223365971,"lng":-93.5685535453,"zoom":10,"place":"MERCER, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":58,"title":"The Know-Nothing Riot in Baltimore\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-10-08","end_date":"1856-10-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Xenophobic men established the Know Nothing or American Party in the late 1940s in response to the growing number of immigrants, particularly Irish Catholics flooding into the United States because of the Irish Famine of 1845.  They were known as the Know Nothing Party because when asked questions about the organization and their affiliation with it, members responded that they knew nothing.  The Know Nothings vehemently opposed blacks, foreigners and especially Roman Catholics whom they supposedly swore to never vote for when initiated into the party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the weeks leading up to Election Day in the city of Baltimore, tensions ran high among the Know Nothings and the ever growing Irish Catholic Democrats.  Tensions culminated in Baltimore when the race for the municipal elections sparked riots between the warring clubs of the city.  Many people were killed and wounded as insurgents fought on the streets with muskets, swivels, pistols and all manners of weapons (The Daily Picayune, Oct 9, pg. 4).'  The governor sent for the city militia to settle the fighting on Election Day and in the end, the American party emerged victorious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The riot in Baltimore highlights the fact that Americans in 1856 did not exclusively discriminate against blacks, but also fellow whites.  American Protestants were extremely anti-foreigner not to mention anti-Catholic and did not welcome the hoards of Europeans, specifically the Irish and the Germans, that migrated en masse to the United States in the middle of the nineteenth century.  Through this riot, the modern day student can see that hierarchies in the United States of the era were not solely based upon race."],"display_date":"October 8, 1856","search_date":"1856-10-08","locations":[{"id":5931,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":65,"title":"Mob Violence in Missouri\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-07-01","end_date":"1856-07-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The fight over whether Kansas should be a slave or a free state raged throughout the summer of 1856 in Kansas, Missouri and other surrounding areas.  The Free State militia won ground in the ongoing battle by seizing the town of Franklin, a pro slavery stronghold in August, but the Pro-Slavery men would not capitulate and they proved victorious in many clashes as well.  Skirmishes continued through the fall leading to deaths on both sides of the struggle.  It quickly became apparent there would be no easy solution to the problem of slavery in the territory of Kansas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An incident occurred in the middle of the summer, when a Methodist Conference was interrupted by Pro-Slavery men in Andrew County, Missouri.  The Pro-Slavery men ordered the conference to disperse and when they did not, the mob entered the church in which the conference was being held and tarred and feathered the presiding officer of the meeting.  When an older man attempted to intervene on behalf of the presiding officer the man was shot.

While the first war only lasted a year, the Second Seminole War began in 1821 and did not end 1842, although no peace treaty was ever signed.  The Third Seminole War was the decisive conflict which ended warfare between the two parties and decimating the Seminole population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Third Seminole War, the last war between the settlers and the Seminole Indians in Florida, lasted from 1855 until 1858.  The war was also known as Billy Bowleg's War because Billy Bowlegs was the main Seminole leader in this third and final installment.  War broke out for the third and final time between the settlers and the Seminole Indians primarily over land disputes and by the conclusion of the war, there were less than two hundred remaining Seminoles in Florida.  After the war, Billy Bowlegs and his family migrated to Indian Territory in Oklahoma under the terms of surrender.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On August 21, 1856 an attempt to resolve warfare in Florida was made with the recently ratified treaty between the United States and the Creek and Seminole tribes.  The treaty called for the Creeks and Seminoles to submit there land and move west.  Once these people moved west, they would be given a Seminole government independently of association with any other tribes (The New York Daily, Aug 22, pg. 4).'  The treaty however did not put an end to the violence between the Seminoles and the white settlers and in the end, the Seminoles were forced to relocate west, but without an independent government or the pecuniary and the civil advantages (The New York Daily, Aug 22, pg. 4)' that the treaty promised."],"display_date":"August 21, 1856","search_date":"1856-08-21","locations":[{"id":1284,"lat":29.7296251981,"lng":-82.4202056031,"zoom":9,"place":"ALACHUA, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":102,"title":"Influential Use of the Phrase &#147;Manifest Destiny&#39;\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-02-27","end_date":"1845-02-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The phrase manifest destiny originated in 1844 with a journalist in New York named John O'Sullivan in his magazine called the <em>Democratic Review</em>, in reference to the annexation of Texas.  Manifest destiny is the idea that it was God's will that the United States expand throughout the whole of the continent (though not by force) to spread liberty and democracy.  O'Sullivan's second use of the term, in the <em>New York Morning News</em> on February 27, 1845, was extremely influential.  With this use, he discussed what he believed was the right of the United States instead of the British to claim Oregon Country.  With the expansion of American territory inevitably came the disagreements as to whether or not expansion should include the institution of slavery, and where: after early 1846, Democrats enthusiastically adopted the phrase for their use.  The idea of manifest destiny was also used in many instances to justify displacement of the American Indians throughout the continent.The use of the term manifest destiny in propaganda and publications promoting westward expansion had long-term, lasting effects on the United States.  Manifest destiny was a major rationale behind the Mexican War of 1846-1848, after which Americans gained Alta California and Nuevo Mexico.  New industrial empires sprung up in the West, especially with the gold rush in the newly acquired California in 1849.  Once the U.S. had control of Oregon Country from the British, it was found to be as rich and fertile as imagined.  After the Civil War, the philosophy of manifest destiny helped to promote the westward movement of the population after the emancipation of slaves.  In some situations, manifest destiny is even discussed today, for some Canadians believe that the United States may still have the somewhat hidden goal of annexing Canadian land."],"display_date":"February 27, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-27","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":105,"title":"Jefferson Davis Takes Office in the U.S. House of Representatives\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-03-04","end_date":"1846-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["From his estate in Warren County, Mississippi, Jefferson Davis was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1844, and took office for the 29th Congress on March 4, 1845.

President John Quincy Adams had the auspicious task of keeping both sides happy in a desperate attempt to avoid any kind of armed conflict.  The first of what would become many troubling incidents for both parties occurred on January 21st, 1827.  Friar Joaquin Aremas was a Catholic from Spain who had migrated to Mexico to convince the Mexican government to realign with its mother country, Spain.  While Friar Aremas could be seen as some meaningless radical (and most historians do), at the time this was seen in the eyes of many as a dangerous sign.  President Adams realized the urgency and quickly sent out a message that was disseminated to the nation at large via the newspapers.  In it, he claimed that No change had taken place in the amicable relations of the Mexicans with those of North America'.  Officer Vera Cruz echoed the President's sentiments claiming that the affairs of Mexico were prosperous'.  Friar Aremas was cast back into obscurity; Mexico never seriously considered his plan, but the thought of Mexico backed by a powerful European country had the potential to upset the entire global balance.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event was significant for it proved the inevitability of a war with Mexico.  Both sides were too deeply involved with one another's affairs.  As long as colonists lived so near the border, and as long as instigators like Aremas were around, problems would soon follow.  Relations became so bad that in late November Mier y Teran was sent by the Mexican government to leave Mexico City for the sole purpose to scout and assess the present danger of the border.  Teran reached San Antonio on March 1, 1828 traveling to San Felipe on April 27th and Nacogdoches on June 3rd.  His worrisome results added fuel to a fire that was lit by a Catholic friar in mid-January 1827.  Could American settlers try to take their territory like so many Indian tribes?

Nearly forty thousand Union troops arrived here and began a full assault, but the Confederates successfully defended themselves, as the Union regiments were uncoordinated, and the Confederates had spent the past year preparing the terrain for an assault. The terrain was varied and difficult to traverse: a series of ridges;high ground;and steep declivity;wide level plain;deep and irregular gullies;a deep gorge.' The terrain was remembered for such places as the Citadel. Unable to storm their opponent but unwilling to concede defeat, the Union army surrounded the Confederates and put them under siege, occasionally attempting to attack, but always returning unsuccessfully. On May 22, at the onset of the siege, Union gunships blasted at the fortification around Port Hudson, but the army was never able to gain access. At this battle two regiments of African American soldiers were present, the 1st and 3rd Louisiana Native Guards. They were the first regiment to actively participate in the combat.&lt;br /&gt;After news reaches Louisiana of the Confederate defeat at Vicksburg, the disheartened Confederate troops surrendered. While the loss of Port Hudson itself would have been horrible, it would not have been nearly as terrible as it was when combined with the proximate losses just days before at Vicksburg and Gettysburg, devastating losses for the Confederacy that not only weakened morale throughout the South but also brought the Confederate army into some disarray, having lost two important strongholds in addition to having their major offensive action be repelled. The Confederate surrender ensured Union control of the Mississippi river for the remainder of the Civil War. This was a huge strategic boost for the Union, which could then use the Mississippi to move quickly around the Western front, and the Confederacy was well aware of this change in circumstance."],"display_date":"May 21, 1863 - July 9, 1863","search_date":"1863-06-14","locations":[{"id":5504,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"EAST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":156,"title":"Creation of Texas Regiment for Service in the Phillipine-American Way\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-03-03","end_date":"1899-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Raised specifically for duty in the Philippines, the Thirty-third Infantry regiment of the United States Volunteers became the most famous combat unit to serve in the Philippine-American War, which lasted from 1898 to 1902. The U.S. had purchased the Philippines from Spain at the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898; however, Filipinos had been fighting for their independence since 1896 and refused to acknowledge American authority on the island. Hostilities broke out on February 4, 1899 with the shooting of a Filipino citizen by an American soldier, part of a contingency of several thousand who had been sent to occupy the island. Several very bloody battles ensued, including the Battle of Manila, which brought thousands of casualties for Filipinos and Americans alike. By the end of the year, the Filipino forces had been defeated, but a guerilla war continued until Teddy Roosevelt declared the war over in 1902. &lt;br /&gt;The Thirty-third infantry became known as the Texas Regiment' because of their reputation for being a bunch of wild ex-cowboys. The regiment served in the Philippines from October 27, 1899, to March 2, 1901. One third of the company's officers and enlisted men came from Texas, with the rest coming from the South and Southwest. The men were organized and trained in the summer of 1899 at Fort Sam Houston and Camp Capron, near San Antonio. They left for the Philippines in the winter, where they distinguished themselves in the battles of Magnatarem, Tirad Pass, Vigan, and Taguidin Pass. They continued to contribute to the American effort on the island until they were withdrawn in the spring of 1901. &lt;br /&gt;The Philippine conflict, in conjunction with the Spanish-American War of 1898, set off a fierce debate within the American government and the public about America's role in the world. While many were eager to export American power across the globe, others were hesitant about such expansionism. Newspapers were a forum for this argument, with articles on the subject running continuously in 1899. The January 7 edition of the Atlanta Constitution read THE WHITE MAN CAN'T CONTROL THE BLACK MAN: Senator Caffery Says He is Opposed to Expansion'. Every politician weighed in on this debate. However, ultimately, President McKinley entered the United States into an age of expansion which left it a global imperial power."],"display_date":"March 3, 1899","search_date":"1899-03-03","locations":[{"id":12547,"lat":29.4490384361,"lng":-98.519907109,"zoom":9,"place":"BEXAR, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":168,"title":"African-Americans Try to Improve the Status of Their Race\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-01","end_date":"1864-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beginning in 1863, black communities began to hold large meetings to discuss the articulation and communication of new attitudes towards African-Americans.  One such meeting was held in a black Baptist church in Memphis to commemorate the first anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation.  This meeting was one of the first of black convocations that called for social reforms among the black community and improvement of their status through emancipation, military service, and education.'  In addition, at this meeting, African-American men in all places, at all times and under all circumstances' were encouraged to stop using the vulgar phrase, nigger,'' because it had become common practice for military officers to address black soldiers as such (Journal, 186).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that African-Americans did attempt to improve the status of their race, the officers did not always respond favorably to these attempts.  For example, on February 2, 1864, a Georgia newspaper printed an article saying that there had been a situation in Mississippi where the officer of an African-American company harshly admonished one of his men for carelessness during shooting practice.  The soldier said that he would not stand such language,' especially considering the how respectable the officer was.  The officer responded by hitting the soldier over the head with his gun, which instantly killed him.  The black soldiers then flew to arms' and wounded or killed over one hundred whites.

The article claimed that a portion of the Federal Army was enlisting black soldiers because it would be a great insult and wrong to the South.  However, this article also focuses on the issue of enlisting African-American soldiers into the Confederate Army, which seems to have been met with even greater resistance among Southerners.  The article refers to the Southerners who suggested African-American enlistment into the Confederate Army as traitors' and scoundrels.' (BKW, 5)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This article goes into detail about the laws that had been established previously in 1861 regarding the admission of African-Americans into the Army.  The law stated that the Governor of Tennessee was authorized at his discretion to receive into military service of the state all male free persons of color between the ages of fifteen and fifty.' (BKW, 5)  In addition, the law stated that it was the sheriffs' job to collect names of free African-Americans and give the names to the Governor, should he feel the need to begin enlisting them as soldiers.  However, judging by the article, it appears that the law had not been utilized. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Union Army had already been allowing for the enlistment of African-American soldiers into the Federal Army.  In early 1864, Union Gen. Grant requested that one of his commanders organize a black corps.  The recruitment for this corps would start in Tennessee, and then move to Alabama and Georgia.  Although an entire black corps was not created until late 1864, many black regiments started coming into existence well before then.  Because the North had begun recruiting black soldiers (and because the Confederate Army was running low on troops), it would only make sense to some Southerners to suggest enlisting free African-Americans in order to put down the Union.'

Johnson describes his experiences in an army camp in Florida during the previous summer of 1898. Johnson's friend, Julius E. Boggs, forwarded the letter to the Charleston newspaper, the News and Courier, where it was published on June 18, 1899. Johnson volunteered for the army when the Spanish-American War broke out in 1898 and was enlisted into the first South Carolina regiment that came to be stationed in Georgia and Florida. After this conflict was over, Johnson's regiment was mustered out, but he joined a regiment from his native Tennessee and, in 1899, was stationed on an island in the Philippines. This is where he wrote his letter from in April of that year. &lt;br /&gt;Johnson's letter describes the monotony of his life in camp until he stumbles upon one of the glaring inadequacies of the US military. Johnson became curious about the hospital at his camp and goes there one day only to discover that it was horribly understaffed, that nurses were catching diseases from sick soldiers and that patients were being kept in despicable conditions. Johnson immediately offered to lend a hand in the hospital and went on to fight his commanders in an attempt to improve the facilities. His story is a compelling tale of the struggles he and his fellow soldiers faced, even within the borders of the US. &lt;br /&gt;Other first hand accounts of what life was like as a soldier have also survived to this day. A collection of papers of the Fauntleroy family contain Mr. James Dearing Fauntleroy's records of his days spent at Camp Meade, Pennsylvania. Mr. Fauntleroy was an engineer from Campbell County, Virginia. His papers detail his correspondence with Office of Ordinance Officer for the Headquarter of the East wing of the United States Army cataloguing his requests for supplies while stationed at Camp Meade. One telegram from the summer of 1899 states that Mr. Fauntleroy requested one thousand meat cans, tin cups, knives, forks, spoons, one thousand haversacks and several other miscellaneous items from the New York Arsenal. &lt;br /&gt;While the Fauntleroy papers illustrate the everyday routines and Johnson's letter describes what it was like to be stationed within the US, newspapers from 1899 give much more dramatic portrayals of what soldiers in Cuba and the Philippines were experiencing. Many local papers ran daily columns covering the activities of their town's regiments. The Richmond Dispatch's With the Fourth' gave everyday updates on the fourth regiment of Virginia, which was serving in Cuba in the winter of 1898-99. Their articles could at times be suspiciously upbeat: It is remarked by those who are in a position to know that the regiment is in better shape than any in the Seventh Army Corps in health, strength, and tactical efficiency'. But, ultimately Americans at home wanted to know what their sons, brothers, fathers and husbands were seeing and doing in the wars of the 1890s."],"display_date":"April 23, 1899","search_date":"1899-04-23","locations":[{"id":1330,"lat":30.4938122303,"lng":-81.4274627631,"zoom":9,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":252,"title":"John C.

Calhoun opposed the Ten Regiment Bill proposed by the Polk administration to bolster the army to continue the fight against the Mexicans.  The ten regiment bill called for increased funding to raise and outfit an additional ten regiments to fight Santa Anna's troops in the Mexican American War.  Congress intended this funding to last until the end of the war or for five years, whichever came sooner.  This demonstrates the relative numerical weakness of the American forces in comparison to the Mexican forces.  Although fewer US soldiers existed than Mexican soldiers, the American's possessed superior training, supplies, and leadership, as evidenced by the victory at Buena Vista.&lt;br /&gt;Although Congress eventually passed the measure, Calhoun received an inordinate amount of criticism for his allegedly unpatriotic actions.  Many critics mark this unfortunate event as the start of the decline of Calhoun's bid for the presidency.  Calhoun misread American public opinion at this time and on this subject, and chose to speak in opposition to a bill his highly patriotic constituency supported.  He neglected to take into account the high levels of patriotism present throughout the country in regard to the Mexican American War.  Although the North and the South disagreed on many issues related to race and slavery during this time period, their patriotic views in support of the War converged.

The Comanche and Kiowa tribes realized that the destroying of buffalo on top of heavy military pressure might finally force them completely onto reservations.  In May of 1874 the Comanches performed a new ritual, a sun dance, at the request of a medicine man called Isa-tai.  During this ritual the decision was made to attack white buffalo hunters in the Texas Panhandle.  The attack took place on June 27 when 700 Native-Americans from several different tribes including the Comanches, Kiowas, and the Southern Cheyennes, attacked an abandoned trading post at Adobe Walls that served as camp to the white buffalo hunters.  The Indians held the camp under siege for four days before withdrawing after suffering a number of casualties.  This battle led to the Red River War in which the U.S. Army retaliated by sending five thousand troops to the area that summer.  &lt;br /&gt;An account of a battle is given in The Atlanta Constitution on September 13, 1874.  The battle took place on September 8 when, after a day of small skirmishes between the Indians and the United States troops, the Cheyennes (as they are called in the article, even though the battle included the Comaches and Kiowas, too) retreated to their hiding place on a hill.  The troops led by General Miles charged the hill forcing the Indians into direct conflict.  The Indians were forced to retreat and the battle ended.  However, the article states that the Indians collected their dead, and lit their own villages on fire, which contradicts other accounts of this battle.  Ralph Campbell's Gone to Texas: A History of the Lone Star State states  that although there were few Native-Americans killed, five villages were destroyed and around 1,400 horses were seized or killed.  &lt;br /&gt;The Atlanta Constitution article states:  The moral victory over the first body of hostile Indians encountered lies;in the effect it naturally must have on the enemy in teaching them a practical lesson.'

A Northerner, John Patterson, purchased the Virginius from the government, and, unbeknownst to the New York Customs House, planned to use the ship to take supplies and men to Cuban insurgents fighting the Ten Years' War with Spain.  The Ten Years' War was the Cuban war for independence which lasted from 1868-1878; the last three months of the conflict would escalate to become the Spanish-American War. On October 31, 1873 in international waters near Jamaica, a Spanish naval vessel took the Virginius (which was flying the American flag) and its passengers and crew into custody.  There were 52 American and English crewmen, and around 100 Cuban passengers.  On November 4 in Santiago de Cuba, the Spanish summarily tried and executed 53 of the Virginius's crew, including the ship's commanding officer and former Confederate Captain Joseph Fry, as well as some passengers who turned out to be insurgents.&lt;br /&gt;Americans were outraged at the news; it was inconceivable that Spain would dare to board a vessel flying the U.S. flag in international waters, then impound and execute most of the crew.  Southerners were especially angry at the death of the ship's captain, an upright gentleman' and native Floridian; melancholy obituaries of the Captain who supported the secession of Florida from the Federal Union, and served throughout the war in the navy of the Confederate States' appeared in papers across the South.  In exchange for the loss of such a man, ever ready to espouse the cause of liberty,' Southerners wanted justice: The blood of Captain Fry and his comrades has not been shed in vain. From all over this country will go up a cry for vengeance upon their murderers, and Cuba soon be free Cuba.'&lt;br /&gt;Even after the news came out that the Virginius had flown the American flag illegally, tensions were high between the U.S. and British and Spain.

In 1875, the Spain paid an indemnity of 80,000 to the American and British governments in apology for the execution of American and British citizens two years earlier.  Though the Virginius incident rallied Southern pride, it also lit a fire of nationalism in the United States, a prelude to the rise of nativism later in the century, and sowed a seed of discord between the American and Spanish governments which would yield the Spanish-American War a few years later."],"display_date":"October 31, 1873 - November 8, 1873","search_date":"1873-11-03","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":359,"title":"Congress passes the 3rd Reconstruction Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-07-19","end_date":"1867-07-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beginning in March of 1866, the period of Reconstruction sought to force change on the rebel states by creating a series of laws designed to control their behaviors.  Only in retrospect can it be said that Reconstruction began in 1866, as it was not until March of 1867 that Congress passed the first of the so-called Reconstruction Acts that would truly force change in the South.  President Andrew Johnson attempted to veto all three acts, but each time Congress passed the act despite these objections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On July 19, 1867, the third of the Reconstruction Acts gave supreme power to the five Union generals overseeing Reconstruction in the five districts of the South.  Each district included several former states of the Confederacy, with the exception of Tennessee, which was never under military rule.  These generals held the power to remove any official, elected or otherwise, from office if they believed the official to impede rather than expedite the process of Reconstruction.  Understandably, the North felt that the South would try to avoid the obligations stated under the previous Reconstruction Acts, which included holding a constitutional convention to re-write each state's constitution as well as the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Despite the implicit fact that this law was intended to improve the situation in the South for blacks trying to resettle after emancipation, it was widely resented by Southerners who felt that the North was, yet again, attempting to impose their will on the former Confederacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Congress pushed the Reconstruction Acts through, despite President Johnson's veto, they were likely unaware of the repercussions that would result from these acts.

Under this system, the general in charge of the region in which the state was located would be responsible for making these decisions.  Because President Andrew Johnson did not agree with many clauses in the Acts of Reconstruction, this particular section was bound to be problematic.  In addition, Texas fell under the jurisdiction of General Philip Sheridan, a man who was often at odds with President Johnson.  Within weeks of the passing of the final act of Reconstruction, Sheridan had placed himself in a vulnerable position by removing the governor of Louisiana, James Madison Wells, and immediately taking aim at the governor of Texas, J.W. Throckmorton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Sheridan, a commanding officer of the United States military during the Civil War, had been assigned to oversee the Reconstruction of the Fifth Military District: Texas and Louisiana.  He saw the current governor of Texas, James Webb Throckmorton, as a hindrance to Texas' Reconstruction and therefore ordered his removal only two weeks after the passing of the third Reconstruction Act.  July 30, the day that General Sheridan ordered Throckmorton's removal, it was reported in the National Intelligencer that President Johnson sought to remove Sheridan from his post as the head of the Texas/Louisiana military district.  Shortly after Throckmorton's removal from office, the National Intelligencer's predictions came to fruition when President Johnson had Sheridan transferred from his post and replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although Sheridan removed Throckmorton from office on July 30, 1867, it was not until August 9 that he was officially replaced by Elisha M. Pease, a Unionist who Sheridan felt would guide Texas through Reconstruction.  Pease, a native of Connecticut who had lived in Texas since 1833 and had always supported the Union, was recommended to the office of provisional governor by A.J. Hamilton.  Ironically, Pease had run as the Republican candidate against Throckmorton only a few months earlier.  The Daily Dispatch published Special Order No.105 from General Sheridan, which removed Throckmorton from office, announced his successor as Pease, and demanded that he be respected accordingly.'"],"display_date":"July 30, 1867 - August 8, 1867","search_date":"1867-08-03","locations":[{"id":12517,"lat":29.9115260515,"lng":-96.1773201162,"zoom":9,"place":"AUSTIN, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":361,"title":"Trial ends in hung jury in the case of John Surratt, Jr.","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-08-10","end_date":"1867-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Perhaps one of the most publicized events of the summer of 1867 was the trial of John Harrison Surratt, Jr. and its impending verdict.  When the verdict was announced as a hung jury' on August 10,1867 after more than two months of arguments had been presented, the responses from the public ranged from resentment to relief.  Indeed, much information needed to be digested to make a decision on Surratt's guilt or innocence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only eighteen years old when the Civil War began, Surratt, who was from Maryland, left school to become a Confederate courier.  During his time in the Confederacy's equivalent of the secret service, Surratt met John Wilkes Booth.  In 1866, when he was first arrested on charges of conspiracy to assassinate President Abraham Lincoln, Surratt maintained his innocence.  While he admitted to being a part of a plot to kidnap President Lincoln a few years prior, he denied taking participating in the murder of the president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to the complexity of this case was the role of Surratt's mother.  Mary Surratt had been tried and hanged in a military court two years prior for her role in the assassination.  Mrs. Surratt had allowed Booth, her son, and other later-charged conspirators to meet in her home, which, according to the military trial, made her culpable.  The public would be as divided over her son's hung jury as they had been by her hanging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A myriad of witnesses were called by both the prosecution and the defense in this case.  One of the more troubling pieces of evidence against Surratt was his fleeing to Europe, where he received protection from the Catholic Church.  When Surratt was finally arrested, it was in Alexandria, Egypt.  Newspapers across the United States published daily updates concerning the Surratt Trial, who had testified, and the editors' opinions on the impending verdict.  The Daily Dispatch actually published the four names of the jurors who had wanted to pronounce Surratt guilty, but not the names of the eight men who chose to proclaim Surratt as innocent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surratt was never re-tried in any court.

After finishing college, Lanier enlisted in the Confederate Army and was sent to the Virginia/Maryland area, into the heart of the battles.  During this time, he was captured by Union soldiers, imprisoned, and contracted tuberculosis.  All of these events would drastically influence the writings he produced in the years following the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiger-Lilies is actually a somewhat autobiographical book.  In it, Lanier analyzes the relationship between a Northerner and a Southerner throughout the Civil War.  As a Southerner who had fought for the Confederate army, Lanier had experienced the war firsthand, both on the battlefield and as a prisoner of war.  These experiences are recognizable in the battle scenes especially, which are considered some of the most realistic representations of Civil War combat in literature.  Ultimately, Tiger-Lilies can be interpreted as an anti-war novel and one of Lanier's less successful endeavors in the course of his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the book is not nearly as revered as Lanier's poetry or musical compositions, it provides a realistic look at the Civil War and how it affected the survivors of the Confederate army.

In order to thwart these efforts, General Pope forced voter registration to be publicized throughout Alabama and announced that from October 1, 1867 until October 4, 1867, voters would cast ballots to vote for a constitutional convention.  After delegates had been selected, the convention began on November 5, 1867.  Newspapers throughout the South covered the events of Alabama's constitutional convention.  In the National Intelligencer, updates were published almost daily. Of interest to many newspapers was Alabama's handling of the question of enfranchising voters.  As it was a requirement for states' constitutions to be approved by the national government, Alabama had to handle this situation in a manner acceptable not only too its citizens but also Congress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Alabama Constitutional Convention did not end until December 6, 1867.

In total four people were killed in the attack and two wounded.  After such provocation as this and other attacks near the Florida border, Andrew Jackson pursued the Indians back into Florida, burning their villages and crops.&lt;br /&gt;Jackson pursued the Indians deeper into Florida, towards St. Augustine.  Along the way, he came across an encampment defended by three hundred and forty negroes' as reported in the National Intelligencer, which he immediately attacked and conquered, where he discovered the leader of the fort was an Englishman, who was promptly court-martialed and executed.  &lt;br /&gt;Jackson soon discovered that the British and especially the Spanish in Florida had been supplying weapons and stimulating the Indians to arms', as the Richmond Inquirer put it.  As a result, on May 24, 1818 Jackson marched on Pensacola and managed to take the Spanish Fort there with little more than a few warning shots.&lt;br /&gt;As word of Jackson's action spread, a stir of controversy shook the nation.  Top officials called for the official censure of his actions.  Henry Clay mentioned in a letter to Charles Tait just after he heard that Jackson had taken Pensacola that he suspected the action was unauthorized, and that it would be imprudent of the President to illegally approve an act of war without Congress' consent.  Still others praised the action, claiming, as the Nashville Whig did, that so long as; Florida remains under the dominion of the Spaniards, our frontiers will be disturbed by Indian incursion'.  Indeed, Jackson himself thought he was merely defending the United States from the Babylon of the south'.&lt;br /&gt;Secretary of State John Quincy Adams who, at the time, was in negotiations with Spain for the territory of Florida, convinced officials not to punish Jackson.  Spain, already weak in the area, took the invasion somberly and eventually seceded control of all of Florida to the United States, wherein Jackson was subsequently appointed territorial governor on June 1, 1821.

Even Lincoln reminded Sherman that there was a law in effect regarding black recruitment into the Union Army, and that because it was a law, all must follow it.  Sherman claimed to have the highest regard for the law, but refused to change his mind because he believed his view represented a large portion of Union soldiers.

President Jackson's destruction of the Bank of the United States had resulted in uncontrolled speculation, and frontier people were clamoring for more land.  This was in spite of the 1832 Treaty of Cusseta, which stipulated that individual Creeks be given a parcel of 320 acres if they decided to stay in Alabama.  But neither the Alabama state legislature nor the settlers respected this agreement.  Speculators and settlers bought land from the Indians for much less than it was worth.  Some Creeks resigned themselves to this forced displacement and emigrated west.  Others resisted removal; finding themselves dispossessed of their land, the non-compliant Creeks adopted the practice of stealing livestock from the frontier people, especially those near the Florida border.  Skirmishes between farmers and small bands of Indians became a common occurrence.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the morning of May 15th, a sizeable contingent of Creeks made an attack in Georgia for the first time.  After crossing the Chattahoochee River from Alabama, the party raided the town of Roanoke, killing several whites and burning their homes.  The Southern Recorder reported: There were 70 or 80 persons in the town, including a small company of infantry under Capt. Horne... the number of the enemy being ascertained (about 300) it was thought prudent to retreat, which they did in disorder.'  Unable to overtake the retreating settlers, the Indians decided to return to the town and burn it to the ground.  A number of those who had escaped alerted a military encampment of the attack, but by the time a group of militiamen made it to the hamlet, the Indians were gone.  The Recorder reported that at least seven whites and five blacks were dead, with 15 people missing; the Indians lost only three of their number, while the rest crossed back into Alabama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reports of Indian hostilities' and depredations' became more and more frequent, considerably heightening the distress of those whites who were already dealing with Seminole disturbances in the Florida territory.  When it became clear that federal troops were too busy with the Seminoles to take care of the Creeks in Alabama, Governor Clement C. Clay called out the state militia to bring peace to the area.  This conflict, which came to be known as the Second Creek War, continued into 1837.

It subjected all able-bodied men between the ages of 20 and 45 to military conscription. The guidelines were later clarified so that even those of foreign birth who shall have declared on oath his intention to become a citizen of the United States' would be subject to conscription.&lt;br /&gt;They could, however, evade the requirement by paying a fee of 300 or enlisting a substitute draftee. The first two draft calls produced an army that was approximately ninety percent substitutes. After two months, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, decided that the language of the act read that the acceptance of a fee to waive conscription was optional, and that he had the authority disallow payments in lieu of military services, and to discourage the economic bias of the law suspended the measure. Stanton argued that such a clause should be avoid because the law was intended to be a war measure' and not a revenue measure.' However, the provision to allow substitutes remained permissible, and those conscripted who were well off continued to pay others to serve in their stead. However, conscripts still made up only a fifth of the entire army. These practices were deemed unfair to poorer residents, and resulted in riots in New York City. One reason for the necessity of the Conscription Act was that, subsequent to the Emancipation Proclamation, military enlistments dropped and desertions become more frequent.

The enthusiasm of the troops was matched only by their numbers, a full regiment of fresh soldiers. In Boston, the regiment received a warm send-off, and the cheering crowds wishing them well were as vast as have seldom before been seen.' Not all Northerners were enthusiastic about black soldiers however. Two African American regiments were attacked in Washington by a band of Pro-Slavery ruffians.'&lt;br /&gt;The regiment did not succeed at first, but news of their valiant effort brought increased recruitment among the black community. Their efforts help sustain the Union's war effort, and slaves began to escape from their masters in the Northern slave states, so that they could enlist and fight. The success of this regiment led to the commissioning of Major Stearns to recruit African American soldiers nationally.&lt;br /&gt;Many of the commanders welcomed the new recruits. Major General N. P. Banks, said, that the two regiments he commanded answered every expectation,' but even he did not trust them to ascend to the ranks of officers: They require only good officers;to make them good soldiers.' However, acceptance of the soldiers was not universal among fellow military men. Observing an African American regiment fighting in New Orleans, one author observed that the coexistence of colored and white regiments had led to much agitation and dissatisfaction,' and that some white officers have threatened to kill the first colored officer that offers to assume in any way military authority in their presences.' In Baton Rouge, a soldier from Connecticut argued, God never made [African-Americans] soldiers, or any thing to make soldiers of.' In addition, it dampened morale among some white soldiers as they asked themselves, What are we fighting for? Is it to raise the negroes to an equality with white men?'&lt;br /&gt;Southerners were shocked by the enthusiasm of Northerners to black soldiers, discrediting their belief that the children of Ham possess singular aptitude for the profession of arms.' The South expressed its paternal attitude towards slavery, attacking the North for assigning the blacks in uniform the post of honorable danger;thrown forward to receive the murderous fire of the brave Confederates.' They also fault the emancipated soldiers for buying into the Northern ideology: he does not penetrate the motive that actuates his Abolition friends in endowing him with qualities and qualifications that he himself knows he does not possess.' However, Southerners were also excited at the prospect of fighting against African American regiments, as they believed that the white race possessed innately superior skills for war."],"display_date":"May 28, 1863","search_date":"1863-05-28","locations":[{"id":11447,"lat":32.4068445137,"lng":-80.4452215468,"zoom":8,"place":"BEAUFORT, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":464,"title":"Battle of Murfreesboro\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-12-30","end_date":"1863-01-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Battle of Murfreesboro, also known as the Battle of Stones River, boosted the North's morale after a decisive defeat at Fredericksburg.

The Union army advanced towards Cumberland Gap, but the Confederates viewed the Appalachian Mountains as an insurmountable barrier for the Union army to traverse to reach Tennessee. In addition to the geographic difficulties of this battle, temporal concerns were also important: this battle raged at the same time as the Battle of Vicksburg, and both armies were forced to struggle to maintain enough troops on both fronts.&lt;br /&gt;The opening volley of the battle came the morning of New Years Eve, and the Confederate army felt very confident having repulsed [the Union army] with heavy loss.' Both sides had substantial forces, with the total number of troops nearly forty thousand on either side. The skill of the Confederate cavalry was well demonstrated here. The cavalry was so adept that the Union was seriously embarrassed by the enterprise of the rebel cavalry, who made some serious dashed upon some of McCook's ammunition and subsistence trains, capturing a number of wagons, and artillery ammunition grew alarmingly scarce.'&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the number of casualties was so high that all the houses in Murfreesboro and the neighboring villages are occupied as hospitals.' In addition to the number of casualties, the number of prisoners taken was also significant. The Union army took over three thousand Confederate prisoners, and each side lost more than ten thousand men in sum. This was the largest ration of casualties to soldiers during the entire Civil War. The intense fighting brought rumors of the death of Confederate General Braxton Bragg, but Bragg survived, leading his troops in retreat from the battlefield.

Texan forces under Colonel James Fannin had suffered a crushing defeat at Goliad in late March; Santa Anna had ordered the execution of the 350 remaining soldiers there.  News of the Goliad Massacre' incensed Texan soldiers under the command of Sam Houston.  They looked forward to their chance for retribution.  Meanwhile, interim Texas President David Burnet urged the general to take decisive action against the Mexican army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Houston's chance came when he learned that Santa Anna himself had led a unit of Mexican soldiers through Harrisburg on the way to New Washington, while the rest of the army remained west of the Brazos river.  He led his men to Lynch's Ferry on the San Jacinto River, hoping to cut off Santa Anna's route leading north from New Washington.  As he predicted, Santa Anna's force of 800 men arrived there on April 20.  Mexican scouts spotted their position, and both sides prepared to do battle.  Mexican General Cos arrived the following day with 550 additional soldiers, so that Mexico had 1,350 soldiers compared to Texas's 900, including nineteen Tejanos.  After the Alamo and the Goliad Massacre, the Texans had developed a passionate hatred of Mexicans, so the Tejanos wore special pieces of cardboard in their hats to distinguish themselves from the enemy.  At 3:30 p.m. on April 21, Houston made his approach.  The soldiers moved as quietly as possible, not firing until they came within sixty yards of the Mexican camp.  The Mexican forces, enjoying an afternoon siesta, were caught off guard when the Texans fired off a volley and charged, shouting Remember the Alamo' and Remember the Goliad'  They killed 630 Mexicans and captured 730, but lost only eight men in the battle.  Their greatest success, though, was capturing Santa Anna.  Houston forced the Mexican president to sign an armistice and order the rest of the Mexican forces to retreat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month after his capture, the Mobile Commercial Register printed a sketch of Santa Anna's physical appearance: You will be gratified by a description of Santa Anna's person.

The skin wrinkles on the lower part of his forehead as he elevates his eyes to speak.

His mouth is nothing extraordinary, the upper lip rather projecting, one of his upper front teeth is gone; his under jaw is long.  His countenance is animated when speaking.  His complexion is a little tawney; but he shews more of the Moorish than the Mexican tincture. He might pass for a white man, but would not pass for a native in the U. States.

An immense sum' had been paid to Spain for Florida in 1821, and the territory had been a messy place since, marked by recurring wars with the Seminoles.  As Senator Strange of North Carolina said, the Indians might be whipped, but unfortunately for the country they would not stay whipped.'  The Florida War with the Seminoles had begun in 1835 with the Dade massacre and the ambush of a small force of Americans.  This had convinced the United States government of the need to take more serious actions in Florida.  In 1840, after five years of war, the United States government was getting tired of its failure to subdue the territory.  Accordingly, the Senate was debating measures designed to settle Florida in a more permanent and forceful manner.  &lt;br /&gt;The American reported that the Senate deliberated upon a bill granting up to 10,000 white settlers a bounty of three hundred and twenty acres of land each.'  The men would have to be able and willing to fight, and they would be organized into camps for the purpose of claiming and protecting their own areas of land.  This bill was opposed by Senator Crittenden of Kentucky, who argued that it was not worth maintaining the United States Army in Florida to protect a mass of settlers who would not be establishing farms and homesteads.  Meanwhile, the federal government would be responsible for feeding and clothing these settlers.  He proposed instead that bounties be offered for each Indian killed.  Reports of numbers of Indians killed and the manner in which they died continued to appear in newspapers throughout 1840.  The military forces in Florida even imported bloodhounds from Cuba to hunt down Indians for deportation.&lt;br /&gt;In July, a bill for the admission of Florida as a state came before Congress.  Congress would admit Florida as soon as it reached the requisite population of 30,000.  A second bill also made its way to the Senate floor, this one calling for Florida to be split into two territories and then admitted as two states.  The Charleston Mercury suggested that this bill had been written by abolitionists with the intent of delaying statehood for years so that anti-slavery settlers could flood the territory in the meantime, eventually turning at least one of the halves into a free state.  A free state at the mouth of the Gulf of Mexico was something which the Mercury could hardly live at peace with.'  It would be a Botany Bay for superfluous Tappans and Garrisons so near us , better to have the Seminoles.'

At the same time many southern blacks were eager to enlist.  Eventually, Congress called for four black and six white regiments.  A number of black men from Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Virginia and the Ohio Valley enlisted, although the majority never saw any combat action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horace Wayman Bivins, a black man from Virginia enlisted in Troop E in the 10th cavalry.  The description of his experience enables us to imagine what life in the army was like for black soldiers.  Bivins' regiment originally patrolled throughout Montana, Wisconsin and Illinois were they were treated like royalty by civilians black and white civilians.  Once the tenth cavalry was transferred to Chickamauga, Georgia in the spring of 1898 he noted a stark contrast in the treatment of black soldiers in the South.  Rather than being met with applause and parades, they were forced to use separate restrooms and eat in different lunchrooms than their white counterparts.  Eventually Bivins saw direct combat action in Cuba and San Juan.  In a letter to a friend he illustrated the pride and excitement of the black soldiers, writing, ;I am fighting for humanity as we march on;to defend the emblem of eternal liberty and justice, the stars and stripes, the flag of our Great Republic;there is no people on earth more loyal and devoted to their country than the Negro.,'  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus despite the harsh treatment that blacks had endured in the United States for over a century, they remained loyal and proud to the country.  What is even more telling is the fact that although blacks were not worthy to use the same toilet as white men in South in 1898, the government had no problem sending black men to fight next to white men.  Regardless the ability of black men in battle was positively regarded.  In a letter to a friend, Teddy Roosevelt wrote,  I wish no better men beside me in battle than these colored troops show themselves to be.'"],"display_date":"April 1, 1898 - August 30, 1898","search_date":"1898-06-15","locations":[{"id":1279,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":671,"title":"Construction Begins on Fort Zachary Taylor in Key West, Florida","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-07-01","end_date":"1846-07-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The first federal building to be constructed on Key West, which is the southern-most point of the United States, Fort Taylor was begun in July of 1846.

Many blacks were employed gainfully in the community as artisans, policeman, and fireman.  Rather than look at this positively, white men were intimidated by blacks and thus considered Wilmington the city of lost opportunity' for white men.  Regardless of the fact that the majority of blacks in Wilmington were upstanding citizens the popular opinion among whites was that the blacks were dangerous.  Many white men were specifically afraid of black men raping white women.  Furthermore whites were angered at the insurgence of political participation by carpet baggers' and negroes.'  As a result many white men made it their personal mission to prove that blacks were socially inferior to whites.  In response to the white supremacist sentiment, the editor of The Record, the black newspaper in Wilmington published an editorial blaming white men for the fact that white women were often raped.  This was the last straw for the white democrats in Wilmington.  Soon after the publication, nine white men came together and formed the Secret Nine.'  The group's purpose was to cooperate with the North Carolina White Supremacist movement to protect their homes and their city.  The Secret Nine planned to revolt the day after the state election.  They worried that the Republican ticket would prevail and thus the city would fail to progress.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the relief of the Secret Nine the Democratic candidate, Charles B. Ayock, was elected as the North Carolina Chief Executive.  Despite the victory in their favor, on November 10 at 11 am, 10000 white citizens held a town meeting led by Alfred Moore who asserted, We will not live under these intolerable conditions, no society can stand it, we intend to change it if we have to choke the current cape of Fear River with Negro carcasses (Moore in Hayden 1936).  The citizens then drew up a declaration of White Supremacy demanding that the editor of The Record, leave Wilmington immediately, and further demanding that the most gainful employment be reserved for whites.  The resolution was sent to Negro leaders.  While awaiting a response armed white men assembled throughout the city with rifles.  They then marched to The Record burning it to the ground.  Inadvertent shots were fired injuring white men.  A large scale riot ensued between the black and white civilians.  Ultimately the editor of The Record was banned from Wilmington, and white supremacist sentiment prevailed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wilmington riot occurred nearly 35 years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Although the blacks in 1898 were legally free' they were still considered inferior to whites.  Thus it seemed that the domination of the black race had shifted from a physical domination to a sort of economic and social domination.  The riot stood to eliminate the Negro as a political factor in Wilmington.  Throughout the South at this time, disfranchisement of Negros was occurring."],"display_date":"November 9, 1898 - November 10, 1898","search_date":"1898-11-09","locations":[{"id":9661,"lat":34.2953764793,"lng":-77.7420682293,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW HANOVER, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":691,"title":"The Battle of Anniston\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-11-24","end_date":"1898-11-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Spanish American War, the Third Regiment in Alabama was comprised entirely of black men.

When physically attacked the black soldiers organized themselves into columns and respectively marched away.  Regardless of their controlled actions, the blacks were painted as violent, ignorant and poor by the whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The torment of the Third Regiment escalated until the black soldiers could take no more.  On the night of November 24, 1898 Private Gildhart of Arkansas was shot by a Negro soldier.  It was reported that he was also stabbed in the back.  In the events that followed a member of the 4th Kentucky regiment was shot down.  It was the belief of the popular press that the Negro soldiers drew fire without reason or warning.  The bad treatment that the black soldiers had endured was not recognized, rather the Birmingham Age Herald described the black soldiers as having, murder in their hearts,' (Birmingham Age Herald, November 25, 1898, p.1.)  Next, a group of about 100 Negro soldiers assembled to fight back against the disrespect they had previously tolerated.  The white regiments from Tennessee, Arkansas and Kentucky drew fire against the black soldiers.  Two white men from Tennessee were reported as killed, while two members of the provost guard were reported as missing.

Washington and a parade of 1,200 young black students.  The people of Tuskegee felt incredibly honored that the President had chosen to visit their school, and B.T. Washington expressed this gratitude in a speech made at the Tuskegee Chapel.

The patriotism was contagious as Senator Wiley first addressed the group, speaking of the pride associated with wearing the Uniform of a United States Soldier.  President McKinley then spoke on the very same steps where Jefferson Davis had accepted the presidency of the Confederacy.  In direct opposition to Davis's earlier acceptance speech, McKinley stated, We have nothing to take back for having kept you in the union.  We are glad you did not go out and glad you stayed in,' (McKinley in Perman 2001).  Although McKinley was a Union veteran, his trip to the South solidified his desire to unify the North and South and show his support for the Southern states.

Affects of the Civil War had created a dominant middle class, as well as a strong African American vote, in Clarke County. When the 1892 elections for Governor of Alabama arrived, most Clarke County residents supported one of two political parties- the Democratic Party or the Farmer's Alliance. The race for governor between Democratic candidate, Thomas Goode Jones, and Alliance-backed candidate, Reuben F. Kolb, promised to be a close one. Local newspapers enhanced the dramatic race by publishing warnings from the Democratic Party, stating that Misrepresentations and falsehood are the chief weapons of the Kolb party' (2). Conflict began immediately after the election, with claims that Jones' victory was the result of illegal actions, such as ballot stuffing. The front page of the Birmingham Age-Herald reported, just days after the election, that The political situation in Alabama is critical and the gravest fears of the leaders of two legislatures and two state governments from present indications, may be realized' (1). Democrats carried the black vote in Clarke County, infuriating citizens of the rural precinct of Mitcham Beat, who had turned to the Alliance after feeling ignored by their own local Democratic Party. This group of citizens of Mitcham Beat, secretly named Hell-at-the-Breech, didn't have a loyalty to the Alliance, either, but voted that way simply to be accepted politically. When the Alliance began reporting lawlessness on the part of white men in Mitcham Beat, the men took out their frustration with violence.     &lt;br /&gt;The murder of elite Democratic Party member Ernest McCorquodale, allegedly over McCorquodale's foreclosure of a Hell-at-the-Breech member's farm , was investigated, but never solved after all suspects were found to have alibis. Not long after, in June 1893, a black man, William Howze, was murdered outside of Mitcham Beat for mistreating a white woman. When the black man's brother was accused of the same crime a month later, two prominent citizens of Clarke County stepped forward to prevent his lynching. When the Hell-at-the-Breech posse confronted an upper-class store owner in a neighboring town over allegations that the store owner had mistreated a boy from Mitcham Beat, leaders of Clarke County saw connections between McCorquodale and Howze's murders. The Mayor stepped in to protect Clarke County around the same time that McCorquodale's death was avenged by the murder of Hell-at-the-Breech member, Lev James. Soon after, Hell-at-the-Breech members' names were given by tortured members and, to make a point, the mob of Clarke County men publicly shot one of the most prominent members of the group, Quincy Bledsole.

He had been unable to establish a government among the Venezuelans as he had wished, and had lost all hope of receiving supplies for his army there, so in February 1817, he moved on to Mexico.  On the Island of St. Thomas, he encountered 130 more men to fight in his army.  In June, he went to Baltimore, Charleston, and Savannah to hire more troops and obtain supplies for his attack on Spanish Florida.  Promising land in Florida when he conquered it, McGregor was successful in raising an army, largely of veterans of the War of 1812.  He assembled his troops at mouth of the Altamaha River, and they marched to nearby Fernandina (later Amelia Island) with the intent to fight.  When they arrived, the Spanish were so intimidated by the display that they surrendered immediately when he landed on June 29th.  &lt;br /&gt;On July 10th the Savannah Republican reported that General McGregor had garrisoned Amelia Island, St. Johns, and Augustine.  Ruggles Hubbard, the high sheriff of New York City, arrived on August 8th and McGregor decided to put him in charge and leave Fernandina.  He returned to his home in Baltimore with his wife.  Hubbard's control of the territory ended abruptly on September 21st, when Luis Aury, a pirate, claimed Florida as his in the name of Mexico.  General lawlessness ensued, and on December 23rd, Aury was deposed by the United States Navy.  He surrendered without a shot.  &lt;br /&gt;The whole affair was very exciting for the people of the South, and accounts of the most recent events in East Florida could be found in newspapers throughout the region on an almost daily basis.  East Florida was an attractive land for America for several reasons.  The weather was pleasant, but more importantly, it was perfect for a variety of valuable trees.  It had the best harbor in the gulf, which would be very helpful for trade.  Also, having foreign soil so close by had made it difficult for southern Alabaman police to enforce laws, since criminals could so easily escape over the border."],"display_date":"June 29, 1817 - December 23, 1817","search_date":"1817-09-25","locations":[{"id":9,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"BALDWIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":783,"title":"South Carolina Executive Council Created by Secession Convention\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-12-14","end_date":"1861-12-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In response to Union military action in South Carolina, including the fall of Port Royal, David F.

Governor Pickens was a scapegoat for the fall of Port Royal, as well as the fire in Charleston that started on December 11, 1861.

Any armed person found within Union lines was to be shot, and any person rebelling against the Union would have his property seized and his slaves freed.  Upon hearing this news, Lincoln quickly revoked the measures, though Fr?mont was kept in control of Missouri.  As a critical border state, Lincoln feared such draconian policies would alienate the Missouri population and lead to greater support of the Confederacy.&lt;br /&gt;Though it was a slave state in 1861, Missouri never seceded, remaining in the Union as a so-called border state.'  The governor, Claiborne Jackson, refused to send troops to support the Union.  In May he assembled the state militia in St. Louis, where they were defeated by Union forces under General Nathaniel Lyon.  A fight broke out between Union forces and local citizens, ending in a massacre.  The declaration of martial law happened within this context of disarray and bitterness.  The city of St. Louis had already been under martial law when Fr?mont assumed power over the state.    &lt;br /&gt;General Fr?mont's proclamation was reprinted in the New York Times on September 1, 1861.  Explaining why he had declared martial law, Fr?mont mentioned the state's disorganized condition, the helplessness of the civil authority, the total insecurity of life, and the devastation of property by bands of murderers and marauders.'  He very plainly stated, All persons who shall be taken with arms in their hands;will be shot.'  The order stated that all people who had been led away in their allegiances are required to return to their homes.'  If they did not return home, their absence;will be held to be presumptive evidence against them.' &lt;br /&gt;Southern papers were outraged by Fr?mont's proclamation.  The Richmond Daily Dispatch called it an abominable, atrocious, and infamous usurpation;which nothing could justify or excuse.'

It continued to burn into the next day.  Charleston was historically one of the wealthiest cities in the South because of its role as a leading port.  The fire attracted national attention, as the New York Times compiled what information it could from various Southern papers: A reprint from the Charleston Courier estimated the fire caused 7,000,000 in damage (in 1861 currency, not adjusted).  Close to 600 buildings 540 acres of the city burned, including five churches.  Negro shanties' may have been included in the count, exaggerating the damage, according to the opinion of the New York Times writer.  Confederate President Jefferson Davis expressed his condolences, according to a reprint from Richmond Dispatch, promising to pay part of the debt owed to South Carolina by the Confederate government.  &lt;br /&gt;The fire was thought to break out early in the morning in Russel and Olds' sash and blind factory.  By midnight much of the city was on fire.  The business and trading parts of the town, and a great part of its public edifices and churches, are in ashes,' the Times article stated.  Another article in the New York Times stated the fire was rumored to be brought about by arson many of the rumors featured slaves starting the blaze.  On December 13, South Carolina Governor Pickens addressed the state Senate and House of Representatives about the fire, as reported by the Charleston Mercury.

He called for aid for this city at the heart of the Confederacy.  I;call your immediate attention to the relief, for the present, of the poor and destitute who may be sufferers.'  There was a large outpouring of support from around the Confederacy.

The town was located close to Fort Monroe, an important base of operations for Union forces during the war.  Union naval ships based at the fort plied the Chesapeake Bay to enforce the blockade.  A Confederate deserter reported that General Magruder wanted to burn Hampton to prevent Union troops from using the town for Winter quarters.  According to Union General Butler, commander of Fort Monroe, Union forces were intended to winter many miles beyond Hampton.'  The fire was thus a wanton act of cruelty to the resident Unionists, and moreover entirely useless,' concluded a New York Times writer.  Perhaps twenty white people and double that number of negroes' remained in the town; unaware of the fire or unable to flee, some were killed in their sleep.    &lt;br /&gt;According to the same deserter, General Magruder had left Yorktown, VA with 7,000 Confederates in order to attack Newport News or Camp Hamilton.

In May, 1861, three slaves had run away from their master and sought refuge within Union lines at Fort Monroe.  When their master, Colonel Charles Mallory attempted to claim them, General Butler refused. Butler drew on his legal training for his answer.  He called the slaves contraband,' and because they could be used by the Confederates in the war against the Union, he would not return the slaves.  This, of course, contradicted the Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and 1850.  But the Confederacy was no longer a part of the United States; therefore, rebelling states were no longer entitled to protection under United States law, Butler reasoned.  His decision infuriated southerners.  Word spread among slaves in the Hampton area, and hundreds of slaves began to flood the Union lines.  Butler employed them in digging ditches, in his words, saving our soldiers from that labor, under the gleam of the mid-day sun.'  Many of the slave women laundered uniforms for the Union soldiers.  The slaves were paid for their labor.  &lt;br /&gt;By July, there were so many former slaves living in the city of Hampton, Butler did not know what to do with them.  He wrote a letter to Secretary Cameron on July 20, published in the New York Times several weeks later.  In it, he asked, What shall be done with them?'  He continued, Are these men, women, and children, slaves?  Are they free?'  He received a reply in August, described in The New York Herald.  The response stated that Congress had passed a new act on August 6.  Fugitive slaves in rebelling states did not have to be returned to their masters, and certainly any slave used in the Confederate war effort was forfeited.  The letter was far from abolition, mentioning reimbursing slaveholders for their escaped slaves after the war.  Still, it was a step toward emancipation, and the importance of the decision was clear to both Northerners and Southerners.  News articles about the so-called contrabands' were common.  An article in December described ex-slaves living in former President Tyler's residence in Hampton.  The basement is occupied as a contraband school-room;there stood about fifty little black children as eagerly pursueing [sic] their studies as any children could,' wrote a reporter stationed at Fort Monroe.

No such attack ever occurred, and in fact it is questionable whether the federal government ever gave a final approval to the plan.  &lt;br /&gt;East Tennessee was very mountainous.

The water was shallow enough to allow Confederates to raise the ship.  During the Summer of 1861, the Merrimac was placed in dry dock at the Norfolk Navy Yard.  Originally a wooden steam-powered gunboat, Confederate engineers began coating the hull with iron, renaming it the C.S.S. Virginia.  On July 24, 1861, the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond agreed to provide iron for the project at 6.5 cents per pound.  Work on the C.S.S. Virginia was overseen by John Luke Porter, who was principally responsible for the design.   &lt;br /&gt;Northern papers were filled with speculation about the Merrimac, often relying on Southern papers for information.  On August 21, 1861 The Chicago Tribune reprinted an optimistic article from the Louisville Courier.  The Merrimac will be a floating fortress that will be able to defeat the whole navy of the United States, and bombard its cities.  Her great size, strength, powerful engines and speed, combined with the invulnerability secured by the iron casing, will make the;destruction of the blockade fleet an easy task for her.'  The article is evidence of pro-Confederacy sympathies in Kentucky, which was a border slave state that did not secede, yet was historically tied to the South.  The CSS Virginia was built in part to break the Union blockade.  Lacking a true navy, the Confederacy relied on privateers to run the blockade and capture Union shipping.  &lt;br /&gt;According to an article in the Charleston Courier, vandals attempted to destroy with twenty kegs of powder;the hull of the forty-gun steam frigate Merrimac.'  Being partially made of iron, most of the ship survived.  The correspondent estimated the ship could have been completed within six months.  In December, however, the New York Times reported that the project was conceded by the authorities;to be a complete failure,' and work had therefore stopped.  In the dismissive article, the journalist wrote, So much for Southern mechanics.'  The CSS Virginia would sail and destroy two Union ships in March 1861 before dueling the USS Monitor to a draw.  Two months later, the CSS Virginia was destroyed by Confederate troops to keep it from falling into Union hands.

Nearly fifteen hundred Union troops, mostly African-Americans, fought side by side against the two or three thousand Confederates stationed there. However, there still was not racially equal treatment of the soldiers, as the white soldiers rode forward on horseback, before retreating to the relative safety of the rest of the Union infantry. &lt;br /&gt;This battle was also one of the few fought with extensive hand-to-hand combat, with soldiers attacking one another with bayonets and clubbed muskets. Soldiers described it as the most gruesome and one of the bloodiest battles they had ever witnessed: Upon both sides men were killed with the butts of muskets. White and black men were lying side by side, pierced by bayonets.' Naval artillery was used to assist the Union troops, but poor communication ability caused frequent mistakes, and friendly-fire casualties resulted. Despite the presence of naval forces, the Confederates pressed on, running upon the Union troops. After several hours of fighting, the difficulties in aiming the gunboats was resolved, and the success of the naval firepower in attacking the Confederates swiftly drove them away. Despite the Union victory here, they lost more than three and a half times as many soldiers as the Confederates did.&lt;br /&gt;The U.S. Assistant Secretary of War commended the bravery of the blacks at Milliken's Bend,' for they extreme capability, contradicting earlier views that black soldiers were inferior. It was not only their bravery, but also their skill and adroit preparation that impressed. One account of the battle reads, [The commanding officer] ordered [an African American soldier] to have the men load their guns at once. He instantly replied: We have done did dat now, massa.' Before the colonel was ready the men were in line, ready for action.' As word of their abilities traveled, many become more accepting. Southerners remained skeptical of the joint efforts of black and white soldiers fighting together. They continued to refuse to realize that African American regiments were becoming successful in attacking them.

The cadets at both schools had rivalries concerning who had more state patriotism' (Volo, p. 188).  At VMI and the Citadel, cadets learned the arts of tactics, operations, drill, and horse riding in addition to the traditional subjects.

The whole state of Virginia was immensely proud of VMI. &lt;br /&gt;               One of the proudest parents of a VMI cadet was Philip St. George Cocke from Belmead, Virginia.

Cocke saw many additions to the grounds of the school including additional barracks, society rooms for the cadets, and even a new mess hall.  With all of the funding and pride that Virginians poured into VMI, it paid off during the Civil War when the Confederacy raided the stashes of officers from VMI alumni.

During the recruiting process of his regiment, Shaw experienced a difficult time attempting to recruit blacks from other states to fight in his regiment due to the fact that only men from Massachusetts could receive state aid for their families if they fought in a Massachusetts regiment.  Consequently, this policy discouraged black men from other states from fighting under Shaw.  &lt;br /&gt;Along with the duty of fighting to end the Confederate stronghold on Charleston Harbor, an additional role of the Fifty-Fourth Regiment was to provide cover for the Fourth South Carolina Calvary once the cavalry was deployed at Lighthouse Inlet in Charleston.  It should be noted that although the Fifty-Fourth did fight under the Union Army, they were not always taken to kindly by even their Federal allies in other regiments.  For instance, Captain Thomas Pickney of the Fourth South Carolina Calvary admitted his disgust at fighting alongside blacks regardless of the fact that blacks were providing protection for Pickney and his comrades.  During battle, Shaw was killed leading his men on, and the Fifty-Fourth Regiment's attack ultimately proved unsuccessful due to the overpowering numbers of the Confederate Army.  Of the 600 men of the Fifty-Fourth Regiment, 272 were lost in casualties, while the Confederates lost 174.

A Houston saloonkeeper named Dick Dowling heroically led a significantly smaller force of around fifty Irish-born Confederates to repel a Union force of nearly 5,000 men and four gunboats stationed in a fort hardly suited for battle in its current state.  The battle stemmed from Federal interest to gain access to suitable land needed to supply northern textile mills with cotton, but more importantly as a following through of the Anaconda Plan' issued by Lincoln in April 1861 to stifle the rebellious South's commercial trade and supply routes to their troops through a massive blockade.

Questions of how congress would react to the Presidents notion that Spain was not involved in the attack on USS Maine became important in the pre-phases of war. The Senate, which was the mainly Democratic and thus adverse to the McKinley administration, disagreed with the President and preferred to go to war with Spain. &lt;br /&gt;McKinley first wanted to intervene in Cuba with the intention of simply putting an end to the already-ongoing war there. When the Spanish government caught wind of this, they saw it as a threat to Spanish sovereignty and prepared a special budget for war expenses.  On April 20, 1898, President McKinley signed a Joint Resolution for war with Spain, offering an ultimatum to leave Cuba. Though the United States' intentions solely involved pacification of Cuba, by the next day, all diplomatic relations were suspended between the United States.

In some cases, US explorers tried to live alongside Native-Americans who called the West their home, but hostility from both peoples often caused conflict.  Americans embraced the mindset that not only was it acceptable, but it was even their duty to organize and civilize the Indian tribes, whom they viewed as not, in fact, an independent people, nor ought they to be so considered' (Calhoun).  On January 15, 1820, Secretary of War J. C. Calhoun wrote to Speaker of the House Clay of the progress' that had been made thus far in this endeavor.  &lt;br /&gt;The widely held view of the Indians as savages' was distorted by embellished tales about their violent acts, such as an account of murders in The Clarion and Tennessee Gazette.  In this specific article, the editor actually points out the exaggerated, incorrect information previously reported regarding members of the Seminole tribe who killed and injured some Tennessee men.  The updated account corrects the previously barbarous portrayal of the Indians, but nevertheless these facts, describing how a jailor shot the Indian through the body;loaded his pistol a second time and shot him through the head,' coincide with the harsh attitude of Americans toward the Indian tribes.    &lt;br /&gt;In theory, the migration of Native-Americans west of the Mississippi River was voluntary, but leaders of tribes were usually pressured or forced into signing treaties with the United States government.  Popular thought was that it was, in Calhoun's words, impossible, with their [Native-Americans'] customs, that they should exist as independent communities in the midst of civilized society;and our opinion, not theirs, ought to prevail;in measures intended for their civilization and happiness.'  Congress made appropriations of ten thousand dollars annually to aid in advancing Indian societies in the US.  An additional emphasis of the efforts to conform the Native-Americans was establishing schools, and Calhoun mentioned the Cherokee as a relatively civilized people because they had already launched two successful schools.  Congress' message was that the Indian tribes must be brought gradually under our authority and laws, or they will insensibly waste away in vice and misery (Calhoun);' due to Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal policy of the 1830s, virtually all were controlled by the Americans, and eventually more than 100,000 Native-Americans migrated to the West."],"display_date":"January 15, 1820","search_date":"1820-01-15","locations":[{"id":1272,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1234,"title":"Italo-American Incident\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-03-14","end_date":"1891-03-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A mob comprised of 20,000 residents of New Orleans, angered at the failure of a jury to convict the alleged murderers of David C.

This declaration was an extension from the original one on April 19th for seven of the Confederate States.  The intention for this decision was to cut off the international trade lines for the Confederacy and make it difficult to transport weapons and troops.  The rigid blockade was established on the Southern coast to affect the seceded states.  The fort at the mouth of Cape Fear river commands the principal part of her trade, as that river is the only one of importance in the State.

(Donald, 401)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;          By extending the blockade to North Carolina, the Union not only controlled much of the eastern seaboard, but cut off many Confederate trade routes via their important ports and river mouths.  Important imports from Europe were strained due to the blockades, which made it even more difficult for the South to compete with the industrial North.

After being informed that the Supreme Court of Arkansas had no jurisdiction in settling the decision and that it was up to the General Assembly to decide; Brooks was left waiting.  Meanwhile, Baxter was gaining unpopularity among his own supporters by fulfilling some of his platform pledges which included opposing a bill that would release railroad companies from financial obligations to the state by placing the burdens on the impoverished citizens.  Many of Baxter's supporters switched to Brooks' cause.  An article in Charleston's News and Courier on January 20, 1874 called this political turmoil a disgrace.'  The article states that There is no doubt that Brooks was chosen Governor' by a majority but when he refused to go along with  the political schemes of his supporters they declared Baxter the winner instead, leaving him to pursue redress through legal means.  The article stated that the citizens of Arkansas were disappointed' in the outcome of the election but they were used to being cheated, as the most scandalous election frauds have been the rule rather than the exception in that state for some years past.'&lt;br /&gt;After Brooks had the support of some of the radical Republicans he felt secure enough to take his case to a Pulaski Circuit Court, where on April 15, 1874 he was granted the office of governor by Judge John Whytock.  Brooks was sworn in in secret by the chief justice and went immediately to the governor's office with an armed guard seizing possession of it.  Baxter soon gathered his own militia and established a headquarters just blocks from the executive office.  Citizens came from all over Arkansas to support and join the militia of each side leaving the city on the brink of civil war.  One scuffle between the two militias occurred on April 20 when Governor Baxter was addressing some reinforcements outside of his headquarters.  Some of Brooks' troops lead by Colonel Rose demanded the intention of Baxter's militia and shots were fired and a few casualties incurred.  Another scuffle occurred when a steamboat, Hallie,' importing militia reinforcements for Baxter was placed under fire by Brooks' men resulting in several injuries and a few deaths.  Brooks sent an ultimatum to the President on May 12 demanding that he recognize either Brooks or Baxter as the rightful governor.  Republican President Grant was hesitant to help because of the decline in Northern support for Reconstruction efforts.  He did not want to be associated with the corruptions happening in Southern politics.   Though up to this point the president had managed to stay out of the scuffle, on May 15 President Grant recognized Baxter as governor ending the Brooks-Baxter war and signaling the demise of the Reconstruction in Arkansas."],"display_date":"May 15, 1874","search_date":"1874-05-15","locations":[{"id":750,"lat":34.8116378829,"lng":-92.2224128621,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1396,"title":"Kentucky announces its neutrality in the North/South conflict\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-05-16","end_date":"1861-05-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After the attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, Kentucky wanted to pursue a neutrality policy between the North and the South.

It had resulted in a tremendous amount of trade through the mid-West, and had also spurred new industries such as wagon construction in Missouri.

He declared the beauty and high value of the gold and quartz specimen qualities. Rice's arrival in the Gold Belt reflected the rapidly growing interest in the mining of minerals in Georgia. Many had declared Georgia mineral rich, and resulted in much interest from many areas. Since the Civil War, the investment of 10 million had already provided for the cost of 400,000 for flumes, and the development in new hydraulic mining techniques. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gold Belt spanned the distance of 300 miles from the boarder of Alabama to the Carolinas. People had known about the presence of gold, silver, copper, and other valuable minerals since 1829 when John Witheroods had discovered gold in Georgia, which resulted in thousands of intruders on Cherokee land. The Gold Rush in Georgia resulted in the establishment of a mint at Dablonega, but the Civil War brought its destruction. The Gold Rush had gradually died out because primitive mining methods failed to reach the inexhaustible mineral supplies other than those easily accessible. Slaves had done most the mining by hand, but with the end of slavery and the need for investment, new mining technology developed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eagerness to develop mining in Georgia resulted from the poor state of the post-Civil War economy. Although many still placed hope in the revival of cotton farming, the cotton fields lacked much opportunity. Georgia, hit with economic depression in 1867 and a bad cotton crop, had no means to pay war indemnity, taxes and the high level of personal and public debt, or to reinstate itself into the market economy. People hoped the mining of minerals would bring economic revival, as mines would provide jobs and investment, pulling Georgia, especially the poor people of the mountains, out of their backward, impoverished state. The revival in mining did succeed in bringing millions of dollars of investment. Atlanta, especially prospered from it. As the natural outlet for the mining region, Atlanta established the new mint, and saw the development of 3000 houses, and a population growth of 30,000.  However, despite the romantic hopes of everyday men simply waking up to find 50,000 worth of gold, the gold mining in Georgia failed to help the poor, but helped the rich get richer."],"display_date":"March 13, 1867 - April 16, 1867","search_date":"1867-03-30","locations":[{"id":1526,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1487,"title":"Union Attempts to Gain Control of Fort Sumter\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-08-17","end_date":"1863-08-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Occupied by Confederates, Fort Sumter at Charleston Harbor in South Carolina prevented the Union from blockading the Atlantic Coast during their campaign to gain control of Charleston.

This sense of urgency by Lincoln reflected the clash that existed between the President and McClellan; while Lincoln faced much political pressure to move the army to attack the Confederacy, McClellan did not want to budge.

Rather than simply executing the rebels, the humane and important course of action taken by the Federal government may have resulted in exchange the return of important incarcerated prisoners on the Union's side.

The reasoning behind this was due to the great advantage the North had in the men they were receiving back in exchange for such unintelligent, Rebel soldiers.  The Union's logic was that they could receive back important strategic leaders for those rather useless privateersmen, essentially a complete gain in their books.  An example of this rested in the later exchange of Confederate privateersmen caught in New York for a group of Union Colonels currently incarcerated in South Carolina.  In exchange for such useless Rebels, the Union was able to free the likes of Colonel Corcoran, Lee, Cogswell and many other important officers who would later be used to a much greater extent than any Confederate privateersmen could even fathom.  By declaring this act, the Union was able to fool the Confederacy into a false feeling of respect, discipline and diplomacy, in addition to demonstrating the higher level of wit possessed by the North early in the war.

While already continually demonstrating their valor and courage in every unbalanced battle they entered, the South was now too going to be fueled by a sense of revenge for such deceitful acts made by the North.  Not only had they been fooled in the earlier agreement to treat privateersmen as legal prisoners of war, but now they were being ignored and terms of prisoner release were being breached.  While the North might have seen these acts as sly and cunning, they were only fueling the fire to which the Confederacy had been living off of since the beginning of the War and contradictorily fueling growth in their opposition's forces."],"display_date":"March 18, 1862","search_date":"1862-03-18","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1545,"title":"The Battle of Shiloh\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-06","end_date":"1862-04-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 6th and 7th, the Battle of Shiloh took place taking the lives of more men than in all previous American wars combined.

By the end of fighting in the area after the initial attack, there were so many dead Confederates in the field that General Grant said it was possible to step on the dead bodies without a foot touching the ground and cross the field safely.'  During the night, reinforcements arrived on the Union side with some battalions gaining upwards of 20,000 fresh men, yet the Confederate troops had no relief in sight especially worsened by the torrential rains and continual shooting from the Union gunboats.  By morning, the Union commanded the field and when the Confederate soldiers retreated, the exhausted Union troops did not follow.  &lt;br /&gt;An unforgiving struggle, the battle ended with 13,000 out of 63,000 Union soldiers killed and wounded in addition to the 11,000 out of 40,000 Confederate soldiers who also perished.

Beginning with the Battle of Contreras on August 19 and the Battle of Churubusco on August 20, the Americans suffered losses of less than a hundred men while the Mexicans had a five to one casualty count.  In these two decisive battles, the Americans captured several generals, took nearly eight hundred prisoners and a large quantity of ammunition and artillery, shattering the Mexican Army of the North.  These defeats laid an open road to Mexico City for Scott, who was within three miles of the city.

Nicholas Trist, an able, firm, and truly patriotic man' was the chief representative of the American government during the peace negotiations, and was later known for his work on the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, to formally conclude a pact of peace with the defeated Mexico.  Alcorta, the Minister of War of the United States of Mexico wrote that with a view to avoid the further shedding of blood between the two great republic of this continent; the President ; accepts the proposition to enter into armistice.'  After some further communications, the Union printed the authentic copy of the draft that Mr. Trist had (with full authority from President Polk) negotiated.

Essentially, General Orders No. 69 held that every exempt and detailed agriculturists' (i.e. plantation farmers, mainly) was to provide 100 pounds of bacon, or at the options of the Government, its equivalent in pork, and 100 pounds nett. Beef for each able bodied slave on the plantation between the ages of 16 and 50 years.'  The order also directed that these agriculturists sell at fair price any marketable surplus of grain and other provisions on hand' to the government or directly to soldiers' families.&lt;br /&gt;Written in conjunction with this General Orders, this circular explicitly indicates that several southern planters paid but little respect to the obligations they had contracted,' namely provision of resources in exchange for exemption from service.  This unwillingness towards, as the order says, diligently employing in good faith his skill, capital and labor, exclusively in the production of grain and other provisions' indicates a potentially deep rift forming between wealthy slaveholding land-owners and the poor white farmers that were fighting in the trenches.  This suggestion seems substantiated by the circular's indication that these exempt agriculturist sought profit by becoming speculators in food and provisions' while others openly affirm that they do not mean to have any surplus' that year.&lt;br /&gt;Looking back at the conditions that Confederate soldiers faced during the war, it is often contended that a lack of arms, munitions, food, or other resources never contributed directly to a major defeat.  In fact, many prominent schools of thought argue that the Confederates did not quit fighting until they had been absolutely destroyed physically, economically, and morally.  The hatred many southerners had more to feel towards the Yankees and the profound embarrassment that they anticipated if they should lose were often enough to keep southerners on task no matter how dire circumstances may have seemed.

Rosser, this release of general orders is meant to warn against and dissuade poor behavior within the Confederate forces.  Quoting the first line of the orders, the want of discipline has been the cause of additional disaster to this army.'  Responding to such indiscretions as breaking rank during battle for the purpose of plundering or desertion of command by an officer, the order mandates that no officer or enlisted man will be allowed to sleep out of camp without a certificate from the Surgeon of his Regiment.'  Furthermore, along with a mandatory three roll calls per day, all areas surrounding camp were to be scoured in such of absentees, who would then be arrested and punished.  For example, one of the main punishments for a cavalry member or officer was a demotion to the dangerous front lines with the infantry.&lt;br /&gt;It must be remembered that this order was written during a period of extremely high stress for the Confederacy and its leaders.  In the wake of Union victories in Atlanta and the rest of Georgia and throughout Tennessee, the South was beginning to experience crushing defeats on its own soil with greater and greater frequency. This additional disaster' of which Brigadier General Rosser writes is additional' to that which Union Generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant were inflicting across Georgia and northern Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the widespread Confederate desertions were devastating the South's chances on the battlefield against a bigger, stronger Union force.  By 1865, 104,000, or ten percent of the entire Confederate army had deserted.  These desertions were due mainly to the increasingly poor conditions that met the young, non-slaveholding backwoodsmen' that were conscripted into the army.  Many of these men had little desire to fight such a war, and they were often pulled away from the battle lines towards their families, who also desperately needed them.

While the matriculation, tuition, and rent fees remained at pre-Civil War levels, one should not be surprised to find that board has regularly advanced in price with the cost of supplies.'  Attempting to stifle this upward trend in cost, Mr. Maupin discusses other possible accommodations, such as paying 15 per month if paid in specie or in supplies necessary for a boarding house.'  Mr. Maupin also discusses an act of the Virginia legislature , one that Confederate Secretary of War and University graduate James A. Seddon had strongly advocated , that allowed disabled Virginia soldiers free tuition, matriculation, and rent if they proved themselves unable to pay their charges.  Similarly-situated Confederate veterans from other states could have their tuition fees waived upon approval by the University.&lt;br /&gt;Two of those students who benefited from the University's generosity were George L. Christian and his roommate, W.C. Holmes.  Christian, who had lost a foot, and Holmes, whose right arm was rendered useless, formed a sort of friendship of utility, as Christian assisted Holmes in his note-taking and Holmes helped Christian to walk around grounds.  At night, in the absence of furniture, the two men made beds of their old Confederate army blankets.  Despite such hardships, the men counted themselves among the most fortunate of southerners, for they were not awakened by the water running in under [them], which [they] had so often experienced in the army.'&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, the University, along with the rest of the country, suffered greatly during these unhappy times.'  Though it never closed down, the University saw a severe decline in enrollment at the onset of war.  Whereas 645 students once filled the lecture halls during the 1856-57 session, the largest attendance that the University saw during the war came in 1861-62, when just 66 men were present.  The matriculates who had not yet joined the army rarely passed, young as they were, more than twelve months at the University , the next year found them private soldiers in the ranks, and exposed to all the dangers of the field.'

Brownlow's Knoxville Whig.  This particular article is a call to arms, so to speak, against Rebel sympathizers who have been for months, heading guerilla bands, robbing Union families, and burning down Union houses and barns and killing Union men indiscriminately.'  These anti-Confederates throughout Tennessee call for the appropriation of all estates belonging to Rebel sympathizers as well as the restriction of trade to Union loyalists alone.  Alarmingly, this article suggests that many among the Rebel sympathizers and co-conspirators are those who have already taken the amnesty oath, so as to throw the Union authorities off their guard, while they operate against us.'&lt;br /&gt;By this point in the Civil War, anti-Confederate feelings ran widely throughout the South, and especially in Appalachian Tennessee, where poor white farmers and non-slaveholders were called upon to fight the North.  In fact, as early as 1861, when Tennessee Governor Isham B. Harris was attempting to prepare his state for war, Unionism had already become a severe problem in eastern Tennessee.  This part of the state, much of which was anti-slavery, saw itself as fully separate from the rich, slaveholding population of western Tennessee.  Similar to the anti-Confederate Mississippians in Jones County, Mississippi, a conference was held in Greenville, Tennessee, which was attended by all of the eastern Tennessee counties except one, Rhea County.  From this conference, these counties grew a petition, which they presented to Governor Harris, requesting their secession from the rest of the state in hopes of becoming a new entity, fully loyal to the Union.  While this petition was ignored by the Tennessee legislature and armed guards were sent in to prevent secession, the anti-Confederate sentiment remained, and as seen in the Knoxville Whig, these pro-Unionist southerners were often met with violence.  And often, this violence, as the Whig also suggests, was inflicted by some wealthy men' who have sons in the rebel army.'  Incidents of violence, however, were not limited to Confederates assaulting Unionists. Rather, Steven V. Ash discusses the many Roane County, Tennesseans that had actually fought with the Union army who, upon their returns home, were determined to exact a price for the persecution they and their families had endured at home under the secessionist regime.&lt;br /&gt;Anti-Confederate sentiment is often discussed as though it were a widespread symptom of a South that was disunited and uncommitted to the causes for which they were fighting.  This, however, is not at all the case, as seen in the countless thousands of men and women who generously volunteered their time, possessions, and lives to the Confederate States of America, more often than not at the cost of their lives and livelihoods.  Eastern Tennessee was indeed widely anti-Confederate, but outside of this and a few other pockets in the South, such sentiments were isolated and rarely voiced as similar-minded southerners were very few and far between."],"display_date":"August 10, 1864","search_date":"1864-08-10","locations":[{"id":12156,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1820,"title":"Confederate Victory in Stony Creek Depot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-07-05","end_date":"1864-07-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Under the leadership of Confederate General Wade Hampton, who weeks earlier had driven General George Sheridan's Union forces from the James River, Confederate troops encountered a considerably-sized, well-reinforced Yankee brigade near Sappony Church.

Blacks were consistently denied chances at promotion and were instead put to work as laborers digging trenches and latrine holes in camp.  Even throughout 1864, towards the end of the war, equal payment of black and white soldiers was denied by the Union War Department.  So, while blacks fought to gain respect and a sense of belonging as free members of society, their efforts were often bitterly rebuked by their own comrades in the fight against the South."],"display_date":"July 5, 1864 - July 6, 1864","search_date":"1864-07-05","locations":[{"id":14311,"lat":37.2374404133,"lng":-77.0005454293,"zoom":10,"place":"SURRY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1821,"title":"Deserter Shot at Fort McHenry\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-09-21","end_date":"1864-09-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Having been tried and convicted by a court marshal, Sergeant George W.

In 1884 Halsey was concerned that, as time passed, a disconnect would develop between Central Virginians and their ability to appreciate the reasons why the war veterans from their area risked their lives to defend the South in the Civil War.  In a letter written from Edmund Halsey to his brother Joseph Halsey of Orange County, Virginia on May 4, 1884, he recapitulated the two brothers' experiences in the Battle of the Wilderness, which took place in Spotsylvania County, Virginia.  Edmund Halsey reflected, It seems strange to think that so many years have passed since then, but when we think of the many who were living there - in the field and at home - and now few are left and those few so scattered and changed it seems like recalling scenes in the Revolution.  Central Virginians who discussed historical events during the latter portion of the nineteenth century had several motives for their attention to the past.  According to Edward Ayers in Southern Crossing, one of these motives included a desire to prevent older Virginians from forgetting and younger Virginians from never learning about the history of their predecessors.  ","A desire to offset negative perceptions of the area also motivated Central Virginia's to focus on the past.  Like Halsey, Central Virginians were interested in reconstructing the history of their particular families and communities so that future generations would appreciate the events and respect the people of the past.  On April 19, 1887, Reverend Horace E. Hayden wrote to Alfred L. Holladay of Prospect Hill, Virginia requesting information about the genealogy and military involvement of the Holladay family.  Hayden was preparing a volume entitled Virginia Genealogies.  Hayden commented on Holladay's contribution to his book as he proclaimed that Holladay's sketch of the Virginia matron, a quiet farmer's wife, would offset the slander of those who argued that Virginians were self confident but ignorant planters, necessarily only once removed from semi-civilization.  Hayden attempted to counter what he considered to be northerners' erroneous portrayals of white southerners by retelling the history of several prominent families from Central Virginia.  In 1888, the Fredericksburg paper, <em>Free Lance</em>, printed an article that countered the negative connotations of the area, such as being behind the times, by emphasizing the positive aspects of the city, such as its hospitable inhabitants and historical importance in the Civil War.","During the latter portion of the nineteenth century, interest in the dissemination of the history of the South was not limited to individuals, such as Halsey, or Virginia, but was, instead, a focus of people throughout the South.  Ayers discusses the fear of Civil War veterans in both Virginia and throughout the South that their descendants would either fail to understand or remember their elders' participation in the Civil War.  In <em>Virginia Reconsidered</em>, Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hofstra discuss southerners' effort to recast the history of the South in a positive light.  For instance, educators in the South portrayed slavery as an institution that benefited all those who were involved.  Particularly in the years following the Civil War, people from the South argued that enslaved blacks had led better lives than their free counterparts in the North.  Supporters of the South and its cause defended their honor through the recasting of history in the years following the Civil War."],"display_date":"May 4, 1884 - April 19, 1888","search_date":"1886-04-27","locations":[{"id":14131,"lat":38.246275988,"lng":-78.01344008,"zoom":10,"place":"ORANGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2025,"title":"Union Sentiment in Arkansas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-10-29","end_date":"1863-10-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By the fall of 1863, the Union army began a series of successful campaigns along the Mississippi Valley.

Furthermore, it was important that the people of Arkansas were not actively against [them]. Despite the number of guerillas still in Arkansas, Andrews declared his confidence that a great number of people supported the Union cause. Andrews then went on to describe specific news about his soldiers and other common news around Little Rock."," The main message Andrews wanted to send to President Lincoln was clear: there was a considerable amount of Union sentiment in Little Rock.

This was important considering Arkansas was a Confederate state and its location just south of Missouri made it a border state. Because of the state's geographical location, Arkansas faced great pressure from both sides of the conflict. Colonel Andrews openly acknowledged the split in sentiment among the people of Arkansas. Despite the continued presence of guerillas in Arkansas, Andrews exclaimed, the loyal sentiment of the people [was] gaining. This split in loyalties was not exclusive to Arkansas. In fact, historian Robert Henry claims that the North, the border states, and even the states that had first seceded were all unhappily torn between loyalties. "," Even though the Union controlled Little Rock and Andrews referred to many respectable and rather influential men supporting the Union, he detected reluctance among many men to take an active role in serving the Union. Andrews thought these men looked for an excuse from taking an active part on the Union side because they feared being reproached by the rebels. According to Henry, it was common for two sides within a state to openly oppose each other. There were even instances in which brothers within the same family, divided over the issue to remain in the Union or to secede, literally fought on opposite sides of the battlefield. However much the issue of slavery played in the division of the nation into Union and Confederate states, the sentiment for secession was by no means unified within each state. Colonel Andrews acknowledged the importance of Union sentiment in Arkansas and expressed his optimism that future military success would give Union supporters the confidence they needed to take an active hand in reestablishing the Union."],"display_date":"October 29, 1863","search_date":"1863-10-29","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2029,"title":"The Western Sanitary Commission Requests Approval to Support Freed Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-11-06","end_date":"1863-11-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Since the beginning of the Civil War, the Western Sanitary Commission served armies west of the Mississippi by providing service and supplies to wounded soldiers. On November 6, 1863, the commission looked to broaden its mission. Five representatives from the organization wrote to President Lincoln expressing concern that the state of freed slaves in the Mississippi Valley was daily becoming worse. Under the conditions that these blacks lived, sickness and death [prevailed] to a fearful extent. The members of the Western Sanitary Commission, pointing to their contributions to the sick and wounded soldiers, asked for permission and authority to extend [their] labors to the freed slaves. With the President's endorsement, they believed they could raise large sums of money and accomplish great good. They further argued that by lessening the difficulties of emancipation, material aid would help crush the rebellion."," In its letter to President Lincoln, the Western Sanitary Commission argued that the living condition of the freed slaves was so bad that hundreds of the blacks would gladly return to slavery, to avoid the hardships of freedom. The brush tent shelter of the freed slaves in the Mississippi Valley only provided protection from night dews. The government supplied freed slaves with rations, but distribution was often delayed. Furthermore, freed slaves had no facilities of cooking, and [were] almost ignorant of the use of wheat flour. The Western Sanitary Commission included these details in their letter to President Lincoln to illustrate the great difficulty former slaves experienced while adjusting to life outside of slavery. Historian Eric Foner claims that by 1860, most freed slaves worked as poor urban or rural laborers and enjoyed few rights other than not being considered a form of property. Oftentimes in Missouri, as well as elsewhere in the South, freed slaves worked for wages well below the average wage of a field hand. This forced freed slaves to live under the lowest of living conditions."," The authors of the letter to Lincoln suggested that providing aid to the freed slaves would [lessen] the difficulties of emancipation and thus help crush the Confederate rebellion. By providing aid for former slaves, the Western Sanitary Commission hoped to improve the living conditions of freed slaves. The organization argued it would not only be a work of philanthropy, but equally of patriotism, for it would remove an increasing reproach against the Union cause. Although historians Clayton E. Jewett and John O. Allen claim there was a heavy influence of northern abolitionists in Missouri, abolitionism was not overwhelmingly popular in the North. By giving aid to freed slaves to begin life outside of slavery however, the Western Sanitary Commission hoped to prove to the Union that emancipation was both possible and the right thing to do."],"display_date":"November 6, 1863","search_date":"1863-11-06","locations":[{"id":7918,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2032,"title":"A Soldier&#39;s View of the Role of Women in the Civil War Effort\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-13","end_date":"1865-02-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Charles James lived in Missouri but fought for the Confederate army in Virginia during the Civil War. In a letter to his sister on February 13, 1865, he discussed the problem the Confederate Army had with absentees and deserters at the beginning of 1865. In an attempt to coax these soldiers back into the army, James stated that General Lee [issued] a general order granting amnesty to all who will within twenty days from the publication of said order report to their commands... The Confederacy had offered amnesty to deserters before, but James stressed this was their last opportunity to avoid the punishment which they deserve. Even though James stated these soldiers left when the army and the people were depressed in spirits, he also blamed women and the allurements of home, as reasons why soldiers left their post. While James placed part of the blame on women, he also added women of the confederacy [had] the power, if they [had] the will and determination, to save the country. It was the women's role to lead the Confederate soldiers away from the pleasantries of grand balls and home life. If they [did] this, James argued, 1865 [would] be the last year of the war."," Charles James kept his sister informed of the state of the Confederate army while he was in Virginia. These letters were the only way that his sister could follow the fighting. According to historian Edwin C. McReynolds, the fighting had ended in Missouri in November 1864. In his February 13, 1865 letter, James clearly stated the role Virginia women should have played during the Civil War. It was their duty, he argued, to put pressure on Confederate soldiers to resist the temptation to remain in their home. Historian George Rable claims, Women had to shame these cowards into doing their duty. James's sister would have been surprised to hear the extent Confederate women contributed to the war. Women in Missouri played a much larger role in fighting for the Confederacy than in Virginia. In his essay Women and Guerrilla Warfare, historian Michael Fellmen argues that Missouri saw the most intense guerilla fighting of the war. Women played an active part in this warfare, both as participants and as victims. They made both verbal and physical attacks against Union soldiers. "," Charles James said women had the opportunity to prove themselves equal during the Civil War. While James implied that this would happen if women focused on preventing deserters, women expanded their role in other areas as well. Historians Eric Foner and Olivia Mahoney claim that while the men were off fighting the war, women played a larger role in managing the plantation, slaves, and participated in other professions previously limited to men. Because there were great casualties for both sides during the war, these women were often forced to continue these new roles at the conclusion of the war. Historian Anne Firor Scott argues that the experience women gained during the Civil War opened doors for women who put their newly acquired skills to good use. James predicted 1865 [would] be the last year of the war.

John Barker turned and sprinted towards his house, but the Indians were too quick. They overtook him, stabbing and killing him instantly. Caleb Lyndon Brayton, frontier neighbor to Barker, stood there stunned. He had just conversed with the Indian party on the road to Captain Gattis' house, seeing nothing unusual in their appearance. How could this have happened? The adrenaline flew through his veins: no time to think, get to the boats Brayton, Captain Gattis, and Colonel Russell flew down the hill towards the shore and pushed off just as the Indians, having doubled to eight, loaded their rifles. The first volley ripped through the shirt of a Negro man in the boat, but by the time they reloaded, the frontiersmen were out of range.","Brayton now had time to absorb what he just witnessed and plan a course of action. The men needed weapons, but, upon returning from obtaining Brayton's Colt 8 shooters, the Indians were no where to be found. The land lay in ruins. Houses were plundered and set ablaze and cattle floated lifelessly in the river. Colonel Russell's family was gone. The following day Brayton came upon the most distressing scene of his life: Here were a parcel of helpless women and children, bare footed and bare headed, and almost naked. The children crying and screaming for water and food, having been two days without anything to eat... They had found Russell's family downriver, but the horror of the past two days could not be escaped.","This was the scene Brayton described to his wife, Marian, who remained in Augusta, Georgia with their family while he settled the frontier of Florida. The Indians he refers to are Seminoles, and the attack and murder of John Barker was part of a larger reemergence of hostilities known as the Crisis of 1849. The Second Seminole War had been over for seven years, but a group of young Seminoles conducted raids up and down both Florida coasts in the summer of 1849. United States Troops mobilized and threatened attack but Chief Billy Bowlegs, who has been described as a great peacemaker, averted conflict by claiming the raiders were outsiders and defiant warriors. He delivered three prisoners and the severed hand of a fourth.","Scattered episodes of violence were not uncommon across the South wherever whites intruded into historic Indian territory, but the Crisis of 1849 was temporally concentrated and particularly horrific. Intricate racial interactions in Florida were augmented by the influx of settlers after 1842 and the peace that followed the Second Seminole War. Specifically, the Armed Occupation Act allowed prospective settlers to claim land and feel safer doing it; Caleb Brayton himself had claimed 160 acres in 1843 under this act. After 1849, however, many settlers did not return to this area and others. Billy Bowlegs had prevented a third Seminole war, but lasting damage had been done to the relationship between frontier settlers and the indigenous Seminoles.

He was someone to talk to, and he cooked a yellow perch dish that really would have done honor to your cuisine at home. McCall and John were deep in the Florida wilderness, surrounding a fire in Wahoo Swamp, and the Major General in the United States Army struck up a conversation with the young man. A dog was lying peacefully by John's side, and McCall asked him how he came to have his dog, a great Indian cur, and what its name was. He replied that the dog's name was fuse because the girl he was courtin' for a wife, and all de gal fuse me (refused me). Dis so provoking to me, I git mad. After their conversation, McCall described Gopher John as my friend in his journal spanning thirty years of service on various American frontiers.","Gopher John was McCall's interpreter because he had a special skill set of a Black Seminole, a population that is much forgotten in southern history. In describing the young man, the adjectives employed touch on his biracial connections. John had grown up from a long-legged, ill-looking Negro boy to be a fine looking fellow of six feet, as straight as an Indian, with just a smile of red blood mantling to his forehead. In addition to his physical features, John retains his cognomen with the Indians as well as with the whites who lived in the Indian country before the war. Other Indian Negroes were feared by the U.S. Army for their ability to recruit slaves from local plantations, but John was able to straddle the racial fence between whites and Seminoles and occupy a social purgatory. Major McCall had a vested interest in seeing that Gopher John did not side with the Seminoles.","The history of blacks in Florida, and how they came to be associated and intertwined with the Seminole nation, is a complex one. Under Spanish rule until 1763, Florida had become a refuge for runaway slaves, even granting them freedom for military service. Some Black Seminoles were descendants of those who fought for the Spaniards at the Battle of Fort Mose in 1738. They began to settle among the Indians who were friendly to the Spanish and remained there after Spain ceded Florida to Britain. Seminole Chiefs even bought slaves, and runaway blacks from plantations in Carolina and Georgia continued to merge with the independent communities of free blacks on the outskirts of Seminole settlements. Naturally, interracial interaction occurred-sexually, culturally, and economically. Blacks supplied agricultural produce in return for protection; they were the vassals and allies of the Seminoles.","The unique role of interpreter for both whites and Seminoles was filled by men like Gopher John. He had relationships with the two communities, but of equal importance was his relationship to Major General McCall. As evidenced in Israel on the Appomattox by Melvin Ely, absolute racial blocs were not present in the antebellum South; for instance, black batteaumen had intimate social connections with whites in the context of economics. The racial distinctions blurred between McCall and Gopher John, and although their relationship was intended to be formal and official, it became something more natural. Hybrid cultures developed on Israel Hill, in Florida between blacks and Seminoles, and elsewhere across the South as traits were shared between different races as they came in daily contact with each other."],"display_date":"April 18, 1842","search_date":"1842-04-18","locations":[{"id":1362,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"HILLSBOROUGH, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2055,"title":"In Cahoots With the Foxes\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-10-01","end_date":"1878-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Fox-hunting was the most popular sport on the Eastern Shore, especially in the bountiful counties of Talbot, Somerset, and Queen Anne. To preserve and encourage this particularly Southern sport, Hanson Hiss and other Maryland gentlemen founded the Elkridge Fox-Hunting Club in October of 1878. George S. Brown assumed the Presidency, but only on the condition that no bag-fox be used in any hunt. The Elkridge Club trained only the finest hounds, and all the Marylanders knew that Chesapeake Bay Retrievers were the fastest and sharpest of them all. The club bought its dogs and kept its kennel near Baltimore, but they hunted on the Eastern Shore.","Captain Greenbury Holt always joined the Elkridge Club in the chase. Hiss would remember in 1897 that Holt, despite his four score years, is still as enthusiastic a hunter as he was 50 years ago. The men helped Holt into the saddle, but everyone knew the Captain would need little else. With a cry the horses sprung into action, the dogs barking eagerly at the scent, and the men shouting, Hi, there ... At him ... To the scent Hi Hi Hi The fox disappeared over the crest of the hill, and the troop thundered after it. The Captain's horse was a solemn and dignified thoroughbred, who amble[d] at a coon pace. He fell behind the other riders as they entered the trees, but with his vast experience, Holt knew shortcuts and by-paths that brought him closer to his quarry. Just as someone pinned the fox, the Captain burst onto the scene: he [was] usually seen at the death, if there [was] anyone out there to see him.

[where] they [were] going to run.","Hiss believed that the people of the South have always looked upon every manner of outdoor sport with admiration and encouragement. Marylanders considered the gentlemanly and sophisticated sport of fox-hunting something uniquely appreciated in the South, which is why they founded the Elkridge Club. Hiss wrote several articles about fox-hunting in the Outdoors journal. He noted that fox-hunting is hell without a Southern hound like the Chesapeake Bay dog. He praised the exploits of Captain Holt, a former Confederate officer. He reflected that there have always been in the North ... a class who deprecated fox-hunting...

Marylanders linked this romantic image of jousting with their image of the Old South, and through jousting, they renewed their southern identity. Many Maryland knights chose names like the Knight of the Lost Cause, the Knight of the Sunny South, and the Knight in Grey to show their sympathy for the plight of the southern states.

He had always desired to see the city. The city was the object of greatest curiosity, fascinating the Bishop with its rich history. He stood in awe before a portrait of George Washington. The Declaration of Independence proved to be a most impressive scene, the picture fills every American heart with American feelings and memory carries him back to the time when in solemn conclave this noble band proclaimed to the world 'Liberty or Death. One could look at the Declaration for a long time and see new beauty in it each moment. Bishop Whipple was swept away in the beauty of the capital. ","However, some sights in Washington caused the New York native to grow frustrated with the current political situation. The House of Representatives particularly disturbed him. The charm of honor is lost, and these men having high sounding titles are not only men in form, but less than men in mind in many cases. Never have I seen as large a body of men who were called great men who came as far short from deserving the title. Such a lack of dignity, such a lack of courtesy, of politeness, of common decency can seldom be seen in a body of men who are law makers. He continued to rant that the law makers were actually the law breakers. Bishop Whipple was so disgusted with the Congress that he described them as beasts. Despite the beauty of the Capital, he left discouraged. There are very few men of fine talent in the House and when you leave the House and see the noble, calm, and kind faces exhibited in Trumbull's picture of the first Congress you feel sad at the difference. Despite his shame with the House, he was proud of the Senate and spoke of the joy he felt upon seeing John Q. Adams. As opposed to the beasts of the House, he described the Senators as men with mind and character. He was happy and proud to see such men ruling over the country. ","Bishop is extreme in his hate for the House and love for the Senate. He was obviously very interested in the politics of the polarized and divided country. In the introduction to his diary, Whipple calls himself a rational abolitionist. In 1844, the Abolitionist's movement was very strong in the North. This made the divide between North and South even more pronounced.

R. Henry of Tazewell County, Virginia campaigned for a seat in Congress under the Democratic Party in 1886. People from neighboring communities such as Lynchburg, Abingdon and Wytheville voiced their full support of his campaign and hopes for his success in the quest for a seat in Congress in the November elections. Although varied in their syntax, the message behind Henry's supporters emphasized the same ideas and qualities that would make him an ideal candidate for Congress. His supporters all commented not only upon his strength, using words like commanding, but also upon his masculinity and physical appearance. He was characterized as being both tall and handsome and being a true type of physical and mental manhood. They also reflected upon class and status, typifying him as a gentleman of culture and character and a first class man in every respect. His supporters made continual reference to his service in the Confederate Army. With all of the praise that was given to Major R. R. Henry, one can only notice what was not being commented upon by his supporters, his strengths in the political arena. There is no mention of their support of his platform or any political ideas that he may have had, instead emphasizing his physical and moral character.","This article exemplifies the qualities that were found to be important in any political campaign during that time. Henry's character was found to be more important then the political decisions he has made in the past and any experience that he has in the political arena. Also, the continual reference to his service in the Confederate Army is reminiscent of the mounting processions many of the Democratic candidates used at that time. In these mounting processions, the candidate would ride in front of a long line of people mimicking Robert E. Lee to touch Confederate sentiments. Perhaps the lack of hard hitting platform issues may be due to the defeat of the Democratic Party in the assembly resulting in the party trying to avoid any friction that would result in future lost elections. ","It was also during this time that sectional diplomacy in the South became a prominent issue in politics. There was a divide in the South in forming either a Northeastern alliance or a Western alliance. This divide led to the formation of an Alliance Platform, which later became the platform adopted by the Populist Party. Many politicians of this time adopted this controversial platform, which emphasized subtreasury plans and other Southern ideals. It may be the case that for Major Henry, the lack of a political platform in the news article reflects the tension in platforms of the time. By leaving out any political ideation, and focusing on the physical and moral characteristics of the candidate, Henry might avoid the struggle within the political system relating the Alliance platform, and reach the constituents based on a more universally accepted stance - morality and character.

The business at hand on June 13th, 1891 for Ex-Confederate veterans of Berkley County, West Virginia was to find homes for ex-confederate veterans who were disabled and aged in need of special care. The need for care was not something unusual for those in the Confederate army. Throughout the civil war, the Confederate army found itself in need of medical care in the forms of hospital buildings and medical staff. It was often seen that many of the wounded soldiers lay sick on the floor, which lent itself to spreading diseases like typhoid, mumps, and pneumonia among the wounded soldiers quite quickly. And so from the very onset of the civil war, the Confederacy found itself lacking in the resources to take care of their wounded soldiers, and nearly 25 years later, those veterans were still struggling to find such resources. ","Also, it was not uncommon during the 1880s and 1890s for ex-Confederates brigades to reunite. It was not until 1889, that the reunions became more organized with the foundation of the United Confederate Veterans. This organization was led by General Gordon. The annual meetings held in New Orleans were host to many ragged confederates, who were usually found without money and sleeping in parks, doorsteps or even on rooftops. It was in these settings that ex-confederates joined together to romanticize and reminisce about the Old South. They told stories of the Southern aristocracy that inhabited the South prior to the Civil War, and re-lived the events of war battles, and soldier's dying words fighting for the Confederacy.","Much of this sentimentality among the ex-Confederate soldiers arose from the South's sense of inferiority and constant need to justify a position in relation to the North. The southerners of this time were reluctant to adopt a New Order which called for assimilation with the North to form a unified country. Instead, they clung to the past, the Old South, recounting old stories and founding organizations like the United Confederate Unions to bolster the solidarity among the South in opposition to the North.

The unit remained in northern Florida throughout its service, where the Union naval blockade intentionally caused serious import shortages on goods like coffee, tea, and salt. Salt was a commodity that was vitally necessary to preserve perishable foods for the army. Before the outbreak of the Civil War, manufacturers would produce salt by extracting it from saline artesian wells and rock salt deposits. However, during the war, due to the Union naval blockade and limited imports, Frier and his comrades had to produce their own salt by filtering it out of the dirt on the floors of meat store rooms. Frier hardly knew what to call the substance they created, for he claimed it looked more like mud than salt, but he was determined to make the most of the discovery. He and the reserve company manufactured several bushels and used them to preserve their meat during the winter of 1863. However, they soon realized that there was limited supply of useful dirt, and Frier worried that a salt famine was on the horizon. ","Since filtering salt-laden mud was not a long-term sustainable practice, Florida residents had to find other sources of salt. The method by which salt production came to be cheapest and most efficient in the state of Florida was boiling sea water, a simple process which required little machinery and which became the largest industry in the state following the Civil War. The industry helped increase civic morale and inter-state interaction during the Civil War, as many Georgians and Alabamans set up operations along the Florida coast to produce salt to sell to their home states. Critical to the development of the domestic salt production industry in the region was, indeed, Frier and his army. The war forced Southerners like Frier to look to new ways of producing those goods of which they were deprived, while it also helped to expand the previously small-scale enterprise of a few Confederate soldiers into a state-wide industry. Although Florida was strategically and physically peripheral to the Civil War, the Union coastal blockade and the occupation of its ports helped shape post war issues and industries.

He saw little or no action in the war for his first eighteen months of service, but he heard reports from members of his regiment who scouted the movement of the Confederate army. He was taken aback when he heard that Confederates had adopted the practice of hanging black men to discourage them and others from joining the Union army. Southerners were determined to punish any black man caught fighting against the South. In a letter to his wife and family in New Hampshire, Shedd proclaimed, Alas For the poor slave It is great wonder to me that they do not rebel; they would if they were not the most quiet, inoffensive race on earth. Besides expressing sympathy for blacks in this letter, he also claimed that slaves in Florida appeared to be more intelligent, to speak better English, and to be better looking than those he saw in South Carolina. To his disappointment, however, there were still no public schools in Florida where people of all races and classes could learn that all men are created equal in the sight of God.","Although many Union soldiers, perhaps even Shedd himself, were still racist during the Civil War, Shedd and other Northerners did see the many benefits of enlisting black soldiers as early as 1862. For many Union soldiers, the violent acts of southerners towards blacks were shocking and repulsive. The large free black population, their perceived prosperity and employment opportunities, and the extensive presence of Union garrisons in Key West all combined to positively influence perception of black Floridians. For Shedd, his intense patriotism, longing for his family, and strong sense of morality is what led him to denounce the maltreatment of blacks. ","Despite Shedd's belief that brave black volunteers did not deserve to be lynched for fighting alongside white Northerners, the lynching of blacks by Southerners, about which Shedd heard reports, did not end with the war, but instead, only gained momentum. In fact, people frequently extolled the lynching of black men as a way to enforce segregation in antebellum Florida. Reconstruction-era violence and lynching was rooted in the determination of white Floridians to keep blacks close to the brutal system of slavery which existed in Calvin Shedd's time.

However, when fighting did cease and Ms. Long saw the Union flag flying above Florida's capitol building, she instead felt crushed and disappointed. In her diary, she expressed her concerns for the future of the plantation economy, as well as for the welfare of the newly freed slaves. She wrote, The blacks will be the sufferers, for there is not one in a hundred that knows how to make a living and many must starve and die for the need of the fostering care of their masters. Ms. Long went on to write that black mothers, in particular, were inadequate and habitually careless and neglectful. ","Ellen Long's fear for the immediate future of the slaves was one shared by other Floridians who did not think that blacks knew how to care for themselves without the provisions provided by the white plantations owners. However, blacks were not the only party for whom Long and other southerners expressed concern. They were, more than anything, anxious about how planters would cultivate their crops if they suddenly found themselves without the loyal assistance of slaves. When the war ended, planters throughout Florida assumed that they could retain their slaves for a few years and follow a process of gradual emancipation. The Federal authorities, however, prevented this and as a result, Ms. Long explained, the Southern planters hated the United States with a hatred that cannot be measured. ","The moral issues which Long brought up after the Civil War were not dissimilar from those introduced earlier by white Virginians in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Since that time, white Southerners perpetually told themselves that slavery was just and Godly and perhaps even the most beneficial arrangement for the slaves themselves. Historian Melvin Ely explained that many Southerners believed that blacks would live in a state of civilization only so long as whites ruled and guided them.

A staff member had just handed him a vicious letter from a reader that, in no uncertain terms, castigated his paper for being so brazen as to refer to black people as Mr. and Mrs. in its articles and stories. The man claimed to be one of the Bourbon Democrats, those who would spill the last drop of their blood rather than apply such titles to such a degraded, worthless, inferior race... The editor could only think that in this day and age, almost 13 years after the war that had ended the institution of slavery in the U.S., it was the man who had sent this letter who was being brazen. The author of the letter, a Mr. Henry T. Earnest, was actually claiming to write on behalf of all Southerners. The editor's first hope was that there was no truth to that claim, after the progress the nation had made; his second thought was how deeply unfortunate it was that Mr. Earnest believed the whole South shared his extreme opinion. That he even still felt there to be a South with its own identity and opinions so alien to those of the rest of the nation was a barrier to all that had been fought over so recently. He chose to publish the letter in the paper- accompanied by a rebuttal. He picked up his pen and began to draft the response. He would address this letter to every reader of The Post who might be wondering what stand the paper would take on such a relevant and sensitive issue. He wrote, So long as colored people are permitted to vote, we will feel constrained to address them as human beings...The gentleman who addresses us should have shed his blood during the late war. When the letters ran in the January 19th issue, he hoped that every reader would know that the paper stood behind progress, not racism."," The letter written to the editor of <em>The Post</em> by Mr. Earnest typifies the definition of the Bourbon Democrats as Willie D. Halsell describes it: ...a ruling group, once dethroned but now returned to power, who stubbornly hold to the past and refuse to adapt themselves to a changing world about them. Despite the fact that the war had resolved the issues of slavery and secession of the South, there were clearly those who felt no such resolution. As Miss Halsell explains, the Bourbons only represented a small subset of the Democratic party; however, their ideas would proliferate widely as the nation continued to struggle with the issue of racial equality. These ultra-conservative Democrats preached white supremacy, and fought privately and publicly (as is evidenced by this letter in the news) to defend what they believed to be white Americans' superiority over black Americans. However, though there were many like Mr. Earnest who made their racist views known during the post-Reconstruction period, there were also those like the editor of <em>The Washington Post</em> who openly accepted and stood up for the black man's right to citizenship and the respect which that citizenship demands for every American."],"display_date":"January 19, 1878","search_date":"1878-01-19","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2097,"title":"The Young Men of Natchez Have Organized an Artillery Company\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-08-25","end_date":"1876-08-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The young artillery company was pressed for funds, and the task of raising them fell to a member of their ranks named H.H. Farnham. In an August 1876 fundraising letter to Stephen Duncan, the former president of the Bank of Mississippi, Farnham, (who signed the correspondence Ch. Com. Of the Gilden Light Artillery) wrote that the young men of Natchez have organized an artillery company, known as the Gilden Light Artillery and are now trying to raise the funds to equip with one or two pieces. Farnham went on to outline the costs of outfitting the new artillery, asking Mr. Duncan to participate by paying a subscription of any amount you may deem it advisable to give so that the young men's artillery might participate in a coming campaign. There is no record of whether Mr. Duncan, already an honorary member of the Natchez Adams Light infantry, accommodated the requests of the Gilden Light Artillery, but it might be presumed that the former Bank president and owner of a sugar and cotton plantation, would have support the young men's efforts in spirit, if not in dollars."," Artillery companies served a unique purpose in the psyche of former Confederate communities. They represented a prouder time and were part of the balm that soothed the southern collective consciousness in the years after their defeat: the Lost Cause ideology, or the idea that the Confederacy had fought nobly and bravely for a superior cause and were defeated only by the sheer force of the federal army. The Lost Cause ideal was first established- or at least first defined in such terms - in a 1866 book of the same name by journalist Edward Pollard, and it gained in popularity throughout the 1870s, mostly through articles written by Former Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal Early, a West Point graduate who emphasized, among other tenets, the nobility of southern military leadership in comparison to the allegedly barbaric behavior on the part of Union troops. As southern historian Rod Andrew, Jr explains, perhaps the most central and enduring element of the Lost Cause was the firm connection in the minds of southerners between martial virtue (courage, patriotism, selflessness, loyalty) and moral rectitude. The image of the valorous soldier as a patriot and model citizen had antebellum roots, but it shaped and drew strength from the legend of the Lost Cause after the Civil War."," The popularity and growth of and esteem commanded by such artillery companies, serve in Andrew's words, as a reminder that militarism was as much as part of southern culture after the Civil War as before. As the young men of Natchez would have been proud to note, their Gilden Light Artillery was part of a phenomenon across the South that was much greater then their own group and its fundraising efforts."],"display_date":"August 25, 1876","search_date":"1876-08-25","locations":[{"id":6928,"lat":31.4831695494,"lng":-91.3531349834,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2103,"title":"Chas.

M. Evans, Manufacturer of Artificial Limbs of the best quality, solicits a share of the Southern patronage the ad read. Prices have been reduced and other special inducements are now offered Southern citizens and soldiers. To insure satisfaction, each leg may be fitted and test fully before any payment is required. Mr. Evans, purveyor of prosthetics, provides the Rev. C.K. Marshall of Vicksburg, Mississippi, as a reference to the suitability of his product for the citizens of the Vicksburg community. "," At the time the ad was placed in the Jackson Weekly Clarion on February 16, 1879, there would have been a high demand for prosthetic limbs among those soldiers who were fortunate enough to return from the Civil War alive. Scores of the roughly eighty thousand Mississippi whites who fought for the Confederate Army were killed, and many more of those who did come home did so missing arms, legs, or sustaining other injuries. Civil War military historians Grady McWhiney and Perry D. Jamieson suggest that the military strategy of the Confederate army was particularly responsible for this state of affairs, asserting that casualty lists reveal that the Confederates destroyed themselves by making bold and repeated attacks... these bloody Confederate offensives took the lives of the bravest Southern officers and men. Relatively few combat officers went through the conflict without a single wound, and most of those who did could claim, as did General Reuben L. Walker, who participated in no less than sixty-three battles, that it was not my fault. "," The unpreparedness of Confederate generals for a new sort of warfare fought with rifles, coupled with a tactical aggression that led them to strike offensively even in the face of massive casualties, meant that an entire generation of young men in Mississippi and throughout the South were either lost on the battlefields or came home dramatically wounded. "," Those who survived the bullet blasts often faced even worse in Confederate hospitals. Medical historian George Worthington Adams paints a grim picture of the sort of medical services provided in wartime: The surgeons of the day thought a bare finger was the best probe; they operated in dirty uniforms; they used the same marine sponge to swab out the wounds of countless men; they reused linen dressings; they meddled with wounds and thus made bad matters worse... far from being surprised at the large number of mortalities, we should marvel that a majority of their operations recovered. Such was the state of affairs for soldiers undergoing surgery, to say nothing of those suffering from the many diseases that ravished the Confederate army. "," The appearance of the Charles M. Evan's ad nearly a decade and a half after the war's conclusion demonstrates how far the consequences of the war's characteristics- from poor military strategy to dangerous operating procedures- would last into the era of rebuilding in the South. For the young veterans who would become clients of Evans' artificial limbs business, the destruction brought about by the Civil War was not limited to their land, their communities, or their former homes; they would face as well the very personal devastation of their own bodies."],"display_date":"February 16, 1879","search_date":"1879-02-16","locations":[{"id":7313,"lat":32.364480123,"lng":-90.8603381835,"zoom":9,"place":"WARREN, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2134,"title":"Southern Reaction to the Nullification Threat\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-06-28","end_date":"1832-06-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was the summer of 1832, and tension hung over Richmond like a thick fog.  National unrest had been building throughout the United States for quite some time, and sectional pressure between the North and South was nearing its boiling point. Those people living in Virginia's capital sensed the impending conflict more than most. Mere months before the South Carolina nullification crisis erupted, John Campbell, a politically active Virginian, returned home to Richmond after extensive travel throughout the country. Immediately upon arriving in the city, Campbell was struck by the attitude of the Virginians he encountered. From all I see and hear since my return home [to Virginia], he wrote to his friend Claiborne Watts Gooch, I think the people of the South (SC included) will support, by a strong vote, the [Presidential] nominee of the [Democratic] Convention. President Andrew Jackson's power, he believed, could not be shaken by any foreseeable event. Campbell immediately gauged the attitude of the South and saw fit to place his faith in the extremely popular Jackson, who would be indirectly nominated for a second term by the first-ever Democratic nominating convention held in Baltimore in 1832.","Campbell did admit to himself, however, that Henry Clay (a Whig) and John Calhoun (a secessionist) would do just about anything to destroy Martin Van Buren, who was then serving Jackson's Vice President, and Jackson himself. Calhoun, he believed, was pushing for disunion in a vain grab for power, hoping to become the eventual king or emperor of a Southern republic. This attitude was surprising coming from a Southerner at a time when regional solidarity was growing, and Calhoun was seen as the face of an increasingly separatist movement. Campbell also voiced his sneaking suspicion that the secessionists (Clay and Calhoun) had a personal interest in separation and were not representing the will of their constituents. Jackson, he felt, could harmonize the Union and preserve American liberty as he had done before. Our Liberty is gone when our Union is dissolved, he wrote. Why should we throw away the fruits of the toil and blood of the fathers of the Revolution? Is it because a Clay or a Calhoun wishes to be President, and the people are too slow in gratifying their ambition? "," Campbell's own opinion after returning to Richmond is significant not only in its foresight (the Union eventually dissolving) but also in its point of view. Campbell was a Southerner living in what would become the capital of the Confederacy, yet he had reservations about nullification and great faith in national unity. In the course of studying the antebellum period, we often assume that all Southern males, for example, thought alike. In reality, there were those that disagreed with nullification and those who did not trust the so-called spokesmen of the South.

According to Wailes, his son, who attended an unspecified medical school in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, resisted all efforts and persuasions used to get him to go off from the medical college with the southern students, at least two hundred of which left for southern institutions in consequence of the political excitement gotten up by the Sectionalists and disunionists. Wailes then described his feelings on the situation, indicating that he was proud of his son for not giving in to social pressures and that he was disappointed in the young men who did head back South. He felt that the United States should not be in such a state of discontent and turmoil, but his opinion was unique because most southerners did want their children to return if they had traveled to the more advanced schools of the North. "," The fact that Wailes' son attended a northern medical school was generally looked down upon by southern people and especially southern practitioners. However, due to the fact that northern schools were more advanced, many southern students traveled to attend them. This was discouraged because the idea that southern medical practice was different than northern medical practice pervaded the minds of most southerners. This theory of medical regionalism was held due to the notion that medical practices had to closely relate to certain characteristics of the patient, such as moral status, ethnicity, and gender. More specific attributes such as the climate and population of where the patient hailed from were also taken into consideration. Due to this, practitioners of the nineteenth century believed in specificity, or that ideas appropriate for one situation were not appropriate in other contexts. The general population of the South also took this belief to heart. Thus, there were different medical practices in the North and the South and southern doctors and citizens disapproved when southern students went north to learn. "," The theory of medical regionalism was not enough to compel all southern students to only attend southern medical schools. Southern practitioners and citizens pushed the idea further by strengthening the southern commitment to cultural separatism through a promotion of the ideals of the South, saying that God had given them, and only them, the ability to do great things for the world. This idea was not fool-proof for keeping southern students in the South because Wailes' son and others still traveled north to attend medical school. Differing opinions among southerners regarding the idea of secession therefore not only affected the population in terms of politics, but spread through other areas of their culture, like education, as well. These differences of opinion were brought into the forefront as the Civil War loomed and it became the issues of normal life, such as receiving an education, which finally forced people to take a stance on how they felt regarding secession."],"display_date":"January 9, 1860","search_date":"1860-01-09","locations":[{"id":6926,"lat":31.4831695494,"lng":-91.3531349834,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2160,"title":"Action on the Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-24","end_date":"1863-02-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Walter Guion wrote a letter dated Saturday, January 24, 1863, to Miss. Bessie Guion, his sister, in Adams County, Mississippi, describing his experiences as a Confederate soldier and relaying some of his emotions about the war. In the letter, Walter spoke of a fight that broke out on the fourteenth of January against a Yankee gunboat near Lauderdale, Tennessee. The Confederate gunboat that Walter was on, The Cotton, imposed considerable damage against the northern boat, but also bore the brunt of the battle. Walter described his intense feelings of fear when he first became cognizant that he was in a real skirmish, and then talked about his surprise that there were African American men among the Union forces. In a letter back to Walter, dated February 24, 1863, Bessie confesses to her brother that she fears for his life and worries about his safety on a consistent basis. "," The heart of the Deep South was easily accessed by the Mississippi River. The river provided a way of transportation for not only men, but goods needed for the war effort such as grain. Thus, it became increasingly important as the Civil War continued that the Confederacy provide fortifications in order to protect its banks and naval stores from the Union's gunboats which often proved technologically superior for the time. As the war progressed and the Union claimed more victories near and along the Mississippi River, such as at the Battle of Vicksburg, the North was able to build up many garrisons of its own along this crucial area. As thousands of African American men from Mississippi came to the Union's aid (more than seventeen thousand by the end of the war), they began to form the regiments occupying these Union garrisons and their accompanying gunboats along the Mississippi River. Thus, it is highly likely that Walter Guion found himself fighting against some of the very men who had escaped to Union strongholds from his very own state and perhaps even county. In a twist of irony, these African American soldiers were guarding the river fortifications within plain view of southern slave owners, their former masters. While naval warfare was not the focal point of the Civil War, it became increasingly important because it was the facet of the war in which many African Americans, especially from Mississippi, were allowed to participate, and prove themselves as men, in. White Mississippians, like Walter Guion, were the ones fighting against these blacks. The emotions that both sides felt, excitement over the idea of freedom by the blacks and anger over the idea of black insubordination by the whites, fueled these gunboat skirmishes to posses a considerable degree of contempt.

Two days after this, on March 14, Forbes gave Elick a severe whipping in hopes of finding out all of the details about his plan of running away, but was only able to confirm that the slave did truly intend on escaping. Placing Elick in jail again on March 15 after another unsuccessful attempt at literally beating the information out of him, Forbes released him on March 21, only to send Elick away on an errand, fearing the whole time that he would attempt to run to freedom at any moment."," Whether or not Elick did eventually run away is unknown, but his plan to escape was not unique. Many slaves entertained the idea of running away to the North, prompted by news about freedom for blacks from northern abolitionists that was creeping into southern territory. The southern belief that the Republican Party was out to destroy slavery caused animosity towards the North and during the year before the start of the Civil War in April 1861, tensions reached an all time high between the northern and southern states. The controversial election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 prompted southerners to begin considering the idea of succession much more seriously. The northern abolitionist's rhetoric of freeing the enslaved African Americans did nothing to please white southerners like Alden Spooner Forbes who depended on the labor of enslaved people to earn a livelihood. The thought that this very same rhetoric of equality and freedom was reaching the ears of their laborers intensified the white southern secessionists' hostility towards the northern abolitionists. The fear of new ideas of freedom formulating in their slaves' minds provoked many, like Forbes, to be especially harsh on their laborers in an attempt to keep them from trying to escape."," Mississippi did indeed secede from the Union on January 9, 1861. People like Forbes who depended on the labor of slaves drove this secession because they could not imagine a world without slavery, like the one they thought northern Republicans would try to create. The thought that slaves would internalize the ideas of the abolitionists regarding their freedom from bondage frightened those who depended on their labor. It was this fear that prompted many of them, in Mississippi and the rest of the South, to use cruel methods, such as whipping, to try and convince them that life as an enslaved laborer was the only life for them.

"," During the election of 1860, the talk of secession grew a great deal among Mississippians. It had been brought up before this time that if the northern states elected a president without the support of the South, that Mississippi would secede. When Lincoln, a Republican, won and took office, Mississippians were outraged because not a single one of them had cast a vote in his favor. In fact, no one in the Deep South had because they viewed the Republicans, and thus Lincoln, as staunch abolitionists who desired to rid the nation of slavery at the soonest possible moment. Mississippians held true to their promise, and two months after Lincoln's election, a statewide convention voted to secede from the Union. "," Mississippians, like many residents of the Deep South, had several fears of what a Republican government would do to their existence. Some, like Wailes, most prominently feared the destruction of the Union and were against secession. Most others, like Baker, felt that southern culture would meet its demise from the Republicans because they believed that the North, with its industrial endeavors, was unable to comprehend how necessary slavery was to the South's economy (or how necessary they felt it was). Thus, the white South was not necessarily fighting for slavery, but more so for a South with its foundations based on slavery. "," White southerners had become so accustomed to their slave society that they were terrified at the thought that the Republicans would try and force them to be without it. Many southerners had achieved an extremely comfortable life because of the peculiar institution. Their economy was the fourth richest in the world, they controlled 60 percent of all United States imports, and had more railroad lines than anywhere else in the world. They felt that this would no longer be the case without the system of bondage that they held African Americans in, and it was the idea that Lincoln and his party would destroy it that led them to talk of secession and eventually carry it out. Lincoln cited his priority as keeping the Union together, not abolishing slavery.

He had made it a long way from his home in Boston to be a surveyor for the city of New Smyrna on Florida's frontier, and he missed all the pretty girls greatly. In a letter to his mother, Eliza Gerry, he described his new environment. He asked her to imagine to yourself me with my jacket off, covered with mosquitoes and sand flies, trampling through thick brushes, and running lines over rough paths cut out of hammocks. In 1837, the Second Seminole War was raging in Florida. Mrs. Townsend worried about her young son, a thousand miles away and fighting a war against the indigenous Seminole nation on behalf of the citizens of Florida. ","Townsend, however, kept her updated on the war news. General Eustis had recently assumed command of the Eastern Army after General Hernandez had allowed an Indian retreat to the south. Troops were building up in the county preparing to drive the handful of little wretches in our direction. Townsend's descriptions of the Seminoles were contrasting and flecked with both racism and respect. Later, he called the warriors respectable and distinguished, but referred to Chief Big Billy as a consummate rascal...a dark looking and immensely powerful savage. The chief he called Powell was a peaceable and consistent diplomat who also maintained a brilliant mind for guerilla war tactics. When in St. Augustine, Townsend had the honor of shaking hands with Old Phillip, Big Billy, Blue Snake, a friendly Seminole, and many others. His encounters with these war chiefs were of great importance to him, and he related these experiences to his mother.","The letter is a narrative of an outsider to the territory; Florida was still very new to Major Townsend. He arrived there having limited interaction with Indian populations, and his descriptions were powerful in their untainted perspective of a foreign environment. He consciously picked adjectives to describe these warriors and chiefs based on what he had witnessed, and reinforced them with what he had heard: stories of battles, massacres (Dade), and conversations with white Floridians. Powell, as Townsend called him, was better known as Chief Osceola to the Seminoles and later to all Americans, as his fame spread. Townsend treats him with great respect, as would many soldiers, officers, and citizens nationwide, giving insight into the thought process of a young soldier in respect to his so-called enemy. Osceola was born into a humble life in the Creek nation of Alabama, with no hereditary connection to the Seminoles. Upon relocating to Florida, he ascended to an unequaled position. He won a string of battles during the summer and fall of 1836, outmaneuvering and baffling U.S. troops in swamps and hammocks. He gave the Seminoles tribal identity and unified them in pursuit of a common goal. Osceola, as Townsend began to show, deconstructs the notion that all whites viewed Indians as savages. They gave respect where it was due, acknowledged valiance when it was displayed, and felt honored in his presence, regardless of his physical appearance or enemy status. Officers chose to deal with him in diplomatic consultations, and, upon his death on January 30, 1838, he was given a military funeral at Fort Moultrie.

Captain Micajah Woods of Charlottesville delivered a stirring Memorial Day address to the people of Staunton, just twenty-two years since the Civil War. Captain Woods spoke as one who had fought in the fields as a Southern soldier during the war and could relate to the experiences of the young men lying in their graves all around him. He described how the growing economy and population of the North had seemed to overshadow the South prior to 1860. Before the war the South was characterized as reliant upon her ancestral background rather than any merit of her own, but the valiant fighting of her sons during the war proved her strength and honor. The soldiers were compared to the heroes of Thermopylae and Merathon while the Southern women were suggested as the Carthaginian maidens, allusions to the ancient world used to conjure the heroic efforts of all involved. Captain Woods reminded the Virginians mournfully viewing the graves of their loved ones that these martyrs to cause that failed have not died in vain.","  The Captain's address turned from ruminations on the past to implications for the present when he cried, It is for us to do our duty while we still live. Southerners must write their own history and not allow it to be mediated through the prejudice and judgment of alien and foreign intellect, mainly Northerners. Woods encouraged all present to record their memories of battles and the names of their lost sons as this knowledge of heroic deeds will allow the South to retain its image of glory. This allowed Virginians to rest secure in the knowledge that Virginia could rise again to bravely fight should she be threatened by an invading foe. Following his address, Captain Woods was presented with flowers on behalf of a Northern lady whose husband fought in the Union. The Captain responded to her gift by describing how the blue and the grey would join together to fight should the need arise and vie with the other in defense of a common flag and the honor of a common country.","  The Memorial Day address closed with contradictory assertions of the new bonds existing between the North and the South and the declaration of the South's brilliance in comparison with the North. These opposing attitudes support historian Michael Perman's argument for the contradiction that formed the core of the federal Reconstruction policy in which the North used radical policies to enact traditional goals. The South was consequently left to function with a novel political system set up as though nothing had changed. Captain Woods's address illustrated an awareness of this dichotomy with a speech containing ruminations of past glory in combination with a conscious declaration of Virginia's role in the Union. Reconstruction united the North and the South politically, but the Union did not extend to public opinion. On that day of remembering, it is obvious that the Southerners were still very aware of the Northern attitudes that led to their succession in the first place.

Important enough that it was stored with the Duke family's personal belongings, one postcard from the late nineteenth century displayed a famous Timothy O'Sullivan photograph taken of the McLean family seated on the steps of their home. The postcard told the story of April 9, 1865, where Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant in the house of Wilmer McLean at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. The two Generals met in a room on the left side of the house and drew up the articles of surrender that marked the end of the War Between the States. The interesting part of the Surrender House history was just beginning as shown by the last line on the back of the postcard - This building was torn down to be rebuilt a St. Louis World's Fair.","The discovery of the postcards in the attic added to the history of the Surrender House. In 1867, the McLean family sold the house and moved to Alexandria, Virginia where Wilmer McLean had been born and built his fortune before marrying the widow Virginia Mason and moving to Appomattox County, Virginia. After transferring hands a few times between the Pascoe and Ragland families, M.E. Dunlap of Niagara Falls, New York, who had lofty plans for the property, eventually bought the house. Originally, his zealous plans were to move the house either to St. Louis as stated in the quote of the postcard or to Chicago for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893.","Instead of hiring New York architects and contractors, Dunlap kept the process local and hired a Lynchburg, Virginia contracting company by the name of Hardy and Hancock Contractors to draw up blueprints of the house in order to have it successfully dismantled, moved, and rebuilt in its new location. In February of 1893, C. Hubbard of Hardy and Hancock Contractors made five blueprints of the building: the basement plan and house section, the front porch cornices and columns, the window and mantle details, the first floor plan, and the second floor plan. Unfortunately, the plans to move the house to the World's Fair never materialized, so Dunlap decided to have the house moved to Washington, D.C. where it would be on permanent display. Dunlap ordered for complete dismantlement of the house before running into a shortage of cash and legal problems. Thus, the house sat boxed in Appomattox County for 50 years where the wood rotted and the bricks crumbled.","Either a member of the Duke family bought the postcard at Craighill and Jones, Inc. in Lynchburg, Virginia or someone - a friend or a relative - sent it to the Duke family. The Craighill and Jones, Inc. label affixed to the postcard remained although there was no address present anywhere on it. At the time the McLean House postcard was printed, Appomattox County residents including the Duke family believed the house would not remain at its current location, and only pictures and postcards would serve as reminders of the house's rich history. The Duke family looked into the past, saw the house as a reminder of a moment in their lives, and realized that the Surrender House was a piece of history not only to within Appomattox County and Virginia but nationally as far as Chicago and St. Louis."],"display_date":1893,"search_date":"1893-07-02","locations":[{"id":13631,"lat":37.3722533013,"lng":-78.8121458288,"zoom":9,"place":"APPOMATTOX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2285,"title":"Southside Virginians in the Spanish American War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-01-01","end_date":"1899-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["July 31 - Pendleton, Charles - Harris Creek - Amherst County - Railroad Brakesman - 27 years of age - Single - 5'7.5 - 136 pounds - Chest Measurement 34 and 36.5 - Ruddy Complexion - Blue Eyed - Light Brown Hair - Accepted - Vaccinated was how the many Army documents read in the collection of James Dearing Fauntleroy.

They gave all pertinent information regarding the man and whether the U.S. Army accepted or denied each from entering the U.S. Army. These documents became important when the United States declared war on Spain on April 25, 1898.","Leading up to the war, the United States had a great deal of interest in purchasing Cuba because many Americans had invested in sugar plantations. In fact, by 1895 Americans had already invested approximately 50 million dollars in Cuba with the profits from trade being close to double that amount. President Grover Cleveland announced on June 12, 1895 that the United States was neutral, even as fervor for war increased in the United States. Spanish General Valeriano Weyler decided that insurgents in Cuba would be easier to control by the Spanish Army if they were located in the center of the Cuban island, so he enacted a policy of Reconcentration and then put the entire island under marital law. On December 7 of the same year, President Cleveland changed his decisions stating that the United States would become involved in the Cuban conflict if Spain failed to end the crisis.","After the explosion aboard the U.S.S. Maine on February 15, 1898, it looked as though the United States would definitely become involved in the conflict. On March 28, the U.S. Naval Court of Inquiry determined that a mine caused the explosion on the U.S.S. Maine. Later that spring in April President McKinley ordered a blockade of Cuba just four days before declaring war on Spain. Once American troops landed in Cuba in June, the Marines captured Guantanamo Bay. The Mobilization Act of April 22 enabled approximately 190,000 regular Army members and volunteers to join the troops already in Cuba. After troops attacked from San Juan and in the San Juan port in early July, Spain signed an unconditional surrender agreement on July 16. A peace treaty signed between representatives of the United States and Spain on December 10, 1898 in Paris, France determined the independence of Cuba while ceding both Puerto Rico and Guam to the United States and allowing the purchase of the Philippines Island by the United States.","At the end of the war, the United States had invested 250 million in the war and lost 3,000 lives. Although it was unlikely that Virginians made many of the investments in Cuba, many men in Southside Virginia volunteered to fight in the Spanish-American War including those whose records Fauntleroy kept.

Hutcheson were the minutes of the L.A. Armistead Camp Confederate Veterans of Mecklenburg County as well as several articles regarding the Camp of Confederate Veterans. One of the articles, Ex-Confederates Meet, was a lengthier article that discussed the application for the charter by the L.A. Armistead Camp of Confederate Veterans to the Grand Camp. Named the L.A. Armistead Camp Mecklenburg County's Camp was in honor of General L.A. Armistead who fell while waving his sword on the heights of Gettysburg. There were many Mecklenburgers in Armistead's Brigade. The initial goal of the Camp was to raise enough money to erect a monument in front of the County Courthouse to pay tribute to the fallen heroes of the Lost Cause.","In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Thomas Ellett, the Adjutant-General Grand Camp C.V. of the Department of Virginia, wrote the Instructions About Forming a Camp of Confederate Veterans. It was a specific outline on the proper way to apply for a charter from the Grand Camp, elect officers, and adopt By-Laws and Order of Business. In the missing portion of the pamphlet there were also the Proceedings of the Grand Camp, Charter and By-Laws of the R.E. Lee Camp, No. 1, C.V., Order of Business, Duties of Officials, Uniform, and Rules of Order. The creation of many other Camps of Confederate Veterans used the specific guidelines such as the L.A. Armistead of Mecklenburg County.","The Camps of Confederate Veterans became popular before the turn of the nineteenth century in the South as a way of honoring the 600,000 Confederate veterans who had fought and died in the Civil War. In Mecklenburg County, most of the companies were in the field by September 1861 and the men in these companies comprised about 10% of the Mecklenburg's white population. These camps held reunions for veterans and their families, erected monuments to honor those who died in the war, and provided a support group for the Southerners who had the war fought in their backyards. Since Reconstruction had not fully rebuilt the South both economically and structurally, Southerners still identified with each other through the Confederate cause. Therefore, instituting these Camps of Confederate Veterans was an attempt to fill the void in Southern identity. As in the cases of Robert E. Lee and L.A. Armistead, Confederate Generals and heroes served as names for the Camps. Mecklenburg County began their Camp in 1983, and it continued to be a success as documented in Nat G.

He asked everyone present to stand and raise their glass to themselves as guests of this special event, the infantry, artillery, and cavalry of the Army of Northern Virginia, the staff of the Army, the women of the South, the strong cities of Richmond and Petersburg, and the memory of the dead. With a pull of the sheet, the bronzed statue of General Ambrose Powell Hill given by the Pegram Battalion Association, A.N.V., was uncovered in honor of Hill's great Confederate military victories. Later Colonel McCabe's wife tucked the program from the event into her purse for safekeeping and as a reminder of her husband's powerful and eloquent speech about those who lost their lives in the Civil War.","Ambrose Powell Hill was a Confederate General who fought in the Civil War yet few people knew much about. At one point in his career, General A.P. Hill led one third of Lee's Army and later both Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee called upon him in their last moments. Although he was not from Petersburg or Dinwiddie County where the statue was later erected in his honor, General Hill was a Virginian from Culpepper in the central part of the state. He began his prestigious military career at West Point where he graduated high in his class. When the Civil War broke out in Virginia, Hill decided to fight for the Confederacy so the he could defend state's rights and the honor of Virginia. He was involved in many different battles within Virginia, and the Confederate Army promoted him several times before a bullet from a stray group of Union soldiers struck him in 1865 causing his immediate death.","Raising the statue of A.P. Hill was not only a tribute to the Confederate military efforts of General Hill and his Light Division which earned so much fame but possibly more importantly, a tribute to a Virginian who believed in protecting the honor of Virginia and the other Southern states above all else. Men joined the Confederate Army to protect their neighborhoods, the land they called home, their families, and their own pride and honor. Although the issues of slavery and state's rights were fundamental issues in the Civil War, they are not why men left their families to fight. The men that General Hill and other important Confederate Generals led into battle were literally protecting their neighborhoods because the Confederate and Union troops met in forty percent of Civil War battles on Virginia and Tennessee soil.

It was visited three times by United States troops, the first time marking the first official engagement of the war. These skirmishes resulted in the deaths of three Seminoles, the capture of one, and the abandonment of the town.","Lieutenant Colonel Arbuckle led the second party to visit Fowl Town. As he and his soldiers neared the town, he ordered JNO. N. McIntosh to approach the village from a different route, with the secondary goal of taking as many prisoners as possible, provided the Indians did not resist or try to escape. If they did attempt to run or fight back, Lt. Col. Arbuckle ordered McIntosh to fire upon them. McIntosh did not expect to encounter resistance, but his hopes were quickly demolished, as he and his team were discovered within about 200 yards of the town. The Indians did not stand and fight, however. They merely fled, firing indiscriminately, and whooping as they abandoned their town to the more heavily armed white men. This left the path open for McIntosh's party to pursue their primary objective: the acquisition of provisions for Fort Scott in nearby Georgia. They searched the town, collecting as much corn as they could find, fifteen to eighteen cows, and a few horses before the Indians returned to attack the whites that were raiding their town. McIntosh's command suffered one casualty; the Seminoles later acknowledged losing five of six comrades. The Indians eventually retreated, leaving McIntosh free to continue raiding the town. They then journeyed the fifteen miles back to Fort Scott, pausing for a few days after about three miles to construct Fort Hughes, a small, advanced picket encampment that would be used later in the war.","Abner Lacock wrote a letter to McIntosh asking for a narration of his involvement in the Seminole War to serve as evidence in the Senate's investigation of General Andrew Jackson. McIntosh replied with a letter, later to be published in the <em>New-York Daily Advertiser</em>, which detailed his participation in the second raid of Fowl Town.","Chief Neamathla of Fowl Town, located directly across the Flint River from Fort Scott, told Colonel Edmund Gaines that if he crossed the Flint River, the residents of Fowl Town would react violently. On November 21, 1817, Col. Gaines disregarded this warning and attacked Fowl Town, killing five Indians. After Lt. Col. Arbuckle and McIntosh completed their raid of the town, Arbuckle returned once more and burned the now-abandoned town to the ground. Neamathla's Seminoles, predictably, reacted violently. In one attack, they jumped a United States boat on the Flint River, killing 37 soldiers, six women, and four children.

One morning during the war, Woods was standing guard as a picket. As the sun rose, one of his fellow soldiers kindly offered to fill his post, while the hungry Woods made breakfast for himself. While he was cooking, an officer approached him and asked him to help with the removal of trash and animal bones from the encampment. After politely declining, saying he was standing picket, the officer proceeded to vociferously curse the boy out, drawing the attention of many in the camp, including General Jackson. The temperamental General ordered for ten balls to be blown through the d----d rascal. When none of the soldiers would comply with this order, Jackson court marshaled the boy on charges of mutiny and desertion, found him guilty, and sentenced him to be shot.","Soon after the end of the war, the United States Senate, prompted by rumors of multiple events like the death of Woods, launched an investigation into the conduct of General Jackson during the First Seminole War. Abner Lacock, a member of the investigation panel, personally came to the conclusion that General Jackson had an innate love of 'blood and carnage' and felt the need to tell the nation about his misconduct. Lacock authored A Letter to the People of Pennsylvania detailing General Jackson's misconduct. In this letter, he narrates the events leading up to the death of Woods, among others, and claims that Jackson deliberately lied time and again to explain his brutal and unwarranted actions.","The First Seminole War was conducted on one of the frontiers of America, and one that was characterized by nearly constant violence. It was a war easily won, but with questionable goals. The end result was the sale of Florida to the United States, a result to which the United States denied aspiring; rather, Secretary of War Calhoun sent General Jackson to Fort Scott in 1818 to wage war on the Seminoles as retribution for attacks against whites-soldiers and civilians alike-in retaliation for General Gaines' sacking of an Indian town.

Mitchill was the executive chair of Georgia in 1817, but in early March of that year, he resigned his post. In July of that year, he met with the leaders of the Creek Nation at Fort Hawkins. His goal of this meeting was to explain to the Indians their role in creating and maintaining a mutual peace between the Indians and the United States. He warned the Creeks that other Americans had approached some of the Creeks in the southern portion of the nation, misleading them and bribing them away from the rest of their nation. He named, most notably, the British Agent Colonel Nichols, and cited the gifts given to some of these Creeks as evidence of corruption. Mitchill argued that the northern Creeks had a duty to bring those who had been led astray back into the nation, as tensions were slowly but steadily arising between them and the United States. Mitchill also stated that the United States would fulfill all of their promises to the Creek nation, as well as willingly renewing diplomatic relations with all of the southern Creeks who could be persuaded by their northern counterparts to return their previous amicable relations with the United States. In his testimony to the United States Senate on the First Seminole War, Mitchell did not state the final results of these talks; he implied, however, that the Creeks acquiesced to his requests. On August 4, 1817, Major Twiggs, stationed at Fort Scott, Georgia, wrote Mitchill on behalf of the chiefs of three Seminole towns in Florida. These three chiefs, via Major Twiggs, asked Mitchill if they too might agree to the terms he offered to the Creeks at Fort Hawkins. Mitchill planned to send for these three men, one of whom was Chief Neamathla of Fowl Town, to discuss their request. Before he could, however, General Gaines attacked and burned Fowl Town, thus instigating the violent retaliatory attacks of the Seminoles against the whites in the area that would mark the commencement of the First Seminole War and prompt Secretary of War Calhoun to dispatch General Andrew Jackson to Fort Scott.","One of the major problems in the process of creating and signing treaties between the United States and the Indians before 1830, when the Indian Removal Act was passed, was a lack of a central, sole authority for either side. The United States had multiple people, ranging from military officials like General Andrew Jackson to statesmen like Mitchell to independent citizens making a variety of agreements with the Indians. The Indians as well, and the Seminoles in particular, lacked a central government. Each town or group of Seminoles was organized independently, thus making it nearly impossible for the government of the United States to make a universal treaty. In addition, even if the United States succeed in writing and passing a treaty with a number of Indian leaders, as it did with the Chickasaws in Mississippi, that did not necessarily protect the tribe from the intervention of the state in which it lived. In the case of the Chickasaws, Mississippi tried to extra-legally subvert the treaty signed by the United States and the Chickasaws in 1830 in order to impose state law onto the Indians. Upon receiving a plea from the Chickasaws, President Jackson paid them a visit, and told them that they essentially had no choice but to sign a new treaty with the United States agreeing to be relocated west of the Mississippi River. The United States repeatedly recanted on previous treaties it had made with numerous different tribes in order to advance its own territorial possessions.

He also had heard reports of Indians murdering whites in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. He was, in fact, sent down to Fort Scott because of Seminole retaliatory strikes against the United States in late 1817. General Jackson concluded that it was necessary for the United States to invade Spanish territory and forcibly take control of Pensacola, thereby dispersing (or killing) the Indians gathered there. On May 28, 1818, he did just that. He claimed, after the invasion, that his action stemmed in no way from a desire to extend the territorial limits of the United States but was instead a preventative measure against further Indian violence against whites. ","General Jackson issued a statement regarding his taking of Pensacola that was then published in at least one newspaper; <em>The Times</em> printed his statement on August 3, 1818. His report also included details of his plans for occupying the city. He stated that all Spanish laws, so far as they effect personal rights and property would remain in effect. ","This ultimately became a moot point, as Spain agreed to cede the Florida Territory to the United States on February 22, 1819, although the treaty legalizing this sale, the Adam-Onis Treaty, was not ratified until 1821. The United States, in return, agreed to assume 5 million worth of Spain's debt. The taking of Pensacola and General Jackson's statement of intent, however, are still important. The atrocities that the Indians committed against white settlers in the Deep South deeply upset General Jackson. He justified all of his actions against the Indians in the First Seminole War on the perpetration of these 'atrocities'-even the ones that were provoked by General Gaines' actions. The Indians were occupying valuable land and reacting violently when the Americans tried to coerce these lands from them. ","The ultimate realization of General Jackson's antipathy towards the Indians was realized with his signing, as President, of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. With the passage and later implementation for this act, Jackson claimed repeatedly that this was for the good of the Indians, rather than for the Americans. He stated to Congress and to the Indians that the purpose of the act was to enable the Indians to preserve their culture from assimilation into white culture, and to give them the space necessary to govern themselves free from the American legal system. Regardless of his intentions, the result remains the same. President Jackson was almost solely responsible for the uprooting of North America's oldest human inhabitants and for one of the most egregious violations of the Constitution in American history. This act was written by his supporters and signed by him; rather than simply mandating the removal of the Indians, however, it authorized the President make voluntary treaties with the Indians exchanging their current land for land west of the Mississippi River. In other words, this treaty required that President Jackson to keep up his facade of removing the Indians in their best interest in order to sell them on his plan.","The Seminoles in Florida were, ironically, one of the last tribes to be officially effected by President Jackson's decision to remove the Indians west. They were also one of the most determined to resist this relocation, eventually forcing the United States into the Second Seminole War. Upon losing the war, all but about one quarter of the Seminoles were relocated.

With the entrance of a sloop later in the month came more frightening news. There was a significant number of Indians gathering in nearby Pensacola, Florida. Upon hearing this news and concluding that the United States army would move to counter this build up of Seminole strength in Pensacola, Colonel Gibson ordered three thousand rations to Fort Scott. General Jackson then ordered his quartermaster to Mobile. He gave him instructions to gather and bring artillery and ammunition to Fort Montgomery and to ready his troops for war.","Information traveled slowly and irregularly on the frontier, especially on one like Florida's, which had no major newspapers or trade routes. Even so, news on the edge of United States territory typically traveled faster and more reliably by word of mouth and personal letters than it did in newspapers. This imperfect and slow communication system, while frustrating in peacetime, often proved fatal in times of war.","General Jackson, and General Gaines before him, made decisions during the First Seminole War based on imperfect and out-of-date information. Although some Indians in Alabama may have murdered a few whites there, and although Indians may have been gathering in Pensacola, it was by no means absolutely warranted for General Jackson to begin his build up of arms and preparation for war. Although Chief Neamathla of Fowl Town warned General Gaines in 1817 not to cross the Flint River and that the Seminoles would meet such actions with an appropriate response, he had also sent a letter via Major Twiggs to D.B.

She claimed to have knowledge of the whereabouts of Peter McQueen, an Indian prophet whom the United States Army had been pursuing for some time. General Jackson had recently just narrowly missed capturing his at Natural Bridge. As per his quick temper, the general was enraged. This Seminole woman presumably heard through word of mouth-there were some Indians serving under General Jackson's command-about his near miss. She offered to turn McQueen over to the United States in return for General Jackson to allow her people to be transported to the land of the upper Creeks, with sufficient provisions to tide them over until they could establish themselves agriculturally. In his furor, Jackson readily agreed to this pact, and she departed with a letter to the commanding officer of Fort St. Marks detailing the agreement. This was, however, the last recorded sighting of her. She never upheld her end of the bargain, nor did she seek further assistance from General Jackson in the relocation of her people. McQueen was, indeed, never captured.","The Seminoles, including the unnamed woman, were directly related to the Creeks. They were in fact originally members of the Creek confederacy in Alabama and Georgia. They migrated to Florida, however, in three distinct phases. In the first half of the eighteenth century, they executed small invasions of Spanish territory, but with the intent to raid white villages, rather than to establish settlements of their own. In the second half of the century, they began establishing villages; by 1812, the Seminoles inhabited at least six towns in Spanish Florida. From 1812 to 1820, the political and cultural tensions in Georgia and Alabama led many Creeks to move to Florida and join the Seminoles already living there. So when the Seminole woman asked General Jackson to help her people move back to the upper Creek nation, she was not asking for him to help her people invade another tribe's land. She was just asking to go home.","This incident is also a clear indication of the growing power of Seminole women. From 1812 to 1820, they experienced a significant increase in their ability to exist formally outside of the household. With the migration of Seminoles to Florida, they came increasingly into contact with whites, allowing them to enter into small trade with them. These agricultural business transactions-primarily involving Seminole women growing and selling oranges, melons, corn, rice, and peaches to whites-greatly increased the political legitimacy of these women, thereby giving the unnamed woman the authority to strike her deal with a general in the United States Army."],"display_date":"April 18, 1818","search_date":"1818-04-18","locations":[{"id":1280,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2332,"title":"Spanish Duplicity Exposed at Fort St. Marks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1818-05-01","end_date":"1818-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Fort St. Marks was a Spanish-occupied fort in Florida, but by early May of 1818, the Spanish were, in the opinion of United States General Andrew Jackson, rapidly losing their ability to control it and, as a result, it was vulnerable to changing hands to the Seminoles'. As the end of the First Seminole War was in sight, this was not something General Jackson could allow to happen. So he approached the commander of Fort St. Marks and asked for his surrender to the United States instead of passing the fort on to Seminole control at the end of the war. Despite extensive negotiations, the Spanish commander decided to turn the fort over to the Indians, much to General Jackson's dismay. He refused to passively accept this outcome, however, and invaded the fort, replacing the Spanish flag with that of the United States without any resistance from the Spaniards. ","Part of General Jackson's animosity and distrust towards the Spanish was proven by the discovery of documents in the fort that detailed the transfer of arms and ammunition to the Seminoles. It was these arms that were used against his soldiers and the citizens of his country. The alliance between the Spanish and the Florida Seminoles was no secret, but the capture of Fort St. Marks provided concrete evidence as to this alliance. In addition to these documents, the American troops also found evidence that the Indians had been in the fort and that the chief of the Seminoles had met with the Spanish leaders in the private quarters of the commanding officer of the fort. There were goods clearly received via trade with the Seminoles stockpiled, including some that the Indians had stolen from American settlers. General Jackson subsequently blamed the Spanish for perpetuating the conflict between the Americans and the Indians in Florida. ","Prior to this discovery, however, both the Spanish and the United States maintained a public facade of being in a war together against the Seminoles, and the Spanish commanders in Florida denied giving any aid to the Seminoles in letter correspondence with American officers. In reality, the Seminoles had been allied with the Spanish since 1812, when the Spanish governor sent messages to the Seminole chiefs claiming that the United States would commandeer their land if they allied with it. He also offered a 1,000 reward for the scalp of John McIntosh, an Indian officer in the United States Army, and a 10 reward for one of any other United States-allied soldier or Indian."],"display_date":"May 1, 1818 - May 30, 1818","search_date":"1818-05-15","locations":[{"id":1280,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2333,"title":"A Defense of General Jackson&#39;s Invasion of Pensacola\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-04-19","end_date":"1819-04-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Upon hearing rumors that the Seminoles were gathering en masse in Pensacola, Florida, General Andrew Jackson and his army invaded and took control of the town, dispersing the Seminole gathering in the process. After the war, General Jackson faced much criticism for his actions in the war, both in the press and in a formal investigation conducted by the Senate; his seizure of Pensacola was not exempt from examination and criticism. ","In the face of this firestorm of words, <em>The Times</em> published an article from the National Intelligencer defending General Jackson's actions. This article, the goal of which was to explain General Jackson's logic in deciding to attack Pensacola to the public, was rife with what today would be understood as racist attitudes. If it [the seizure and occupation of Pensacola] saved the life of a single frontier settler, it was right. At the time, however, these attitudes represented one side of the norm. Indians were killing whites. Indians were in possession of valuable land. Indeed, it was their own economic prosperity in their trade with the British that attracted the attention and ultimate envy of the United States. Given these two facts, many Americans believed the U.S. Government had every right to relocate them to the west.","The other side of this debate, which emerged about a decade later during the firestorm surrounding the passage and implementation of the Indian Removal Act, was adamantly opposed to the removal of the Indians, regardless of the rationale behind it.

On that day, the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em> ran an article detailing the preparations of Colonel Theodore Roosevelt's First Volunteer Regiment of Cavalry, formerly known as Teddy's Terrors, which would move out to Cuba later that week. There had been a delay in the organization of a third squadron as two hundred Indian Territory troops were late in arriving, but were expected to come the following day. Colonel Roosevelt was working with the troops and expressed his expectations that the troops would see victory in Cuba. Citizens had welcomed Roosevelt to the camp the night before by serenading him and he received cheers from camp visitors. With their successful training and the support of civilians as well as the government, Roosevelt and his Rough Riders would soon be ready to take on their assignment and leave their mark on the Spanish-American War.","The Spanish-American War, which took place in 1898 in an effort to free Cuba from Spanish rule, created a need in the U.S. government for more troops to supplement state militia in the overseas battle. A federal law passed in April created three regiments of volunteers in the western territories and states; President William McKinley was given the duty of selecting the commanding officers. The regiment which would go on to win the most fame, the First United States Volunteer Cavalry, was that led by Lt. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt. Though the group, which was affectionately known as Teddy's Terrors and the Rough Riders, had a high concentration of westerners including outlaws and cowboys, it also had a large contingency of wealthy easterners and even Ivy League students.","The regiment was the first to land in Cuba, pushing back the Spanish forces, charging Kettle Hill and marching on Santiago de Cuba.

She left her two daughters at home in Knoxville, Illinois, and for over a year helped the wounded at war directly on the battlefield. "," Mrs. Holstead tended to Union soldiers in hospitals and tented fields. During an evacuation provoked by the confederates in Corinth, Mississippi, she paused during all the chaos to stop and care for the wounded during the battle. As a result she had to travel alone by horseback through Tennessee day and night, in the opposing rival's territory using an article of clothing for a pillow to sleep outside at night."," In the next six months after her adventure she served as the matron for the hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. Because of her firsthand experience on the front, she moved to the general hospital in Franklin, Tennessee, thinking she could be of more use in a place few women would wish to occupy.

Just in New York City, April 25, 1861, several prominent women already collected to start the Women's Central Relief Association. They planned the distribution of medical and other supplies to soldiers in camps and battlefields. Some also worked to improve the government's transportation system of the sick and wounded soldiers. Historian Katie Ross argues that many times the sick and wounded lay unattended and often unprotected for days on the battlefield or river's edge waiting for transportation down the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers to hospitals along the Ohio.

During that time Elizabeth wrote to him frequently describing the state of health of their family and the state of the town of Nashville, Tennessee. She very much wanted to visit him and worried about his health."," As Elizabeth waited on the homefront she faced Union suppression of her own. Union troops occupied Nashville arresting prominent men and confiscating property. They insisted the Nashville locals take oaths of allegiance to the United States and have a pass in order to cross in and out of the city. Union officials would not permit some of Elizabeth's neighbors to return to Nashville after their refusal to take oath. "," Disbelieving their warnings, Elizabeth eventually encountered the border control personally upon returning home one day with her children.

She firmly responded I have most decidedly adding that her reasons were numerous, and insuperable and her pass was legitimate because it had been issued just a few days before. The officer insisted that he had been under orders to let no one pass through who did not take oath. Eventually Elizabeth and her carriage driver weakened the officer's obstinacy until he compromised to grant her admittance if she and her children promised to give their word not to give any information (that might be detrimental to the Union) to any Confederate Cavalry that may visit her house within the next day.

Catherine Clinton and Nina Silber argue that feisty confederate women no longer saw themselves as passive victims, and however unrealistic their fantasies of resistance, they had begun to form new expectations for themselves, while maintaining traditional expectations of their menfolk. The men left the women to represent their strong sentiments while they were away. Their husbands risked their lives fighting for their important ideals, so it was the least a woman could do to vocally support them. Letting down their resistance meant letting down their husbands and families, as well as their town. In Elizabeth's case, she was with her children and needed to go home.

The water level of the river and the crowds of people made it difficult to cross.

Once involved in the conflict, Texas found herself up against Santa Anna's powerful army and not faring well. After the fall of the Alamo, Houston feared the worst for Texans and wanted them out of the way of the Mexican army.

The Runaway Scrape was fraught with fear and danger and became a defining event in the history of Texas.

Bell, whose motto the paper printed as <em>the Constitution must be maintained, the Union must be preserved, and the Laws must be enforced in all their integrity</em>, represented old Whigs of the South in the new Constitutional Union Party.  While the scope of the ensuing war that resulted during Lincoln's presidency was far greater than most could have anticipated, this last appeal to North Carolinian voters forebodingly warns of rupture that would lead to the now smiling fields barrowed by cannon balls, and manured with human blood and bones. The article considered that disunion for the current justifications would be modern humanity's greatest sin second only to the biblical original sin.  ","      The paper, eerily anticipating the prospect for Lincoln's victory in the election, made considerable effort to prepare its readers for the event of a Republican president.  An analogy to card games was made, such that if one begins a hand of cards and then finds the hand gone against him, he cannot honorably disengage but must respect his commitment to the other players and play it through.  Similarly, the article warned that North Carolinians must be willing to accept a Lincoln election just as they would expect Northerners to accept Bell's election.  This gesture of logic is considerable, as Lincoln did not even appear on North Carolinian ballots.  Furthermore, the article purported that factional grievances will be better resolved through Constitutional outlets than through disunion.  Finally, the article offered an assurance against disunion: millions of dollars of southern debt to northern creditors.  The pressures which manufacturers would bring to bear on Lincoln to maintain union, it was suggested, would suffice to dissuade the North from precipitating war.","Powerful forces lurked behind the political debates which confronted readers in North Carolina's Piedmont.

The case stated that in St. Louis, Missouri in January 1862, the defendant had trespassed on the property of the plaintiff while the defendant was a soldier in the Union Army during the Civil War. Though the plaintiff sought damages for the trespassing, the defendant claimed that he was protected under Section 4, Article 11 of the Constitution of the State of Missouri. According to court documents, Section 4 of the Missouri Constitution exempts persons from liability for acts done during the recent civil war, by virtue of the military authority vested in them by the government of the United States, or in the pursuance of an order received from any person vested with such authority, is valid, and protects from prosecution or actions for all who can show for their acts the authorization of a military officer, acting under the command-in-chief of the army of the United States. The defendant claimed that at the time of the trespass a state of civil war existed, martial law had been declared, and his actions were assessments of orders given by the general of the army of the United States who was in charge of Missouri. Finally, the defendant insisted that he was under the protection of the Act of Congress of 1863 which instituted a two year limitation clause on cases arising from the Civil War. The opinion of the court, written by Justice Miller, stated that the defendant was indeed a Union soldier and would be protected under law as such. In regard to the Act of Congress of 1863 which set the two year limitation, the court stated that it cannot be assumed that Acts of Congress only apply to the federal courts. Its final ruling decreed that all cases involving the legitimacy of the limitations placed on such cases by Acts of Congress be decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. "," In 1861 and 1862, the United States Congress and President Lincoln instituted the First and Second Confiscation Acts. The First Confiscation Act stated that while there was a state of insurgency against the United States, Union soldiers were allowed to seize property of known Confederates.

The Second Confiscation Act was one of the first enforcements of emancipating slaves as it said that any Confederate who did not surrender within 60 days would be punished by having his slaves freed by Union forces.

Two weeks later, the paper ran Governor Fitzhugh Lee's follow-up announcement that concurred with the President's request. Lee told the families in Virginia to render thanks to Almighty God. The paper dedicated two lines to the abundance of partridges, pheasants, and wild turkies in the markets. The paper of the 27th provided an analysis of the holiday and its effect on game. The article praised the idea of the holiday and its success, but it reminded the readers that the North initiated this custom and It is hard for an innovation to take root among the old established social customs of the South.... The article also promised that the holiday would not subtract from the Christmas holiday because people gave thanks for daily blessings at Thanksgiving and thanked God for the Saviour at Christmas. With that problem settled, the opposing page reminded readers that they killed many turkeys so that they could celebrate that day. "," This national Thanksgiving caused quite a stir for this small newspaper to dedicate so much space to the holiday. Normally, the paper ran stories written by the students and multiple observations about the weather and the students' health in each issue. Also by mid-November, the paper had a countdown to Christmas and a reminder to parents that students could not go home for the holiday. "," Grover Cleveland won the Republican White House for the Democrats in 1884 and 1892. The American South explains that during Cleveland's presidency, his job included keeping the country united, especially because the Republicans and Democrats seemed to be at odds more so than normal. In addition, the pain of the Civil War remained strong in people's hearts. One way to unite everyone without politics was the reaffirmation of Thanksgiving Day's place in America. This way, the people could view Cleveland as a president who cared for his citizens and the union of the country. He also affirmed Christian ideas in the nation. He could try to win over votes by reinstituting a holiday that people enjoyed and boosting the economy through turkey sales.

For example, there was a law that stated that for each twenty slaves a man owned one man from his home would be excused from fighting. Rich men were also able to buy others to substitute their spot in the troops. There were also heavy taxes on farms, even on farmers who had little to spare.

Reporting an estimated 605,919 tons in 1899, pig iron movement in the South increased approximately seven fold from the preceding year's 83,821-ton figure.  The Wall Street Journal noted, of this the Birmingham district shipped considerably over half.  The Birmingham district was also responsible for the shipment of two-fifths of the total cast iron produced in the South in addition to exporting 50 percent of all southern pig iron.  With the increase in domestic prices of iron, this figure confirmed Birmingham as a fixture in the European iron trade.  Breaking all records in movement, shipment, and exporting, the Wall Street Journal's figures proved Birmingham vital in the southern industrial boom.  ","    Birmingham's industry was initially stimulated by the Civil War and the Confederacy's need for raw materials, namely, iron.  Alabama had seven blast furnaces in 1861 and this number increased to sixteen by 1865.  Ironically, though the Confederacy initially fueled the Alabama iron industry, the devastating effects of war temporarily halted industrial progress.  The iron furnaces were destroyed during the course of the war.  Additionally, the aftermath of the war disrupted transportation of iron via southern railways.  Despite these setbacks, Alabama was determined to rebuild their iron industry.  In a series of investments and technological development as well as the juxtaposition of iron, coal and limestone markets in Alabama, the Birmingham industrialization was well under way by the early 1870s.  According to C. Vann Woodward in his Origins of the New South, by 1899 Alabama's iron production was over ten times her tonnage of 1880.  This production was more than twice the combined production of her nearest rivals, Tennessee and Virginia and more than all the other southern states combined.  By 1890 northern capital flooded the state to finance industry and a generous supply of labor worked the mines.  The labor supply was overwhelmingly black, constituting 46.2 percent of the labor force, in addition to a high proportion of Alabama's well-received immigrants.  ","The growth of the iron and coal industry in Alabama was largely facilitated by the extensive rail system planted throughout the state.  The great empire builder of the Alabama mineral belt was the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, according to Woodward.  The L and N laid approximately half a million acres of land in Central Alabama by 1876 connecting Birmingham to all the major iron and coal towns in the region.  The L and N was also responsible for gathering investments of more than 30,000,000 and attracting immigrants to work the mines.  In 1888 the railroads transported a tonnage of pig iron exceeding the average annual weight of the entire national cotton crop for the past fifteen years.  With the railway system of Alabama firmly implanted by the early 1880s the state was able to fully engage in an industrial revolution."],"display_date":"June 29, 1899","search_date":"1899-06-29","locations":[{"id":304,"lat":32.2202206971,"lng":-86.2076124057,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2537,"title":"General Early Protects Augusta County, Virginia&#39;s Economy","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-11-12","end_date":"1864-11-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During 1864, General Jubal Anderson Early commanded the Confederate Army in its last invasions of the North. Early routed almost two-thirds of Sheridan's forces at the Battle of Cedar Creek (October 19, 1864), but Sheridan's forces quickly rallied to defeat Early in a decisive victory there, leaving the remaining troops hungry and exhausted. After the defeat, most of Early's troops would rejoin Lee at Petersburg in December. Between those two events, General Early issued a broadside to troops, detailing expected actions in the counties of Augusta and Rockbridge. Even though his troops were severely undersupplied, General Early demanded that wheat and corn were not to be impressed from Augusta County. If corn was acquired, a proper receipt would provide documentation to ensure that nothing was impressed. Augusta County's economy was based on agriculture, and had these crops been used for Confederate soldiers, financial hardship for the county would have been even larger than it already was.","This broadside depicts an important relationship between the land of individual counties and the Confederate Army. Many citizens had grown angry with the Confederate government because of the infractions on their individual property. Civilians considered impressments an invasion of their individual rights, as well as a hypocritical function of a government that advocated states' rights. Despite the overwhelming need of General Early to acquire resources for his troops, he ordered that none of Augusta's supplies be impressed. General Early commanded his troops at a time where Confederate citizens saw slim chances of the Civil War resolving in their favor.","David Donald, Jean Baker, and Michael Holt confirm the need for the Confederate Army to issue commands such as this broadside in late 1864. Yielding supplies to troops, while suffering economic setbacks, further frustrated Souther supporters of the war. Since citizens felt that their personal liberties were violated, they took it upon themselves not to honor the prohibitions on trading with the enemy. The lack of economic support of the Confederate Army, as well as the lack of moral support from the citizens, because of impressments, created a situation that increasingly threatened Confederate ability to wage war.

The Union troops arrived at her home and stole guns, clothing, bonds, and the watches from two slaves, Sue and Mammy E. Louisa was so alarmed at their behavior that she was afraid for her safety. She found Union officers who protected her, but the threat of violence from Union soldiers was real. Louisa Minor experienced fear that day felt all over the South as Union and Confederate troops passed through widespread communities. Like others, Louisa Minor remained defiant.","The destructive force the war had for civilians surfaced as early as in Fredericksburg, Virginia between December 11 and 15 1862. Fredericksburg had been occupied by Confederate sharpshooters slowing the Union advance, so the Union troops probably felt justified in their action. Looting in the town occurred to a severe degree as the entire contents of houses was thrown into the street. The greatest loss felt by southern women like Louisa Minor was the loss of loved ones on the battlefield. Among Virginians alone, 20-30,000 men died in the war, while by 1862 alone there were 42,000 claims for back-pay by families of deceased soldiers. The suffering and fear felt by Louisa Minor and her family in Albemarle County was just a small part of the broader suffering the war brought to American civilians.","Louisa Minor's personal humiliation at the hands of Union troops repeated itself all across the Confederacy, as the movements of Union and Confederate armies initiated destruction of civilian property from Virginia to Louisiana. In Virginia, Gen. Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley campaign of 1864 devastated that area's ability to provide food for the Confederacy. Sheridan waged war on the ability of the Confederate population to resist, a method emulated all over the Confederacy by Union forces. Significant resistance by Confederate guerillas forced Sheridan to be even more extreme. Between late September and late October 1864 Sheridan systematically destroyed the Shenandoah Valley's ability to feed Confederate troops. Far from Virginia Benjamin Butler brought the war to the doorstep of Confederate civilians early in the Civil War by confiscating private property in New Orleans after the Union took that city in 1862. Maj. Gen. James H. Wilson's offensive into northern Alabama in 1864 was actually more severe than Sherman's in Georgia though it achieved less renown. Confederate units and deserters from both sides also inflicted severe hardship on the Confederate civilian population. When Louisa Minor's property was taken from her in early 1865, she became one more of the many thousands like her who had experienced the full destructive force of the Civil War.

The Union soldiers had confiscated or destroyed much of the plantation owners' valuable property, and without property or the system of slavery that had sustained the South for so many generations, the agricultural economy plummeted and became extremely vulnerable to carpetbaggers and scalawags. Those southerners who had held jobs in the political or other public sphere found themselves replaced by Yankees or Yankee sympathizers. Many once-affluent whites quickly grew frustrated with their forced dependence on the Yankees - for whom they had nothing but contempt and hatred - and the sense of desperation and hopelessness that pervaded the defeated South. Horace Buckner, the young son of a white Louisa County, Virginia planter, traveled throughout the South in the midst of Reconstruction and expressed his horror at the devastation wreaked upon the entire region. Writing his father in Louisa from Mobile, Alabama, in 1867, Horace expressed woe for both himself and the other southerners he observed. As a public school teacher, he worried that although I employed a competent teacher to serve in my absence with the consent of the board...if they are changed, which I think is very probable, I may lose my position. The military authority, which controls this state, seems determined to throw out every Southerner who has any public office and put Yankees in their places. Within the last week, they have removed the entire city government and replaced then with notorious Yankee sympathizers. ","He expounded upon the hopeless conditions in Mobile, writing times are very hard in this city. There is nothing doing. Money can hardly be obtained at all. The clerks in the stores are idle more than half the time. Hundreds are out of employment and are willing to work for almost nothing. He also worried that the registration of blacks to vote will distract them from agricultural work, and that the depressed economy in the South would discourage foreign capital from the region in the future.","After describing these conditions to his father, he proposed a rather radical solution for his own situation and asked his father's advice and counsel. Rather than stay in the ruined South and attempt to rebuild his life under Yankee rule, Buckner considered the idea of emigration out of the United States. During this period, a small number of southerners chose to leave the country rather than live in defeat. A good many seem to be immigrating to Brazil, Buckner writes. They all seem to be well-pleased with the country. I received a letter from a friend of mine out there, urging me to come out, promising me a good and easy situation among a flourishing colony of Southerners. Buckner's friend had promised him a job and a salary equivalent to 1,200 greenbacks and a place in a community of relocated southerners along the Amazon. In fact, over nine thousand southerners did end up relocating in Brazil. John Lowe, in his article Reconstruction Revisited: Plantation School Writers, Postcolonial Theory, and Confederates in Brazil in the Mississippi Quarterly, discusses this phenomenon. Lowe writes that even before the war, Brazil held appeal to many southerners for its perceived similarities to the American South: namely, an institutionalized system of slavery, warm, agriculture-friendly climate, and the nation's later sympathy to the confederate cause at the outset of the Civil War.","Buckner did not end up leaving the country, but instead spent many years traveling through the South and West, never truly settling into a permanent home. However, the fact that he considered - and other southerners actually went through with - leaving the country completely for a land as foreign as Brazil demonstrates the level of disenchantment and frustration felt by white southerners during Reconstruction. In the book Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction, James M. McPherson wrote extensively about the tensions in the postwar South between Northern and Southern whites. He concludes that most often, Southerners' pent-up rage could not be taken out on the Yankee soldiers themselves, and thus Southern white Unionists, or the notorious Yankee sympathizers, about whom Buckner writes, as well as free blacks, absorb the brunt of Southern anger. McPherson also details the corruption and exploitation of many Yankee officials. The federal government instated a cotton tax of 2.5 cents per pound, which was not revoked until 1868. Often, Yankees sent to collect cotton from Southern farmers for distribution throughout the Union instead simply stole it and sold it for their own profit - or accepted substantial bribes from southern planters not to do so.

W.D. Cabell, a graduate of the University of Virginia and principal of the Norwood High School in Nelson County, Virginia, was just such a man. In his journal he often pondered the effect his own life would have on those around him, and beseeched the Lord for help in doing good works. In 1867, Cabell decided to use his position as principal of Norwood High School to help those he saw as most in need: disabled ex-Confederate soldiers. The normal tuition for one semester at his school came to 150; he offered 12 spots at half price for those who met the following conditions:","I. Satisfactory evidence that he is unable to meet the expense of a full academic course,","II. That he was disabled in the discharge of his duty as a Southern soldier,","III. The he will, when his course is completed, engage in the cause of education as a teacher, and give to some poor, honest boy an equivalent for the advantages now offered to him,","IV. That if this is impracticable, he will, as soon as he is able, pay the balance of the regular rates of the school, but without interest.","Cabell identifies himself as thoroughly and permanently identified with the cause of southern education, and as such takes it upon himself to make his charitable offer only to those that are held in high esteem by the fallen southern aristocracy, such as ex-Confederate soldiers. He contends that I confine this offer to no particular state or locality, and in discriminating between applicants will decide (other things equal) in favor of the most unfortunate. He does not, however, extend this offer to other destitute southern citizens, such as newly freed blacks, and thus still reflects the limited moral attitudes of his time. ","According to Fred Arthur Bailey, author of Free Speech and the Lost Cause in the Old Dominion, Southern teachers after the Civil War attempted to inject the Lost Cause mentality into school curricula within the entire South, including Virginia. Once established as the arbiters of Southern thought, Bailey asserts, they expunged offending works from schools and libraries, silenced dissident teachers, and indoctrinated Southern children with antebellum aristocratic social values. The ideas of the Lost Cause range from old southern ideas of chivalry and honor to race and gender relations and roles within society. Also, an integral part of the Lost Cause idea was the portrayal of the South as a valiant yet defeated region now forced to live under corrupt Yankee rule, whose ideals and social mores must not be lost in favor of northern values. Although the specific curriculum from the Norwood School is not available, it's very possible that Cabell fit this description to some degree. He obviously sympathized greatly the Confederacy, and was a self-proclaimed champion of Southern Education.

Macon was also quick to state that he later served in combat with this unit during the war between the states.Serving in such a unit was special to Macon because it was a clear act of serving his community. Not only did he drill to protect his home, but the men on either side of him were his friends and neighbors, prepared to make the same sacrifice alongside him.  His service in this unit made him an object of admiration and pride in the community, the concept of a noble southern gentleman defending his city.  However, Macon's youthful enthusiasm was most certainly curtailed when he experienced the harsh reality of the Civil War battlefield, where the pageantry and glory of parades through downtown Richmond would be replaced by the acrid smell of cordite and the cries of the dying. ","In the 1850s, with the memory of British tyranny not far from the minds of many Americans, there was still a great deal of wariness in regards to the idea of a standing federal army and professional military leadership.  Beginning in 1792,Congress began requiring able bodied men to serve in local militia units.  In 1808, the law provided that authority over these units fell to the state governor rather than the federal government, a forerunner of the modern National Guard.  With distrust of federal forces being particularly prevalent in the South, militias such as the Public Guard in Richmond were formed to provide local communities with some military muscle.  These militias provided well armed and well-disciplined units that could provide security in times of unrest, as well as acting as a type of police force.  While few, if any southerners would explicitly say so, these units also gave southerners peace of mind in the sense that any slave revolt would be met by a rapid and lethal response from local units who would not be subject to bureaucratic or political red tape as federal troops would be.","    This idea of military self sufficiency also led to a new martial state of mind in the southern gentry, whereby they stoked the idea of their ancestors being dashing Cavaliers, fighting across the plains of England during its Civil War in defense of their ideals.  This martial spirit also led to the foundation of numerous Southern military schools such as the Citadel in South Carolina and the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia."],"display_date":1859,"search_date":"1859-07-02","locations":[{"id":14218,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2583,"title":"The Gruesome History of a Wartime Steamboat\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1864-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The Civil War diary of John L.

Thomas McKee was an official in the Charlottesville school district in 1874. McKee handled funding both for the district's African American school and for the white school. He was puzzled to discover that the African American school received less funding in 1874 than its number of students was supposed to receive. McKee wrote D.P Powers, the local Superintendent of Schools explaining the discrepancy, reminding the Superintendent that the district's white school which had a smaller enrollment, experienced no such funding shortfall. At the end of the letter, McKee humbly deferred to the judgment of the Superintendent, perhaps because he knew further agitation would not help and might hurt the black school's budget. Virginia was redeemed by the white supremacist Democratic Party in 1873, the year before the funding disparity. Assuming that the funding shortfall stemmed from the race of the black students because McKee did not press the issue, he uncovered a form of discrimination which became increasingly common as Reconstruction ended. Though McKee may have been dedicated to providing the public schools, black and white, with their necessary funding, somehow a black school under his charge did not receive the funding it needed. ","Many white southerners in the wake of the Civil War continued to believe that African Americans were beneath them in the social hierarchy. In addition, fear of African Americans taking revenge on white southerners for slavery spurred the creation of Black Codes by short-lived provisional governments dominated by southern whites, which heavily regulated African Americans daily activities. The Fourteenth Amendment ended many of the Black Codes, but not the racism that created them. Thus fear of African Americans led to a need to subjugate them, and even while under the military governors' installed during Reconstruction, white southerners kept these intentions in mind. They argued that blacks lacked the education to be responsible voters, and did everything in their power to keep African Americans from gaining such an education. ","However, the Fourteenth Amendment required equal treatment under the law, so rather than eliminate education for African Americans white southerners undermined it, such as in cases like A. Thomas McKee's in Charlottesville. The southern state legislatures gained substantial black membership once black voters were protected by U.S. troops from intimidation. These more liberal legislatures spread public education throughout the South. Schools were segregated, but blacks increasingly accepted half-way measures such as these over nothing at all. Even Frederick Douglass believed that segregated education was the best that southern blacks could hope for. Nonetheless, freed slaves had an extraordinary desire to seek education, because they knew this was the best route out of the poverty and ignorance in which they were taken advantage of by whites. ","Southern white racism stymied these efforts however, because as Reconstruction ended southern whites gained control over the funding of black public schools. They saw education as a threat to keeping blacks subordinate to whites in society, as educated blacks would be more likely to seek better wages and working conditions. The Ku Klux Klan expressed the most violent form of this white prejudice, terrorizing the black community if members tried to improve their lives. The Klan even committed murder in order to maintain white supremacy. ","The Compromise of 1877 officially ended Reconstruction, as Pres. Rutherford Hayes withdrew all remaining Federal troops from the states of the former Confederacy, which took away the last glimmer of protection enjoyed by blacks. A. Thomas McKee's experience was important because it demonstratedone small part of atrend typical across the South as Reconstruction came to a close, the increasingly blatant campaign of white southerners to subordinate blacks to whites in society. Education played a key role because just as freed slaves understood that it was their best route out of poverty and ignorance, so too did white southerners, who consequently did everything in their power to undermine black education.

It detailed the departure by rail of elements of Richmond's volunteer militia regiment, men who were being sent to suppress the insurrection that was taking place. The readers were also stunned to read that the governor of Virginia had ordered the men to Harpers Ferry himself; they were not called up by the federal government, which had already dispatched its own troops, US Marines under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee.  Furthermore, Governor Henry Wise accompanied the vanguard units on a commandeered mail train to the scene of the action, with the remaining companies of the militia to be sent the next morning when more trains would be available. The citizens of Richmond could only guess how tumultuous the situation was if their own governor was personally leading the military effort. The bulk of the passage detailed the sad sight of the departing troops.  It described legions of young men and boys going off to fight in the war, not knowing if they would return in good health, or at all.","This editorial is interesting because on the one hand, it demonstrates the capabilities of the state run militia.  Governor Wise was able to call up and deploy the men in order to deal with a situation in his state without any input from the federal government. However, the true importance of this editorial lies in the southern perception of the events surrounding the Harpers Ferry raid.  The wording and tone of this passage made it very clear that people saw this event as a grave threat to state stability and peace.  One also gets the sense that there was a widespread belief that there was a major battle occurring in Harpers Ferry. There is no doubt that much of this misconception was due to the slow travel of news; the common citizens in Richmond would have no way of knowing that Brown only commanded 18 men, half of whom were dead by this time. However, even if they had known this, the principal behind this raid was what disturbed so many southerners.

Eugene Davis was one such prisoner of war at Elmira Military Prison in 1864. The two most infamous Civil War prisons opened that year in Andersonville, Georgiaand at Elmira, New York. After he arrived in Elmira, Davis wrote to his family in Albemarle County, who promptly wrote him back. He received letters from three different relatives in one day. Davis explained that he lived in a building with 150 other Confederates. He had a cold before he wrote the letter, but recovered from it. Davis also mentioned both the number of times per day guards fed prisoners at Elmira and how the entire camp went to the same building to procure rations every day. Eugene Davis expressed great confidence that he would survive the prison camp, and hoped for more letters from his family. ","Prisoners of war suffered enormously in 1864 and 1865 in both the Union and the Confederacy. Union soldiers in Andersonville Prison suffered from exposure because of lack of shelter, dysentery and diarrhea due to poor diet, and sometimes death because of the lack of medical care. The Confederacy suffered in large measure because of the lack of a clear chain of command over the Confederate prison system in general, and inefficient command structure at Andersonville. Georgia officials made matters worse by repeatedly refusing to cooperate in the supply of lumber, regular guards, slave labor, cattle drivers, and tents to the prison. Andersonville had an intended capacity of 10,000. By May 1864, it was 50 percent over capacity. By mid June the prison contained 24,000 Union prisoners. In a pattern to be repeated in both Union and Confederate prisons, as the prison population grew, food and other supplies did not keep up and deteriorated to extremes. In addition the Confederate government gradually became totally negligent towards the prisoners at Andersonville, while more than willing to continue to send prisoners there over the protests of the administrators of the camp. Henry Wirz and John H. Winder, two of the officers in charge, could not keep up with the tide of incoming Union prisoners during the summer of 1864. The situation at Andersonville reached a tipping point on July 25 1864 when more than 30,000 prisoners were present at the camp with no rations to feed them. Confederate Secretary of War James Seddon and others only changed the situation when Sherman's Union armies drew close to Andersonville that fall. Ten thousand of the Andersonville prisoners were shipped to Salisbury, North Carolina by October 1864. Just four months later, due to further Confederate neglect, 34 percent of these men had died. ","Confederate prisoners of war at Elmira suffered many of the same troubles as Andersonville prisoners. Despite the economic advantages of the Union over the Confederacy, lack of food in sufficient quality and quantity to keep prisoners healthy was a problem. This suggests that like in the Confederacy, maltreatment of prisoners was not a result of inability to help them but of unwillingness by individuals in the Union prison system. As at Andersonville, as the prisoner population of Elmira increased, the food problem worsened. Eugene Davis wrote in his letter of the many thousands of men in Elmira who all had to use the same cook-house. Scurvy emerged due to poor diet, just as at Confederate prison camps. Both Elmira and Andersonville had no hospital to care for the sick for much of their operation. Andersonville was closed in the early fall of 1864, but Elmira remained open, and bore witness to even greater suffering by prisoners in 1865. A new enemy attacked Confederate prisoners in Elmira in the winter of 1864-1865, New York's cold weather. Confederates found it especially difficult to deal with because stoves were scarce. In February 1865, 426 Confederates died at Elmira about a third of all the sick. Though Andersonville may be more famous as a place of misery for prisoners of war, Elmira actually had a higher mortality rate, 24 percent, or 3,000 out of 12,000 total prisoners. Eugene Davis' letter to his daughter is very significant to understanding the lives of prisoners of war. He wrote of the hardships of camp life, of his desire to hear from his family, and his yearning to think of his home, not his prison. The suffering and uncertainty felt by Eugene Davis' family while he was a prisoner of war repeated itself in counties all over Virginia and all over the South, as Confederate soldiers tried to survive the war in prisoner of war camps.

The Governor appointed him Colonel of the Virginia Volunteers; he was honored to hold such an independent position but warned Mary Anna, whom he affectionately called little one, that they would probably not be able to correspond for quite some time. By his faith in God, he asked her not to worry, that he would be protected until he could meet with her again. "," The Civil War certainly took its toll on every family during the war. Four out of every five southern men left their homes and family to fight for the Confederate cause. Families were torn apart and more often than not, because of death, not able to be put back together. "," Most Confederate men joined the army to protect their lifestyles - their families and their land. They wanted to protect their liberty and their homes from attack. However, as the war progressed, many men felt that they would be almost better served at their homes, protecting one piece at a time. By 1864, Union armies occupied every Southern state and they began taking over. Desertion by Confederate soldiers resulted because they feared so much for their family's safety. In William Cooper's The American South, he quotes a desperate wife's forceful case saying there is no use in keeping a man thare to kill him and leave widows and poore little orphen children to suffer... My poor children have no home nor no Father. Many men, while dedicated to the cause, still abandoned their ranks. Their duty was most importantly to the families they were fighting to protect. "," By the last winter of the war, thousands of soldiers had disappeared. Men such as Thomas Jackson remained dedicated to his service. He remained faithful to his Virginia Volunteers and said farewell to his wife for quite some time. As the war progressed morale decreased and the South could see their grips loosening and therefore, soldiers were not always as reliable."," Because so many Southern men left home to fight in the war, women were forced to become more self-sufficient and independent. They took on the duties their husbands and fathers once held. They managed farms and worked in factories. While this was a new opportunity for women, they were more concerned with surviving and their husbands returning home. When the war was over and the men returned, most women resumed their previous lifestyles, thankful that normalcy was beginning to return. "," Mary Anna had no assurance that she would ever see her husband again. Most women of the South did not. All they could do was have a little faith, stay busy, and pray for their men to come home.

Bolling's appointment shows that the military was prominent in state forms as well as national forms in the period leading up to the Civil War. Qualities of the military include fidelity, courage, activity and good conduct - qualities that are still valued in the military today. Bolling was selected as Lieutenant Colonel because of these qualities and his dedication to his country through prior military service. His appointment was a strong opinion on his character and loyalty. "," Previous military conflicts had left the United States with a stronger sense of having a military and how they should use one in wartime. The War of 1812 left the young country shocked that England would attack them again, but also proud that they had fended off the most powerful nation in the world. The 1815 Battle of New Orleans proved to be the major triumphant victory in the war that increased America's international influence. Despite the fact that the Treat of Ghent (1814) had ended the war, the Americans still legitimately beat the British in the War of 1812, a feat to be proud of because of the British's dominance in the military world. "," This war had left the country suspicious of more attacks from other invaders or powerful countries coming in to try to re-colonize America. Americans believed that other powerful European countries would come over to try to colonize America because of their immense natural resources and large amount of land. These suspicions led to the build up of the American military and Reserves, so that they would be ready just in case another country waged war against them again. The Reserves consisted of the national military and state militias; they were constantly trained and only used in case of an emergency. The military may not have been engaged in battle, but they would be ready if it came about again. An army was maintained in both the North and the South."," Virginia was especially known for its Navy because of the port of Norfolk in the Tidewater. Many wealthy planters and businessmen in Virginia had either served in the Navy or had a son who had. Military education became popular in the first decade of the nineteenth century; many wealthy planters either attended a military institute or sent their sons there to train for military service. The notions of honor and prestige mentioned in Bolling letter were major motives for wealthy planters joining the military. Holding a leadership role in the military was especially prestigious at this time period and many men of the upper class held these positions; men in leadership positions held large amounts of honor, but did not have engage in the actual fighting. "," William Bolling was part of the Commonwealth's military; this is evident in his appointment because he was appointed by the governor, a state official, rather than a national official. This shows that states were beginning to look at states' rights and hold pride in their state. Each state had their own militia to defend themselves against any other state. They brought their militias together in times of need to fight for the country. Each state was responsible of training and maintaining their militia.

It was visited three times by United States troops, the first time marking the first official engagement of the war. These skirmishes resulted in the deaths of three Seminoles, the capture of one, and the abandonment of the town.","Lieutenant Colonel Arbuckle led the second party to visit Fowl Town. As he and his soldiers neared the town, he ordered JNO. N. McIntosh to approach the village from a different route, with the secondary goal of taking as many prisoners as possible, provided the Indians did not resist or try to escape. If they did attempt to run or fight back, Lt. Col. Arbuckle ordered McIntosh to fire upon them. McIntosh did not expect to encounter resistance, but his hopes were quickly demolished, as he and his team were discovered within about 200 yards of the town. The Indians did not stand and fight, however. They merely fled, firing indiscriminately, and whooping as they abandoned their town to the more heavily armed white men. This left the path open for McIntosh's party to pursue their primary objective: the acquisition of provisions for Fort Scott in nearby Georgia. They searched the town, collecting as much corn as they could find, fifteen to eighteen cows, and a few horses before the Indians returned to attack the whites that were raiding their town. McIntosh's command suffered one casualty; the Seminoles later acknowledged losing five of six comrades. The Indians eventually retreated, leaving McIntosh free to continue raiding the town. They then journeyed the fifteen miles back to Fort Scott, pausing for a few days after about three miles to construct Fort Hughes, a small, advanced picket encampment that would be used later in the war.","Abner Lacock wrote a letter to McIntosh asking for a narration of his involvement in the Seminole War to serve as evidence in the Senate's investigation of General Andrew Jackson. McIntosh replied with a letter, later to be published in the <em>New-York Daily Advertiser</em>, which detailed his participation in the second raid of Fowl Town.","Chief Neamathla of Fowl Town, located directly across the Flint River from Fort Scott, told Colonel Edmund Gaines that if he crossed the Flint River, the residents of Fowl Town would react violently. On November 21, 1817, Col. Gaines disregarded this warning and attacked Fowl Town, killing five Indians. After Lt. Col. Arbuckle and McIntosh completed their raid of the town, Arbuckle returned once more and burned the now-abandoned town to the ground. Neamathla's Seminoles, predictably, reacted violently. In one attack, they jumped a United States boat on the Flint River, killing 37 soldiers, six women, and four children. These strikes prompted Secretary of War Calhoun to send General Jackson to Fort Scott to execute a war, with free rein, against the Indians.

Lee's surrender.Sharitt saw no way that his company's retreat into Texas would sustain the crumbling Confederacy, and he chose to aid hiswife and childreninstead."," Southerners were quickly losing hope for a victory in the later years of the war; many, like Sharitt, wanted an immediate cessation of fighting, even if it meant surrendering to the North.According to John B. Boles, the desire for survival was more important than the national cause of the Confederacy.As the Federal forces overran and decimated the Cotton South, many southern soldiers recognized the nearing defeat.Boles notes that the plummeting morale and the looming defeat led many southerners to desert the army.Joe Gray Taylor states that many Louisiana soldiers deserted the Confederate cause shortly after the Union army dominated southern strongholds.White southerners chose between protecting one's family at home or fighting in the Rebel army.Sharitt himself yearned for honor in warfare but recognized that his family's honor and livelihood were of supreme importance.","--J.R."],"display_date":"December 4, 1864 - December 31, 1865","search_date":"1865-06-18","locations":[{"id":5635,"lat":31.2197514707,"lng":-92.724986908,"zoom":8,"place":"RAPIDES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2719,"title":"The Post-War Union and Reflective Poetry\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-09-14","end_date":"1873-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" The famous poem by Francis Miles Finch entitled The Blue and the Grey commemorates soldiers who fought for both sides during the Civil War.<em>The Planters' Banner,</em> a local newspaper of Franklin, LA, published this poem on September 14, 1867.William T. Palfrey included the memorial poem in his plantation diary.The poem contrasts the North and the South, the robings of glory (the North) and the gloom of defeat (the South), and the dead and the living.Images of death and the grave beneath the sod and the dew run throughout.The poem also paints the vivid, gory picture of warfare, describing the flow of inland river where the iron fleets had once traversed and the grass beneath which soldiers lie in their graves.The rivers are no longer sullied by the red flow of soldiers' blood, and now flowers bloom around the scenes of battle.The poem shows life after war: it transitions from the gloom of defeat into a sunny spring day full of blossoms blossoming for all.While the seasons change and the weather varies, the Love and tears for the Blue, Tears and love for the Grey remain."," The poem memorializes the soldiers who fought and died for both sides; sentimental poems remember these fallen heroes.Yet, The Blue and the Grey challenges the pointlessness of the war itself, probing, Sadly, but no with upbraiding, The generous deed was done, In the storm of the years are fading, No braves battle was won.To Finch, little honor came from the Civil War, merely death for soldiers fighting for their causes.The poem paradoxically and simultaneously eulogizes and glorifies the Civil War in its pointless destruction and its grandiose battles. In memoriam of these soldiers of both the Union and Confederate armies, Finch paints a picture of common loss, equal splendor, and the remembrance of soldiers by visiting their graves."," Finch's poem was written to honor the universality of mourning in the North and South in the years preceding the war's end.Through the acknowledgment of mutual sympathies, he epitomized the new national tradition of memorializing the soldiers.According to David W. Blight, the poem was published in<em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> in Boston, and was very popular. Recitals of the poem continued for years to come at Decoration Days and Blue-Gray reunions.At these events, men and especially women commemorated the lost soldiers by visiting and decorating gravesites, convening at graveyards, and holding communal memorial services to honor those who fought for either side.Thepoem reflects the emerging reunionism that these events created.By 1866, southerners had founded memorial associations, with a majority of their constituents being women.These Memorial Days, described in detail by Blight, grew in popularity, and the North soon had their own."," Memorialization intertwined with civic life.Blight reveals that the memorial days were a means of coping with Reconstruction and its debilitating consequences on the South.In a different way, memorial days were a small tie to the ideals white southerners had been forced to desert in their defeat and in Reconstruction.Not only had slavery ceased to exist, but also the Confederacy, their nation of four years, faded with Robert E. Lee's 1865 surrender.According to Charles Vincent, the end of the war saw the end of the world as they knew it.Demoralization and social dislocation encompassed many white southerners' post-war lives.Some southerners still held on to their unique southern identity.Blight narrates that in John A. Bilmer claimed, The world had <em>conceded</em> to Southern courage, Southern devotion, Southern skills, and Southern power, as displayed in that war.Southern citizens still lived under the reign of Reconstruction and felt the aftermath and destruction caused by the war.Memorializing dead Rebel soldiers was a way of channeling this grief into a positive source, visiting the graveyards and battlefields in order to move forward, like Finch challenges his readers."," The North, too, began eulogizing the dead Union soldiers in much the same way.According to Blight, in May 1868 and 1869, General John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, asked for all Union veterans to honor the dead soldiers by conducting ceremonies and visiting gravesites.Northern memorials grew to encapsulate fallen southerners as well as black and Union soldiers.Finch's poem was a stepping stone to a reunified nation.","--J.R."],"display_date":"September 14, 1867 - December 31, 1873","search_date":"1870-11-06","locations":[{"id":5519,"lat":32.1808059275,"lng":-91.7158468561,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2723,"title":"Louisiana Lady Battles with Regional and Human Attraction\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-10-17","end_date":"1863-11-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" As a young twenty-two year old Louisiana woman, Miss Sidney Harding was completely caught off-guard when her prosperous family had to flee their plantation because of Yankee pressure and become Civil War refugees in DeSoto Parish, LA.Harding was not unlike other southern women: she faced internal and external conflicts throughout her years as a refugee.OnOctober 17, 1863, Harding commented on the disdain she felt at the sight of other girls being friendly to northern soldiers and the disloyalty of the lower parishes, but she would redefine what was acceptable in a war environment with her former country."," On November 4, 1863, Harding met a handsome man, a cavalier, born in New York who had only lived in the South for six years.He was remarkably handsome, tall with black eyes and dark skin.She boldly invited him to stay the night at her house, an offer he graciously declined the offer, saying that he would love to visit again another night instead.The two passed most of the night talking with one another, enjoying each other's company in the midst of wartime struggles. The next day, Harding could not take her mind off this gentleman, who she admitted to having second thoughts about.Her friends wondered if it was acceptable of her to be speaking with a northerner who had lived in the South for only a few years before the Civil War began.She, however, convincingly rationalized her fondness for this former northern gentleman.First, he had fought and been injured at the battle of Shiloh (fighting for the Confederate army) and was the son of an Episcopal clergyman.She viewed these qualities as honorable and pleasant.In addition, Harding described the man as a good southerner with elegant manners and courtesy.Harding delighted in this chance encounter with a handsome gentleman during her stressful refuge in DeSoto Parish."," According to William J.

Hume, the Arkansas convention was unique, however, because it contained extensive debates about the role of race.The Civil War raged on, yet Arkansas was already underway of Reconstruction and improving race relations.Jesse N. Cypert, a southern white man from White County, pressed for ratification of a constitution excluding black suffrage, while William H. Grey, a black from Phillips County, advocated for black suffrage.Grey's arguments were rational, thought provoking, and supported by substantial evidence, and the convention approved black suffrage.Grey was treated as a gentleman and, at least in this convention, as an equal.The reigning president insisted that Grey be addressed Mr. ----, from ---- County the same way that the white delegates were addressed.Cypert's excuse for unequal address was that He had spoken of him as a negro, because he was such."," This rationale of racial equality reflects much of the Reconstruction South; it was hard for white southerners to abandon suddenly all previous prejudices.Yet, Grey proved his intelligence and deserved respect through his long oration on the reasons blacks deserved the right to vote.He based the majority of this argument on the idea that poor white southerners were worse off than many African Americans.To convince his peers of this idea, he quoted many South Carolina politicians and a Georgia judge who questioned the ignorance of these poor whites.For example, he quotes William Gregg who, in 1851, stated to the South Carolina Institute that he put[s] down the white people, who ought to work, and who do not, or who are so employed as to be wholly unproductive of State.Grey points out that blacks wanted to work and be productive members of society, yet this ignorant group of white southerners was granted more rights than his own race."," The Reconstruction Acts of March 1867 forced southern states to comply with the North to attain readmission to the Union.Hume notes that Arkansas was one of the former rebellious states to undergo a Constitutional Convention to discuss politics and bridge together opposing factions.Among these factions was the meeting of whites and blacks in a political sphere for the first time since emancipation.This instance shows the small, successful steps made during Reconstruction for black suffrage in a southern state; at the Arkansas Constitutional Convention, Grey epitomized the intelligent free black who desired large changes in southern society.According to John B. Boles, white southerners varied along class lines, and the poor white yeoman farmer or the poor white southerner were in a class separate from the slave-owning farmer or plantation owner.Boles narrates that their economic situation resulted in less education, and poor white southerners suffered substantially during the Civil War years.Using the inequality of whites along intellectual and socio-economic lines, Grey aptly proved to his peers African Americans' right to both respect and suffrage.Grey supported his arguments about blacks' deserved equality by exposing the contradictions in southern society.His victory over a bigoted Cypert was a victory not only for Arkansas, but also for African Americans who were now free and struggling with their newfound emancipation in a discriminatory nation.Such minor victories would be hope for blacks across the South, as acts of injustice dominated southern society for years to come.","--J.R."],"display_date":"March 1, 1867 - January 30, 1868","search_date":"1867-08-15","locations":[{"id":712,"lat":34.5311279044,"lng":-90.7753398937,"zoom":9,"place":"PHILLIPS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2735,"title":"Proud, Patriotic Song of an Arkansas Colored Regiment","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1865-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Written in 1863 by the white Captain Lindley Miller, the First Arkansas Colored Regiment of the Union army proudly sang the Song of the First Arkansas to become excited for training and battle.According to Miller's notes, the marching song was sung to the tune of John Brown's Body, which is significant because they honored Brown, the well-known man who attempted a widespread slave insurrection in Harper's Ferry, Virginia in 1859.The song speaks for the patriotic, proud, and dedicated black soldier.The lyrics glorify the fight for de Union and de law.The black soldiers outright profess that they hab done with hoein' cotton and hoein' corn, and they demand they dey will hab to pay us wages, de wages ob their sin.The song incorporates many elements of abolitionist thought.It demands treatment from whites as equals, demanding that whites bow their foreheads to African Americans and a right to property.A political allusion to Father Abraham and his Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 also exemplifies blacks' desire to attain the rights sanctioned to them by the government.Miller's song is a patriotic one, and it is revolutionary in its inclusion of blacks into the American sphere of citizenship.According to Ronald C. McConnell, 647 black men chose to enlist in the First Arkansas Infantry and their Union patriotism is evident in this song.Black soldiers fought in the same war, and they deserved the same respect.The Song of the First Arkansas recognizes their patriotism, bravery, and desire to end slavery in order to attain rights and equality in their nation."," The enslaved people were eager to end slavery, recognizing that the myth of the patriarchy of slaveholders was false.The song illustrates how incorrect the pro-slavery argument that slaves benefited the most from slavery.The lyrics show white slaveholders' oppression of black emancipation, describing When we heard de proclamation, massa hush it as he will.Yet, these black soldiers took the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 literally and wanted to fight to emancipate the slaves of all the southern slaveholding states.According to McConnell, songs in the Civil War evoked enthusiasm and motivated soldiers to fight.The black soldiers remembered the oppression of their fellow blacks and had even more reason to stand up for the abolitionist cause.According to John O.

Flying towards this vital meeting, the steamer ship needed more fuel, and deck hands began tactlessly tearing down fences along the banks of the river. Suddenly, a poor, woebegone, wretched looking old man came rushing down with his children...all crying together, imploring that the northern steamboat spare his fence.

Delivered by Benjamin Morgan Palmer of the First Presbyterian Church, this sermon advocated southern secession in defense of its providential trust to perpetuate slavery. Palmer believed that slaves were by nature incapable of self government and dependent upon their masters for protection. Dr. Palmer's reasoning is sound, sensible, and Christian to Wadley who yearned for the South's fighting for the patriarchal cause of slavery. Dr. Palmer justified slavery through the patriarchy of a white slaveholder who protected the dependent slave. Wadley's opinions were typical of the Lower South during the days after Abraham Lincoln's presidential election, and sectionalism grew quickly and passionately, even in women's minds. According to Samuel S. Hill and Charles H. Lippy, Palmer's sermons on slavery, namely this famous oration, led to his position as the elected moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States of America. Wadley listened to Palmer with attentiveness and respect; she, like many other white southerners, believed in the doctrine of slavery as a divine right from God granted to the South. Wadley relates another sermon from a Dr. Lord, which summarizes the mistaken piety of abolitionists in their attempts to emancipate enslaved people from southern masters. Dr. Lord derived his preaching from Isaiah, and he condemned those who setting up their own judgement and their own code of morals instead of religion, and the scriptures, condemn that which has been sanctioned both by the bible, and by ancient usage.

After the Battle of Bentonville, Union troops marched on to Goldsboro to rest and refit after seven weeks of fighting.","The effect of Sherman's Campaign on the Confederacy was devastating; Confederates were no longer united. With an army of 60,000, Sherman made the entire South feel the weight of war. Sherman's campaign, as historian Charles Edmund Vetter noted, triggered a significant amount of suffering throughout the South, in the form of economic depression, psychological disturbance, and material destruction. Even though Sherman's march through the Carolinas did not directly influence Lee's surrender, the march devastated Confederate logistics. The despair of North Carolinians threatened to break up Lee's army. They were tired of the war.

As the proud mother of two Confederate soldiers, James and Hines, Zillah found strength in her Bible. In her diary, Zillah wrote of her fear for her sons' safety and her pride in their dedication to the Confederate struggle for independence, but always found comfort in God's words. When both James and Hines were killed in service in late 1862, Zillah's worst fears were realized. On January 9, 1863, she wrote in her diary that the remains of our dear sons...reached home last Monday 5th of January 1863. Zillah's unwavering Christian faith consoled her and she explained that although I wept sore and do weep yet I know that in our heavenly Father's house are many mansions. It was a comfort to Zillah to know that her sons shared her religious devotion. Reverend S.S. Russell, a soldier who fought along side of James and Hines, reassured Zillah that he could testify that they had been living demonstrations that men by the grace of God could live Christians under any circumstances.","Religion was of great importance to southerners like Zillah. According to the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</em>, evangelical denominations provided education to women prior to the Civil War. Because religion was so closely tied to knowledge, women were especially religious in the South. After the Great Awakening of the nineteenth century (religious revivals in the South), evangelical Christianity became a bedrock of southern culture. The impact was felt even stronger by women because religion was family oriented. Women like Zillah raised their children according to their religious beliefs, and in Zillah's case, those beliefs were devout. Religion was also somewhat of an equalizer; women and men were equal in God's eyes in terms of sin. Women were free to ask for forgiveness of their sins just as men were.","To Zillah Brandon and women like her, religion was not just a matter of church on Sunday. It was a way of life, encompassing her education and her family."],"display_date":"January 9, 1863","search_date":"1863-01-09","locations":[{"id":365,"lat":32.5910098434,"lng":-88.1987909047,"zoom":9,"place":"SUMTER, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2836,"title":"Jefferson Davis Hides with the Barringers\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-01","end_date":"1865-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Federal General Stoneman had been recalled to pursue and capture Jefferson Davis and his cabinet.

In his correspondence to the Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Vasa Fox, Farragut mentioned the increasing number of Confederate deserters he and his men picked up from gunboats. The Union used these men for intelligence, however inaccurate, and continued to take them on in hopes of gaining new information. ","Union naval vessels took up more and more deserters as the war progressed. This symbolized a significant flaw in the Confederate cause. By 1865, as much as ten percent of the total Confederate forces had deserted their posts. In numbers, this totaled 104,000 men. In spite of initial zealous enthusiasm, as conditions worsened, soldiers struggled to maintain their drive for the cause. The Confederate government could no longer meet the needs of its soldiers. They could not pay, clothe, or feed their men adequately, and people deserted in response. Throughout the South, men wrote home to their wives lamenting their condition. In addition to having poor supplies themselves, men worried about their wives at home with their farms and slaves. As the war endured, men increasingly abandoned the Confederacy to protect themselves and their families. ","Another possible explanation for the increased desertion can be seen in the conscription of most of the Confederate army after 1862. This placed people in the army who were not necessarily committed to preserving the South. As the Confederate States of America increasingly became a lost cause, these men felt no need to continue risking their lives and those of their families.

Harrington, CSA of Franklin County, Mississippi. It seems Mrs. Jones, most likely a widow at the time of her writing (note that it was she and not her veteran husband who penned the request), had been unable to secure the pension entitled to her by state law as the widow of a Confederate soldier. Although, according to Joanna Short, the most common reasons for this were failure to provide sufficient evidence of military service, disability, or poverty, it seems Mrs. Jones was simply having trouble with the paper work; as most people not directly affiliated with armed forces or government usually were (and still are), she had, up until the time of her writing, been stumped as to the proper procedure for filling out the proper forms and thereby obtaining the proper compensation. To this end, she sought the assistance of Major Harrington.","Mrs. Jones' case was not uncommon during the time period. During the period after the Civil War, many states began giving benefits to families of those killed during the conflict. With the backing of the Federal Government, the practice was most prevalent and more generous in the North, as the northern states could better afford to compensate families, but southern states also adopted the practice. Originally, pensions were afforded only to war widows, or wounded soldiers with variable extent of... disability, from 5 per year for the loss of a finger or toe to 150 per year for the loss of two or more limbs or total blindness. Then, according to the U.S. Government National Archives, Mississippi began granting pensions to indigent Confederate veterans or their widows in 1888. In other words, now any veteran who was down on their luck could be compensated, even if the reasons for their hard times were unrelated to the Civil War. ","The reasons for this expansion of benefits, according to Theda Skocpol, were mainly political, as straightforward compensation for wartime disabilities [turned] into fuel for patronage politics. The issue became so pressing nation wide that in 1882, Representative Roswell G. Horr of Michigan observed: I think it is safe to say that each member of this House receives [at least] fifty letters each week in regard to aid obtaining a pension. The subsequent bureaucracy that grew to deal with the large number of requests resulted in confusion, extravagance, and injustice, claims Judge Parry. The issue grew so large between 1880 and 1910, says Skocpol, the U.S. federal government devoted over a quarter of its expenditures to distributing pensions, which, aside from interest payments on the national debt in the early 1880s...exceeded or nearly equaled other major categories of federal spending. (This figure stands as a stumbling block for historians claiming an absence of federal involvement in social welfare before the New Deal.) ","Returning to Mississippi, Joanna Short notes that the average pension by 1910 in the state was 43.36 per year (41.08 in 1893 by a CPI conversion), and that for many Confederate veterans who struggled to earn a living because of disabilities or their widows, who did not have as much access to the work force, this amount was not trivial. It is unknown whether or not Mrs. Jones was an original war widow, in which case she would have been missing out on a great deal of money due her since 1865, or was trying to take advantage of the expansion of grants since 1888. Either way, the amount of money she would hopefully soon be receiving, with the help of the gentleman Major P.C. Harrington, would certainly help her during the economically challenging post war times in the South. The issue would be especially pressing to her, as the country had just experienced what the Hon. John W. Daniel called, in a speech before congress, the most acute stage of the panic of 1893, the result of which was a large across the board fall of prices, and the minimization of the United States financial system. This deflation and minimization most definitely affected many Mississippians. Mrs. Jones, therefore, most likely needed the help of Major Harrington as quickly as possible."],"display_date":"November 1893","search_date":"1893-11-15","locations":[{"id":7031,"lat":31.4771528974,"lng":-90.8978368524,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2848,"title":"A Sunday Snub\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-08-22","end_date":"1865-08-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On an August morning in Montgomery, Alabama, an elderly African-American woman found a seat in one of Montgomery's principal churches and waited for the service to begin.

In an article in the Montgomery Advertiser the following Tuesday, the woman was excused from her decision to sit in a seat exactly suited to her mind with the dismissal that she knew no better, and probably had been told that she was as good as the whites, and entitled to as many privileges. White Montgomery citizens were beginning to realize that, in order to maintain the racial order of slavery, they would have to make sure that newly freed African-Americans, such as the lady in the church, knew their place.","One of the ways cities like Montgomery informed freedmen of the new social order were with Black Codes.

Susan Brardford Eppes was a teenager in the deep South and responded to this event with intense sorrow. She knew that war had arrived, and she knew war would change everything. In her initial response, Susan discussed the burden now facing the southern people. Everyone in the South had to be a part of the fight. Her support and sadness for the South then moved toward anger with the North. She said that the North brought the war to the South; southerners did not want to fight. However, when the North chose war, the South could not turn away. Susan then took comfort in her knowledge that the Christian God, the God of Battles, would help the people of the South. ","As sectional tendencies developed throughout the 1850s, southerners became increasingly proud of who they were. It became an honor to be southern, and some southerners even worked to create elaborate legacies. When the issue of secession came into play upon the election of Lincoln, leaders used rhetoric encouraging the men of the South to protect their honor. Men could not stand by idly when the North attacked the southern way of life. Susan commented on the importance of honor by saying that no southerner would back away from a fight. Susan also strongly believed that the North was at fault. In her mind and those of many others, the North antagonized the South. The North refused to accept the South and its use of slavery. This continual attack on southern culture made it impossible for southern men of honor to turn their backs to the growing conflict. ","People of the Confederacy believed very strongly that God was on their side. They believed this because their cause was just, and they were true, honorable Christians. Religion and scripture not only justified the cause but also preserved it. For example, General Stonewall Jackson and General Robert E. Lee continually prayed with their men and reminded them to hold true to their beliefs. Susan believed fervently that God was on her side and the side of the South. This was the case because the North forced the South into an unnecessary war to defend southern honor. Though she was young at the time, Susan's interpretation of the war around her was demonstrative of the overall atmosphere and set of beliefs contagious throughout the South.

Hill, Telegraph Editor of the Detroit Journal, was published in the Jackson Weekly Clarion Ledger. Mr. Hill, it appeared, had inherited a Civil War era relic from his father, who had received it from a member of a troop of Michigan cavalry. The relic itself was an ornamental Bowieknife with a six-inch blade, horn handle, German silver mounted. The sheath is blue velvet, German silver tipped, and on the band encircling the top has been scratched with a pin point, in fine clerical hand: Col. J.M. Wood, Mississippi Tigers. The Michigan cavalryman apparently found the knife in Corinth, Mississippi following the evacuation of that city in May, 1862. ","The evacuation itself occurred on May 29 and 30. Although, according to historian Steven Nathaniel Dossman, Corinth was absolutely vital to the Confederate war effort, as it was the site of the junction of the Memphis and Charleston line with the Mobile and Ohio, the crucial chains that linked the confederacy together, General Beauregard saw no other alternative to withdrawal from the city; after a long, grueling siege which was made especially terrible due to lack food and clean water and had turned the surrounding area into what one soldier called the most Godforsaken country I ever saw, the Confederate General decided to spare what men he had left.","Beauregard took four days to plan and carry out the action. The first step was to notify his own troops to prepare to attack in order to confuse Federal intelligence reports. Then, through secret correspondences, he meticulously laid out his plan of withdrawal. Finally, on the night of May 29, under the guises of extra campfires, as much commotion as possible to sell the ruse [of imminent attack], and even an empty train [running] in and out of Corinth; complete with whistles, bands, and cheers to make it appear large numbers of reinforcements had arrived, Beauregard completed his move out of Corinth. Having to move his men out of the area under Beauregard's very particular commands all while maintaining an air of secrecy, Colonel Wood clearly had other things on his mind than his knife; as it was found simply upon the camp ground, Colonel Wood most likely misplaced or forgot it during all the commotion. ","Thirty-seven years later, he [or his family] finally received his knife back [perhaps]. Although war relics are usually given very serious sentimental value, this particular find seemed to have no value to the finder and clearly was not seriously important to E.B. Hill. Therefore, it is fitting that Colonel Wood or his family should receive this piece of their personal history back. Furthermore, this respectful action by Mr. Hill is representative of larger efforts, still ongoing in the 1890s, to heal wounds between the North and South; relics are usually kept as a reminder of the enemy and the battle, but here it was returned in order to, in some small, individual way, erase the line between enemies and, as may have been hoped by E.B. Hill, the animosities between North and South.

One month earlier, Jefferson Davis had been inaugurated as the new president of the Confederacy. Elizabeth Saxon traveled to Montgomery, Alabama to celebrate the inauguration of Davis and then traveled to Mobile when Lincoln was inaugurated. In Mobile, she visited with a good friend and mentor from her childhood, Madame Octavia Walton Invert. Well-educated and charming, Madame Invert was a woman of society. Saxon described her as the most generous person she had ever met. The two exchanged formalities and then discussed Lincoln's present inauguration with sadness and fear. Invert cried for the friends she had scattered throughout the North and the South and knew how difficult the upcoming months would be. Saxon was younger and saw more hope for the future. Yet the depression of her role model was greatly troubling, and the somber mood quickly spread to Elizabeth herself. ","Uncertainty surrounded Lincoln's inauguration. Unionists and Confederates found themselves unsure of what would happen next. His inauguration speech needed to alleviate fears and explain his positions and possible actions. In his speech, Lincoln proclaimed that his purpose was not to eliminate slavery but rather oversee that which belonged to the government. In this sense, he was referring to the states that had already seceded. This included Saxon's home state of Alabama, which had seceded on January 11, 1861. Lincoln argued that he had no intentions of ending slavery in the South, but simply wanted to preserve the Union. ","Despite Lincoln's reassurances, southerners were not convinced. Many believed that slavery could not be protected in the current Union regardless of who was in charge. States that had already seceded continued to encourage border states to join their new nation. Even though states like Alabama had already taken action, no one knew what Lincoln's response would be. When he refused to sit idly by and allow the South to create its own nation, war became the next possible step. While the border states did not seceded until April and May, the rest of the South knew that war was coming. Unlike the inauguration of Jefferson Davis, the inauguration of Lincoln was a somber occasion. Invert's wisdom led her to believe that war between the North and the South was next and that would mean great casualties on both sides. Though younger, Saxon realized a great deal from watching the depression Invert faced. She too came to believe that the Confederate States of America would have to fight to preserve themselves. Lincoln could not say anything to convince the southern states that he would fairly handle the institution of slavery.

Masters feared for their lives and their property and decided to send some of their slaves further south and away from the Yankees. Hughes and his wife were part of a group initially sent to Georgia. Once in Atlanta, Hughes and his wife were transferred again, this time to Mobile, Alabama. In Mobile, Hughes was sent to the salt works. There he worked for the rebel government, while his wife worked as a cook in the same factory. Salt was essential for preserving meat, and thus Hughes and his wife were forced to play a critical role in aiding the southern military effort. ","In 1863, it became legal for the Union army to use black troops. While this included freed blacks, Northern troops also enlisted runaways who offered their service. For blacks, this was a way of guaranteeing freedom and showing patriotism. Clearly southerners feared this. They accused Lincoln of inciting slave rebellions and violating laws of war. When it became apparent that Yankee soldiers intended to benefit from using blacks in the army, the fears of masters were renewed and they often sent their slaves South to hide them.

In a period of three months in 1862, large groups of slaves armed with cane knives, clubs, and old guns stole horses and mules and marched to the city. There they bypassed rebel pickets and fought battles with policemen. The fortunate ones eluded capture and found refuge in Union army camps, others were beaten or sentenced to three months hard labor.","Throughout the war, many slaves followed Union armies. In June 1862, one enraged plantation owner finally gave up and ordered all of his slaves off the plantation telling them to go to the devil, instead they went to the Union army. During the early period of the war, black men, served not only in the Union but served many private soldies in the Confederate army. These soldiers carried their servants around with them in the field. Duties for these men included waiting on their masters, cleaning their horses, and cooking their meals. Rations and money became scarce as the war went on and these servants were ordered back to the plantations.","In the summer of 1862, 10,000 refugee slaves were put to work in the Union army cutting wood, policing army camps, and loading and unloading quartermaster supplies. One Union officer reported that many of the fugitives came to the camps starved, having eaten nothing for days. Refugees from all over escaped to New Orleans and were placed in shelters with some rations provided. Many of the black men were ignorant to proper sanitation and health care. On March 17, 1864, the military mayor reported that the colored population was generating disease by living in crowded, unsuitable huts and disregarded the laws of health. The Union officers and General Banks took whatever measures were available to compensate for the large numbers of starving, unemployed, and penniless African Americans in New Orleans.","Although these African Americans filled many positions in the army, they were not permitted to fight alongside their white male counterparts. In August 1862, General Butler decided to enlist free black men into his army to gather more troops. Despite the fact the many African Americans were willing to sacrifice their lives in the army, white people still believed that they would not survive without the paternalistic guidance of their owners.

In speaking to the Calliopean and Polytechnic Societies at the Citadel Academy in Charleston in 1853, Yeadon took the opportunity to address the audience on what would happen if higher institutions in South Carolina did not maintain strict discipline among their pupils.","Stemming from God, Order is the great law of nature, whereas Insubordination or rebellion was the primal sin, which drove [man] from Paradise. In the United States, Yeadon noted, order takes the place of the sword of power, pervading, ruling, and harmonizing our political system, which leads to the people of the United States literally reveling in the enjoyment of a political Eden, a national Paradise. But he cautioned, without order, we would be torn by civil dissensions, beyond all other nations, as the necessary result of our division into separate States...and we would soon behold our great and glorious Union, now covering a continent with its nationality and with the ample folds of our starry banner, broken into warring fragments, unable to command peace at home or respect abroad, and a derision and a by-word among nations. ","Yeadon's was a timely lesson. In 1853, only 11 students graduated from the College of Columbia, and nary a soul from the Citadel. It is manifest that a spirit of insubordination among our youth is not only at the bottom of these deplorable results, Yeadon concluded, but that it has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished. ","There are several reasons he gave for why this spirit of insubordination ought to be diminished, but the last was the most telling: The nature of our institution of domestic slavery, and its exposure of us to hostile machinations, both at home and abroad, render it doubly incumbent on us, and on our whole sisterhood of Southern States, to cherish a military spirit and diffuse military science among our people.... Thus prepared and harnessed for conflict...the South, the united South, self-sustained and self-defended, and thrice armed, as having her quarrel just, may defy the world in arms. ","One can almost hear his voice rising to a crescendo on these last words. Yet it was November 23, 1853. War would not break out between the states for over seven more years. But one would think from listening to Richard Yeadon's speech that the armies were marching to Charleston that instant. And the main reason for preserving order in the South's colleges: the threat of external attack on the South's peculiar institution. ","This episode supports historian Arthur Cole and others who believe there existed in South Carolina in the 1850s the danger of a rupture of the Union and of civil war ten years before the firing of the first gun on Fort Sumter when even sober-minded southerners...began to calculate the value of the Union.

With the inner coastal position under Union control, a very tight blockade of North Carolina could be maintained by the North. This news was extremely devastating to the people of North Carolina, as they realized that their beloved state was starting to slip away from them. Eliza Oswald Hill heard reports of New Berne while she was seeking refuge away from the coast in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In her diary, she expressed how her hope for a Confederate victory slowly faded with the news of every loss to the North. The rumors she heard about New Berne were finally confirmed to her on March 15 1862. It was extremely distressing to Ms. Hill to learn of the advancements the Yankees were making into her state. She articulated her utter distaste for what lengths the North would undertake to gain ground in the South. Eliza Oswald Hill's reaction to the news of yet another Confederate loss of coastal land was representative of the general hopeless attitude shared by many North Carolinians as the Civil War progressed.","The Union force understood what it needed to achieve to take control of the South. Part of this strategy included seizing significant locations in the Carolinas. As Herbert, Baker, and Holt argue, by turning its efforts to coastal ports, the Union could establish a tight blockade of the Southern coast which would have very detrimental effects for the Confederacy. In February-March of 1862, General Ambrose Burnside successfully undertook this task. After important victories scattered through out North Carolina, General Burnside turned his attention to the strategic port of New Berne. At this time, it was the second largest city of the North Carolina Coast. Despite its size, however, New Berne was only defended by no more than 4,000 Confederate troops when Burnside's drive arrived at its doorstep. This small number of men was under the leadership of General L. O'B. Branch. The Rebel soldiers fought well, but they could not overcome their lack of numbers, and many had to flee inward to avoid capture. By the end of the day on March 14 1862, New Berne was in Union hands.

James Hopkins Adams was certainly aware of the tumult he caused with that short declaration. A former governor of South Carolina from 1854 to 1856, Adams was, in December 1860, serving as a commissioner to the committee discussing the possibility of secession and civil war in South Carolina. His remarks caused Charleston resident Emma Holmes, in a December 5, 1860, letter to her friend Lizzie Greene in Georgia, to declare, Last Sunday will never be forgotten by the Charlestonians. The Convention was sitting. The Governor was holding a council of war. Troops were marching in the streets. The Palmetto Guards (The Finest and largest company of infantry in the state) took control of the Arsenal, and subsequently a salute of thirty two guns fired to the 'fallen grandeur' of the Stars and Stripes, as they were hauled down, to give place to the banner of the glorious Palmetto State. To top it all off, it was a Sunday-the Sabbath, the day of rest, which all Charlestonians were assuredly enjoying in a peaceful, leisurely manner, before the onslaught of troops and gun salutes. ","To be sure, all these displays were mere show, one snowballing into the next, probably unnecessarily troubling Charleston's finest ladies. Abraham Lincoln had yet to be inaugurated, had yet to call for 75,000 volunteers to stop the South from seceding, had yet to issue any other proclamations. Fort Sumter's bombardment-and with it a war-would not occur until April 1861.","But much can be said for mere show. Indeed, the state seems to have been working its way towards such displays in the several months prior. In a November 10, 1860, letter to Lizzie, Miss Holmes wrote of similar events: The report having reached Boston that South Carolina had already seceded, Mr. Caleb Cushman sent on in a vessel owned by himself and brothers, then here with orders to fire a salute of fifteen guns for the Southern States and to hoist the flag of S.C., a palmetto tree and Lone star. Though Emma was mistaken-formal secession would not occur until December 20 of that year-the multiple-gun salutes and hoistings of the Palmetto flag seemed common occurrences in the months leading up to secession. ","This episode is important in demonstrating the fact that Charlestonians were celebrating secession several months before it actually happened, a fact that should not be taken lightly. Historian Walter Edgar concurs, stating that South Carolinians had been calculating the value of the Union since the 1820s, and with each passing year, more and more found the Union wanting in the balance, a threat to the order and harmony of the state. Letters like Emma Holmes' represent the very thoughts of Charleston citizens during this time, demonstrating, as was seen a fortnight after Emma's December 6 letter, that their views were in line with those of their politicians."],"display_date":"December 5, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-05","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2926,"title":"Secession\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-20","end_date":"1860-12-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 17, 1860, a convention formed in the South Carolinian capital of Columbia to debate and confront the single most important decision facing the state since voting on independence from Great Britain over 80 years earlier. As fate would have it, the city of Charleston would be the one to hear the verdict on secession first. We, the People of the State of South Carolina, in Convention assembled, do declare and ordain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, That the Ordinance adopted by us in Convention, on the twenty-third day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, whereby the Constitution of the United States of America was ratified, and also all Acts and parts of Acts of the General Assembly of this State, ratifying amendments of the said Constitution, are hereby repealed; and that the union now subsisting between South Carolina and other states, under the name of the 'United States of America,' is hereby dissolved. The delegates had moved their convention from Columbia to Charleston due to rumors of a smallpox outbreak in Columbia. The importance of the move cannot be underestimated. As historian Walter Edgar says, There may have been one case (of smallpox) in the city, but by moving to Charleston those favoring secession would be in a locale more hospitable to their ideas. ","Among the hospitable was Emma Holmes, a young Charleston lady, who was both very agreeable to secession and willing to accept wholeheartedly the smallpox outbreak story. In writing to her friend Lizzie Green on December 20, Holmes exclaimed, The Union is dissolved, and we the people of South Carolina are a free and independent sovereignty Yesterday dear Lizzie the Ordinance of Secession passed at 1 1/4 P.M. and last night it was signed at Secession Hall (formerly Institute) amidst an immense concourse of people, and illuminations of tar barrels and fireworks of every description, music and parading of various companies. The Convention and Legislature adjourned here this week on account of the small-pox which is very prevalent in Columbia... In celebration, Frank Porcher lit 48 colored lanterns at his home on East Battery; tar barrels were burnt on Meeting Street; Roman candles and bombshells were launched throughout the city. The vote had been unanimous-all 169 delegates in favor of secession. This episode is important, of course, for the national ramifications it held. South Carolina was the first state to secede, others soon followed, with the results a new nation and civil war. But historian Ralph Wooster's data on the members of the South Carolina secession convention are far more probing. Delegates to South Carolina's secession convention held a median age of 49 years-the oldest median age of all the conventions-and were the only delegates to vote entirely for immediate secession. South Carolina delegates were also richer-with median personal property of 50,000, 18,000 more than the next closest, Mississippi-and held the most slaves-a median of 37, compared to 15.5 for Mississippi, again the next closest. Finally, 250 of the total 1,048 delegates at all conventions were born in South Carolina, and were heavily in favor of secession. ","Supporters for war in South Carolina, at least, were wealthy, older men. Perhaps the best conclusion to be drawn from this episode, then, lies in the words of Mr. Wooster: The motives for supporting immediate withdrawal from the Union seem then to have had a deeper basis than personal characteristics of convention members alone. Thus the political climate in Charleston, as this episode shows, may have contributed more to secession than mere property, age, or birthplace.

On December 6, 1850, William H. Barnwell, rector of St. Peter's Church, took the pulpit to expand upon the great political question which is agitating our country. The occasion? A Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer, as designated by the South Carolina legislature. The great political question? Slavery, especially in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, a compromise most South Carolinians viewed as an absolute defeat for the South. ","Barnwell was very clear on his stance: The purpose of the North is to use the whole power of the Government for its own aggrandizement, and the destruction of an institution which we believe to be of vital importance to our welfare. The institution for Barnwell, though, was not just important for South Carolina's welfare-it was ordained by God and a gift to the African race. His ultimate conclusion, though (the morality of slavery aside) remained political: Whatever speculative notions any one may have as to the moral influence of slavery, that it is a fundamental institution of the Southern States, and that no Government on earth has the slightest right to meddle with it, either directly or indirectly.","Turn to November 21, 1860. This time, South Carolina Governor William Gist had proclaimed another Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer. This time, it was Reverend Thomas Smyth lecturing at Second Presbyterian Church on The Sin and the Curse. This time, it was the election of Abraham Lincoln and a growing secession movement that prompted the occasion. It was all a foregone conclusion in Smyth's mind: This is only the result,-the consummation of a tragedy which has been long progressing to its last act,-when the curtain fell upon the dismembered body of the Union. He goes on to blame Northern Christians for this situation; they pervert truth, justice, honor, and good faith by forgetting that the condition of slavery has been and is recognized and regulated by God, who first ordained that it should come to pass as a penal infliction upon a guilty race, for the mitigation of greater evils, and for the good of all... that under the fostering care of these Southern States, and of this legally bounded institution, these people have multiplied in a ratio greater than their masters; that they are healthier and happier than any other laboring class on the face of the earth. ","This episode is important in showing the fusion of religion and politics in 1850s South Carolina. The views of these two pastors also aligned with those in the rest of the South. As Charles Iron of Elon University notes, By the 1830s, Southern whites insisted in their formulation of a regional, evangelical orthodoxy that God had ordained slavery and that slaveholders could confidently hold their property in persons so long as they were attentive to the spiritual condition of their slaves. Though these two sermons were ten years apart, the themes they espouse and the justifications for slavery they promulgate remained the same."],"display_date":"December 5, 1850 - November 21, 1860","search_date":"1855-11-28","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2935,"title":"Runaway Slaves Seek Refuge in Union Camp\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-05-21","end_date":"1862-05-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One morning in May two slaves, Sam and Mary, belonging to Mr. Mitthoff, left their home and went to Camp Parapet, a Union fort.

He was then told that General Phelps wanted him to leave much of what the young Mitthoff had taken.  Mitthoff's son wound up leaving the camp empty-handed.  When father and son reconvened they witnessed their slaves beating their mule with sticks and throwing mud at it.  The mule then charged towards Mitthoff's carriage, in which his children were sitting.  Mitthoff had to run in front of the raging mule in order to protect his children, which resulted in a terrible injury to his foot.  ","Coinciding with Union occupation, the proportion of runaway slaves increased dramatically in Louisiana.  As soon as slaves figured out where they could go to attain freedom, they left their plantations whenever the opportunity arose.  Confederates knew that when Federal troops arrived they were bound to lose large numbers of slaves.  Therefore, practices monitoring and controlling slaves were magnified in order to prevent the huge loss of capital resulting from runaway slaves.  Parishes hired permanent guards and created river patrols to stop slaves from escaping.  Prior to the war slaves could live unaccompanied in cities, but once the Federal troops arrived masters were fined for allowing slaves to be on their own.  The state paid to have extra white men monitor plantations that did not have enough supervision.  There was also an increase in the amount of Negro hunters who were compensated for retrieving runaway slaves.  Confederates sensed the danger that Union troops brought to the system of slavery and did everything within their power to control the system they were willing to die for.  Not only would runaway slaves hinder the southern economic system, they also were likely to join the Union army.

Although McPearson's evidence shows a youthful army, the fact that Burgywn was promoted at such a fresh age shows the significance of this event, even among his young compatriots. Soldiers measured their own and their fellows' honor by actions that either fulfilled or violated the decorum of discipline and fearlessness that was established in the army.

Although the Texans attacked with only six hundred men against Santa Anna's eleven, they held the day due to Santa Anna's poor tactical decisions demonstrating a distinct interest in self preservation. The Texans only suffered six casualties and twenty injuries. Citing this statistic, the Texas Secretary of War remarked that The history of war does not furnish a parallel to this battle.

In this way, the women of coastal South Carolina could contribute to the war effort without officially being recognized by their country. They used whatever outlet they could as an opportunity to help their beloved soldiers. ","Not until September, 1862 did the Confederate Congress officially authorize women as nurses. Thereafter, women were welcomed by the Southern army as a recognized source of medical help. In his book <em>Ordeal by Fire</em>, historian James McPhearson argues how women in the South, because of this late recognition of aid, did not play as large of a role in the war as did Northern women, since these women were allowed at an earlier time to be official nurses. However, women, such as Bachman and her partners, found ways in the South to significant ways to contribute to the war effort and assist their wounded. ","Women played a vital role in the Civil War, and without them, the war would have been very different. Female efforts during this time were especially important in the medical field, since fighting was seen solely as a man's job. They did most of the hard work in the civilian volunteer agencies that were created to aid the growing number of wounded soldiers. They were dedicated, hard-working people who earned respect and praise from officers and men. The female endeavors during the war, recognized officially or not, contributed greatly to the overall efforts that were made."],"display_date":"August 11, 1862","search_date":"1862-08-11","locations":[{"id":11591,"lat":34.1745784268,"lng":-79.4302448823,"zoom":8,"place":"MARION, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2995,"title":"Florence, South Carolina Residents Defend Their Home","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-02-01","end_date":"1862-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When the battle came to the home of the residents of Florence, South Carolina, they stood up, assumed their responsibility, and fought it. In February, 1862, a siege was initiated against the section of the Carolinian coast that included Florence. At the time, there were six steamboats at Florence Landing. During the attack, two of these boats were taken by Union forces. The other four, however, were sacrificed to the pride of its Southern owners. The citizens of Florence set fire to and burned the remaining steamboats. They preferred taking their arms into their own hands before giving the Union the opportunity to destroy their property. ","South Carolina also played a special and unique role in the Confederacy, since it was the first state to secede from the Union in December, 1860. It became the leader for the fight to uphold the Southern way of life. The responsibility of secession traced back to its drive to create a new country. Having ignited the whole affair, South Carolina had to assume substantial accountability for whatever ensued. John Moore's statement that South Carolinians bore a burden in the war is supported by the fact that the citizens of South Carolina held their job in special esteem and certain pressure was kept on them to defend their reasoning. The residents of Florence felt this spirit as they defended their home from Union forces.","As evidenced in Florence, the homefront and battle lines can often be one and the same. This statement never rang more true than in the South during the Civil War. Southerners witnessed the bloody battles and violent events unfold right in their own front yards. In South Carolina, almost all of the armed combat it saw took place along the coast. This shoreline region became immensely important for the Confederate cause, as it was vital to the import and export of supplies and communication.

The fife and drum sounded as the company proceeded to the camp of instruction where they were to reside until orders were given. On the streets, women were busy sewing tents and army clothing. Men, with their wives by their sides, went from store to store picking up necessary articles to take off to war.","The men were given orders to march to the City Hotel while their baggage, which consisted of a company mess chest and some boxes of company property, was loaded. Later that day, the company was organized at the hotel. A standard complement of officers and non-commissioned officers for a company of infantry included one captain, two lieutenants, one orderly sergeant, four duty sergeants, and four corporals. The sergeant-major was in charge of requesting the rations, ammunition, arms, and other camp equipment. ","Camp Walker was located at the highest level of land, only a few feet above sea level, in New Orleans. Here the Confederate soldiers encountered swamps filled with drainage from the city and puddles of water and black soli. Three thousand men were stationed in the mile and a half enclosed area.

The company's supplies included twenty tents, eighty-six bed sacks, ten camp kettles, twenty-two mess-pans, and twelve water-pails.

His illustrious military career included leading the Creeks against the British in the War of 1812, defeating the Upper Creek Indians against their Lower Creek foes in the Creek Civil War, and heading a national police force to continue the fight against the Upper Creeks.  Yet, these military conquests also created many enemies, especially among the Upper Creeks.","The final straw for the Upper Creeks was on February 12, 1825, when McIntosh, along with eight like-minded Lower Creek chiefs, signed the Treaty of Indian Springs relinquishing all of the Upper and Lower Creeks' land in Georgia for a sum of 400,000.  In retaliation for losing their land unjustly and because of their hatred for General McIntosh in general, 200 Upper Creek Indians set fire to McIntosh's plantation on April 30 and brutally murdered him in the process.  Little did the Upper Creeks know that they had also upset an entire state of white Georgians.","A few months later, editorialists in the northeast responded to the Creek's loss of land with disdain for the actions of the United States government.  On June 21, 1825, the <em>Southern Recorder</em> responded both to the actions of the Upper Creeks and the reaction of the Yankee editorialists furiously.  ","<em>The Recorder</em> began by mourning the fate of McIntosh, who, the paper claims, sacrificed his life for the Creek Indians.  In their view, he had devoted his life to the progress of his red brethren towards civilized life.  Sadly, their turbulence and treachery had rendered his cause unsuccessful.  ","<em>The Recorder</em> went on to find utmost fault in other newspapers that claimed that McIntosh sought to steal land for the United States from the Creeks by pushing them beyond the Mississippi River and leaving Georgia for the white man.  <em>The Recorder</em> editorialized that by defending the property rights of the Creeks, the eastern editorialists were also condoning the murder of their beloved McIntosh.  ","In fact, the <em>Recorder</em> argued, if the business [of aggression towards the Creeks] had been conducted more energetically on the part of the United States, McIntosh's murder could have been prevented.  In this way, the United States was actually doing the Creeks a favor by forcing the untutored and uncivilized Creeks off of their lands in Georgia.  The Creeks would have likely been better off if they had simply moved west unprovoked because they had no chance in their battles against their American foe.  An earlier withdrawal from Georgia without bloodshed would have saved thousands of Creek and American lives.","The focus of this narrative is the ongoing tension between American and Georgian expansionism against the territorial concerns of the Creek Indians.  Treaties between the Creeks and Georgia helped define the land struggles between the two peoples since late in the 1700s, but violence reigned supreme in the majority of the interactions between the two cultures.  The United States government, especially under the leadership of President Andrew Jackson, violently forced the Creeks out of the state, all while hiding under a similar veil of concern for the Indians that the Recorder showed in this article.  ","The Creeks consistently refused the repeated requests from the United States government that their peoples move out of Georgia without the force of the United States military.  Although in a less organized fashion than that of the United States, the Creeks persisted to fight the Americans over the contested Georgia lands.  While McIntosh's death defined the Indian people to the Recorder, his murder only served as a highlighted event in ongoing strife between the Creeks and the American government over land claims that eventually led to the Trail of Tears and the near extermination of the Creek Indians."],"display_date":"June 21, 1825","search_date":"1825-06-21","locations":[{"id":1522,"lat":33.0721732643,"lng":-83.2584220033,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3013,"title":"Creek Attack\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1825-05-25","end_date":"1825-05-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In late April 1825, with the murder of William McIntosh and his brother Samuel Hawkins fresh on his mind, Benjamin Hawkins carefully rode his horses back towards his hometown of Montgomery, Georgia, in the fear of suffering a similar fate on his brother.

Frightened, a cousin of Hawkins? abruptly fired a blank rifle shot into the air in the hopes of frightening the pack of Creeks.  The Creeks quickly responded, firing towards Hawkins as he wheeled his horse around to gallop in the opposite direction.  Fortunately, Hawkins was not hit.  In the melee that followed the unwelcome encounter, he tossed his plaid cloak aside, only to have it littered with Creek gunfire.  ","As Hawkins rode into the distance, the Creeks rejoiced, presuming from Hawkins? bullet-ridden cloak that Hawkins had either been wounded or killed.  Reports from the Creeks made it back to the Southern Recorder, who reported on May 8 that Benjamin Hawkins had both been murdered by the same pack of Creeks who had killed McIntosh and his brother.

Despite a divide among many Southerners about the honor of accepting federal pension, C.M.B. argues, Why then should ex Confederates prefer to burden their impoverished friends and states, rather than appeal to the generosity of this rich government.As the nineteenth century concluded, questions arose over how to deal with the health of the men the fought in the Civil War. In addition to the massive deaths incurred by both the Confederacy and the Union army, the South was forced to deal with rebuilding infrastructure, developing a new source of economic production, as well as replacing an entire generation of men lost to the war. The difficulties facing the South were furthered by the fact that Southern veterans were denied national pension that was given to aging Union soldiers. As the issue of federal pensions came to light in the final decade of the nineteenth century, many Confederate veterans had claimed that accepting the federal pensions was dishonorable and that self reliance should be the only means of economic viability. Yet, even those who proclaimed the pensions to be dishonorable knew that the lagging economy of the South made it difficult for veterans to afford to remain self-sufficient. Additionally, aging soldiers who lived off their families placed an added burden on their children that did not seem appealing, especially when Northern soldiers received government aid. The story of C.M.B. illustrates an important question regarding how best to deal with the lost cause of the South. The southern states had staked everything on the Civil War, and upon defeat were treated by the North as the losers of the War. The absolute destruction of both the Southern economy and infrastructure placed the South in an era of poverty. Consequently, as aging veterans grew too old to work, many individuals were forced to burden their families with the cost of caring for an additional family member. While industry had slowly returned to many southern cities by 1899, the need for government pensions seemed necessary to the aging veterans.

It lay just two miles north of the Cape Fear River, right on the Atlantic coast. Wilmington was an important port for the export of tar, turpentine, pitch, and lumber. The people of this small North Carolinian town were shrewd, hospitable, intelligent, and not to be beaten at driving a bargain by any Yankee. According to the soldier, we ate, drank and were merry...as in the days before the flood.","The flood that changed the character of Wilmington was the loss of control of the town to Union forces during the Civil War. By the time the Union focused its efforts on Wilmington, many of the other Southern ports had been seized by the Union. This made Wilmington a particularly vital possession for the Confederacy. After an unsuccessful first attempt to capture coastal control, the Union army was able to secure its position in Wilmington with a second endeavor in January of 1865. This victory was extremely monumental for the Northern cause because the control of Wilmington meant that the South had lost one of their very most important ports. Essentially, a lifeline to the South had been cut off, which weakened greatly its already dying cause. ","The capture of Wilmington was devastating not only for the Confederate military cause, but also for the people of the town. They had not seen any action in their town from the North for such a long time they thought they were safe from the perils of war. Residents had lapsed into a dream of security and thought the horrific day was far off. Historians Donald, Baker, and Holt seem to think that the fact that the Confederacy had kept Wilmington so long into the war was unexpected and its loss would be inevitable. However, given the attitude of its residents, not everybody expected the defeat, and it did come as a surprise to some. The loss of control changed the face of Wilmington. Families that had long been established in the area left for the interior of the state, and those that stayed did so because of limited option due to great loses in the war.

The author of the article praises Edgerton's lecture by declaring that A more eloquent prayer, and one adorned with more appropriate literary quotation was probably never addressed to a Charleston audience, and expresses surprise that an Episcopal minister was capable of such oratory."," Throughout the South after the Civil War, the orphaned sons of the Confederacy looked for ways to defend their futile struggle for independence. Recently, historians such as C. Vann Woodward have described a trend amongst former Confederates to explain the war as a Lost Cause, a noble fight that the South was doomed to lose from the beginning. This idea of the Lost Cause allowed Southerners to believe that they had been the superior men, and that their military prowess had allowed them fight on for four years when the Union's overwhelming advantages should have subdued them much more quickly. While this view became prevalent across the South in the late-nineteenth century, it failed to take into account that the Confederacy had several advantages, such as: they did not have to win but only draw, they were more familiar with the terrain they were fighting on, they had shorter supply lines, and public opinion about the war in the Union was divided. Still, this episode shows that while the spirit of defiance remained alive in Charleston, the religious leaders of the late-nineteenth century urged peace and reconciliation with their former enemy."],"display_date":"August 20, 1891","search_date":"1891-08-20","locations":[{"id":11460,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3082,"title":"Laura Merrick Entertains Union Soldiers\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-05-21","end_date":"1863-05-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["While many of their husbands and fathers went to fight in the Civil War, Southern women were often left at home to care for their families.

They strangely requested that Laura sing Bonnie Blue Flag, a Confederate song. Midway through the song Laura burst into tears and ran from the room.

They were headed twenty miles north towards the city of Morehead City, North Carolina, which was situated just opposite Beaufort and in good firing range to Fort Macon. Once the group reached the area near Beaufort, the fortunate receipt of a mistaken letter divulged some valuable information to the Union forces. It described that Fort Macon was garrisoned by about 500 men, but they were heavily in need of fresh provisions. The soldiers in the fort were sick and lacking morale. Barret and Yearns describe the importance of strategy in attacking Fort Macon, and the dismal conditions and their consequences at the fort certainly prove the historians' point. The strong strategy by the North and lack thereof by the South led to the city in which the fort was situated, Beaufort, being taken by the Union by the early summer of 1862. The stars and bars that one flew over Fort Macon no longer remained there, but the stars and stripes were now flying high.

Mr. Conrad delivered a speech on the subject to the meeting in which he discussed the ills inflicted on the southern states by the North such as disregard for run away slave laws and their disregard for the importance of slavery in the South in general. He stated that We assure our northern brethren that the institution against which this insane war is waged, is so interwoven into our social, domestic, and industrial life, that any sudden change would be destructive to us, and even to themselves. While Mr. Conrad made it clear that the citizens of Frederick Country would not tolerate actions against slavery, he also states that secession will only worsen the situation. Mr. Conrad pleads for reconsideration by South Carolina in this statement: Hence; we do not question the power of South Carolina, in virtue of her state sovereignty to absolve her citizens from their allegiance to the federal government. But we do utterly deny her right, under the circumstances that now exist; and as parties to the compact, deeply interested in its fulfillment, we deny that she alone has the right to decide whether adequate cause exists. Mr. Conrad also presented several solutions to the conflict with the North which he suggests giving to the Virginia General Assembly. We may obstruct the wheels of the Federal Government; or defend our Constitutional rights, in arms, under the flag of the Union; and even these extreme measures would be less fatal than a voluntary secession, he stated. He and the members of the meeting agreed that South Carolina did secede the North would be quick to put them back into place and repair their own actions against slavery. The remedy is with our Northern friends: we await their action with trust and confidence that they will now see and appreciate the evil, and apply the proper correctives. "," After the secession of South Carolina the rest of the southern states were left with a very critical decision: stay in the union and allow the north to force its anti-slavery ideals upon the entire south or join the rebellion, unsure of what would come next. The question facing the upper South was not simply whether to secede but whether to aid their brothers farther south. This looming decision divided the South into three sections. The first was made up of those southerners mostly in the lower South who believed in immediate secession, the idea being the quicker secession is accomplished by the south the stronger the statement. The next group was made up of southerners in the upper South with fewer slaves who wished to wait until a group effort by all the states was decided on before seceding. The last group was made up of those who sided with the North and were against secession completely, this seeming to be the group that Mr. Conrad would side with as he confirmed by stating: We have no faith whatever in the success of any southern confederacy of these States, except merely for the temporary object of mutual defense. South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas, being of the immediate secession group, all joined the rebellion with majority votes in their conventions soon after the election of President Abraham Lincoln. About the election of President Lincoln Mr. Conrad stated The election of Mr. Lincoln is recent, was unexpected, fortuitous, and if not already regretted by his supporters, will, in all probability, prove the destruction of his party. Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina also joined the cause with a majority but only after President Lincoln called for a move on South Carolina, being more of the second group. In Virginia the decision on secession was especially important because Virginians were so close to the North and the South at the same time. As Edward Ayers confirmed, More than half of the war's battles were waged with in Virginia's borders, making their decision especially critical.

In 1862, the Confederate State Congress passed a conscription law that called all men in the ages between 15 and 45 into service. Many men did voluntarily fight, and others followed the conscription law so that at one time there were more Texans fighting in the army than votes cast in any of the states elections.

In fact, conscription tended to force the older men who were settled and needed to stay ar home into finding a substitute. While many outwardly voiced disapproval to those who did not go and fight, newspapers were more frequently filled with bids ranging upwards of thousands of dollars to take another's place.

After this dramatic turning point, both the North and South began to take offensive and defensive measures. Suddenly, the nation stood at the threshold of war. Only approximately two weeks after Beauregard's Confederate troops had stormed the national fort, a large group of clergymen from across the state of Mississippi gathered within the walls of a quaint Church on Randolph Street in Holly Springs for the state's Thirty-fifth Annual Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Over the course of three days these men discussed, among other things, the state of the nation and their role as the church within a country at odds. "," For the Bishop's Journal and Address, the Rev. W.M. Green spoke to the gathered assembly. A great deal had occurred in the political realm since they had last met: Their state had joined the Confederacy in January 1861 and troops were being assembled for both the Union and Confederacy. An eventful year has passed over us since we last took counsel together, remarked Green. The revolution which has been forced upon us, has been effected in a manner no less wonderful than grateful to every heart. What may yet be in reserve for us, we cannot tell. In the hands of the wise and merciful God of Nations, we must leave our country, with the earnest supplications of Christian hearts, and the firm resolves of patriots trusting in the righteousness of their cause. "," During the Civil War, faith and morale were closely linked. The Confederacy believed their cause to be righteous in the eyes of God, a belief that served as a patriotic rallying point for the South. God is on our side was the cry of many. Southern citizens and soldiers saw military men such as Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee to be divinely inspired leaders in whom they could trust and depend upon. With each Confederate victory on the battlefield God's preference was confirmed. The church played a large part in continuing to foster this faith in the Confederate war effort by continually deeming it a divinely righteous cause. The Protestant Episcopal Church, as well as other southern protestant denominations, formed a core of stability that fueled the people's fiery spirits of nationalism."],"display_date":"April 25, 1861 - April 27, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-26","locations":[{"id":7173,"lat":34.7662259669,"lng":-89.4795664639,"zoom":9,"place":"MARSHALL, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3200,"title":"The Anticipation of War News\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-10-03","end_date":"1863-10-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1863 the state of Mississippi found itself entrenched in a massive war of attrition against its northern neighbors. Men from the South donned gray and marched off to battle, leaving those who did not join the ranks to fend for themselves on the home front. Rev. Samuel Agnew of Lee, Mississippi was one of these individuals. Agnew and others like himself found that they could not easily keep the Civil War from pressing into the forefront of their minds. The War evaded every aspect of southerners' lives and affected their attitudes and actions day in and day out. For some, the War came to their very doorstep. Crops became earthworks and homes transformed into hospitals and army headquarters. For others, the War seemed more like an encroaching storm that affected their very way of life. These citizens, as those of Lee, Mississippi in 1863, depended on news from the front in order to keep abreast of the state of the War. However, on days when no news arrived it left many southerners disconcerted and on edge, unaware of how things were shaping up. On these particular days, time stood still. "," In his diary entry on October 3, 1863 Agnew remarked, I have not noticed anyone passing the road today and consequently have no news. Everything is quiet and still and dull. I have done nothing but loll about and scribble....It is unusual for me not to hear some rumors and reports every day but today I have none. Up until this point Agnew's diary had covered any and every small bit of news that he had received on the War and the most current political situation. Each entry went into great detail about battle action, accompanied by a list of familiar names of those who had fallen. The entry for October 3 is starkly different from the rest. No news had arrived that day. Not one person had even come through town to give any indication of rumor. Agnew frustratingly had nothing to report. "," Daily life for those on the home front during the Civil War was tedious. Men and women continued with the necessities of home and work as best they could, all while on edge with anticipation of hearing word from the front. As Agnew's diary illustrates, Southern communities hinged on any word received from the battlefield. On days when no news arrived communities were left hanging in suspense, not knowing if a battle had ensued, which side was victorious, or who had fallen. The Southern home front thrived off of the reports they received from the field. These reports helped tie the world of the soldier and the life of the citizen together.

Just as the nation had fought off a tyrannically government in 1776, they too were freeing themselves from the chains of tyranny that they believed the United States government now held them in.

In fact, they raided and looted all across Texas in response to the constant threat of losing even more territory. While Indians succeeded by burning stations and driving settlers from their homes, their actions spurred many more debates, conventions, and other attempts to deal with the Indians. One attempt to coexist with the Indians was through the creation of reservations. Some Indians were able to acclimate, while others with a more nomadic lifestyle found it quite difficult. Tensions continued between the Indians and settlers as more settlers encroached on the reservation land and Indians continued to raid and roam throughout Texas and Mexico. In fact, the dangerous raids and attacks performed by the Indians forced several local volunteer units and the United States army to become involved. A convention was later assembled that structured and firmly established the United States and Texas's view of the Indian nuisance. The resolutions of Dr. R. G. Worrall of Jacksboro, adopted in Galveston in April, 1860, articulated the general public sentiment by stating All Indians were hostile and should be exterminated or expelled from the State and that the frontier must not be contracted.

The structure of society was changing around them, and many had trouble with the rising stature of blacks in society, even when it came to matters of national security. Raleigh Green, in a June 10, 1898 editorial, expressed his particular aggravation that white southern men were expected to salute African American officers. While Green recognized that all blacks were free, he continued to accept a central principle of slavery: blacks are inferior to whites. Green explained that respect for black officers was causing a great deal of unnecessary discussion with Spain. Green argued that any black officer who expected a southern white solder to salute him would be consistently disappointed. To solve this foolishness, Green explained that any black soldier who did not want to fight in the Spanish American war should go home. Green bluntly stated that black soldiers were vestigial to the American military; the American military did not need their services. He concluded his editorial by saying of qualified black soldiers, however we are glad to be able to express it as an opinion that such colored men here in the south are few and far between.","Racial tension in America was so strong it played a role in the Spanish-American war. When the Maine was sunk in 1898, President William McKinley was forced to move the nation into war. Some blacks saw this as an opportunity to advance their social position. Booker T. Washington proclaimed himself willing to take responsibility for recruiting soldiers who would gladly fight on behalf of the United States. Not all blacks saw war as a positive force. Some argued that the war was only arming the very people that abused African Americans. Others considered it ironic that blacks were fighting for the freedom of Cubans when blacks endured obstacles to their own freedom at home. Furthermore, some worried that the Spanish American war would serve as a distraction from these injustices. ","Although, Green told those blacks who didn't want to fight to go home, this was not a viable option. As Edward Ayers explains, any soldier who had been enlisted in the military long before 1898 had no choice but to fight in Cuba. Although many of these troops were courageous soldiers, they received little recognition. One sergeant explained it mattered not if we were soldiers of the United States, we were 'niggers' as they call us and they treated us with contempt. Many white citizens and newspapers made it clear that any black soldier stationed in their area would be expected to stay in their place. Blacks, however, were also clear that they demanded equality. In the end, however, Ayers concludes that the experience of the Spanish-American war, far from helping race relations in America, accelerated their decline.

Making his way through a swampy pine barren, Ruffin found little trace of any cultivation or civilized inhabitation. The few people in the area raised cattle and, since their animals grazed on the open land, the concept of property ownership was completely foreign to these miserable people. Ruffin scorned the crude capitalists, for some of them owned 500 to 1,000 head of cattle and not a single acre of land. In his private diary, Ruffin noted that these men belonged to a peculiar class: In about a space of 10 miles square of Williamsburg and Georgetown districts, the inhabitants are wretchedly poor, have no slaves, scarcely any other property, and almost no agricultural labor or regular industry of any kind. The men live by hunting, often helped out by petty pillage or trespass on the neighboring properties. These people, and even the more industrious and honest of the poor in lower S. Ca. are a most wretched and worthless population - compared to those whose condition that of the slaves is one not only of greatly superior comfort and happiness, but also of respectability and dignity.","Edmund Ruffin had been commissioned by James Hammond, then governor of South Carolina, to perform an agricultural and geological survey of the state. Ruffin had developed new methods of using calcerous manures to improve the fertility of soil, and some South Carolinians hoped that agricultural reform would help develop the economy and preserve the institution of slavery. Ruffin was always a renowned advocate for secession and an ardent believer in the inferiority of the black race.","Ruffin's disdain for the poor whites of South Carolina's coastal plain demonstrates the power of class in antebellum society. Notions of class were always intertwined with the institution of slavery. In his account, Ruffin immediately emphasized that these people owned no slaves, consigning themselves to a pitiful class. But as Stephanie McCurry demonstrates in <em>Masters of Small Worlds</em>, the intricate relationships of power within the yeoman household were just as significant as those more conspicuous class tensions between plantation owners and yeoman farmers. Poor white men set boundaries of power within their household that defined the roles of their wives and their laborers.

The movement of the Union army through southern crop lands and towns not only destroyed the moral of the southerners, but it ruined crops, houses were burned and other property was destroyed. Southern railways were also almost entirely destroyed, leaving southerners no way to ship what little goods they had left to make any money. War time destruction had resulted in a drastic lowering of the assessed value of Southern farm lands, which in turn required that the tax rate increase Boles asserts. Many southerners could not afford this higher tax rate compiled with the worthlessness of their property and the loss of the free work force they had become so dependent on.

Davis spoke of the differences between Maine and Mississippi and explained that these differences between the all of the states are what made the United States unique. He expressed how each state had something different to offer the Nation, which made their unity as a country more crucial. Only three years after this eloquent speech in Maine, Jefferson Davis ironically found himself seated in Richmond, Virginia as the President of the Confederate States of America. Davis' speech in 1858 gives evidence to the fact that he and his fellow Mississippians had no clue a major war that would divide the nation was in the making. In 1858, Mississippi and the rest of the South considered themselves part of the great United States.

At the Pond plantation the horses had been hidden in the woods once it was learned that Union forces were close by.

Soon after receiving such a high honor, Carter fell in battle, becoming one of many left strewn across the field that bloody day. "," On June 18, 1884, Capt. James Barron Hope asked those assembled from Pickett-Buchanan Camp of ex-Confederates and from the city of Norfolk to remember the sacrifices of fellow soldiers. He spoke of warriors like Capt. Williams, who never returned and whose resting spots constituted Virginia's most precious jewels. All those assembled witnessed the dedication of a Confederate memorial to honor the memory of fallen veterans and the Cause, though lost a cause which our brothers believed was right and which we believe is right today. After a solemn procession and readings of poems heavily laced with heroic imagery, the audience gathered as Confederates and declared each 18 of June a memorial day to those they would never forget. "," Southern romanticism with the Lost Cause and the Confederacy grew along with the increasing manifestation of a New South towards the end of the nineteenth century. The South suffered from a prevailing sense of inferiority and a constant need for justifying such a position, and the years of Southern reconciliation witnessed the peak in this cult of the Confederacy. The older generation recoiled as the younger generation embraced Yankee values and forgot or misunderstood what the veterans had fought for. Thus, the former Confederates felt compelled to make their offspring remember a society they saw evaporating before their eyes. By 1896, 75 percent of former Confederate counties had United Confederate Veterans groups, representing a third of the ex-southern soldiers still living. For similar reasons, women formed the Daughters of the Confederacy, which sought to raise money for building monuments, like the one in Norfolk, to make this past permanent. One of the biggest celebrations occurred in Richmond, where in 1890 100,000 people gathered to raise the Robert E. Lee monument. "," Ironically, some advocates pushing towards a New South, sought out Confederate imagery to help legitimize their projects. Railroads, oftentimes, would locate an impoverished, old Confederate general, and put his name on their letter-head as effective advertising. Even a new style of American literature played a key role in reassembling the values and virtues of the fabled Southern aristocracy. Fiction became distinctively Confederate in sympathy in a way that had not even existed in the ante-bellum South's defense of its peculiar practices. Northern authors even carried this theme. Likewise, one saw an increase in genealogy, as people tried to connect themselves to these lost heroes of the past. Eventually, those groups using Lost Cause imagery to profit no longer needed it, while those who truly embodied it gradually died off. Though perhaps diminishing in numbers, this undercurrent of Confederate nostalgia (especially seen in race relations) would remain into the twentieth century.

Sherman encountered little resistance during his ?March to the Sea? and when he arrived outside of Savannah on December 10, the Civil War was essentially over. Union General Ulysses S. Grant had Robert E. Lee pinned down outside of Richmond while Confederate General John Bell Hood had encountered stiff resistance from Union forces in Tennessee."," The fall of Savannah was not as significant as the capture of Atlanta but it was nonetheless a severe blow to the morale of the Confederacy. Sherman used the city as a springboard for his ensuing drive north into South Carolina. On February 17, 1865 Sherman arrived at the state capital of South Carolina, Columbia, where his troops set fires that burned the majority of the central part of the city to the ground.

On April 18, 1831, a duel took place in Richmond, Virginia, between a Mr. Prior and a Mr. Rae. Both gentleman resided in the central Virginia region and were of the wealthy class among their local communities. The fight began over a dispute about the Hampton Academy, a topic of much debate over the past 18 months. Mr. Prior suffered no injuries during the incident while Mr. Rae was shot in both legs. He then was carried many miles to safety which only aggravated his injuries even more and brought him closer to his death. "," This story of Mr. Prior and Mr. Rae, published in the Virginia Herald newspaper, illustrates an important idea concerning the personality of southern white men during this time period. Above all else, honor was the most essential characteristic a white man could have. It was what separated him from the blacks, and what helped him gain the respect and admiration of his peers in the community. Kenneth Greenberg, in Honor & Slavery, describes southern white men as superficial. He states that They were concerned, to a degree we would consider unusual, with the surface of things-with the world of appearances. Southerners took pride in their words as well as the general appearance they displayed to the world. The quarrels often originated from accusations, insulting words, or verbal disagreements. If a man questioned another man's words or negatively commented on his outlook, many were willing to fight to the death over it. ","It is very important to see how Mr. Prior and Mr. Rae were willing to put their lives on the line for what we would see as trivial instances of name calling and verbal disagreement. For them, these were profoundly important instances that called into question their trustworthiness and honor. Greenberg recognizes the minor importance of death when he says, Free and honorable gentlemen were not afraid to die because they believed that mastery over the fear of death seemed a precondition for life as free men. This helps us understand the great value of honor among men in central Virginia during that time and how their words and appearance were so significantly important to them."],"display_date":"April 18, 1831","search_date":"1831-04-18","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3404,"title":"The Poetry of Henry Clarkson\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-01-01","end_date":"1898-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1898, Henry Clarkson published a collection of poems called Songs of Love and War. In his collection, he portrayed the soldiers of the South as heroes. Clarkson had first hand experience in the Civil War. He trained as a physician and performed medical duties as a member of the army. After the war, he settled permanently in Haymarket, in Prince William County, Virginia. He continued to practice medicine, but he also wrote poetry throughout his life. In some of his poems Clarkson expressed ideas about the Civil War that were in accord with those espoused by the Lost Cause movement popular at the end of the nineteenth century. In fact, he had been referred to as the poet laureate of the Lost Cause. As such, Clarkson was representative of the effort in the South to justify the cause of the war, to sentimentalize the antebellum South, and to glorify the Confederate soldier.","In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Virginia and the South at large were concerned about the reputation of Southern states. The Lost Cause theory, in part, was a solution to this concern. This theory consisted of three principal arguments. The first was that the South was constitutionally justified in seceding. Second, the South was not defeated but had been overwhelmed by greater numbers and resources. Third, the antebellum South was more concerned with honor and duty than financial success. The theory, in general, argued that racial harmony existed prior to the Civil War and the North was to blame for stirring up racial tensions. In order to make sure that this interpretation lived on, southern states created works, such as monuments, that portrayed Confederate soldiers as heroes. The monument erected in Fairfax cemetery speaks of soldiers whom death could not terrify and whom defeat could not dishonor. Those espousing the Lost Cause point of view hoped that such sentiments would make a lasting impression on generations to come. The Confederacy had lost the war, but it was determined to present itself during the peace on its own terms.

The newspapers prior to the Civil War are full of reminders that not all people were in fact equal. Two adds in The Valley Star (the primary newspaper in Lexington, Virginia) were surprisingly similar: one describing a lost horse and the other a lost slave. In Virginia at the time, the two were very similar. Both were considered property and both influenced the livelihood of a farmer. Although many southern planters did feel that slavery was unjust, they could not imagine life without it. The main reason the South was in such disrepair after the Civil War was because the ruling class, the slaveholders, had completely lost its livelihood. The war had taken their property.","On January 18, 1949, Clayton Coleman published an ad in The Valley Star concerning his runaway. LOOK OUT FOR A RUNAWAY 50 REWARD.

The traders were not considered to be the nicest of men, but it was a business, and they were in it to make money. Local traders would start small, and gradually build their enterprises. Sales were commonly made from farm to farm within a region. An ad directly above the aforementioned runaway notice declared a sale of slaves because of the owner's death. The attorney auctioned off ten slaves, including a mother and her three boys under the age of 9. It is presumed that this family would be split among different farms in the region; a reality that was a constant incentive for slaves to behave. ","With the Compromise of 1850 came a tightening of the Fugitive Slave Act. Anyone who helped a slave escape would be punished. Northern abolitionists found this to be preposterous; in fact, both the North and the South hated the compromise.

In fact, the governments of the United States and Spain were currently attempting to ratify a treaty outlining once and for all the borders between American Louisiana and Spanish Texas. This band of adventurers did not have the authority to attack Texas, and yet, until the end of July of that year, news of military preparation against Texas persistently crept east to Baltimore, Boston, and Washington, D.C. On July 19, the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> poked fun at the brazen upstarts, who they believed to have been duped into joining the expedition to fight along side the famous guerilla leader, Xavier Mina.","Xavier Mina was forced to flee Spain in 1814 when he opposed the restored Spanish monarch, Ferdinand VII. Mina then attempted to attack Ferdinand VII through an invasion of Spanish Mexico. His efforts were thwarted and he was executed by firing squad on November 11, 1817. A contingent of his force against the Spanish was led by American Colonel Henry Perry. Perry also died in the attempted coup; only four of his men escaped the battle that claimed their commander's life and eventually made their way to Natchitoches, Louisiana.

When this process was complete and Tennessee was admitted into the union he was offered a seat in the House of Representatives but later transferred to the United States senate. After occupying this position he then moved on to become a judge of the Supreme Court of law and equity of Tennessee. He held this position for a few years then moved on to become a general in the military. ","General Andrew Jackson recruited men from Tennessee to join him in arms and traveled around the country fighting battles and protecting the boarders of the United States.

Jackson's triumph as a military leader impressed the nation and lead to suggestions for him to join the presidential race.

This message was relayed to Georgia Governor Joseph Emerson Brown in a letter he received from Commanding General Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard on December 2, 1862."," As quoted from Beauregard in his letter to Governor Brown, ?The general plan of obstruction I have adopted for shallow rivers is simple, easily constructed, of little cost, and I hope will prove very effectual.

Beauregard also noted that Howard was left in charge of protecting the blockade and battery placed near Lake Bluff. "," The lack of a viable and extensive railroad system in the South meant that during the Civil War the Confederacy relied heavily on inland waterways to move goods and troops quickly from place to place. However, once Union forces penetrated this infrastructure they used the rivers to their advantage just as frequently. In southern Georgia, the Altamaha River was a main source of transportation for both sides. Formed by the confluence of the Ocmulgee and Oconee rivers near Lumber City, Georgia and joined farther downstream by the Ohoopee River, the Altamaha flows more than 130 miles to the Atlantic Ocean where it empties into the sea north of Brunswick, Georgia.  Obstructing the Altamaha River prevented inland Union troops from connecting via waterway with their fellow naval forces off the coast of Georgia. This not only blocked Federal vessels from moving further inland to penetrate the Georgia heartland but it also severed lines of communication between the two forces. With the Federal navy blockading the Atlantic coastline, the Southern cotton pipeline with England was slowed immensely, severely constricting the Confederate economy. Cutting the two forces in half gave Confederate blockade runners a better shot at breaking through the Union barricade. Before Union troops invaded the Southern states, the multitude of streams, creeks and rivers that wound through Georgia worked as an excellent thoroughfare for Confederate forces to utilize.

It announced that the steamship New Orleans, along with her captain, Captain Auld, had departed from the city the previous night, headed for Mexico. On board was a full ship's worth of passengers, both men and animals. The full inventory consisted of 151 horses, Captain Dobbius' company 4th Infantry, Captain Featherstone's company Louisiana Volunteers and 50 quartermaster's men."," These men were leaving behind the humid, crowded and filthy streets of New Orleans for another undesirable location: a war zone close to Mexico City, Mexico. They arrived back on land likely just in time to play a part in the last major battle of the Mexican War at Contreras. At this site, Mexico sustained over 700 casualties while the United States walked away with a mere 60. The Mexican War officially began on April 25, 1846, when Mexicans opened fire on Americans in southern Texas. Although the Mexicans appeared to start the war in the sense that they did fire the first shots, Americans can be considered the true instigator: Texas had declared itself to be an independent republic from Mexico in 1835, but it essentially remained Mexican territory until the United States annexed it ten years later. "," This annexation may have been a conscious part on then-President Polk's part to actively cause a war with the intention of winning and gaining land. After all, Mexico had plenty of territory after which the United States lusted, and America did emerge from the war with both California and parts of the modern day Southwest. This war did not have the same urgency that past wars fought on American soil had had: never were the war strategizers worried that they would lose. The United States was cool and collected in comparison to the disorganized and flustered Mexican government, and the possibility of anything but a victory seemed remote at best. Regardless of the United States' confidence, they continued to battle bravely in Mexico. A year prior to Captain Auld's departure for Mexico, the Mexican President had claimed that his soldiers would not only regain control of Texas, but also work their way into the existing states - a few cities in Louisiana in particular.

Taking care of day-to-day business without a husband and father in the rough settlement of San Felipe de Austin was not an easy feat.

Brown was taking part in an exploration of the upper colonies of Texas, and his party's horses were stolen in an Indian raid. However, the settlers vowed to pursue the marauders and not to return until their stolen property was recovered. Additionally disturbing was the fact that Indians had recently committed several such attacks in the upper colonies. ","The fact that even in the sparsely populated lands of Mexico's northern colonies Brown and other Anglo-Americans were involved in conflicts with Indians was indicative of the Indians' struggles within the United States. Interestingly, the Indians of the upper colonies were not all native to the area. In fact, as a result of persecution within the United States, many of the Indians with whom the Anglo-American settlers interacted were displaced members of the Cherokee tribe. After the American Revolution, a large number of Cherokee left their traditional homes in the southeastern part of the United States, and moved west to Louisiana, then owned by the far more welcoming Spanish. As time passed, more and more Cherokee who found their eastern homes encroached upon by white settlers joined their tribal brethren to the west. Following the U.S. purchase of Louisiana, many Cherokee again moved, now seeking to live under the friendlier Spanish government in Texas. As time passed, Anglo-American settlers as well as the Spanish government again threatened the Cherokee Indians. Cherokee leaders actually applied for a formal land grant in order to legally secure their lands from other settlers, but they correctly interpreted repeated delays in their application's approval as a portent of eventual rejection. By 1826, the Cherokee were desperate enough to take part in an armed insurrection against the Mexican government, along with some Anglo-American settlers and other indigenous groups. The revolt was crushed by Mexican troops with the aid of volunteers from the more established American colonies. ","The plight of the Cherokee in Texas was merely a later chapter in their great struggle resulting from the colonization of their native lands. Throughout the history of the South, Indians occupied large portions of the region's soil and directly influenced politics, agriculture, and other aspects of Southern life. It was not until approximately 30 years before the Civil War that the Indian populations of the South were forcibly removed from the area. However, with the continual westward movement of settlers, political and physical conflict between Anglo-Americans and Indians would continue to be a factor in shaping the country for years to come."],"display_date":"January 13, 1831","search_date":"1831-01-13","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3508,"title":"A Contraband Works for the Union\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-14","end_date":"1862-04-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The contraband only spent a short time working for James D. Templeton's brigade before his death, but in that time the ex-slave managed to leave a lasting impression. Templeton was a young Union soldier from Savannah, Ohio who took part in several major battles of the Civil War, including Antietam. He spent much of his first two years in the mountains of West Virginia, as the horn player in a military band attached to Rutherford B. Hayes' 23rd Ohio Infantry. On April 14, 1862, he wrote home to his parents to describe a former slave, or contraband, who came in about a week ago and began to work for the brigade. Templeton described the man as a very pleasant fellow and works well. Says he will stay with us and go with us home. Two weeks later, his parents received another letter mentioning the escapee, this time to relay the facts of his death. You remember I told you we had a contraband at work for us? He took sick and died very suddenly on Tuesday last. We did all we could for him. He was only sick two days. The doctor pronounced his disease inflammation of the stomach. He was a fine fellow and we miss him very much. ","As slaves fled from their former owners during the chaos of war, they often attached themselves to the advancing Union army. Though some slaves attempted to make the dangerous journey to the states of the Union, the advancing northern army was often the closest and safest option. Everywhere the northerners went, escaped slaves followed, usually to be held by the advancing army as contraband from the enemy. The Virginia-West Virginia border provided a perfect opportunity for many other slaves to escape, as West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863 on the condition it would be a free state with a plan of gradual emancipation for those currently enslaved. Since the state shared a long border with the largest slaveholding state in the Confederacy, Virginia, it was a popular escape route for many slaves. ","As Templeton's letter indicates, the new contraband went to work for the soldiers of the Union brigade. All over the South, contrabands worked for the northern army in many different roles, as laborers, hospital workers, cooks, and often body servants for federal officers. They became a vital part of the workings of the Union army. Slaves were even put to work for the Confederate cause, usually pressed into building trenches or fortifications, and thousands went into the field with their masters as personal servants. By the end of the war, Jefferson Davis was even pressing for the conscription of slaves into the Confederate army, with promises of freedom for those who volunteered. Though this Southern plan was never put into action, the North did indeed recruit and arm runaway slaves, as well as free blacks from the northern states. In this capacity, many African Americans served with honor and distinction.

Though the order was taken from the Lynchburg Virginian, it was reprinted in the Marion Ensign and all over the South. It also indicated that those men who had previously been designated for light duty, should report to training camps, or be immediately sent to the front. ","Virginia had experienced some of the worst ravages of the Civil War by late 1864, and almost 75% of its eligible male population had joined the Confederate Army. But the desperate straits the Confederate government found itself in by this late date forced the implementation of drastic measures. In this case, all men formerly on detail who had been assigned specific tasks behind the lines, as well as those on furlough (granted leave by their superiors) were immediately called back into service. The calling up of those who had been given light duty is another indication of the manpower problems the South was facing in the waning days of the Civil War. Light duty was usually assigned to those who had been previously injured or otherwise declared unfit for active service. The Confederacy had only about six more months of existence by October of 1864, but the government was doing everything it could possibly do to survive.","By 1864, however, a quarter to a third of the soldiers east of the Mississippi River were conscripts. The conscripts were despised by volunteer soldiers, and were considered less reliable on the battlefield and more likely to desert. But conscription laws had been in place in the Confederacy since 1863, when an order was issued for all eligible men between the ages of 18 and 35 to join the army. By 1865, the minimum age of recruits had been lowered to 17, while the maximum age was extended to 50. At this point, the government of the Confederacy was even considering allowing slaves to fight for the South in return for their freedom. The measure was actually passed in March of 1865, but the war was over before any slaves could actually be put into the battlefield.","Though conscripts did make up a significant minority of the Confederate Army at the end of the war, the loyalty of most Southerners never waned. In fact, in many cases the more hopeless victory appeared, the more patriotic many Virginians came. This pattern was reflected in many areas of the South, and its effects would be felt long after Lee's approaching surrender at Appomattox.

But there were many in the South who dissented from this opinion, who held steadfast to the ideal that slavery was a just institution. E.W. Taylor was one of them. Taylor, who moved to Charleston from the North to become a slave owner, enjoyed the perks of ownership to the fullest extent. Presumably a bachelor, Taylor realized soon after making his purchase how enjoyable it was to have a female to make his house into a home. To Taylor, having a woman to cook his meals and clean house was the best gift slavery could offer. ","However, soon after his arrival in the South, Taylor was inundated with of anti-slavery propaganda from Northern abolitionists. Concluding that the actions of these abolitionists had the potential to cause separation of the Union, he was of the belief that abolitionists should pay attention to their own affairs. Many Southerners like Taylor believed that slavery was not the cruel institution portrayed by Northern abolitionist. In an 1837 letter to Jeremiah Wilbur, a friend from New York, he recounted the tale of a minister from the North who met a wealthy slave-owning woman from the South. Up until that point, the minister had made it known that he was against slavery and for abolition. However, the minister and the woman fell in love, and the minister began to change his previous thinking. He began to rant against Northern abolitionists and Northerners in general. Ironically, he had once been an abolitionist himself.","Abolitionism was a great concern for many in Charleston. Like Taylor, prominent members of Charleston society feared that if slavery was abolished, hired labor would come to resemble hired labor in the North- a cruel, cautionary tale against capitalism. Abolitionists were only causing distress in Southern cities like Charleston. ","Taylor's views on slavery and abolitionism echoed those of many Southerners, especially those who resented being inundated with propaganda. Abolitionists accused slaveholders of many cruelties, including forced reproduction and childbearing of female slaves, and not allowing slaves to practice religion, just to name a few. According to historian Ira Berlin, abolitionists experienced difficulty proving many of these accusations, but the mere appearance of those caused uproar in the South and planted the seeds of disunion, as seen in Taylor's letter. E.W. Taylor exemplified Southerners for whom abolitionist propaganda from perceived hypocrites raised the spectre of disunion. Yet, many Northern abolitionists were, in fact, free blacks who were drawing on their own experiences in captivity for information for said abolitionist propaganda."],"display_date":"January 25, 1837","search_date":"1837-01-25","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3532,"title":"Charleston Women Discuss Support of States Rights\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-01-07","end_date":"1833-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Women like Laura Margaret Cole Smith of South Carolina were not blind to the implications of politics for the Union as a whole. Upon receiving news of the 1832 Nullification Crisis, Laura wrote to her cousin Camille explaining her opinions on the state of the Union. Smith held steadfastly to her belief in South Carolina's states rights. Although the prospect of war saddened her because her father and brothers would have to fight, she believed that it was important for South Carolina to preserve its liberty instead of conceding to the Union. South Carolina was discussing war and succession far before states like Virginia.","The Nullification Crisis was not the first time that the slavery/anti-slavery debate had threatened American political stability. In signing the Tariff Act of 1832, President Andrew Jackson pushed a previous tariff struggle that had been brewing between South Carolina and the federal government to a climax. Tariffs previously established in 1828 had been deemed by South Carolinians unconstitutional because they taxed imported goods, which were popular in the states, more heavily than those made in the North. In the view of many South Carolina planters, the North was being favored by this tariff, and the economic problems of the Carolina rice culture were being ignored. In addition, they saw themselves as unnecessarily persecuted because South Carolina was a slave state. Jackson signed a new Tariff Act in 1832 that lowered the tax somewhat; however, South Carolinians had hoped he would do away with the law all together. In November 1832, the South Carolina assembly came together in a special session to declare the tariffs null and void in South Carolina. It became a struggle of states rights versus federal rights, now known as the Nullification Crisis. ","Letters like Smith's of January 1833 also show that Southern women before the Civil War were required to be involved enough in political affairs to be able to support their husband's or father's political opinions. Their opinions were usually congruent with that of the male members of the families. Sally G. McMillen confirms that women were expected to have the same views as the men in their families in her article Women in the Old South. Interestingly, in Harry L. Watson's long description of the Nullification Crisis in his book Liberty and Power, he does not even allude to women being involved in the political front at all, because, quite frankly, they were not. Although women could discuss politics and support the opinions of their families' males, they did not have a say in politics and were not allowed to vote, showing that women were expected to fulfill the traditional female role of family caregiver. Laura addressed her father and brother in the beginning of the letter; they were absent from the home, and she wished for their return, showing how much she cared for them. Speculation leads us to the conclusion that they were dealing with the nullification crisis in a political context. In addition, she commented that she had discussed the issue of nullification in private with the gentlemen in her life; they were grateful for her support."],"display_date":"January 7, 1833","search_date":"1833-01-07","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3552,"title":"Support for Jackson \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-01-01","end_date":"1819-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In March of 1818, Jackson invaded Florida, brought down Fort Negro, and seized parts of Florida, which was under Spanish control. Jackson's actions caused international repercussions. Spain protested the invasion, which led to the halt of negotiations to buy Spanish Florida. The invasion, also, led Britain to protest the execution of two of its subjects who had never entered the United State territory, and led Congress to hold hearings to discuss the irregularities of the Ambrister and Arbuthnot trials and to decide what to do about Jackson's actions. ","Representative Cobb of Georgia introduced resolutions condemning Jackson's actions in the House in 1819. Shortly after, Representative Tallmadge gave a speech, as well, on the Seminole War, where he showed his support for Jackson's actions and his opposition for the resolutions. Other representatives such as Henry Clay showed opposition for Jackson while others supported Jackson's actions such as Representative Holmes. Both Homles and Clay along with many other representatives delivered their speeches on the issue at hand. After every representative, who wanted to speak, spoke, Jackson ended up being victorious once again, but instead of being victorious on Florida soil, he was now victorious in the House of Representatives. ","Jackson was too popular for the resolutions to pass and some of the representatives knew this fact. Some opponents who knew about Jackson's popularity did not want to give in to the assumption of Jackson's popularity. Yet, the Representatives' outcomes were in accordance with the public's opinion. If it were up to the citizens to deliver speeches, there is a good chance that Jackson would have gained support for his actions since the majority of public opinion claimed Jackson was a hero.   ","Although, the speeches did not take place in Florida, these speeches are critical part of the history of the Seminole War, which was a local problem through out Florida. News of the debate on the resolutions and the outcome in the House of Representatives were in newspapers all over the United States letting everyone know, even the settlers in Florida, what they would anticipate. In addition, the fact that the resolutions failed to pass was important to history because it meant that tensions between the Seminoles and white settlers would only increase. Shortly after, the Indians began to retaliate and attack white settlers in Florida and Georgia. ","If the resolutions would have gained more support and passed, it was possible that the continuation of the Seminole Wars might not have occurred or would have occurred at a different time changing history, as we know it. Although, Jackson was victorious and the resolutions did not pass, debate on the Seminole War was not over. A couple years later, Congress would resume its discussion on if the war with the Seminoles in Florida would be worth the trouble.

This of course was all made possible by the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, which officially sanctioned the integration of African Americans into both the federal army and navy. Although blacks were being given their freedom and were participating in the war alongside whites, they nevertheless continued to receive inferior treatment.

Edward Scott had offered his land to build the first courthouse, in the hopes that commerce would develop nearby and increase the value of his large patent. The proximity of the site to a section of the James River especially conducive to crossing aided this stratagem. In the coming decades Scott's Landing developed into the most important port upstream of Richmond. Various Scotts and nearby merchants tried for years to incorporate the settlement as an official town, but none were successful until John III, in 1818; the town was called Scottsville, and contained dozens of lots on land donated by John. In the following two years the town was party to other favorable developments. The founding of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville promised to bring large shipments of building supplies through Scottsville's warehouses. In the 1810s the state government chartered two stock companies that enabled Scottsville to act as a hub of transportation: one to build a toll road from Staunton, one to improve canals along the James up from Richmond. In spite of these promising developments, John Scott, by fall of 1821, began auctioning off his estate. He described it as the most valuable real estate in Virginia Containing about 15 Hundred Acres. Four hundred of which are Low Grounds, Inferior to none on the stream. He sold the estate at public auction on the premises, emphasizing the 'high state of cultivation' [and] Elegant Building, also offering the stock and crops of the estate, plus a valuable tract of woodland. Curiously, Scott only managed to sell part of this magnificent estate in 1821, and had to hold another auction in 1822.","In the advertisement for his auction, Scott declared that he was intending to remove to the South. Though born in Albemarle, Scott had already lived in the South some years, practicing medicine in Alabama. Like thousands of Virginians, he may have gone down South in the years following the War of 1812, to make a life in one of the new towns that cropped up all over the territory acquired from the post-war Indian treaties. Scott probably only returned east when he inherited the Scottsville estate upon his grandfather's death. Upon receiving his inheritance, he may have discovered himself unaccustomed to estate operation, and wished to return to his medical practice. Another possibility is that the general economic atmosphere discouraged him from focusing his life on the estate. Although the factors mentioned above aided the economy in Scottsville, the overall Virginia economy had been sluggish ever since the national Panic of 1819.

An understanding of militia as noble and proficient fighters - the myth of the citizen soldier - became an entrenched American image in the wake of war, after the Revolution and Jackson-era conflicts especially. In spite of this image, in reality militias were almost never outstanding military units, and fought much more inconsistently than trained infantry units. The presence of militia in an army often vexed the efforts of the officers and organized units that they were attached to. Additionally, militias were notoriously poorly-armed. In 1820, less than one half of militia members in the United States owned any gun, let alone a well-maintained musket. Less than one fifth of white men owned a gun. Before the firearm industry developed in the United States, bringing down the cost of guns and ammunition, to own, maintain, and practice with a gun was a very expensive and impractical proposition for the vast majority of Americans. Playing with a gun was too expensive for people who worked all day. Dedicated farming provided food much more reliable than tromping around the woods on a hunt. While the first U.S. Militia Act in 1792 mandated that militia members arm themselves, very few American men actually complied. In consequence, successive national acts through 1808 shifted the financial responsibility of armament to states and the federal government.","Southern militia envisioned themselves as symbolic inheritors either of a Revolution tradition, or of a composite English tradition formed from images of refined gentry, mounted Cavaliers, and staunch Normans. Practically speaking, militia musters at this time were not particularly military affairs. Musters were often extremely social events that entailed more alcohol than target-practice (which some militias in southern states abandoned because it was too embarrassing). The defense of states rights against an aggressive national government was a key reason that militia had been preserved since the founding of the United States. While militia in southern states seized upon this purpose when war against the North erupted in the 1860s, the possibility of deployment against fellow Americans was nowhere near the front of Virginians' minds at this time.

She stopped when she came across a big festival with music and white women and men dancing together. Upon inquiry, she learned that the festival was a fundraiser for the sick and wounded white soldiers. Immediately, she contemplated the need for an organization that supported the black freedmen that were constantly entering the city. Within two weeks, Keckley had won the support of her church in forming the Contraband Relief Association. Keckley was also employed by Mrs. Abraham Lincoln, with whom she traveled to many cities and gained more support for the Association. Mrs. Lincoln and the President also made contributions to help finance the Association, and its success eventually led to Keckley serving as its President in 1863.","Elizabeth Keckley's initiative to create an organization that provided aid for and served the African American community would become very characteristic of African American leaders within the years to come. The exclusion of African Americans from city outreach programs and fundraising organizations run by white leaders continued throughout and after the Civil War. Yet, as more and more African Americans or freedmen entered the city for refuge or later on after emancipation, the African American community grew in strength and responded to the segregated lifestyle by forming its own organizations and institutions.

A staunch abolitionist, Brown was the first white American to set about culling up a slave insurrection. He first gained the nation's attention when he led a volunteer militia during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of the previous decade. Following his involvement in that conflict, Brown was responsible for the direction of the Pottawatomie Massacre on May 24, 1856 and subsequently freed eleven slaves in the neighboring state of Missouri. What he is best remembered for, however, is his participation in the famous raid on a federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in modern-day West Virginia. The anti-slavery espousals and violent methods of John Brown incited neighboring Virginian counties into action; according to W.W. Scott's <em>History of Orange County</em>, Brown's well-known raid on Harpers Ferry occasioned wild excitement, a good deal of local apprehension, and was, indeed, the alarum gun of the war that so soon followed.","John Brown's incendiary actions caused the immediate organization and equipment of numerous volunteer companies throughout the state of Virginia. One of these militias originated in Orange County, the self-proclaimed Montpelier Guards, of whom many are memorialized in the lists of Confederate soldiers buried in Charlottesville cemeteries. They were characterized by Scott as a fine volunteer company [that organized themselves] at and about Orange Courthouse. Led by Captain Lewis B. Williams, Jr., the Montpelier Guards traveled to Charleston, South Carolina where they stood guard until Brown and such of his accomplices as had been caught were hanged. Although they did not participate in the capture of Brown himself, their presence in Charleston thwarted the rumored attempts his rescue during the term of his imprisonment. Nevertheless, the company was Brown's military escort to the scaffold where he was hanged for treason to the state of Virginia. ","The Montpelier Guard of Orange County, Virginia served as an example for several other county-organized militias of the 1850s, including the Gordonsville Greys, led by Captain William C. Scott, and the Barboursville Guard, who operated under the command of Captain W.S. Parran. These companies, following in the footsteps of Williams' men, were uniformed, and began regular drills in preparation for the direful conflict which everybody felt was coming, indeed was almost come. John Brown's controversial actions galvanized the nation either in support or condemnation of his efforts. Militias, like the Montpelier Guard of Orange County, Virginia, were stirred to a fever pitch in response to events like the raid at Harpers Ferry and constituted the backbone of what was to become the Confederate Army."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":14128,"lat":38.246275988,"lng":-78.01344008,"zoom":10,"place":"ORANGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3577,"title":"Address to an Edgecombe Patriot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-01-18","end_date":"1846-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 18th, 1846, the ladies of Edgecombe county held a ceremony to honor the volunteers of the Mexican-American War.  Ever since the blood of American soldiers had been shed in Texas, the call of patriotism compelled many Americans towards war.  In Edgecombe, patriotic banners and speeches had been prepared for the men who would soon be off for Mexico.  Present at the ceremony was a renowned Senator of North Carolina, Captain Louis D. Wilson.  In the name of his country, Wilson had left his Congressional duties to lead a group of Edgecombe volunteers into Mexico.  Sarah E. Howard addressed Wilson and his men on behalf of the women of Edgecombe:","Appreciating the heroism which has impelled you at the call of your country to rush to her standard... we have wrought with our hands a banner for the volunteers...  Whilst the weakness of our sex forbids us to encounter the fatigues and privations of war, it has always been deemed appropriate that women should cheer on the soldier to the field.  In this we but emulate the example of the maidens and matrons of the Revolution, that Revolution which established those political liberties and conferred those social benefits, to secure which you have volunteered.  Your fathers waged war against the haughty Britons...  You are now engaged in a contest with the perfidious Mexicans, and the flag of '76 is the flag of '46... You have enlisted under that proud banner which has been consecrated to the cause of human liberty - the glorious stars and stripes of your country - it is the precious emblem of our noble confederacy of free and independent states... Go; our hearts are with you.","Women's activism was proscribed in the arenas of war and politics.  It was not their place.  Howard's speech accepts the role of women as secondary to the masculine political issues.  Even at such a powerful event, the contributions of women were still gendered.  Like the women three generations earlier, the female patriots of Edgecombe County could only craft banners and cheers in support of the soldiers.  The references to the maidens of the Revolutionary War and the community of Edgecombe are significant because these geographical and historical communities were what bound women in their place in the South.  As Jean E. Friedman notes in <em>The Enclosed Garden</em>, Southern women maintained their kinship networks during times of war, and these communities inhibited women from developing independent women's associations.  In Edgecombe, the meaningful communities for women were social, national and geographical, not organizations of gender."],"display_date":"January 18, 1846","search_date":"1846-01-18","locations":[{"id":9431,"lat":35.868028512,"lng":-77.6521883059,"zoom":9,"place":"EDGECOMBE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3615,"title":"David Watson Prepares for Battle\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-01","end_date":"1861-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["From December, 1860 to January, 1861 David Watson of Louisa County, Virginia wrote a series of letters back home to his mother. Watson enlisted in the Virginia militia and was writing from several locations, including Charleston, South Carolina at Fort Sumter. Built after the War of 1812 as one of a series of fortifications linking the southeastern coast, Fort Sumter fell on April 13, 1861 to Confederate forces under the command of Brigadier General P.G.T. Beauregard; historically speaking, this battle typically signifies the beginning of the American Civil War. David Watson, however, was writing months before the explosive confrontation in Charleston and the subject matter of his letter details the apprehension over the looming conflict, resilient hope that a peaceful solution could still be achieved, and overwhelming concern for the condition of home life shared by American soldiers who had yet to fall under the polarizing influence of the Civil War. ","In the opening sentences of his letter, Watson gave his mother some bad news; her fears have been realized, he wrote, as her apprehension...with regard to the possibility of [him] having enlisted in the civil war became a certainty. Although he characterized his environment as frenzied and poised for battle, Watson maintained that he and his compatriots [had] not yet quite despaired of a peaceable settlement of the difficulties by the Yankees becoming aware that they [had] nothing on earth to make by attacking us. What is more, the young soldier wrote that the news around the camp indicated that there would be no more Union attempts to reinforce the garrison at Fort Sumter. These efforts to resupply and strengthen the northern presence in Charleston were repeatedly rebuffed by Confederate troops throughout the winter of 1860 and 1861. Lastly, and perhaps most telling of the optimistic mindset of men like David Watson, he expressed his desire to settle up his accounts with his creditors at home. Perceiving the conflict to be only temporary, Watson spoke of account balances and petty debts as if he would be home within the next few weeks to reconcile them personally. ","Before the Battle of Fort Sumter, the event that inextricably defined what were the North and South, men like David Watson held out hope that the conflict would be short-lived. In writing to his mother, Watson expressed his belief that neither side had much to gain from a long, protracted war. His priorities lay at home in Louisa County with his family and his financial wellbeing, evidenced by his anxious desire to balance his accounts and return to his habit of keeping up daily interactions with his business associates. Unforeseen to Watson, the scope of the trifling conflict the central Virginia native mentioned in his letters would expand to an unprecedented level of violent conflict only a few short months into the spring of 1861."],"display_date":"December 1, 1860 - January 30, 1861","search_date":"1860-12-31","locations":[{"id":14012,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3642,"title":"The Marquis de Lafayette Visits Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-10-19","end_date":"1824-10-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Although a Frenchmen, the Marquis de Lafayette was a man dear to the hearts of many Americans in the early nineteenth century. He led American troops into battle during the Revolution, had sustained a wound at the Battle of Brandywine, and was instrumental in encouraging the participation of the French forces in the siege of Yorktown which led to the surrender of the British in 1781. Lafayette was not the only foreign officer to serve in the Continental Army, but he was revered for his generosity, friendliness, bravery, and genuine love for America, his adopted country. "," It is no wonder then that when in October of 1824 the Marquis, now quite an old man, landed in the city of Norfolk a great reception awaited him. The <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> reported the spectacle awaiting Lafayette upon his landing which included an artillery salute, a triumphal arch erected in his honor, ranks of local militia, the assembled Corporate Societies of the Borough, and large groups of school children including those of the Female Orphan Society. All this made for what the Herald described as a truly animating picture. Additionally, the Herald reported that in the evening the businesses and dwellings of the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth were brilliantly illuminated, the latter municipality lighting 42 bonfires on the shores in honor of the Marquis. Sometime during his stay, a trip across the river to the city of Portsmouth was planned in order that Lafayette might pay a visit to the United States Naval Yard there. Louisa Emmerson, a life-long Portsmouth native wrote that the Trustees of Portsmouth welcomed him to their town, and with military honors conducted him to Crawford Street, where at its intersection with High, a fine triumphal arch had been erected in the General's honor. The arch itself was finely constructed and decorated with American flags, evergreen boughs, and flowers. Mrs. Emmerson wrote that before continuing to the Naval Yard, the procession stopped so that some school children of the city could recite a poem for the distinguished guest. "," Clearly, the Marquis' visit was quite an event for the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth. It certainly was not everyday that a small city was graced with the presence of one of the most venerated heroes of the Revolution, a man that Louisa Emerson described as second only to Washington. For more than a month, the Herald reported on the receptions of the Nation's Guest as he toured the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Richmond, and Williamsburg. Day after day, near full pages of newsprint was spent describing his stay in each city with particular detail. The visit of the Marquis de Lafayette was perhaps the event of a lifetime. Norfolk was only one of many stops on Lafayette's Farewell Tour of America. From 1824 to 1825, Lafayette visited all twenty-four states in the Union. Along the way he was treated to numerous dinners and balls in his honor. He listened to speeches, he attended plays, he visited Revolutionary War veterans, and he laid the cornerstones to several monuments to the American Revolution including the Bunker Hill monument. No expense was spared in celebrating the return of the hero. "," The year 1824 was the perfect moment for Lafayette to make his return. America was experiencing a prosperous and peaceful period in its history. Cities were growing and industry was beginning to develop. The occasion of Lafayette's visit was a chance for the burgeoning American glass, printing, and pottery industries to flex their muscles as they churned out a variety of commemorative items emblazoned with the image of Lafayette. But why was all this attention and money being spent on an aging war hero that was not even a native citizen? Quite simply, Lafayette was one of the last remaining founding fathers. In celebrating Lafayette the man, the people of the United States were not just celebrating the accomplishments of the man but also the American ideals of liberty. Furthermore, the very fact that Lafayette was not a native son endeared him to the American people because he risked his life not to protect his native land, but out of a genuine love for freedom and democracy. Lafayette's visit was a chance for the American people to once again remember the sacrifices of the past and the ultimate triumph of democratic ideals."],"display_date":"October 19, 1824 - October 27, 1824","search_date":"1824-10-23","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3674,"title":"Soldier&#39;s Recollection of Capturing Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-02","end_date":"1865-04-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As T.S.

Indeed, as they soon passed abandoned, but extremely sturdy (almost impregnable) works, Peck acknowledged his belief in the fruitlessness of trying to take Richmond by assault. Fortunately for Peck, his pessimistic outlook was disproved once he and his fellow soldiers reached the Southern capital. The city was ablaze and in chaos, with Confederate forces torching their own buildings, convicts from the Virginia State Penitentiary robbing or killing, and panicked citizens fighting over articles and rolling looted barrels of flour or molasses. Peck rejoiced at the tumult and later recollected, Never shall I forget that day It was, and probably will be, the greatest of my life.

Meanwhile, General Grant, with his well-quipped army, had embarked on a ruthless campaign to reach the city by destroying anything standing in his way, no matter how many casualties.

Northern leaders had degraded you and themselves, he criticized, by inviting the co-operation of the black race with Abraham Lincoln's proclamation freeing slaves in the Confederacy and inviting them into the North's army and navy. Just before, the Union had been condemning the South for seeking the intervention of the white French and English. "," In response to Lincoln's actions, Davis issued a statement of his own, declaring slave status for all free blacks in the South. Captured black Union soldiers would also be deemed chattel, as would all African Americans in any states taken by the Confederacy. Slavery is a corner-stone of a Western Republic, Davis emphasized, and the proper condition of the negro is slavery, or a complete subjection to the white man. "," The Confederate President composed his address during a bleak time for the South. A few months earlier, Southern troops had suffered defeats in both Kentucky and Maryland, obliterating any hopes of recognition and aid from England or any other European nations. Davis knew that Great Britain would not risk involvement in the conflict unless signs clearly pointed toward a Confederate victory. In addition, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation provided the North with the moral upper hand in the eyes of anti-slavery England and France. The South recognized its need to defend itself as the elimination of slavery became a major goal of the North, which had initially put forth preservation of the Union as its primary aim above all else. "," Davis' reference to blacks in the Union military reflected another significant difference between the North and the South. The North employed African Americans even before Lincoln's declaration; Union commanders sometimes recruited black troops, and in 1862 the War Department sanctioned the recruitment of African Americans. By the end of the war, almost one out of every ten Union soldiers was African American.

The years leading up to the affair were full of bargains, compromises, and violent encounters that transcended both racial and societal lines. On January 7, 1847, many newspapers distributed articles focusing on the ongoing war with Mexico. The dispute increased social and political unrest back east, and the decision of whether or not to allow slavery in the new lands previously occupied by Mexicans was at or near the top of the agenda. In an attempt to bolster and create a harmonious atmosphere in the nation's capital, the news publication The National Era ran an article proclaiming the importance of order and abstinence from violence in the District at such a perilous time. The most threatening concern expressed in the article was the importance of keeping the city running smoothly and peacefully, despite widespread domestic turmoil. The citizens of Washington felt this was vital because visiting foreign diplomats saw Washington as a picture or representation of the nation as a whole. Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the city in order to secure positive foreign relations. After all, if anarchy existed in the city of Washington, then visiting foreign diplomats would be less inclined to trade or do business and would also leave with a poor impression of Americans and republican liberty in general. The gradual emergence of a world economy built upon trading was fundamental to the existence of both the North and South. This futuristic ideal economy requires, at the very least, peaceful conditions back in Washington so as to promote the kind of city-on-a-hill atmosphere that will attract foreign support. Richmond for example, saw an increase in urban population and a rise of new professions such as prostitution - which could yield a livable economic income at the time. After further examination, Joshua Rothman pointed out that resources were scarce and consequently, prostitutes constantly assaulted one another in public. If upon arrival foreign ambassadors or diplomats were greeted with a scene similar to the picture Rothman paints of Richmond, then their view of Washington would no doubt be negative, and therefore detrimental to the reputation, accountability, and future existence of the nation as a whole."],"display_date":"January 7, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-07","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3706,"title":"A Reflection on the Ongoing War with Mexico\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-03-04","end_date":"1848-03-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Daniel Webster, leading American statesmen and established Whig Senator during the antebellum period, sent a letter discussing the war with Mexico to his dear son on March 4, 1848.

Though he was clearly disgusted over imperialist actions taken by the United States in the West, which upset the delicate balance between free and slave states, his will and conviction appeared to be weakening.Merely six days later, the Senate ratified the treaty and America gained five hundred twenty-five thousand square miles of territory at a net cost of just under twenty million U.S. dollars. Daniel Webster had every right to be skeptical of the suspicious circumstances that surrounded the acquisition of the formerly Mexican lands. Trist negotiated the treaty without President Polk's prior consent, but Polk later agreed to the treaty and sent it to Congress to be ratified. Finally, in May of 1848, Mexican officials agreed to the terms, and the war was officially over. Richard Winders, a historian and former Curator for the Alamo, even went as far as to make the point that the United States' War with Mexico doomed the two great parties of the era by forcing their associates to take sides on the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories and indirectly on the future of the institution of slavery itself.

McAuley had already planned on holding out at the yard until the Union arrived to take it over, which he thought would be soon. This put him in a serious predicament: he could try and hold out and risk losing the yard to the confederates, or he could burn the yard to the ground and sink all of its ships so the confederates couldn't use anything at the yard. McAuley chose the latter, he burnt the whole yard and sank all of the ships. As all of this ruckus was going on, the help that McAuley was waiting on arrived. The USS Pawnee arrived from the Potomac River, and the Union soldiers finished setting fire to the yard and blew up the dry dock to put it out of use. The Pawnee then headed back north leaving the Gosport Naval Yard in ruins. They also left the Confederates with many heavy guns, gun powder, and the sunken USS Merrimack."," This event contains the fight between the North and the South for the possession of seats of power. In the case of Gosport it was a heavily armed naval yard. Even though it was in Virginia, which succeeded, the Union claimed much of the weapons contained in the yard. This event shows the hostility that existed between the North and South even at the beginning of the war, and how people were pressured to quickly side with one or the other, like in McAuley's case. It shows the phenomenon of how the two sides in the war so quickly came to oppose each other when, not long before, they were all one country that shared much of the same heritage. This event also left the Confederates with the Merrimack, which was later brought up and turned into the USS Virginia."],"display_date":"April 21, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-21","locations":[{"id":14409,"lat":36.8397586016,"lng":-76.3809881826,"zoom":9,"place":"NORFOLK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3725,"title":"The Gallant Knight of Hereford\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-09-05","end_date":"1878-09-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 5, 1878, Richard Hereford represented Prince George's County in a jousting tournament. The sixteen knights, clad in armor and flashing colors, paraded the streets of Baltimore before the event. Long lines of fancy barouches followed the men and their steeds. A brass band heralded the knights as they passed the judges' stand. Each knight had a preliminary ride, but then the contest began. At stake were a gold watch with chain and a pair of Smith & Wesson's improved revolvers, but the Knight of Hereford rode to win the honor of crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty.","Sir Hereford clipped eight of nine rings during his first three runs, but the riding was particularly strong in this tournament. In the fourth tiebreaking round, the three rings were a mere inch and a quarter wide. As he prepared for his run, Hereford tried to act cavalierly: a knight's demeanor reflected on himself, his county, and his state. The trumpets [blew] out a challenge, the drummer [gave] a scientific trill, and the Chief Marshall called out in a booming voice, Charge Sir Knight The heralds echoed, and Sir Hereford thundered down the 90 yard track. In full gallop, he poised his lance. He neatly clipped the first two rings, but just missed the third. The crowd cheered as the trumpets blared triumphantly. A pair of pages escorted the Knight past the judges. The ladies in the stand waved their handkerchiefs. It was not enough to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, but the joust was still a success for any knight who conducted himself with gallant bearing, majestic mien, and superior horsemanship.","After the Civil War, Maryland's image had deteriorated in the eyes of many southerners, who accused Marylanders of being submissionists to northern oppression. The joust became popular in southern Maryland because many Marylanders wanted to redeem their identity as southerners. In the 1890s, the journalist Hanson Hiss claimed that jousting may be ... the only remaining relic of that romantic and picturesque age which has furnished the bards of centuries with themes. Marylanders linked this romantic image of jousting with their image of the Old South, and through jousting, they renewed their southern identity. Many Maryland knights chose names like the Knight of the Lost Cause, the Knight of the Sunny South, and the Knight in Grey to show their sympathy for the plight of the southern states. Jousts strengthened ties to the South in other ways as well: this joust in Baltimore was used to raise money for yellow fever sufferers in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1878","search_date":"1878-09-05","locations":[{"id":6035,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE GEORGES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3735,"title":"The Battle at Yorktown\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-04-05","end_date":"1862-05-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Civil War was raging on a day in early April in 1862 when Maj.

During the conference, the church had different ministers primarily speak on the state of the church and other business matters. Theological matters had a strong presence, also. The church was active in giving money to the Foreign Missionary Society and had increased the amount given each year, much to the pleasure and surprise of the organization. They also up held their pledged amount for the year. The church also debated whether to change the name to Methodist Episcopal Church in America, but voted against it. Only two men voted for the change, but the article does not give their reasoning. The conference adopted a memorial on temperance and elected delegates for the following conferences. The most interesting event, the article author felt, was the chairman's concern over a sermon. The chairman disapproved of a trial sermon, but the rest of the committee determined it to be orthodox. Upon this approval, the chairman asserted that if this was the case then there was no line between paganism and Christianity."," The Washington Post and the New York Times published these original articles. Washington was not too far from Staunton by way of the railroad, but New York was much farther.

Their strategy to gain and replace members required holding conferences that moved annually throughout the region. This 1886 meeting is their annual conference and a continuance of their efforts to maintain membership. Also during this period, revivalism started gaining force. The meetings the church held concentrated on proper behavior of its members, and instructed them that gambling did not belong in their lives while dancing had a shaky position. The test sermon to which the chairman objected could have pushed the boundaries concerning social issues. In addition, the church became more active with missionary work at this time and that is why their large donation was such a surprise. It was not until 1939 that the M. E.

Colonel Riley and his men took all the Seminoles to the fort as prisoners. The following Tuesday of that week while one of the sentinels fell asleep, one of the Indians escaped. Another guard saw him and began firing, which alarmed other guards to begin firing as they were chasing after him. Unfortunately, Captain Mason was shot dead in the process of trying to capture the Indian escapee. The sad part is that no one knew who shot Captain Mason. It is possible that he was shot by one of his own men or another Indian trying to defend the escapee.","Many Indians who escaped were lucky. The Indian that escaped that Tuesday night was even luckier because he got the captain killed in the process, which left one less soldier for the Seminoles to fight.","Other forts besides Fort King, such as Fort Scott, Fort Russell, and Fort Cooper, experienced similar episodes with Indian prisoners.

In April 1862, the Senate Committee on the Conduct of War was asked to investigate accusations of Confederate crimes against Union dead and wounded at the First Battle of Manassas.  On May 5, 1862, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> published the Committee's report, including excerpts of testimony and their conclusions.  The testimony was taken from soldiers and citizens who witnessed or were victims of the atrocities.  The testimony of Drs. Swain and Ferguson both highlighted instances in which wounded Union soldiers were denied adequate medical care, leading to further pain and death in some cases.  Louis Francis, a Union soldier, gave testimony as a victim of this inadequate treatment; his wounds were so badly tended that on several occasions the bone of his amputated leg continued to rupture through his wound.  His multiple requests for a more qualified surgeon were all denied.    Finally, the Committee heard testimony from many citizens who had witnessed Confederate soldiers desecrating the bodies of the Union dead in order to obtain trophies, such as bones or skulls.  All of the testimony and evidence led the Committee to find that Confederate soldiers had committed atrocities against the Union's wounded and deceased.  In their conclusion, the committee decried the barbarism of the Confederacy and called for the support of all loyal people and foreign nations to defeat this inhumane and immoral enemy of the Republic.  ","The First Battle of Manassas was an embarrassing defeat for the North; it weighed down their spirit of prewar triumphalism, deflated the morale of the troops, and quelled public support for the Civil War.  Historian Harry Stout claims that many religious and civilian leaders viewed the defeat as a moral judgment against the North's leaders and their aims in war.   After the defeat, the North needed to rally mass public support and boost the morale of the troops; this report and its publication were an attempt to define the North's cause as a noble fight against the barbarism of the uncivilized South.  The committee made this expressly clear in their conclusion's call for support and solidarity against the inhumane enemy.  This article framed the conflict as a war that pitted the civilized and virtuous North against the uncivilized and barbaric South; this interpretative shift helped the Union regain popular support for the War and reenergized their troops against the enemy.

The stage was the Battle of Gaines's Mills on June 27th, 1862, and it was up to Hood and his men to lead the charge to Confederate victory. This was the battle, as Hood describes it in his memoir, which launched him and his Texas brigade from obscurity into fame. ","It was the morning of the third day of what became known as the Seven Days' Battle, and General Robert E. Lee faced the dilemma of turning back the much larger Union army from Richmond's front doorstep. McClellan's Peninsular Campaign had brought the war to within several miles of the Confederate capitol, and due to miscommunication among the Confederate commanders McClellan had achieved a victory at Mechanicsville the day before. However McClellan had unexplainably fallen back to the position along the ridge behind Boatswain's Swamp. The position was well defended by embankments and long-range guns and offered a very difficult approach for the Confederate troops.","In preparing for the day's attack, General Lee approached Brigadier-General John B. Hood and asked him to fight his way towards the middle of the Union line in an attempt to break through. McPherson describes Hood as a daring and \"gladiatorial\" man who quickly accepted the challenge and went to scout out the terrain.   Seeing the Union line was in a strategic position, Hood devised his approach and waited for the opportune moment. As the battle raged on for the whole day, Hood held his 4th Texas unit in reserve while Lee's first attack was again hampered by miscommunication and thrown back. Towards sundown, the Confederates rallied, and Hood seized his opportunity. Placing his unit at the center of the Confederate line, Hood ordered his men not to fire a shot as they advanced but to stay in line. Hood believed that the only way to reach the Union line was by staying in formation, and if his men were forced to stop and reload their guns they would never make it. Hood describes how he and his men pressed on towards the Union line while their \"ranks were thinned at almost every step forward.\" Finally they crested the hill before the swamp, and Hood led them charging down the steep hill, still not a shot fired among them. Crossing the swamp, the Confederate advance faltered. Hood recounts how, at this crucial moment, he shouted to his men to \"fix bayonets and charge\" The Texans bravely led the surge up the hill, scaled the Union breastworks, and quickly dispersed the Union troops from their position.  McPherson describes how, after the Union line was broken, McClellan and the Union troops quickly retreated while the Confederates managed to capture 2,800 troops. However the day's fighting had been very fierce as the Union lost nearly 4,000 men and the Confederates nearly 9,000 men. All this happened in only six hours of fighting.","Hood and his Texans fought valiantly and had brought victory to the Confederacy at a great cost. Describing General Stonewall Jackson's report of the battle the next day, Hood recounts how the decorated General complemented 4th Texas unit by saying that \"the men who carried this position were soldiers indeed.\""],"display_date":"June 27, 1862","search_date":"1862-06-27","locations":[{"id":13908,"lat":37.7601235969,"lng":-77.4908797136,"zoom":9,"place":"HANOVER, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3875,"title":"Indian Massacre Stuns the Nation\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-12-21","end_date":"1866-12-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"They were mutilated horribly, stripped naked, their bodies cut open and scalped, even to the beards from their faces,\" reported a <em>New York Times</em> correspondent from Fort Laramie, in what was then the Dakota Territory. On December 21, 1866, a detachment of 81 soldiers under the command of Captain William Fetterman was lured out of Fort Phil Kearny, ambushed by a coalition of Indians, and completely destroyed. News of the nation's worst military defeat on the frontier traveled slowly. A massive blizzard blanketed the West and traveled eastward, preventing America from learning the fate of the 81 soldiers until nearly two weeks after their deaths. When newspapers finally received word from their frontier correspondents, a horrified nation was stunned by news of an Indian attack like no other to date.","\"Massacre\" screamed the headlines as Americans tried to piece together what had happened. The initial shock was accompanied by a desire for revenge against the Indians. \"Slaughter,\" \"massacre,\" and \"butchery\" were the words used to describe the battle. It was determined that \"We must now have a war of extermination.\" Blame for the debacle quickly settled on the government and the Army: Americans questioned Indian policy and demanded that the military, rather than the Interior Department bureaucracy deal with the hostile Sioux along the Bozeman Trail. \"The fact is that Indian affairs here have been horribly bungled,\" argued the journalist from the frontier.","The Army sought to divert blame in a drama that involved Civil War generals Grant and Sherman. Fort Kearny's commander and Fetterman's superior, Colonel Carrington became the immediate scapegoat. Carrington was accused of everything from cowardice to incompetence as the War Department sought to paint the fiasco as problem of local, rather than national, command. Courts of inquiry convened and official investigations, both by the Army, and eventually Congress, lead to conflicting testimony. Rather than conducting \"a war of extermination,\" the Army quietly settled affairs the following year by signing a treaty with Red Cloud, the Indian leader responsible for planning the attack on Fetterman.","But ultimately, Fetterman himself would take the blame for the \"Fetterman Massacre.\" Popular history describes him as an arrogant, foolhardy officer whose underestimation of Indians led to not only his own demise, but, excepting only Custer's Last Stand, the worst Indian-related disaster on the Plains in American history."],"display_date":"December 21, 1866","search_date":"1866-12-21","locations":[{"id":15204,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DATOKA TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3900,"title":"Southern Wartime Humor Concerning President Lincoln\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-07","end_date":"1863-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 7, 1863 the Raleigh Register published a song by Smith Webb mocking President Lincoln and his ability to keep the Union together.  The song contained seven verses that used sarcastic remarks and comparisons to criticize the President's actions.  The song began using sarcasm after deriding the President by stating, \"Fifty Yanks it is said won't make one good Confed; would a million make Abraham Lincoln\"  The song focused on Lincoln's talent at splitting up the nation, which was made clear when Webb wrote the statement, \"So to splitting he goes, and his genius was bent, And anon he outsplit all creation; Spit this thing and that thing wherever he went, till he split up the great Yankee Nation.\"  Webb continued to criticize Lincoln for his poor manners and compared him to various animals such as a monkey, a donkey, and an owl.  Another verse of the song urged Lincoln to think more carefully in the future.  Webb used the song to hopefully end the war when he stated, \"Lay aside all this love of the Niggers, And stop all this pulling of triggers, Send home your gunboats sir, Wherever one floats, sir.\"  ","    Wartime humor was present in both the Confederacy and the Union during the Civil War.  The newspapers printed humor in different forms including drawings, songs, and poems.  The humorous propaganda was very political and commonly associated with a certain party relating to both local and national events. The humor appealed to all classes and united them during their time of struggle. Many of the humorous writings focused on patriotism. Often the writings urged citizens to fight in the war or support their nation and the war effort with more enthusiasm.  Humor was also used as an outlet to express discontent with the war and the political situations occurring during the time. ","The Confederate newspapers constantly published wartime humor mocking Lincoln and portraying him in extreme fashions.  Lincoln was the embodiment of the South's anger with the war and the current state of affairs.  His trouble with secession was a constant subject of mockery from the southern newspapers.  One cartoon depicted Lincoln as an acrobat balancing the North on one side of his pole while dropping the South to the floor below.  Another cartoon depicted Lincoln as a circus performer about to do a balancing act with the northern and the southern states as plates on sticks balancing in the air.  Lincoln was subject of a variety of wartime humor published in the South, but all the humor published served to communicate the current political issues and opinions.

Governor Vance requested the safety for the city's \"defenseless inhabitants.\"  Vance expressed hope that General Sherman would protect the charitable institutions of the state as well as the libraries, museums, and public records.  Governor Vance appealed to General Sherman's logic when he stated, \"I can but entertain the hope that they may escape mutilation or destruction in as much as such evidences of learning and taste could advantage neither party in the prosecution of the war whether destroyed or preserved.\"  ","    Governor Vance made many efforts to save North Carolina from the Union forces before he wrote the letter of surrender to General Sherman.

Vance also attempted to protect the war supplies in North Carolina when he learned the Union army was coming.  Vance feared an invasion by General Sherman because of the campaigns made by Sherman throughout the South.  In these campaigns, Sherman's destroyed large areas of Georgia and South Carolina.

Upon his arrival on free soil, Jones contacted Brown and made arrangements for Brown's escape. They communicated through a clever system that involved passing each other magazines in which \"letters in different words were undermarked by a dot or period, and which letters, when put together, made an intelligible sentence.\" Once a time and meeting place were agreed upon, Jones sent a supply wagon as a means for Brown to escape. Brown was filled with elation when he reached freedom and met Jones until, unfortunately for the fugitives, the prison commander immediately confronted the men and accompanied both back to the prison. ","While this anonymous account relates the story of an escape attempt, it also alludes to the favorable conditions that existed in some prison camps during the Civil War. For instance, regarding the commander of the prison Brown reported, \"Major Wilkes is emphatically one of Natures noble-men...perfectly unassuming, even with those under his surveillance-wishing them well, and endeavoring to promote their comfort and happiness.\" Likewise, Fort Warren, to which Brown referred in the description of his escape, was known for its benevolent treatment of prisoners. In his diary, former Confederate Secretary of State Alexander H. Stephens attested to the accommodations offered in the Federal prison. He revealed that he had a large room with plenty of light, a bed of \"tolerable comfort,\" pure water, sufficient food, and \"the privilege of seeing daily papers and reading books\" during his detainment at Fort Warren. The prison itself was originally built in 1851 on an island in Boston Harbor as a Union fort that had been converted in 1861 to hold high-ranking officers and political prisoners during the Civil War. Due to the high social and military status of most prisoners, their treatment and living conditions were overall exemplary in quality. Historian Minor H. McLain even describes Fort Warren as \"an outstanding example of humanity in time of stress.\" Despite the problems it faced due to overcrowding when it first opened, Fort Warren only amassed a total of twelve prisoner deaths during its existence, while reaching a high of 394 captives in February 1865. However, the relatively small death count that Fort Warren accumulated serves as an exception to the atrocious mortality found in other prisons during the Civil War, such at Andersonville, Georgia; Elmira, New York; or Libby Prison in Richmond, Virginia.","Of the approximately 193,750 Union soldiers captured, over 30,000 died in Confederate captivity, while nearly 26,000 out of the approximately 214,900 captured Southerners died in Federal prisons. Military historian Robert S. Davis gives mortality rates for the worst prisons on each side; as high as 35 percent at the worst Southern prison, as high as 24 percent at the worst Northern prison, and an average of 12 to 15 percent of the troops for both armies. Although these rates seem high enough to motivate anyone to flee captivity, it was also a soldier's duty to escape and rejoin his army in battle. Historian Pamela Hain gives evidence of this obligation when she cites several escape attempts made by prisoners at Fort Warren, despite numerous testimonies to its benevolent conditions compared to those at prisons elsewhere. As Brown suggested in the account of his escape, regardless of the quality of treatment, \"there are those as ready and anxious to escape from this, as from that, or any other prison.\""],"display_date":"November 1864","search_date":"1864-11-15","locations":[{"id":6210,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3912,"title":"Early Support for a War in Missouri\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-07-13","end_date":"1855-07-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 13, 1855 in Lexington, Missouri, there was a convention held to rally support for the continuance of slavery in the United States. At that convention James Shannon gave an address entitled \"Domestic Slavery,\" in which he attempted to justify the practice of slavery and disprove the validity of the reasons given by abolitionists to outlaw the practice. The reasons he gave in support of slavery covered a broad spectrum, typical of the Southern justification of slavery. He cited Bible verses that in his mind showed that slavery was condoned, even encouraged, by God himself. He predicted economic catastrophe in not only the southern United   States, but the entire country, if the slaves received freedom. Shannon estimated the value of slaves in the United States at over two billion dollars, a huge financial loss in the event of emancipation. He attempted to refute claims about the immorality of slavery by arguing that the slaves actually benefited from American slavery, saying that under the guidance of the white race the Africans learned how to be civilized. In his conclusion he suggested that once \"all peaceable means to protect our rights, and save the Union\" were exhausted, \"we will stand to arms,\" and \"God will defend the right.\"","            Shannon's arguments for slavery were typical of the rhetoric used by pro-slavery forces in the decades leading up to the Civil War. Southerners believed that they were justified by the law and by God in their practice of slavery, but Shannon's remarks went beyond simply justifying the practice of slavery. Even in 1855, half a decade before the first state seceded from the Union, the idea of secession from the Union was common among Southern pro-slavery forces. The aggressiveness of the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed outlawing slavery in all the land acquired during the Mexican-American War, caught the attention of Southerners. Shannon was among many others who thought that preemptive action was necessary to stop Northern politicians from outlawing slavery. This early support by Southerners for secession and acceptance of violence as a necessary step in order to protect the right to slavery made the American Civil War seem inevitable, even five years before the first shot was fired."],"display_date":"July 13, 1855","search_date":"1855-07-13","locations":[{"id":7668,"lat":39.0656247172,"lng":-93.7855117112,"zoom":9,"place":"LAFAYETTE, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3914,"title":"Opposition to Freedom\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-12-31","end_date":"1889-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            On the last day of 1889, an editor of the <em>Roanoke Daily Times</em> criticized \"the relations of the races,\" which, he avowed, \"do not appear to be at all improved by the election of a Republican president.\"  The editor continued, affirming that black people had \"become restless and arrogant in a large measure, and ready at any time to enter on the work of bloodshed and murder.\"  This was not the case under the presidency of Democrat Grover Cleveland, who assured justice and contentment for all black citizens, the editor argued.  While this editorial in the New Year's Eve edition of the <em>Times </em>was brief, it nevertheless emphasized that blacks were still a threat to society, especially under the administration of Republican President Benjamin Harrison.  Moreover, the editorial highlighted growing white backlash in Virginia against the rights that African Americans gained following the Civil War. ","            Numerous reasons explain why the editor of the <em>Times</em> criticized Harrison's administration and the situation of black Americans.  Harrison took office in 1888 having defeated Cleveland, the incumbent Democrat.  Running on a platform of \"Rejuvenated Republicanism,\" Harrison received a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Cleveland, and he alienated strongly Democratic areas of the country as he took office in 1889.  Additionally, his support for black civil rights and his appointment of Frederick Douglass as a foreign minister to Haiti further angered his opposition.  Cleveland, on the other hand, had supported returning captured Confederate flags to former Confederate states and had expressed federal appreciation of Confederate soldiers.  Harrison's failure to engender support from Democrats and former Confederates resulted in the 1892 re-election of Cleveland in the most decisive presidential election in 20 years.","            The advancement of civil rights legislation that followed the Civil War was a source of opposition to black citizens.  Historians Nancy Bentlen and Sandra Gunning write that after the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, \"African American men were suddenly free to enter local and national government during Reconstruction.\"  Philip A. Bruce's publication of <em>The Plantation Negro as a Freeman</em> in 1889 reflected growing white opposition to black freedom.  Characterizing black men as immoral and rebellious, Bruce \"devoted a great deal of time to writing Southern history that directly aided and abetted the post-Reconstruction backlash against African Americans, arguing that as they moved beyond slavery, blacks were inevitably devolving into barbarism.\"  ","            Both the administration of Harrison and the advancement of black rights that took place after the Civil War and Reconstruction gave rise to this editorial.  Its criticisms and fears reflected those of white Virginians across the state, many of whom were staunchly Democratic and still loyal to the former Confederacy.

A number of factors contributed to widespread desertion from the battlefields, particularly the sense of conflicting duties that many men faced. Soldiers felt a duty to the Confederacy but also a strong obligation to protect their homes and families. According to historian Mark Weitz, they experienced a \"push from the conditions they were in\" and a \"pull which came from home.\" Furthermore, unpopular practices such as conscription often undermined their sense of patriotism and the national identity that the Confederate government had tried to build. Conditions on the battlefield also drove soldiers to desert. Many suffered emotional and physical hardships from the horrible realities of war and the intense demands placed upon them on a daily basis. Troop morale was critical to their performance and also for the drive to remain loyal to the Southern cause. The scarcity of necessary supplies such as food and clothing, especially as the war progressed, also contributed to desertion.","Punishment for deserters varied. Some commanders such as Robert E. Lee and Braxton Bragg stressed the importance of severe punishment-often a death sentence-to those who fled the army. They felt that the prospect of death served as a deterrent for the crime. Most deserters, however, faced less severe penalties, such as hard labor, floggings, or brands.

In his diary, Stokes highlighted the major events throughout his three-year term of enlistment in the Civil War. Specifically, he noted a number of occasions in which his regiment came in contact with both African American soldiers in the Union Army and slaves. In one such episode, Stokes learned that a small group of enemy soldiers, including eight armed blacks, had been tapping their telegraph wires near Green Pond, South Carolina. Stokes and his men soon pursued the party and managed to capture three of the black spies. Although he added that one of the black scouts drowned in retreat, Stokes provided no further information on the incident. ","The use of African Americans as spies was common throughout the Civil War. African Americans comprised over nine percent of the Union war force by the end of the war, but only a small fraction served as combat soldiers in the field. This was a result of a number of different factors, including a lack of experience, preparation, and training; poor organization; and carelessness on the part of white officers. Due to the racial divide, black troops also experienced unfair treatment for much of the war. Although few blacks directly participated on the battlefield, the Union Army employed many behind the scenes as scouts, raiders, or spies. They provided a significant contribution to the war effort. William Stokes encountered one such reconnaissance team, as he noted in his journal. The use of African Americans in the war, although not always on the front, gave the Union Army a distinct advantage and proved to be a \"defining moment in the history of the [black] race.\""],"display_date":"September 14, 1863","search_date":"1863-09-14","locations":[{"id":11488,"lat":32.467984914,"lng":-80.4033249144,"zoom":8,"place":"COLLETON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3926,"title":"Religion on the Battlefield\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-09-16","end_date":"1861-09-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    In an unsigned letter dated September 16, 1861, a Confederate soldier wrote to his family to tell of his first few weeks marching to war. His letter began with mundane details of the dates and names of towns his regiment marched through and speculations of when and where he would meet the enemy, but most of the letter is filled with religious tones and rhetoric. ","    The anonymous Confederate soldier wrote home that \"[if] it should be the Lord's will that I should fall on the battlefield, it will all be right. [...] the great end of this life is to prepare for death, and an entrance upon another.\" Of those who followed Christian beliefs, historian Steven E. Woodworth writes that their faith \"encompassed many facets of life, and they also believed that this present life was not the conclusion of their existence.\" This most certainly gave soldiers a sense of relief and peace, know matter what experiences they may have to endure on Earth. The Confederate and Union soldiers not only had a high chance of dying on the battlefield but also that it would be a very gruesome or lingering death, especially when the main method of healing a musket wound was by amputation. But the soldier from Nansemond County found that not all men outwardly practiced their beliefs. He witnessed that the circumstances of \"camplife are any thing else but favorable to religion, or deeptoned piety. Here I see and here [sic] more wickedness in one week than all that I ever met before put together.\" ","    In his letter the soldier reasoned with his family and urged them not to worry, arguing \"this world is not my home, and we should never shudder, or grieve at the escape of those we love, from a dreary desert, to a pleasant home.\" Of those who were Christian, Woodworth asserts that many soldiers \"spoke feelingly of heaven as home.\" This brought comfort not only to the soldiers but also to their loved ones or survivors left behind and out of the danger of war. ","    At the tail end of the soldier's letter he firmly advised his family to follow the word of God. \"Make the service of God the great object of your life, and He will make your salvation the great care of His heart.\" Woodworth states that many citizens and soldiers alike viewed \"heaven as a place of happy meeting.\" This view comforted both those close to death and those left alive. Soldiers and civilians both had the reassurance that death was not the end but only the beginning of life. The soldier not only wanted to ensure his own seat in heaven but those of his family as well so he could die peacefully with the knowledge that he would see them again.

To use the words of her editors, the Gazette continued printing \" at a cost and trouble of which many of our readers have not the least conception; for if they had, there would not be so many who would still withhold what they owe us for our labor.\" ","    The war cost the Confederacy a great deal of resources, making simple and everyday items and foodstuffs scarce. The South sent its young men off to fight the North, which meant that they also sent off a majority of their farmers to go fight. Conscription was strict and only a small demographic of men were exempt from service. The Confederacy exempted only those planters owning twenty or more slaves and those that grew food crops only. Planters and the Confederacy could not waste land on cotton. The women and young sons of these soldier-farmers had a hard time bringing in the harvest without the extra labor of fathers and older brothers or sons, so food was scarce. The slaves also found it easier to resist their mistresses or run away with their masters and overseers away at war. Even a number of slaves were drawn away from the fields to fight alongside or serve the Confederate Army. Historian William Blair writes \"large-scale farmers on whom the burden of production now rested felt besieged by their own people, as nonproducers and the poor clamored for regulated prices on foodstuffs and the Confederacy demanded slaves for production and military work.\" The Richmond Bread Riot in 1863, when 68 women were arrested in the Richmond market after causing a ruckus and breaking into shops to steal bread, illustrated these tensions.","    Not only could the Confederacy not produce enough food, but the Union Army also destroyed what little they had when marching through Southern towns. Blair writes of the destruction the Union Army doled out within \"a five-mile radius around Dayton\" in the Shenandoah Valley. Blair states that the Union Army burned and killed \"a total of 2,000 barns filled with wheat, hay, and implements; seventy mills filled with grain; and roughly 4,000 head of livestock.\" This lack of supplies, coupled with the Confederacy continuously printing its own unbacked paper money and raising the inflation rate, effectively crippled the South's economy. Thus when the Gazette asked for repayment, it offered a variety of methods to pay off amassed debts: \"we will take from those in arrears, 1 in specie, 1 bushel of wheat, 1 1/8 bushels of corn, 7 pounds of good bacon or butter, 75 pounds of clean rags, or a half load of wood for each year as may best suit subscribers.\""],"display_date":"April 27, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-27","locations":[{"id":14234,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3932,"title":"An Editorial on the End of the Civil War in Charleston\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-07-22","end_date":"1865-07-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 22, 1865, in Charleston, South   Carolina, a man by the pen-name of Juhl wrote an editorial in the <em>Charleston Courier </em>describing many elements of city life in the post-Civil War period. The writer's real name was Reverend Julius J. Fleming, a prominent and outspoken citizen of Charleston widely respected for his roles as a preparatory school principal, a Methodist preacher, and earlier in his life, as the editor of the <em>Sumter Watchman</em>, a Charleston area newspaper. More importantly, however, the editorial Fleming penned shows a distinct knowledge of the fundamental problem that plagued Reconstruction South Carolina.","In the editorial letter that he penned in the <em>Courier</em>,<em> </em>one of dozens that he would write during his lifetime, Fleming addressed many problems that the Civil War had laid on South Carolina. In particular, Fleming's message also posed two significant queries relevant to the safety and survival of Southern culture: \"How can<em> </em>peace and quiet be permanently secured?\" and \"How and where will farmers find an adequate, reliable labor force?\" ","Interestingly enough, both of Fleming's questions hinged on one all-important aspect of Southern lifestyle, the slave labor agricultural system that had existed for nearly two hundred years at the time of the Civil War. Fleming, in his editorial, described slavery as \"the life-blood of secession and the real <em>casus belli</em> [cause of war],\" thereby showing that slavery's end was to be the single largest hardship faced during Reconstruction. On this note, he claimed that \"by one sweep the wealth of the country is taken away, and a people accustomed to wealth and ease are suddenly reduced to poverty, humiliation and toil.\" Fleming's idea of South Carolina's economic ruin as a result of emancipation was later supported by Civil War historian W. Scott Poole, who cited the disappearance of \"enormous wealth, founded as it had been on a now defunct social system.\"","There is no doubt that both questions Fleming posed were difficult ones to answer, especially considering the Union Army had freed a gigantic number of former slaves during their march through South Carolina. Nevertheless, there is also no doubt that the author developed several sensible answers to uncertainties faced not only in South Carolina, but the South as a whole, in his landmark editorial. Among these suggestions, Fleming's envisioned arrangement for agricultural change was particularly impressive, and featured a version of sharecropping in which wealthy planters would \"divide up a portion of their estates into small farms which emigrants can readily obtain by purchase or lease.\"  In the post-war South, Fleming's system was put to use on a large scale, and it lasted into the twentieth century. ","Across his editorial, Fleming displayed an acute knowledge of the problems to be faced as the result of slavery's demise in post-Civil War South Carolina. While there is no question that Fleming's editorial addressed on one hand \"a people picking up the pieces of an existence shattered and changed by war and defeat,\" there is also no question as to the overarching theme of his letter. This motif, of course, was not disquiet or misery, but rather an appreciation that \"the war [was] over never to be renewed.\""],"display_date":"July 22, 1865","search_date":"1865-07-22","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3948,"title":"Border States and the Civil War\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-01","end_date":"1861-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["    Salem H. Ford realized early that his company was in for a tough battle.  As a captain in the cavalry of the Confederate States Army, he worried about the lack of leadership in his unit.  After all, Colonel Price, the only man who seemed to know how to \"form a line of battle,\" was fighting on the other side of the state.  As Ford glanced across Spring  River, which was the only thing separating Ford's army from General Sigel's Federal troops, he was mesmerized: \"I could not help admiring for their beautiful movements in their formation line of battle.\"   He knew his men had a small chance of winning the skirmish, but they had no choice.  Suddenly, gunfire erupted.  The battle of Carthage had begun.","    The battle raged on for hours.  It was a back and forth affair, as each side would rally after what seemed like defeat.  Desperate for a victory, Captain Hiram, a colleague of Ford's, commanded the Confederate soldiers to throw anything they could at General Sigel's men.  The cavalry threw rocks and pieces of iron.  Soon, General Sigel began to retreat from the constant bombardment.  Before long, Ford and the cavalry had pushed him back ten miles from Carthage, sealing the Confederate victory.  After the battle, Sigel, reflecting on the battle, applauded the efforts of the Confederate cavalry: \"if [I] had such men in [my] command...[I] would not be afraid to charge hell and capture the devil.\"","    While the determination and drive of the Missouri soldiers threw General Sigel off guard, their resolve is not surprising.  The Kansas-Missouri conflict served as a prelude to the Civil War.  Each state dealt with raids and guerilla warfare on a consistent basis beginning in 1854, so the two states were in the midst of the conflict when the War Between the States broke out.  When the war officially started, Lincoln's top priority was to try and secure the loyalty of the Border   States.  While Lincoln was able to attract Kansas to the Union cause, Missouri, a slave state, sympathized with the Southern plight and, while it never seceded, did favor the Confederacy.  This division between Kansas and Missouri only reinforced the hostility.  For the soldiers in Captain Ford's company, they not only saw Federal troops before them - they saw Kansas, the neighbors they hated the most.  This hatred led each side to fight harder than they might have had there been no rivalry prior to the war.  Their border war manifested itself in the Civil War.  Missouri became a symbol for the way the rest of the South should fight as their sacrifice and passion would set the standard for the rest of the Confederacy during the Civil War.

He wrote to the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates in regards to the South Carolina Nullification Ordinance, and the newspaper posted this as an article for locals.  Floyd explained that South Carolina felt the Tariffs took advantage of it and the state had \"declared those laws unconstitutional.\"  In South   Carolina's defense, he noted that its state had implored Congress to overturn those laws many times, but that \"all this had been disregarded by that body.\"  Although Floyd first presented South Carolina's motives for nullification, he went on to note the potentially negative consequences of this action.  The Virginia governor warned that \"should force be resorted to by the Federal Government, the horror of the scenes hereafter to be witnessed cannot now be pictured even by the affrighted imagination.\"  Floyd presented both sides of the issue.  ","Floyd's desires for how Virginians should respond to nullification, more clearly revealed his inclinations.  Historians describe the governor as a \"states' rights advocate\" who \"originally opposed secession.\" These two ideas seemingly conflicted with each other.  Floyd promoted an all-encompassing stance that would preserve South Carolina's rights and also promoted the ideal of limiting Congressional powers without endorsing nullification. He said that first there should be \"an investigation of the causes, with a view to a redress of grievances.\"  However, he acknowledged that South Carolina had already attempted to do this and failed.  Thus, he said the next step was \"an amicable reference...to the great tribunal which formed and adopted the constitution, viz: the PEOPLE of the States themselves.\"  Floyd went so far as to say that if the people could not settle the issue peacefully, it would essentially disparage the ideas of \"liberty\" and \"self-government.\"  Therefore, he presented the state of Virginia with two choices: to support South  Carolina and engage in potential Civil War or to \"appeal to the States of the Union.\"  He warned that the former of the two choices would result in \"fire-side altars bathed in blood,\" and that the latter decision would enable \"the maintenance of...harmony.\"  Floyd presented the two options as having completley different consequences.","Virginia had a task: historian William Freehling explains that ultimately \"the Virginia legislature, even while sending [an official commissioner] to stop South Carolina from nullifying [the tarrifs], affirmed that any state could legally secede.\"  Although Virginia remained in the Union until the fall of Fort Sumter, it did not condemn the actions of the secessionists around it.  This somewhat conciliatory legislative action, as Floyd suggested, would have less severe effects. Interestingly, though, Floyd eventually became a promoter of secession, a Confederate general, and as historians note, \"resigned under charges of financial cheating and transferring arms to the South.\"  Overall, it is evident that Virginians initially took a moderate stance, hoping to avoid confrontation.

He was fortunate to be a part of a soldier exchange that allowed him to return to the North, and when he boarded the steamboat to make the journey home, he was met with a new uniform, a new pair of boots, a bath, and a hot meal.  However, these luxuries were a far cry from the horrors he and the other Union soldiers experienced in the prison camp at Andersonville.  Before arriving at Camp Sumter, Kellogg and the men in his company had been under the care of a group of Confederate soldiers who had been released from a Union prison.  He and his comrades were well fed, and had a distinctly positive view of their pre-Andersonville captors.  He noted that the southerners were \"a gentlemanly set of fellows, and treated the northern soldier with some consideration.\"  The men were able to procure rations and other pleasure items from southern citizens through purchase and trade, and enjoyed a fairly comfortable existence.  "," The time before they reached Andersonville set the men up for a great shock, however, as conditions at the prison worsened daily.  When the men arrived, the sight of other prisoners foretold the fate awaiting them.  As one former prisoner said of his first sight of the camp, \"The uncheerful sight, near the gate, of a pile of ghastly dead - the eyes of whom shone with a stony glitter, the faces black with a smoky grime, and pinched with pain and hunger, the long, matted hair and almost fleshless frame swarming with lice - gave us some idea that a like fate awaited us on the inside.\"  Sadly, this soldier could not have been more right."," The prisoners were not provided with shelter, and were only given very meager rations.  No cooking utensils were provided, nor was there any wood for burning fires to cook their food.  The only water for the entire camp was located at the center of the compound, and was also used as an outdoor latrine, which laid the foundation for countless diseases to fester and grow.  Also, a death line was drawn around the camp, and any prisoners who crossed this line were shot immediately.  Many times, the guards would shoot for no apparent reason, leading to the death of a number of innocent men.  One confederate guard appealed to the president of the Confederate States, Jefferson Davis, to stop the violence.  He wrote, \"They think killing of a yankee will make them great men, they shoot prisoners, alleging they crossed the dead line.  I know you are opposed to such measures, and I make this statement to you to be a soldier, a statesman, and a Christian.\""," In 1864, the death tolls at Camp  Sumter were astonishing.  In the month of August, one in eleven prisoners died.  In September and November, one in three died, and in October, a shocking fifty percent of the prisoners at Andersonville passed away.  By the end of 1864, almost 14,000 of the supposed 33,000 prisoners held at Camp  Sumter had fallen victim to the horrible conditions they lived in.  Conditions in Union prisons were much the same, and by the end of the war, some 56,000 prisoners had lost their lives to disease and starvation.

Like many Southern newspapers, <em>The Camden Confederate</em> tried to provide people on the home front with as much information as possible regarding the progress of the war, but the information available was not always plentiful or completely reliable. No matter the status of the troops at the time, the newspapers continued to remind the citizens that they were \"fighting for home, property, liberty, life-everything.\"  The papers urged Southerners to hate the Yankees and accept nothing less than success in the war.","            The nationalism found in this newspaper was part of a movement that had begun even before the Civil War to present a strong, united South. As talk of secession began in the late 1850s, leaders in the South began to push for citizens to identify with their state or region rather than the United   States. Once southern states began to leave the Union, this loyalty became even more important to allow the new nation any chance of success. During the Civil War itself, there was little more important than presenting a united home front dedicated to the triumph of the Confederacy. Newspapers such as <em>The Camden Confederate</em> played a key role in advocating Confederate nationalism. This nationalism, extremely strong at the beginning of the Civil War, was not enough to hold the Confederacy together, and as the war drew to a close, so did the intense Southern unity. This is, however, a disputed analysis of Confederate nationalism. Other historians claim that the South remained a united front throughout the war, and a loss of unity has no place in the discussion of the South.

Though the school was set to open nine years later, in 1865, the headmasters were thinking far ahead. The basic courseload for the school had arithmetic, history, geography, and grammar, while the advanced lessons included surveying, mythology, French, and, interestingly enough, brawling. The military instruction encompassed the command of squad and company as well. Ironically, the school seemed well prepared to deliver its students into the \"Military Institutions of the state,\" even though the administrators certainly had no way of knowing that a bloody and brutal war would be nearly over by the time the school was scheduled to open.","Though the advertisement specified ages for its pupils - between twelve and eighteen - there was no gender requirement. It is obvious that the students intended for this sort of education were male, since females were not allowed to fight in the army. Although the majority of Southern students - and therefore Southern schools - were male, there also existed a rather large number of female educational institutions. These schools were very rarely co-ed; young men and women were taught separately and, for much of the nineteenth century, different subjects. Women learned the French style of education, which focused primarily on needlework, the French language, and other ladylike occupations, but as times changed, both men and women at higher educational levels pushed for the same training for young women as was already in place for young men. Though military prep schools certainly remained an exception, women began to learn arithmetic, geography, grammar, and other liberal arts topics, instead of the French topics.

General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia surrendered to the Union and effectively destroyed any chance of her beloved Confederacy succeeding in its war effort and becoming a separate and distinct nation. For Emma, the only highlight of the month appeared in the assassination of President Lincoln: \"After all the heaviness and gloom of yesterday this blow to our enemies comes like a gleam of light.\" A common, unfortunate theme throughout her April diary entries was the rationing of food and a severe lack of funds available for more than the basic necessities. Though wearing homespun versus store-bought clothing items was a minor disturbance compared to the lack of food, her accustomed wealthy way of life was ruined. LeConte tried to keep some of her former lifestyle of leisure by trading French lessons for German coaching with a family friend, but as she realized that her usual \"Old South\" lifestyle was gone forever, her desperation set in.","The Confederate surrender would be the start of only harder times for South Carolinians like the LeConte family as well as other Southerners. Lee's formal surrender at Appomattox brought down the Confederacy in one written swoop. Economic times were already tough in the South, as most white men had mobilized with the Confederate armies and were unable to keep a steady eye on their farms at home; meanwhile, slaves voluntarily freed themselves from bondage without their masters' watch. Most women were powerless to run family businesses. The combination of these situations dropped the South into destitution even before the Civil War ended. Unpaid debts between Southerners and annihilated commercial centers such as Charleston and Columbia added further to the South's woes. Impoverishment became the rule - not the exception - in the ex-Confederate states, a situation that remained until the twentieth century.

","    Because tariffs were the only real issue of the 1880 election, the politicians spun the debate to the polarizing issue of North and South.   The Lynchburg Virginian held that the Republican Party \"held out to the people that a Democratic victory meant a restoration of the \"rebels\" to power, and the dunces who heard this balderdash seemingly swallowed it as if it were divine inspiration.\"  Republicans knew that they would draw more support if they made it appear as if the South was once again attempting to unite against the North.  They announced that Hancock's nomination by \"Confederate Brigadiers sets the old Rebel yell to the music of the union.\" However, the Republican victory did not cause the outcry from Democrats that the Republicans predicted with their slander against the South.  ","    Neither side was guilt free from sectional leanings.  The majority of the South did unite as the \"Solid South\" and the Republicans exaggerated the severity and reason behind Southern polarization.  The election of 1880 proved that even a decade and a half after peace, the North and South still voted on mainly regional lines.

To quell the South's angered reaction, Jackson issued the Tariff of 1832, which made some reductions on tax rates.

His departure invoked many of the religious passages in her diary as she used religion as a comfort and a way to calm her fears. Bond often prayed to God in that she \"may not be entirely cut off from [her] husband,\" and that \"the cruel enemy may be driven from our soil.\" Her prayers to \"put a stop shortly to this miserable war\" were her comfort, and God, she believed, would answer those prayers.

Douglass was able to take some accountability for the issues President Lincoln had to deal with. Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln first met on August 10, 1863. Douglass had gone to the White House to discuss discrimination that black soldiers faced during the Civil War. Lincoln had acknowledged that the unequal pay black soldiers received warranted some anguish, but Lincoln believed that equality for black soldiers had to come gradually. On April 14, 1876, Douglass, in his lecture to the droves of people that attended the unveiling, expressed his gratitude for the former President's patience and forward thinking.

Virginia our native state, was now for a time at least to be freed from the desolation and cruelties incident to the presence of an armed foe.\"  He concluded his writing by praising James because \"he did not die in battle like so many others, but for the South he gave his youth, sacrificed his health and poured his blood.\" ","    Houston demonstrated nostalgia towards the Confederacy that was typical of Southerners during this time period.

The treaty, or rather collective of three treaties signed at Medicine Lodge, Kansas in October of 1867, was a comprehensive peace settlement between the U.S. government and the Plains Nations of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.  Major provisions in the treaty were that the nations would move onto reservations in the Indian Territory and that the United States would help them become \"civilized,\" providing them with necessary supplies and instruction.","            At Medicine Lodge, most of the Native American nations wanted peace, but did not agree with the constrained reservation system that limited autonomy and pushed white civilization upon them.  Among the more outstanding spokesmen of Medicine Lodge were Chiefs Ten Bears and Satanta, who represented two of the most prominent nations, the Comanche and Kiowa, respectively.  Their two voices well addressed specific problems with the proposed reservations, but also addressed broader issues of Native American identity, prospects, and the nature of their relations with whites.","            Satanta, one of the major figures in the armed conflicts leading up to Medicine Lodge, argued very emotionally and emphatically: \"I love the land and the buffalo and will not part with it. I want you to understand well what I say.  Write it on paper.\"  Satanta argued that the land, the hunt, and the independence from \"medicine lodges\"-the churches and schools advocated by whites-were essential elements of his culture, his means for happiness.  Secluded from this lifestyle, he said, \"We grow pale and die.\"  He also emphasized the way in which whites interacted with Native Americans, saying that while he was open and honest with the commissioners, they were deceitful and unreliable.  Yet far worse for Satanta were the U.S. troops who, he said, \"cut down my timber; they kill my buffalo.\"","            Ten Bears was more ready for peace and as such his speech was gentler in tone, beginning with an expression of warm feelings towards the commissioners.  Yet he too blamed the United States for a great deal, saying that it was they who started the conflict: \"There has been trouble on the line between us...but it was...you who sent out the first soldier and we who sent out the second.\"  Ten Bears also broadly criticized the plans of the commissioners, rejecting the reservation scheme with houses and medicine lodges.  He stressed the freedom and happiness of life in the prairie and contrasted it with living and dying as the whites suggested, hemmed in by \"walls\" and \"enclosures.\"  ","            Ten Bears reiterated Satanta's consideration of culture, saying: \"I lived like my fathers before me, and like them, I lived happily.\" He further defended his right to this life based on the promise made by the \"Great White Father\" (the President), which guaranteed the permanence of land rights as they then stood.  Finally, Ten Bears argued that far from removing his people to a better location, the proposed reservation site was \"too small\" and that the Texans had taken away the land and timber that best supported prosperity.  The final words of his speech summarized the plight of Native Americans in powerful, fatalistic terms, saying, \"The white man has the country which we loved, and we only wish to wander on the prairie until we die.\" ","            Though not actually faced with extinction, the nations of Medicine Lodge were in the midst of such upheaval that the period could justifiably be called the end of an age for their peoples.  Arguments like those of Satanta and Ten Bears at Medicine Lodge were not new; Native Americans had long defended their essential rights, sovereignty, and freedom-political rhetoric that is itself very telling as it specifically caters to Western ideology.  Yet the virtue of these values were not enough to protect Native Americans in a seemingly intractable clash of cultures, wherein they were opposed by both U.S. governmental policy and the very real \"shock of civilization\" that saw the buffalo hunted almost to extinction while frontier settlements swept across Native Americans' lands, dominating them in trade and constantly fighting with them.  In the twenty years after Medicine Lodge, Native American sovereignty and their free, unsettled lifestyle, as espoused by Satanta and Ten Bears, were both rejected by the United States.  The two major blows came in the shape of a Congressional act in 1871 that ended treaty-making with Native Americans, and the Dawes Severalty Act in 1887, which divided up the communal land into individual allotments and made Native Americans U.S. citizens."],"display_date":"October 19, 1867 - October 20, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-19","locations":[{"id":4553,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Unorganized, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4082,"title":"Desertion Plagues the Confederate War Effort\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-15","end_date":"1865-02-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In February 1865, the <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> printed a general order for those who had lost faith in the Confederate war effort and deserted, offering them a way to honorably rejoin their fellow Confederates in the fight. As many Confederate soldiers deserted and returned to their families, General Robert E. Lee appealed to their \"honor and duty\" by presenting only two options: \"war [or] abject submission.\" The only logical choice seemed to be a continuation of the fight for self-government at any cost. Lee offered pardon to any man \"improperly absent\" as long as he returned \"within the shortest possible time within 20 days.\" He declared that \"no general amnesty [would] again be granted\" in this final effort to reabsorb deserters into the Army of the Confederacy. Unfortunately for Lee, offering a sweeping pardon did not significantly recoup his dwindling supply of men still willing to fight.","Historians have pointed to desertion as one of the primary reasons for the South's defeat in the Civil War. The notion of the Civil War being a \"rich man's war, and a poor man's fight\" was a huge factor in desertion rates. One school of thought believes that as the war progressed, the yeoman farmers who were doing the majority of the fighting came to resent the planter aristocracy that was often exempted from military service due to various Confederate policies. The war became increasingly difficult, and many soldiers deserted due to economics, family, and personal sentiments. The less a man identified with the cause he was fighting for, the more likely he was to desert. Yeoman farmers did not own slaves, and the principles of slavery were not worth fighting and dying for as the war proceeded. In the final months of the war, desertion rates escalated as it became clear that the South would not emerge the victors.","James McPherson examines the Confederate soldier's experience through various diaries and letters and disagrees with this position. McPherson claims that Confederate men did not gain the conventional disillusionment and cynicism that would logically lead to desertion. The sources that he examines show soldiers continuing to assert the importance of the ideals they were fighting for throughout the conflict. Reasons for fighting would include defending their government, their manhood, their families, and their comrades. Although the reasons for desertion are clearly a subject of great debate among historians, it is clear that desertion made it increasingly difficult to pursue the collective goals of the Confederacy on the battlefield and inevitably contributed to Lee's surrender several months later."],"display_date":"February 15, 1865","search_date":"1865-02-15","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4083,"title":"Proof of Allegiance\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-05-27","end_date":"1865-05-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 25, 1865, John Herbert Claiborne took the oath of allegiance to the United States at the Office of the Provost Marshal in Petersburg, Virginia. He served as a surgeon with the title of Major in the Confederate Army during the war and continued to practice medicine after the surrender. In the terms of the oath he swore to \"support and defend the Constitution\" and to support all laws including \"the emancipation of slaves\" from that time forward. By taking this oath, he secured amnesty for serving the Confederacy during the war, considered an act of treason. That day he received a slip of paper noting that he had taken the oath, but he returned six days later to request a letter from the Provost Marshall confirming his allegiance and giving him permission to purchase a pistol for his own protection. Almost a month later, on June 26, he returned yet again for a duplicate certificate of his Oath of Allegiance. Papers such as these restored J.H. Claiborne and other former Confederates to their status of citizens of the United States during Reconstruction, a time when a Confederate war record often excluded men from the political landscape they once ruled. Generals Lee and Grant determined the terms of the surrender at Appomattox, but this agreement did not begin to address many of the questions created by the end of the struggle. Politicians determined the terms of reunion during the era of Reconstruction. The status of Confederate veterans proved to be a controversial issue in the halls of Congress as well as throughout the South. On one hand, Southerners needed to be punished for their rebellion, and it would be irresponsible to place the same white aristocracy back in power post-war. However, to suppress almost the entire white male population would leave few educated men to rebuild the southern governments.","President Johnson laid out the terms for Confederate amnesty in May 1865 through a proclamation that gave amnesty restoring all rights and property (except for slaves) to ex-Confederates who would take an oath of loyalty to the Union. Exempted from the proclamation were top ranking Confederates, as well as owners of more than 20,000 in property. These southerners who were not given amnesty in the proclamation would have to swallow their pride and appeal to the President Johnson for amnesty. Inevitably Johnson pardoned almost anyone who requested one, a much more lenient policy than the previously proposed Wade-Davis Bill of June 1864 that required men to swear that they had never aided the Confederacy in order to participate politically.

Stuart, lauding him as \"manly,\" a \"heroic spirit,\" and an \"active servant of our blessed Lord.\"  A theme of common loss prevailed as Minor detailed the situations of family members scattered throughout the defeated South.  ","Minor's letter transitioned from detailing what was lost to forming an idealistic memory of the effort. David Blight discusses the formation of a national memory of the war in his book <em>Race and Reunion</em>.  This transition in Minor's letter typifies the Southern memorializing of the Civil War.  Although Charley, a cherished family member, died in battle, his memory served a significant purpose for the future of the South.  Memories attributed to the war in the south became known as the 'Lost Cause' rhetoric.  Men, like Charley, were memorialized as brave fighters, who, although they lost, fought honorably for a cause they believed in.  Women, like Mary and Lizzie, were memorialized as strong and willing to support their men as well as their country.  In creating memories of the war, women across the country helped to establish Decoration Days, which became Memorial Day, now a national holiday.

The numbers of exiled slaves became so great in 1736, they were acknowledged by the Floridians, being referred to as Maroons, and also became allies in defending the territory.  Georgia was formed as a free colony between South Carolina and Florida and used as buffer colony to protect the Carolina planters' slave interests.  However, in 1750, a Creek Indian Chief named Seacoffee left the tribe with a large group of followers.  They traveled from Alabama to Florida, and under the Spanish colonial policy, they were incorporated into the Spanish population and entitled to land in the territory of Florida.  They settled near the area of the Exiles and refused all Creek laws.  These exiles were called \"Seminoles\" by the Creek Indians, meaning \"runaways.\"  They elected their own chiefs and became their own tribe.  Some members intermarried with members from the Maroons, as the groups merged into one entity.

On November 24, 1832, South Carolina held a contitutional convention and nullified the tariffs of 1824 and 1828, with Calhoun's full support behind his state.  Andrew Jackson's response to the convention came in December of 1832 when he declared nullification as being \"incompatiable with the existence of the Union.\"  This is the time in which GrimkÉ is writing his letter to Calhoun.  ","Thomas GrimkÉ tries to indirectly explain to Calhoun how he would treat the tense situation.  He does this by describing what his ideal country and an ideal statesman would be,  \"He must resolve, and abide by that resolution with inflexible constancy, never to harbor a thought, not utter a word, nor do a deed, that may, by any possibility, suggest the opinion, that the Union can ever be abandoned.\"  GrimkÉ is trying to explain to Calhoun how he would handle the situation of the south by abandoning any talk of secession or nullifaction.  He continues to speak of how a leader should act saying, \"Regard the Constitution of the Union as the sacred covenant of my first-born, sealed with their precious blood, the testimony of their faith, hallowed and irrevocable as the plighted troth of the marriage bond.\"  GrimkÉ refers to the Constitution to be in part of every American family.  ","\"I demand of every public man another prominent duty; to distinguish between the rulers and the people: and honor those, however, unworthy, for the sake of these.\"  He is hoping Calhoun will ignite southerners into supporting the north and the national leaders in office.  \"You have trodden a path, which inferior men might have selected.  Without amazement in their superiors, or danger to your country...That duty was to soothe, not to provoke; to calm, not of passion; of attachments, not jealousness; of manly, candid sense, not of prejudice.\"  This last quote is GrimkÉ's last attempt to persuade John C. Calhoun into preserving the Union."],"display_date":"December 1, 1832","search_date":"1832-12-01","locations":[{"id":11579,"lat":33.9290712834,"lng":-81.2531457905,"zoom":9,"place":"LEXINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4120,"title":"Prairie Farmer Breaks News of Custer Disaster\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-07-15","end_date":"1876-07-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"It proved a rash and disastrous venture,\" noted the <em>Prairie Farmer</em> in criticism of Lieutenant-General George Custer's effort \"to divide his regiment into two detachments - one under the command of Major Reno, and the other commanded by himself - make wide detours and flank the enemy.\" On June 25, 1876, Custer and his 7th U.S. Cavalry came upon a village of combined Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, and Arapaho Native Americans on the plains of Montana near Little Bighorn River. According to the <em>New York Evangelist</em>, \"seeing the upper or southern extremity of the village, and probably misunderstanding its extent, he ordered Reno to ford the river, and charge the villagers with three companies, while he, with five companies, moved down the right bank and behind the bluff, to make a similar attack at the other end.\" Reno did as he was told, but soon retreated to the limited cover of the timberline after about 20 minutes of fighting. Custer had told Reno that he would stay near enough to provide Reno's forces with reinforcements, if needed. However, Custer took a diverging route and stumbled upon the village, which was ready to fight. The Native American forces engaged Custer's troops, which were pushed back from the river, through a valley, and onto a high ridge. There, all of Custer's battalion were surrounded and, save for Custer's Crow scout, \"were annihilated by hostile Sioux savages,\" as described in the <em>Prairie Farmer</em>. Fighting continued the remainder of the day and the next, with Reno's forces withstanding Native American attacks until being relieved by generals Terry and Gibbon on the third day, just after the enemy had fled.","According to historian Walter Camp, the battle \"was no massacre; there was no ambush, no trap set for the white troops to enter. It was a battle in three fights, fair and simple. The Indians had met Custer's detachments in detail and defeated them, all within sight of their village.\" Although Custer was widely criticized at the time, the ambiguity surrounding his death gave artists free reign to interpret his final moments. One of the most popular images created by artists since is of \"Custer's Last Stand,\" which most often portrays Custer as a fearless, buckskin-clad man standing firm and stalwart in a swarm of Indians and fallen soldiers, defying death itself. Historian Brian W. Dippie claims, artists \"gave it instantly recognizable form and planted it in our heads.\" Additionally, Custer's widow, Elizabeth, actively campaigned to establish her husband's legacy as a valiant and brazen hero - an effort that was widely successful. ","To whites, the myth of Custer's Last Stand could be interpreted as \"white civilization surrounded, indeed stormed, by white savagery,\" as Dippie suggests. The Prairie Farmer betrays the white majority's opinions of Native Americans as \"hostile savages\" and \"red devils.\" This one-dimensional myth is how the Battle of Little Bighorn was viewed for more than a century. However, in the late twentieth century, efforts were made to explore the Native American outlook on what they termed the Battle of the Greasy Grass. Little Bighorn came at the apex of the United States Government's attempts to subjugate Native Americans by forcing them onto reservations. As suggested by Native American scholar Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., whites \"offered the Indians the same three choices: become whites; stay on reservations, isolated from the rest of us, until you can be assimilated; or resist both choices and die.\" Douglas C. McChristian reiterates this point: \"They knew it as...a great, yet fleeting victory that signaled the doom of their traditional way of life.\" To some, the controversial battle was a symbol of American virtue. Yet to others, the battle reflected the conflict between unending American westward expansion and the Native American defense of their land and way of life. To bridge the gap, many scholars have attempted a more universal reinterpretation of the Battle of Little Bighorn that encompasses both the long-held view of the former and the more recent emergence of the latter."],"display_date":"July 15, 1876","search_date":"1876-07-15","locations":[{"id":8042,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"BIG HORN, Montana"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4121,"title":"The End&#39;s in Sight in Nashville\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-12-15","end_date":"1864-12-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Major-General George H. Thomas had done it. In a telegram sent to President Abraham Lincoln and Lieutenant-General Ulysses S. Grant, Thomas described, \"The woods, fields and entrenchments are strewn with the enemy's small arms, abandoned in their retreat.\" Following the overwhelming Union victory at the Battle of Franklin on November 30, 1864, General John M. Schofield joined the rest of Federal forces in Nashville, Tennessee. Commanded by General Thomas, the Union force reached approximately 49,000 men. The Federal defensive line in the city was positioned in a semicircular shape stretching from east to west and extending a mile to the south. Confederate Lieutenant-General John Bell Hood was in the process of making a daring offensive into Tennessee, hoping to reach Kentucky eventually, when he was soundly defeated by Schofield's forces at Franklin. From there, Hood led his battered and discouraged forces to Nashville on December 2, where they took up defensive positions, hoping to take the city in a counterattack. Although his army had little confidence in Hood's command after the devastating slaughter experienced at Franklin, Hood was somehow optimistic: according to the <em>Richmond Daily Dispatch</em>, '\"We have taken stronger places...and we will take Nashville.\"' However, the actual events of the battle would prove contrary to his expectations. ","Under heavy pressure from both Lincoln and Grant to crush the dwindling Confederate army in the West, but delayed by winter ice storms, Thomas finally began his assault on Hood's army, which was a much smaller 31,000 troops, two weeks later on December 15.  He launched a two-pronged attack. As described by historian Jack Lepa, the first attack, which was directed by General Steedman towards the Confederate right flank, \"was supposed to be merely a demonstration to attract the enemy's attention from the main assault.\" The second, but main, assault was led by Generals Smith and Wood on the left side of the Confederate Army. At the end of the first day, Union troops had pushed General Hood's Confederate forces approximately eight miles south of their original positions. However, both President Lincoln and General Grant encouraged Thomas to bring an end to the war in the West for good; as Lipa states, \"At this point in the war a mere victory was not sufficient. The enemy must be destroyed.\" The following day went much like the first. Thomas launched another two-phase attack against the Confederate forces, which had formed a new and shorter line along the Overton Hills, concentrating on the Confederate left flank. Attacks from Federal Generals Smith, Schofield, and Wilson forced Confederate General Cheatham's troops to retreat along Franklin Pike, the only remaining means of escape. Only rainy weather and the return of Confederate Calvary General Nathan Bedford Forrest prevented Union forces from pursuing and capturing the remaining Confederate Army, which retreated to Tupelo, Mississippi.","\"The Federal victory at Nashville sealed the fate of the Confederacy west of Virginia,\" according to Lepa. Historian Stanley F. Horn reinforces the battle's importance: \"After Nashville there were no more battles of material import. Within four months the war was over.\" After being routed at Nashville, the Army of Tennessee, which was the second largest Confederate force during the Civil War, was rendered ineffective for the remainder of the war. Confederate losses outweighed Federal casualties approximately three to one. General Hood's risky campaign to invade Tennessee and Kentucky had failed. Meanwhile, General Sherman faced virtually no opposition during his infamous \"March to the Sea,\" which crippled the South. Coupled with success in the East and Sherman's March, the Battle of Nashville served as the decisive blow that led to the Confederacy's eventual surrender in 1865.

Finally reaching the fort on November 6, 1814, Jackson sent a surrender demand to Spanish Governor Gonzalez Manrique, but British marines opened fire on Jackson's army. Jackson next called for an immediate British evacuation of Pensacola. The Spanish governor refused so Jackson ordered his officers to pass the word on to their troops to prepare for a predawn attack the following day.  The attack was over in a matter of minutes, and the Spanish resistance crumbled. Gonzalez Manrique hoisted a white flag and surrendered the town. Jackson described the way his troops acted with a \"steady firmness\" and describes \"the good order and conduct of my troops whilst in Pensacola…has drawn from the citizens an expression, that our Choctaws are more civilized than the British\". This statement about the civility of the Choctaws is the key statement in Jackson's letter because it presents the irony of Jackson's relationship with the Indians. ","This irony is clearly presented during the First Seminole War, and Jackson's Indian Removal Policy that he employed during his presidency. In his letters from the Seminole War, he often refers to the Native Americans as \"barbarians\" and as the \"savage enemies of the U.States,\" a stark contrast from the praise he gave the Indians during the capture of Pensacola. Jackson further contradicted his statement in 1814 when he became president. During his presidency, \"Jackson believed that the red men now lived on conquered territory and that they would survive only if removed farther west, that removal was a \"just and liberal policy\"\" (O'Brien 223). \"From his own bitter wartime experiences, Sharp Knife [another name for Jackson] was convinced that the nation's southern frontier could never be free of danger of foreign intervention until the red men were gone\" (O'Brien 224). Therefore, in 1830, Jackson passed the Indian Removal Act, which forcibly removed the Creek, Chickasaw, Seminoles, and even the Choctaws. This is ironic because in 1830, Jackson adopted a policy to remove the Indians that he claimed in 1814 \"were more civilized than the British.\" After the statement made by Jackson in 1814 about how \"the Choctaws are more civilized than the British,\" from then on his policies towards the Indians starkly contradicted that statement.

She also described the tension in the city of Corinth, Mississippi where people were on edge and fearful of \"Yankee raids\" following some previous, unmentioned event. Although the unmentioned event happened some weeks before, the residents of Corinth continued to be on the defensive. ","    The issue of life on the home front is one of great importance when attempting to understand and fully grasp the type of impact that the Civil War had on both the Northern and Southern regions of the United States. As Stephen Ash described in his book, <em>When the Yankees Came, </em>\"the unique psyche of the South has been shaped, in part, by what happened to the Southern people when the Yankees came.\" Events such as the burning of Bayou Sara by Union armies as well as personal encounters with soldiers mentally and physically affected by the conflict would have severely affected the outlook on the war for those who remained at home. For many Southern women especially, who suddenly became responsible for managing farms and plantations on their own while living with battles being fought in their backyards, their experiences on the home front deeply influenced their opinions of the national conflict. Perhaps such events would have caused women like Narcissa Barksdale and Alice Janney to rally around the Confederate troops and encourage them to fight harder against the invading Union forces, but then again these same events could have just as easily spurned a desire to simply stop the fighting and bring the troops home.

Families owned slaves and continued to throughout the Civil War. Opoethleyohola, a Muscogee Creek Chief also known as Gouge, wished to remain neutral. Many other neutral Creeks followed him North of Indian Territory, which is now Oklahoma.","Colonel Douglas H. Cooper had been persuaded that 'Gouge' was a threat and had been offered support from E. H. Carruth, Indian Agent for the USA. He took 2000 troops, and began pursuing the refugees. His spies told him that there were more followers than first believed, so the Ninth Texas Cavalry joined them in their pursuit. Their Commander, Lt. Col. William A. Quayle, believed there \"to be 1500 strongly posted\" Indians, including 500 Jayhawkers, but later they numbered 9000. The Confederates numbered 2500; both they and the refugees were \"ill equipped for the winter march or for military action.\"","Gouge camped with everyone near the Creek Council at Thlobthlocco when he heard about their pursuit. He began to \"fire the prairies,\" leaving nothing to be foraged; thus slowing down Cooper. With the burning, it was still \"so dark [they] could not distinguish an Indian from a white man at three paces,\" which didn't help any whites, but it was easier for Indians as they are better at seeing in the dark. The flickering of the many bush fires and the moving of the tall grasses contributed to the confusion.","Late November 19, the front of Cooper's men, believing they had made contact with Gouge's pickets, followed the fire-trailers who lead them into an ambush. Near to Round Mountain the Texans gave chase. They were fired upon by the fire-trailers and dogs were sent through the ranks to disturb the men; they got into rank as quickly as the situation allowed. The Indians fired the bush to surround and shepherd Cooper and his men to where they wanted them, a \"timber-lined, horse-shoe-shaped prairie,\" where Cooper was welcomed with hot lead and whizzing arrows. They were \"fighting by the flash of the enemy's guns … on three different sides,\" but this did not affect the death toll. Six Confederates died, four were wounded, while one went missing; Opoethleyohola lost approx. one hundred and ten men. Cooper also lost six horses, some killed, and some stampeded.

After the Civil War, the North wanted to ensure the abolition of slavery, recognition of the rights of African Americans, and that the South would remain a part of the nation; these were the major goals of the Reconstruction policies.   To meet these goals, The North required all former Confederate states to write a new state constitution, incorporating these measures, in order to be readmitted to the Union.  From January 14, 1868 to March 17, 1868, delegates met in Charleston, South Carolina to formulate a new South Carolina State Constitution.  This new constitution incorporated the goals of the North.  Article I included provisions that:  stated the equality of all men (Sec. 1), abolished slavery (Sec. 2), asserted that the Union was \"indissoluble\" (Sec. 5), and pledged \"paramount allegiance\" to the United States Constitution (Sec. 4).  While Article I abolished slavery and dictated equality, the new constitution also had to have provisions that ensured the political and social rights for African Americans.  Article VIII Sections Two and Eight ensured the political freedom of universal male suffrage regardless of \"race, color, or former condition.\"  While, Article X Section Ten, which ensured that \"all public schools...shall be free and open to all children...without regard to race or color,\" was intended to provide the social right to education.   With these new statues in the state constitution, the North felt that South Carolina had met the provisions to be readmitted to the Union; the North hoped these new laws would end the discrimination and disenfranchisement of the African American community in South Carolina.  ","    Historian Richard Zuczek argues that while the constitution provided a new government and new protections for African Americans, \"State whites rejected out-of-hand the constitution and the government it would establish.  For Carolinians, although the new constitution 'may have the authority of law...it has not and never can have the moral sanction of right, truth, or justice...\"  Because the new constitution was written mainly by African Americans and white Republicans, most of the white citizens of South Carolina saw the constitution and the government as illegitimate and longed for the reinstallation of a society based on white supremacy.  This attitude represented the major failure of Reconstruction; it ended de jure political and social discrimination against African Americans, but could not address the de facto discrimination based upon the attitudes and culture of white Carolinians.  These attitudes led to actions that disrupted the government and ensured that African Americans were not given the equality or rights the new constitution guaranteed them.  Southern whites used extralegal forms of violent or economic coercion to continue the discrimination of African Americans; the new rights, provided by the law, were being circumvented by a society that hoped for a return to the antebellum culture of racial superiority.  Thus, the goals of Reconstruction could not be fully applied to a society that was not ready to embrace a culture of racial equality."],"display_date":"January 14, 1868 - March 17, 1868","search_date":"1868-02-14","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4147,"title":"The Last Rebel Paper\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-03","end_date":"1865-04-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By 1865, General Robert E.

Tate communicated in a letter to his superior officer, Jacob van Lear, that the men were restless.  Embroiled in a military chess match with Britain on their own soil, this was an awful time to have depressed soldiers.  At any time, the men at Camp Mitchel might be called to duty.  So, maintaining a high morale was equally important as remaining sharp in battle.  Nevertheless, feelings of anger and frustration abounded, and some officers, like Tate, sought to appease the soldiers, if for no other reason, than to boost morale and spur victory against the very deadly British and Indian forces.","For those camps not at war, everyday chores such as guard duty were a necessity.  Even so, men like Bob Beard detested it.  Assigned watch in the pouring rain, Beard's increasing disenchantment with his place in the war hit its tipping point.  Certainly, the soldiers expected to fight, but questions about if they ever would, seemed to rack Beard's brain.  In an effort to do something to change his situation, Beard rallied the men in camp to support a bill in the House of Delegates that would discharge them from duty.  His efforts did not fall on deaf ears.  Other men, like Andrew Seat, begged for higher wages.  The unhappiness throughout the camp incited change.  ","Tate sensed their restlessness, and in hopes of a compromise, he urged his superiors increase wages because \"if they don't pay the troops of their money very shortly that they will all go home.  They talk very strongly about it now.\"  He understood the ramifications of having unhappy soldiers, and the threat that they might just abandon the cause was very real.

During the time of Rice's military service, he had two daughters that were still slaves in Glasgow, Missouri.  While spending time in Benton Barracks Hospital, which was in St. Louis, Missouri, Rice wrote letters to his daughters, as well as the master of the two girls.  In the letter to his daughters, Rice assured them that the Union Army was on its way to free them and liberate Glasgow.  He wrote of expecting to be out of the hospital and with the army to personally free the girls when they came in town.  Rice also talked about the girl's master, Miss Kaitty, and told them to warn her that he is coming.  He stated that he used to have some respect for her and other slave holders, but since the girls freedom was denied, he had lost all of it.  Rice compared Miss Kaitty to the devil, and questioned how she could ever call herself a Christian, while refusing to sell his children to him.  He directed threats towards Miss Kaitty, stating, \"I want you to understand kittey digs, that where ever you and I meets we are enemies to each other.\" ","Many enlisted, especially former slaves, to help the Union cause.  According to historian Jeffrey R. Hummel, by the end of the war nearly 200,000 blacks served in the Union military.  This, Hummel states, \"brought thunderous outrage,\" from the southern population, which may have been a reason why Rice's children were not given to him by the slave holder.   ","Black soldiers were not permitted to fight for the Union at the start of the war, and even when they were allowed to, they had to earn the respect of whites.  No matter what the feelings were towards blacks at the time, their importance could not be denied.  Historian James M. McPherson states that blacks fighting for the north \"gave an important impetus to the Union war effort.\"  ","Spotswood Rice's letter illustrates one instance of a black mans experience in the Union army, and how he hoped it helped save his children from slavery.  It also shows the type of feelings blacks had for slave holders of the time.  Rice had very strong feelings of revenge for his daughter's master, and was not afraid to tell her about it.  Like many other blacks, Rice used the Union army as a way to get a type of revenge on the southern way of life.

With emotional words and a call to desert the army, many more confederate soldiers, who were already unhappy due to low morale often caused by defeat, left the army.  Despite this, the desertion rate for the Confederate Army was lower than that of the Union Army.  Many agree that a majority of the Confederate Army volunteers continued their service to the army until the end of the war, and that the high desertion numbers in the Confederate Army were only partially due to soldiers deserting their camps.  Many soldiers who either died in battle but were never found, or who left their camp and served in another unit are counted in the number of deserters.

Interestingly, a letter was sent to Secretary Seward three years prior to the attacks, warning him of a rumored plot to assassinate the president and a number of his Cabinet, but Seward chose to ignore the warning on the belief that assassination was not an American practice.

To Mrs. Virginia Clay, wife of Senator Clement Clay of Alabama, the fifty-five year old Houston was a \"Senatorial Hercules\" and a \"roughish old hero\".  In her book, <em>A Belle of the 50's</em>, Mrs. Clay explains Houston's whittling habit saying that \"a seemingly inexhaustible supply of soft wood was always kept in his desk [in the Senate] and out of it he whittled stars and hearts and other fanciful shapes.\"  One day, she received an envelope while she watched in the gallery of the Senate and \"within a tiny, shiny, freshly whittled wooden heart, on which the roguish old hero had inscribed, 'Lady I send thee my heart Sam Houston'\" (99).  She further mentioned his youthful nature as she explained that \"nothing amused him more than to reduce to a confused silence those who surrounded him, by suddenly addressing them in all sorts of unknown words\" in a number of Indian dialects (100).  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Sam Houston to Mrs. Clay she found in his attire as \"he wore a leopard-skin vest, with a voluminous scarlet neck-tie, and over his bushy grey locks rested an immense sombrero... wrapped around his broad shoulders he wore a gaily coloured Mexican <em>serape</em>, in which scarlet predominated\" (98- 99). ","Numerous reasons explain why Sam Houston would wear a serape as Marion Wisehart in <em>Sam Houston: American Giant</em> wrote, \"Senator Houston wore a bright Mexican serape to protect his back and chest from drafts\" (497).  Or perhaps with the time he spent near Mexico, Senator Houston became more comfortable in that clothing style.  Regardless, the same man that Mrs. Clay describes seems very different than the General who led an army of Texans to victory at San Jacinto.  Sam Houston acted as statesman, politician, and soldier.  He fought in the War of 1812, governed Tennessee and later Texas as Governor of two different states, became elected twice as the President of the Republic of Texas, and worked as a Senator for Texas fighting against succession (though a slaveowner himself).  Wisehart describes another aspect of Houston as \"he could talk extemporaneously for two or three hours and hold his audience in thrall.  After sleeping all night on the cold, damp ground, he could sit on a log and write powerful appeals to stimulate patriotic ardor or eloquent petitions in his own defense\" (vii).  As explained in <em>The Autobiography of Sam Houston,</em> \"It is of such violent contrasts that an epic figure is made\" (xv).  The diversity in the behavior of Sam Houston can not be separated.

A few men stand at ready to insert the cannonballs before a misty field that would later be covered with smoke.  Despite the gritty quality, the focus on the soldiers faces is striking.

Despite initial reservations about secession, he joined the multitudes of southerners who rushed to enlist.  At first an artilleryman, by 1864 Trueheart had finished studying medicine and was an assistant surgeon in the 8th Alabama Infantry of the Army of Northern Virginia.  It was in this capacity that he experienced the Battle of the Crater on July 30, 1864 in Petersburg, Virginia.","            As Charles W. Trueheart recalled in an August 28, 1864 letter to his brother, Henry Trueheart, the level of death and destruction at the Crater was horrific.  He tells his brother, \"I have never any where seen such a slaughter as there was enacted,\" the dead and wounded were spread across several acres and, \"in many places you couldn't walk without stepping on their carcasses lying one two or even three deep.\"  The \"Crater\" was the result of an attempt by Union forces under Ambrose Burnside to smash the Confederacy's heavily fortified position at Petersburg by tunneling under their location and setting off a major explosion.  To this end, the Union effort was a success, but in the ensuing struggle, the Union attack lacked coordination and became log jammed at the Crater.  The Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee quickly capitalized on this error and inflicted a severe defeat on Burnside's forces, notably including the 4th Division of the United States Colored Troops.  For most Confederates at the Crater, this was their first encounter with black soldiers, here represented in major proportions.","            The black soldiers' presence was Charles Trueheart's main focus in recounting the aftermath of the battle.  His first mention was of the \"Negroes\" that lay dead and wounded with the \"Yankees[,] those vile deceivers and ruiners.\"  Throughout the letter, Trueheart looked at the relationship of these two entities. He said that the injured blacks \"bore their sufferings much better than the Yankees;\" that they complained less and displayed greater Christian devotion in their sufferings.  Moreover, Trueheart wrote that the main complaints that the blacks had were that the Yankees abused them and that the slaves among them wanted to return to their masters.  Trueheart then described the heroism and ability of the blacks, almost equal to the Confederates' and far surpassing the behavior of the white Yankees.  He noted an instance wherein, \"one black fellow...had a regular duel with the Sergeant Major of our reg't.\"  Trueheart says that they traded several shots, that the black soldier, in fact, landed the first shot, hitting \"the Sgt. in the forehead.  Fortunately his head was as thick as his heart was brave, and the ball glanced upwards.\"  A Confederate at last shot and killed the black soldier.  In another notable encounter, an \"officer in our Brigade, having captured a negro in the trenches, told him to turn and fire upon the retreating Yankees; which he did rapidly.\"","            It is impossible to determine how much of Trueheart's account was true, but certainly there is a pervasive slant.  Indeed, many others reported with sadistic pleasure the widespread massacre of black troops by soldiers encouraged to execute them rather than take any prisoner.  The purpose of Truehearts' revisions seems almost inherent within the letter.  It reflected an interest, at the very least, in a temporary realignment of social inclusiveness that would incorporate blacks (40% of the Southern population) and thus engender support for the war efforts against \"those vile deceivers and ruiners.\"  The value of blacks to the war effort was undeniable; loyalty of slaves on the plantations was a major issue, but their presence on the battlefield could be even more potent.  Around 200,000 black soldiers served in the Union, almost 25% of the number of men thought to have fought for the Confederacy-an especially impressive figure considering the comparatively small proportion of blacks in the Union, as well as their exclusion from enlistment until more than two years after the war began.  ","            By the Battle of the Crater in 1864, confidence in the ultimate success of the Confederacy was waning and there was considerable agitation for inclusion of blacks in the war effort.  Significantly, most supporters of a black soldiery also espoused emancipation, which they saw as an unfortunate but necessary accomplice.  By 1865, even top Confederate officials like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee came out in support of the plan. Yet the time had passed for such a move.  With the Confederate States' defeat in spring of 1865, it became a moot point.  The fragile wartime overture of Southern whites was rendered little more than a moment's retreat from racist agendas that defined much of the South's history."],"display_date":"August 28, 1864","search_date":"1864-08-28","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4241,"title":"Chicago Prepares for Lincoln&#39;s Remains\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-30","end_date":"1865-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            April 30, 1865, was a busy yet solemn day for the residents and city officials of Chicago.

Simms believed that generations to follow would remember the triumph of the women who exemplified the best qualities of both men and women.","            The Civil War years offered women in both the North and the South new ways to participate in society.  A small number disguised themselves as men and snuck onto the battlefield, others became nurses, and still more stayed at home to sew uniforms and pack provisions.  From the start of the war in 1861, magazines such as <em>Harper's Weekly</em> encouraged women to sacrifice their resources, time, and families for their nation.  After kissing their husbands and sons farewell, women set up domestic labor groups to fulfill their patriotic duties and show courage even while far removed from the battlefield.  This courage demanded that women suffer emotional wounds sometimes considered more harmful than the physical wounds suffered by the men they loved.","            As the war progressed, resources in the South grew slim and women became impatient.  As more sons and husbands died, women began to question their role in society without a man - should they devote themselves wholeheartedly to the war or fight for their own freedom?  The elite women's dresses grew dingy while the lower classes struggled to find bread and coffee for each night's meal.  Over time sewing groups turned into political discussions, and the boldest women began writing letters to government officials and army officers beseeching them to bring the men home.  Others wrote poems and prayers published in magazines, trying to impress the magnitude of their suffering.  Letters to their husbands begged them to come home to protect their families.  Southern women feared God was no longer on their side.  As they debated whether it might be easier on the battlefield than at home, they tried to find the balance between gentleness and valor required of them.  Despite all of the doubt, they must have hidden their uncertainty well because men like William Gilmore Simms believed that women held the South together and credited them for winning the war even though the South lost."],"display_date":1867,"search_date":"1867-07-02","locations":[{"id":8926,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4267,"title":"Kate Stone Praises Booth for His Daring Attempt\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-28","end_date":"1865-04-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 28, 1865 Kate Stone recorded her thoughts about the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.  She wrote, \"All honor to J. Wilkes Booth, who has rid the world of a tyrant and made himself famous for generations.\"  She also mentions John H. Surratt in her praises for \"daring\" an attack on the Secretary of State William H. Seward, a well know abolitionist. Later she discovered it was Louis Powell, friend to Booth, who had attempted to take the life of Seward. Later in the entry, Kate commented she hoped the two \"avengers\" would escape to the South. She releases a torrent of anguish on Lincoln's memory by adding, \"It is a terrible tragedy, but what is war but one long tragedy? What torrents of blood Lincoln has caused to flow, and how Seward has aided him in his bloody work.\" Kate wrote about the \"gloom\" that descended on her town, when news of Robert E. Lee and his army had been captured. She concludes her entry by stating that depression has taken everyone and she fears for her and her family's welfare if the slaves are freed.  "," Kate Stone's uncertainties were very legitimate feelings to most Southerners when they discovered Lee's surrender. The war to Southerners was fought for tax equality and defending state rights. Abraham Lincoln appeared as a tyrant to many Confederates when he revoked the right of <em>habeas corpus</em>. In doing this, many Confederate sympathizers and informants were arrested without their constitutional rights to a trial. This incited fierce patriotism and nationalism within the South, as Confederates sought to define Kate Stone's \"terrible tragedy.\" To commemorate feelings of patriotism, military leaders, such as Robert E. Lee or the Confederate soldier were viewed as people of honor, which reflected Southern virtues of courage, honor and integrity on the home front. ","These honorable sentiments were observed as essential qualities in Kate's South.  It was these values that idolized the memory of the South before the war and created a superior opinion of the southern home front. The idea of protecting the \"grace and gentility\" of home life in the Confederate states was reinforced with the news of Lee's surrender and the emancipation of the slaves. The home front became the next battle ground for the conservation of southern values. These thoughts would create much of the tension between the white South and the North as plans for Reconstruction took place. Kate Stone's journal entry provides a look into the Southerners' identity as Confederate defeat became a reality. Kate represents the insecurity of the Confederates as they experienced a period of mourning and remembrance at the end of the Civil War. Kate Stone's reflection of Lincoln's death, Lee's surrender and the emancipation of slaves was her way of trying to reason with news from the battle front.

Under the command of Major Robert Anderson, the troops heard the signal and began to evacuate their garrison. Packing up provisions, ordnance, and the fort's United States flag, the soldiers left Moultrie permanently. Their destination was Fort Sumter.","    Tensions in Charleston were high, as city commanders, loyal to the state, organized militia and built batteries throughout the Charleston area aimed at Fort Moultrie. Despite these threatening troop movements and gun placements, Major Robert Anderson was under strict orders to show no hostility towards the rebels. However, likewise, he was also instructed to \"hold to the last extremity\" if attacked. Afraid of being overwhelmed by a land-based assault on Moultrie, Anderson had planned for weeks to abandon his position and relocate to Fort Sumter, which he believed was much more defensible installation. He had no express orders from Washington to move to Sumter and his move could be perceived by rebel commanders as a hostile act.

This brigade saw action in many battles of the American Civil War, including the battles of Richmond, the Second Battle of Manassas, Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg.  Caldwell describes the actions the brigade took part in, and at the end of each section lists the names and ranks of those soldiers from the brigade killed or wounded in that action.  If a commanding officer is killed, Caldwell devotes a special remembrance of that officer as a man and a soldier, as a kind of memorial.  </em>","<em>In this book, Caldwell goes into great detail about the brigade and their combat experiences.  One scene which is quite striking is one in which he passed by a breastwork that had caught fire due to exploding ammunition.  Caldwell saw the charred bodies of men who were caught in the inferno, and described how their bodies showed the last moments of their life, arms in the air trying to ward off the flames.  In the descriptions of the battles, he usually showed his sense of pride and camaraderie.  There was only one instance of when he was ashamed of his brigade, and that was when they were unable to hold the line against a Union assault.  Caldwell also mentions the support of the Southern women.  He says that the women incite dissention among the soldiers and have been so worn down by loss and hardship that they had given up and left the men to their own devices.</em>","<em>The secondary sources support the events described in Caldwell's book.

The Commission focused on the details of Union soldier's imprisonment during their service. The soldiers gave testimony as to their experience as a prisoner of war. The compilation of accounts details the suffering and privations of different soldiers both commissioned and non-commissioned officers. ","            Private Joseph Grider was sworn in and examined in Virginia by the Commission. He detailed his survival from both the Libby and Danville Prisons operated by the Confederate States of America. The main discussion elaborated on the health of Private Grider and the conditions in which he was held. Grider detailed the rations allotted to himself and his fellow prisoners of war; the main storyline revolved around the bread ration, a staple in the diet of Civil War soldiers. The bread was rough with whole grains; when he was moved to Danville he received black bread made of cane seed. Grider discussed the deterioration of his health as a result of the food rations and inadequate housing. The prisoners suffered from diarrhea and other ailments. One other area of interest from Grider's testimony involves the severity of punishment enforced by the Confederate guards; during his stay at Danville seven men were shot for out the window. Other punishments involved the holding of men in chambers until they 'fouled on the floor.'","            Another testimony from Private Robert Morrison detailed the differences between Richmond, Pemberton, and Danville Confederate Prisons. Similar to Grider, he discussed the loss of personal items and the deprivation of clean and warm shelter during his early experiences in the prisons. The deprivation of healthy and clean food was another problem for Private Morrison. He noted the decline in his health as coinciding with his entrance into the prisoner of war encampments. Prior to his capture he did not have problems with diarrhea or fever; sickness did not take hold upon Morrison until he began eating the rations given to him by Confederate guards. Unlike Grider's testimony, Morrison detailed his final living quarters as warm, spacey with endless amounts of food and also access to a 'privy.' ","            The similarities between these two privates testimony is parallel when it comes to their experiences with food rationing. In many instances they expressed their opinion that it was contaminated or perhaps undercooked. Private Morrison stated, \"I got a chunk of corn bread daily...sometimes it was about half baked.\"  Dr. Joseph Jones, a witness in trial against Henry Wirz, 'formerly the commandant of the interior of the Confederate States military prison at Andersonville', shared this hypothesis stating, \"As far as my experience extends, no person who had been reared on wheat bread, and who was held in captivity for any length of time, could retain his health and escape either scurvy or diarrhea, if confined to the Confederate ration (issued to the soldier in the field and hospital) of unbolted corn meal and bacon.\" ","            Interestingly enough, Confederate law decreed that all prisoners should have access to the same privilege and food rations as the Confederate Soldiers; this act was acknowledged by General Robert E. Lee himself in a letter to a relative stating, \"The laws of the Confederate Congress and the orders of the War Department directed that the rations furnished prisoners of war should be the same in quantity and quality as those furnished enlisted men in the army of the Confederacy, and that the hospitals for prisoners should be placed on the same footing as other Confederate States hospitals in all respects.\" Whether this was an act of forbearance or an act of compassion it is easy to see, Union soldier in Confederate prisons suffered through disease and desperation similarly. Although this was an act in effect, prisons in the South failed to comply with all its' standards and requirements. William Best Hesseltine pointed out that the closing of the summer of 1863 brought about the halt of a cartel in which prisoners from both sides of the war were exchanged; this halt increased the number of mouths to feed and also the growing debt of the Confederacy. Prisoners in southern camps suffered the consequences of this halt. Hesseltine remarked that the quality and quantity of rations for prisoners especially at Libby prison decreased markedly as the days passed by and yet the officers continued to enjoy luxuries such as apples, sugar, eggs, molasses, and corn."],"display_date":1865,"search_date":"1865-07-02","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4281,"title":"Fire and Steel:  Weaponry of the Confederacy\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1863-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Cannons and rifles perform a cacophony of blood and thunder as the cold steel of bayonets slice through the enemy line.

In this book are the specific types, dimensions, and qualities of these weapons.  In and of itself, this book does not shed much insight into the effect these weapons had upon the battles of the Civil War.  We must look for this instead in personal accounts of soldiers who witnessed their effects firsthand.  For this, Caldwell's <em>History of a South Carolina Brigade, </em>Brunson's <em>Pee Dee Light Artillery</em> and Brown's <em>A Colonel at Gettysburg and Spotsylvania</em> work exceedingly well, as all of these books give detailed and sometimes vivid descriptions of the effect of these weapons.  For example, Caldwell describes a particularly gruesome scene in which several soldiers' remains lie mangled by grapeshot and rifle wounds.  </strong>","<strong>During the Civil War, most generals still employed Napoleonic tactics, preferring to move large amounts of troops in tight formations to fire highly accurate rifle volleys at short distances.  This factor, combined with the particularly sinister use of grape and canister shot, which is basically a shotgun burst fired from a cannon, meant a high casualty count.  One can well imagine the devastation these weapons caused upon those unfortunate enough to be in their path.  Bayonets were also used, often causing severe infections in the wound.

It only made sense, then, that Americans would embrace the use of a formal cavalry.","However, the American Civil War marked a change in battle tactics even from the Napoleonic wars mere decades earlier.  A shift in technology made personal weaponry more deadly, forcing generals away from using their own technology to their advantage and towards figuring out how to avoid the advances of the enemy.  Despite these changes, the cavalry remained a staple in the wartime diet of both armies, though it was particularly relished by the Union.","Many accounts were filed of war-horses being specifically trained to withstand gunfire and even taught to charge into enemy fire.  This fearlessness, simulated or innate, was also a value that many outsiders placed on the cavalry.  Though slackers could be found in all walks of life, the Union cavalry's best continually outnumbered and outshone its worst.  As a result, Major-General McClellan continually restocked and supplied the Union's cavalry, spending a great deal on keeping the varied companies stocked with horses and weaponry.

A summary of the Lincoln Assassination case in the New York Times on July, 21 1865 proves that Fort Jefferson, the Dry Tortugas would be home to several of the Lincoln conspirators.  ","Ponce de Leon made a discovery in 1513 that would later serve as home to a group of men connected to the assassination of an American President.  The island chain would later receive the name of the \"Dry Tortugas\", each word in reference to an identifying feature of the islands as noted by early explorers.  The \"dry\" depicts the lack of a fresh water source on the islands, an essential piece of information that sailors relied upon.  \"Tortugas\" was a maritime term for sea turtles, and these creatures also happened to be the main source of meat for anyone inhabiting the islands; such as the crew of the HMS Tyger did in 1742 after they were shipwrecked and stranded for 55 days.  The extreme isolation of the Dry Tortugas along with its strategic location, not unlike that of Gibraltar, made them the target for a US Fort that would serve to protect shipping lanes and carry out the Monroe doctrine.","Construction of Fort Jefferson began in 1846 and was never completed.  The massive structure covered 11 acres of land on Garden Key, the only island in the Dry Tortugas suitable to serve host to the large mason building.  The American Civil War caused Fort Jefferson to double as a military prison and housed several hundred inmates in the second story gun casemates.  ","In April, 1865 John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Lincoln and fled Ford's Theatre.  After breaking a leg, he sought medical attention from Dr. Samuel Mudd, a prior acquaintance, and proceeded to dodge the authorities for several more days before being shot.  Dr. Samuel Mudd, Edmund Spangler, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlin were all sentenced to life in prison for their alleged roles in the assassination of President Lincoln.  Following their sentencing, the Lincoln conspirators departed in July, 1865 for Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas.  ","In the fall of 1867 several cases of Yellow Fever broke out amongst the troops garrisoned at Fort Jefferson and by mid-September an epidemic gripped the fort.  After the medical officer passed away, Dr. Mudd volunteered his services which saved many of the soldier's lives.  More extraordinary was the fact that Dr. Mudd himself had Yellow Fever and he continued to labor through the disease.   Despite Dr. Mudd's best efforts, his comrade in chains Michael O'Laughlin passed away from the epidemic along with a handful of soldiers.  The NCOs of Fort Jefferson wrote President Johnson a letter praising Dr. Mudd's heroic medical feats despite being a prisoner.

The result was the needless deaths of thousands of men on both sides due to malnourishment, lack of medical care, and abuse by prison guards.  But one set of prisoners fared slightly better than the other.","In a documented 1876 interview, Dr. R. Randolph Stevenson spoke of a provision in the Confederate Constitution for captured Union soldiers. The provision says, \"and the rations furnished for prisoners of war shall be the same in quantity and quality as those furnished to enlisted men in the army of the Confederacy.\"  Union prisons did not uphold such guarantees.  Many Confederate prisoners were denied basic needs by a nation with all kinds of resources.  The Confederacy on the other hand even went so far as to sell valuable supplies in order to feed and care for captured Union soldiers.","Indeed, many surgeons commented on the poor health of returned rebel soldiers. Those diseased souls spoke of abuse and neglect at the hands of their captors.  It was not uncommon for prisoner trade barges to contain the bodies of dead and dying persons.  Some prisoners spoke of being placed in prisons where disease like Small Pox ran rampant and medical aid was denied. Such accounts were collected and published after the war by historians.  Such stories seem at odds with the fact that the Union had funds available to improve the health and well being of captured rebels.","The Confederacy, on the other hand, made sure it upheld its belief in equal treatment of captured soldiers.  When money became scarce within the Confederate prison system, cotton and tobacco were sold to provide additional funding. When disease began to ravage prisoners, Confederate officers tried to barter with Union commanders for medical supplies, only to be rebuffed.  Accounts of favorable treatment and hospitality by Confederate prisons came from men like Mr. John F. Frost of Folgers Company 19th Maine.","In some circumstances, Union soldiers were held prisoners inside hospitals, while Confederate troops were held in makeshift camps.  The unequal treatment of captured soldiers by the two sides stands in contrast to the readily accepted notion that Union soldiers were treated much worse than Confederate troops.  This is perhaps the belief because of northern propaganda like \"Report 67.\" A renamed Congressional report on Confederate prisons based on conditions of soldiers and not on testimonials of POWs.   However, the truth is eventually revealed, and the light shone on the misdeeds of others.

On November 23, 1860, the Richmond Daily Dispatch reported an account from the New York Journal of Commerce about the manufacturing and selling of \"Arms to the South.\" Before directly quoting the New York Journal of Commerce, the Richmond editor mentioned that the makers and sellers of arms were perhaps the only ones \"gathering any advantage from the present crisis.\"  According to the New York account, a firm in New York received anywhere from twenty to fifty orders for arms from South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama daily. The writer for the New York Journal of Commerce also mentioned that while those who did not know better might call the South's credit and financial dependability into question, the South actually concludes all business transactions with cash within thirty days. Adding significance to this article, the writer noted that all the orders came from Southern states, but \"but mainly from those in which secession is regarded as the only remedy for Southern grievances.\"","    The author of this article refers to the \"Colt's revolvers and rifles [sold] to Georgia,\" the arms for \"1,800 men…sent to Savannah,\" and the order of one thousand \"death-dealing weapons\" for Alabama. The New York Journal of Commerce ended this article with another seemingly biased statement that, \"the wholesale houses and agencies in the city [New York City] have been hard pressed to supply the orders for every imaginable species of weapons.\" These figures seem slanted towards Unionist and Northern sentiments, but perhaps these astronomical figures and seemingly exaggerated sentiments by Northerners were not as far-fetched as they first appear. ","    At the onset of the Civil War, the South struggled to provide adequate arms for Confederate troops. Records exist, however, of these several thousand modern small arms that were shipped to the Southern states and that were provided by Northern industries pre-Civil War. When these supplies were cut off at the start of the Civil War by orders of the U.S. government, smaller Confederate states began to produce and manufacture small arms, but they never were able to catch up with the production by the Northern states. It was at this point that the Confederacy turned to Caleb House in Europe in 1861 and 1862 for their weaponry and supplies. Despite the constant gaining and losing of arms in various battles during the Civil War, at the end of the war, the Confederacy, provided by Chief of Ordinance Josiah Gorgas, reported that they possessed 1,306 field artillery pieces, 921,441 rounds of artillery ammunition, 323,231 infantry arms, and 72,413,854 small arms cartridges. So, while the North was not the sole provider of the arms for Confederate armies, their early supplying of Confederate weaponry provided the basis for the Southern states to never lack in arms and ammunition, even though the conditions of these Confederacy arms was negotiable.

Soldiers from both sides of the war wrote letters home to loved ones describing the daily events and occurrences in camp life.  Life as a soldier required patience. Many soldiers recounted the long periods of time spent sitting in camp waiting for their chance to fight. At camps soldiers could actually hear the sounds of war and battle from nearby and became restless and wanted to fight, to see some action. ","            One soldier wrote under the pseudonym Timber Doodle; in his letter home on February 16, 1863. He detailed the lull in camp life plagued by a lack of action. He expressed wishes to see Richmond because his time in the Army soon expired and without fighting the men would see nothing. The tone of his letter is diluted from the monotony of camp life; yet his language and spirit are not completely dulled. He used humor and wit to discuss problems within the Army. Not only are the men sitting and waiting, but they are not getting paid; Doodle wrote, \"We have been out over six months, and not a cent of pay yet; nor do I think we will get any till our time is up.\" Timber Doodle portrayed his experience in the war as repetitive and droning; he expresses the desire to fight by writing, \"Our time is getting short...we had better be up and doing.\"","            Another soldier, the self-proclaimed Omega, wrote a letter home on March 17, 1863. In his letter to loved ones he also discusses his experience with camp life. Like Timber Doodle, he had yet to see action, but he can hear battles in the near distance. He discussed the high spirits of the Army and the readiness of all the men to fly into action at a moment's notice. Unlike Timber Doodle his camp life is portrayed as fun and entertaining. Omega detailed his experience with Irish soldiers and their celebration of St. Patrick's Day. His description of the games and drinking shows a new side of camp life not seen in Timber Doodle's experience. One interesting story he told detailed the death of fellow soldiers. The soldier did not die in battle, but rather in a competition. Omega wrote, \"The third was a general race, trying the elastic powers of the officer's horses by leaping ditches nine feet and the same breadth. One man was killed by his falling into the ditch.\" Unfortunately the droning of camp life and perhaps the high mortality rates from war and disease seem to have dulled Omega's sense of compassion and concern for life.","            Many soldiers shared a similar experience with camp life and these details of monotonous inaction are not irregular. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw expressed a similar sentiment in a letter home to a loved one, Anna, as he wrote, \"The days & weeks pass very quickly tho' they never vary excepting when we go on guard...\" Bell Irvin Wiley, a historian, compared the beginning of the war and camp life to a picnic. He discussed how for many of the soldiers traveling South by train and boat was an adventure; he wrote, \"The battlefield if given a thought seemed remote, and a lack of martial experience made its horrors incomprehensible.\" He pointed out that for many Union soldiers life in camp was no worse than life at home; many younger, rural soldiers were in fact surprised by the wealth of material items which the Union Army could afford. ","            Like Omega and Timber Doodle, Wiley discussed a broad spectrum of sentiments from utter enthusiasm to outright detest for the war which grew within the soldiers as a result of the idleness and monotony of camp life. Wiley wrote, \"Battle is the ultimate of soldiering. All else in warfare is but incidental to the vital closing of opposing forces in conflict.... In the Civil War, however, fighting was an intimate, elemental thing.... Some Billy Yanks went into battle very soon after enlisting...Others waited many months for the fiery ideal. One battle comprised the entire fighting experience of some, while many faced the jaws of death repeatedly.\" ","           Wiley's description of small bursts of action and long periods of inaction seems to accurately portray the sentiments of both Omega and Timber Doodle. These elements of the Civil defined the experience of many Union soldiers who sat reluctantly in camp waiting for their time to fight. These three soldiers, Omega, Timber Doodle, and Shaw, experienced different aspects of camp life during the war in varying parts of Virginia, but there is one thing they share. They are soldiers and they are fighting for the same cause."],"display_date":"February 16, 1863 - March 17, 1863","search_date":"1863-03-02","locations":[{"id":14210,"lat":38.6845288469,"lng":-78.1593262248,"zoom":10,"place":"RAPPAHANNOCK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4325,"title":"Saving Grace: Creation of the United States Ambulance Service\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-08-02","end_date":"1862-08-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            Under the orders of General McClellan, the Army of the Potomac was the first section of the Union Army to derive benefits from an organized ambulance system. On August 2, 1862 General McClellan issued General Order No. 147 near Harrison Landing, Virginia. This order set up regulations within the Army of the Potomac for the creation, organization, and management of an ambulance train system. ","            The order entrusted the running of the ambulance corps to the medical director, Jonathan Letterman. Order No. 147 organized an officer to run the corps at each level of the army; a captain, under the direction of the medical director, commanded the corps. After the captain, commissioned and noncommissioned officers such as the first lieutenant for a division, second lieutenant for a brigade, and sergeant for a regiment presided over their respective equipment. The officers were held responsible for inspections and care of all equipment and workers within the corps. The officers of the corps also presided over the management and control such that the ambulances were to be used for \"transporting the sick to various points and procuring medical supplies, and for nothing else.'\" ","            The establishment and implementation of the Letterman Ambulance Plan reorganized the Army of Potomac's medical services completely. According to Edward C. Munsen, a Major of the Medical United States Army, prior to the order the most incompetent soldiers were acquired to assist in the removal of wounded soldiers from the battlefield. Many times these assignments resulted in the consumption of medicinal liquor and drunkenness of the ambulance assistants. The drunken soldiers ignored their wounded comrades while hiding from enemy fire. ","            Patricia L. Faust, editor, wrote about the unpreparedness of the both the Confederate and Union Armies. Neither side had the manpower or technology to deal with the tremendous numbers of casualties and wounded soldiers that lie on the field following battles. Faust wrote, \"Whether a physician wore gray or blue, he learned quickly that the fate of the wounded depended on which army held the field when the slaughter ended.\" The lives of many soldiers were lost due to the inadequacy of the 'early ambulatory' and medical systems.","           Surgeon General William A. Hammond wrote a plea to Edwin Stanton, the Secretary of War, begging for a better, more organized system of ambulance carriers. His letter, preceding the issuing of the act, discussed the 'frightful state of disorder' which existed in the removal of soldiers from the battlefield. Hammond also commented on the \"scarcity of ambulances, the want of organization, and drunkenness and incompetency of the drivers.\" The plea begged for assistance for the Army of Virginia in the removal of over 600 soldiers still lying on the battlefield; this number being larger due to death of wounded from starvation, exhaustion, and other ailments or wounds. It was not just the military leaders who were outraged; it was also the general public.  ","           Patricia Faust also commented on the state of affairs after the Second Bull Run; the 'early' ambulance wagons and vehicle were breaking down and could not carry men off in great numbers. The civilians were outraged. A week went by before the wounded were removed from the field; the wounded lay on the ground as they suffered through thunderstorms and excessive heat. Finally on July 4, 1862 Surgeon General Tripler was removed from his position and he was replaced by Jonathon Letterman. Letterman, the man for whom the plan was named after, was the official organizer of the new system. ","            This Order from McClellan was implemented a month prior to Antietam, the bloodiest single battle of the war, and also provided great service in the Battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg for the Army of the Potomac. After the Battle of Fredericksburg, Surgeon Charles R. Leary issued a statement in his official report claiming, \"During the engagements of the 13th, the ambulances being guided and governed with perfect control and with a precision rare even in military organizations, the wounded were brought without any delay or confusion to the hospitals of their respective divisions.\"","             Order No. 147 established a strong system of order for use in a chaotic atmosphere. The success of the Order led to the adoption of the Ambulance Corps into the Army of Tennessee by Grant. Ultimately this order led to an approval of the system by President Lincoln on March 11, 1864; Congress passed the Uniform System of Ambulances act which standardized an ambulance system for all military forces.

Included in Manly's offenses was the prayer at Jefferson Davis' inauguration to the presidency of the confederacy in February 1861.  As part of a special group of ex-confederates who could not sign the typical oath of allegiance, Manly needed a Presidential pardon.  Individuals like Manly had to submit a petition to Andrew Johnson to be pardoned.  Following the petition, Manly had to obey five terms to become and remain a United States citizen.  First, he took the oath of allegiance as established by President Johnson on May 29, 1865.  Manly then had to pay any costs owed from any proceeding and disclaim property or proceeds from the sale of confiscated property.  He was instructed to notify the secretary of state to legitimize the pardon upon its arrival, and if Manly used slave labor of any kind in the future, the pardon would be void.  On October 19, 1865 Manly received two more official letters signed by Secretary of State William H. Seward: the first stated that he had taken the oath of loyalty, and the second professed the first letter was a valid copy of the letter Seward had on his file.  At age 67, just three years before his death, Manly Basil, Sr. was once again a citizen of the United States.","            At the end of the Civil War, Lincoln (and later Johnson) was faced with the task of reintegrating those who had participated in the rebellion against the United States.  Lincoln designed a plan that included an oath of allegiance readily available to the masses, but required leaders of the Confederacy to ask him for a pardon directly.  By not forcing anyone to take the oath, Lincoln encouraged a feeling of amnesty when the war ended.   After Lincoln's death Johnson adopted a similar plan, but included a greater number of people in the \"exceptions\" who must ask for presidential pardon.  Manly's role in establishing the confederacy meant that he fell within the fourteen categories of exceptions which included those rebels who had served in political office, held a high ranking military position, or owned property valued at over twenty thousand dollars.  With so many people requiring special consideration, there was a significant influx of petitions for pardon between July and October of 1865 from those who wanted to attend the upcoming state conventions.  Basil Manly's petition for pardon coincided with press reports claiming President Johnson was giving pardons more freely than before.  Lincoln's hope of rebuilding the nation by granting citizenship to large numbers of ex-confederates set up an interesting dichotomy.  While Radical Republicans grew increasingly angry at Johnson's laxness on those they saw as traitors, Southern Democrats slowly began fighting to reassume power in the South.  Instead of finding a unified nation, the two factions continued the struggle for power until after Reconstruction ended."],"display_date":"September 12, 1865 - October 19, 1865","search_date":"1865-09-30","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4336,"title":"Civil War Christmas Memory\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-12-25","end_date":"11/10/37","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["           During the Civil War, holidays and festivities did not enshroud the lives of families and soldiers throughout America. Soldiers usually sat in camp waiting for action as the winter months did not involve tremendous amounts of fighting. Second Lieutenant Robert Gould Shaw wrote home many times to his mother but also on Christmas Day 1861. His description of camp life and the lack of festivities for soldiers is just one example of the diluted Christmas spirit. This lack of elaborate celebration was a common experience for many Southerners such as both a soldier and his wife.","            Shaw told his mother that Christmas Eve and Day were just like any day within the last six months. There was little action and little reason to be joyous and celebrate. Other than a little snow at midnight the holiday just did not seem to be like a typical Christmas; there were no stockings hung, no songs sung, and Santa was nowhere to be seen. Shaw's account of Christmas and camp life seemed somber and relaxed. He seemed to be in good spirit and does talk of Santa cheerfully, but Shaw quickly softens this emotion with a somber observation; this remark is about the reality of war and the restrictions associated with life as a soldier. Shaw wrote, \"...I suppose no one ever had a better chance of seeing \"Santa Claus\"; but as I had my stockings on, he probably thought it not worth his while to come down to the guard-tent.

Although desperation and ersatz ruled the Confederacy during the Civil War, especially during holidays, a complete dissolution of the Christmas spirit did not occur. There are always exceptions; some families could afford the expensive gifts and meals while other soldiers and their families simply looked past the war-torn nation and found a brighter outlook with things that they could be thankful for. In an interview Ida Baker, commented on her recollection of Christmas during the war. She recalled the lack of luxuries, but remembered the spirit which kept themselves and their soldiers going; she said, referring to the women of the era, \"They never gave up and they never stopped making much with nothing.\" The woman always strived to keep their men happy both away during combat and at home following a tour of duty.

The external image of two girls represented the divisive issue of slavery opinions in the north. Fannie North lived in a small cottage and longed for \"a larger and freer home\" in which to grow and be independent. Nancy South had plenty of room and the finest of all material goods, but she was always seeking more. Nancy was not content with her blessings and fortunes. Rather she chose to conquer land and impose her force on others. While \"quiet little Fannie North was [...] contenting herself faithfully living in her narrow sphere, till God should see fit to grant her more room, big Nancy South spread out broader than ever,\"  the desire for more room in which to expand herself only contributed to her selfishness. Fannie was saddened by her lack of freedom and wanted nothing more than to help herself and others enjoy free will.

According to historian Warren Sollors, in 1727 a white woman abandoned her husband because she fell in love with a black man. As a result, laws in 1741 called attention to the interracial marriage of whites and blacks in America. A fine of fifty pounds was to be paid in addition to children of these marriages to work on plantations for an additional two years term. This provoked the notion of legally integrating two races into one another's world. Abolitionists published literature and essays in support of cultural mixing between blacks and whites, creating a unified community. H. Dexter's <em>Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, applied to the American White Man and Negro,</em> is documentation of the positive theories and cultural improvements that interlacing the two races would fabricate in America. ","Dexter stated what he felt would make America a perfected race when he claimed, \"All that is needed to make us the finest race on Earth is to engraft upon our stock the Negro element which providence has placed by our side on this continent.\" The concept of creating a powerful combination of both black and white Americans resulted from two abolitionists and psychologists, Dr. Pritchard and Don Felix DeAzara, wrote essays in response to the \"evil of the pure and the benefit of the mixed.\" These scholars relying on scientific racism wrote about color of the skin depending on the temperature and climate conditions in which they were raised. They concluded that color of skin was irrelevant to the content of their hearts. As an example, the pale English would remain white in the rainy climate of England, while the Africans dark with the climate of the hot, humid sun would need their shadowed complexion. The color of one's skin is only<em> </em>a result of one's environment, nothing more. If integration were introduced, soon humans would have red, blond, and brown hair with some straight or curly. Secondly, the vital thing to remember, despite diversity in appearance, the anatomy is all the same. The human race stems from the same Adam.","Despite Sollors's opinion of the advantages of interracial societies being too difficult to pinpoint due to deep-seated prejudices, Prichard managed to do so very boldly and effectively. He declared that states intermixing races creates a very strong, vital series of new cultural advantages both physically and in the workforce. Black intermixing into American society was the starting line in black history, which led them into the \"white limited\" business world. Due to Prichard's positive concepts of black integration, Minchin's novel of the black textile worker discussed the initial occurrences of whites and black intermingling on the job. In addition, Prichard's companion, Don Felix DeAzara, added to the notion of interracial advantages in America. He claimed America's citizens would posses beautiful features and an agreeable personality, which would carry with them in the work force and throughout life. The idea of merging two cultures would give each race particular characteristics of one another. Combining cultures would produce a race of vigorous life on top of stellar physical conditions surpassing previous generations of American society.

Living the beginning of her life in New Orleans, she eventually moved with her family to northern Michigan where she first discovered her love of the theatre. By the age of eighteen she moved to New York to try her luck at being an actress and stage performer. In homage to Charlotte Cushman, her favorite performer, Harriet legally changed her name to Pauline Cushman. She later married Charles Dickinson, who was called away to fight for the Union in 1862. ","Cushman joined a theater company three months after her  husband left, that toured all across the South, spreading her name throughout the area. One evening after a performance in \"Union-controlled Louisville, Kentucky,\" Cushman was given a large sum of money to toast to Jefferson Davis. She complied, despite her love of the Union, and toasted her enemy. Cushman's theatre company, enraged with her trading allegiance for cash, fired her. Cushman was not phased, as she used her toasting opportunity to \"rub elbows\" with the Rebels. By doing so, she managed to gain their trust as a map and document transporter for the South, while secretly serving as a Union spy. ","According to the <em>Detroit Tribune</em> article <em>Miss Maj. Pauline Cushman, The Federal Scout and Spy</em> in May of 1864, Cushman's accomplishments were praised through journalist accounts of her dramatic escapes. Cushman was captured three separate times, two of which she managed to escape from. Of the second, Cushman was en route to Nashville, riding on the Hardin Pike, when two Confederate scouts grew suspicious of her and mounted her on horseback to bring back for sentencing. Quick on her feet, Cushman paid a slave ten dollars to invent a story of Union soldiers attacking to distract the Confederate scouts. When the scouts fled to check out the invading troops, Cushman escaped temporarily, only to be recaptured the following day. Her eventual capture while concealing Southern battle plans in her shoes and petticoats placed her in jail. By now, the sickly Cushman was sentenced to hanging upon notice of her recovery. Had it not been for the Union invading the Confederate town three days prior to her scheduled execution, Cushman might never have survived to pass along her stories. ","Upon her release, Cushman returned to New York to visit friends and family and to lecture those interested in her adventures. Cushman died tragically of an opium overdose shortly after writing, \"The Life of Pauline Cushman,\" her biography of the patriotic \"Miss Major\" of the Union Army.

Although noticeably different from the modern sniper, Berdan's Sharpshooters were the unmistakable forefathers of what is today roundly considered the most feared specialization on the battlefield. In fact, some theorize that the modern term \"sharpshooter\" may in fact originate from the Sharps Rifle-equipped marksmen in Berdan's unit. Whatever the case, the skill of these men is revealed by Berdan's report of his unit's first combat encounter at the Battle of Yorktown during the Peninsular Campaign of 1862. Although the sharpshooters were unable to wrest a clear victory out of the battle or campaign, their solid performance during Yorktown meant that a new age had dawned for the infantryman.","On June 15, 1861 Secretary of War Edwin Stanton approved the creation of the 1st Sharpshooters Regiment under wealthy investor, crack shot, and outspoken proponent of the idea, Hiram Berdan. Although there were other sharpshooter companies already in existence prior to this, Berdan's unit distinguished itself in several ways. First, these other units were attached to state-specific regiments and received training, uniforms, and assignments that were little different from stock infantrymen. By contrast, the men in Berdan's unit hailed from states all over the Union, with many of them having already been experienced hunters and marksmen, as evidenced by the initiation test alone. Specifically, just to get into the regiment, a recruit had to shoot, freehand, ten consecutive shots in a target 200 yards away and produce a group size no larger than five inches. As this is no easy task even with modern optics and rifles, it is not surprising that the men of Berdan's unit began to think of themselves as an elite group.","The first combat test of this mindset would come at the Battle of Yorktown. According to Berdan's account of the first of the 17 days covered in his report, once the ground was reconnoitered, the regiment was divided into \"companies and detachments, with proper supports and reserves, according to the cover and duties to be performed.\" He then outlined just what those duties entailed, implying that the chief duty of the sharpshooters was basically a specialized form of skirmisher. Specifically, they guarded the roads and flanks respectively against enemy cavalry and flankers, and watched the movements of the enemy. Their secondary objective was to, when \"in groups of one to one hundred, pick off gunners and protect batteries.\" Despite heavy Confederate fire, Berdan reported that his men inflicted many casualties on the enemy (Berdan himself thought that they had \"killed or wounded several hundred rebels\") at the cost of only two killed and four wounded in their own ranks.  ","Although this may seem incredible, it is worth pointing out that Berdan's men tended to be strong individualists (a trait possessed by many modern snipers) who, as mentioned previously, considered themselves an elite unit and dressed accordingly. Specifically, they forsook the typical blue uniforms in favor of green and gray outfits in one of the early uses of camouflage. Whatever the case, it appears that word got around in the Union lines, as Berdan ended his report by stating that \"Since the 5th we have sent a detail of 20 [men] to each of three brigades and sometimes to Hamilton's division. On the 19th I sent two companies, A and C...to General Smith's division. They have thus far done good service.\"","The American Civil War was not the first time that sharpshooters were deployed, as previous wars and contemporary European armies had used them even before the pre-Berdan units were formed. Despite this, the creation of Berdan's Sharpshooters proved to be a huge step towards the modern concept of a sniper, owing as much to Berdan's ideas of deployment and missions as the advancements in rifle technology.

Grant and the East/West division of the Confederacy itself, a goal stipulated in the Anaconda Plan. Since its capture would mean a major strategic victory for the North, the city held immense symbolic, as well as strategic, importance to both sides. After a series of subtle and unsuccessful attempts to circumvent Vicksburg in 1862 and 1863, Grant returned to the approach that had served him so well in the past, and would continue to do so this time and in the future: the brutally direct approach.  "," The City of Vicksburg itself sits atop high bluffs that give it (and any guns placed inside) a commanding view of the Mississippi River, especially north of the city proper, making ownership of the area a necessity for any party that wishes to control the river. The problem from Grant's point of view was that the bluffs meant that he would need to attack the city from the East, which in turn meant ferrying his troops across the river, a task that even Grant knew to be too risky to try north of the city in the Union occupation zone. As such, Grant, after trying and failing several times, devised a simple yet daring plan to ferry his men across the river south of Vicksburg, where a hairpin turn on the river limited the range of the city's guns. To do this, however, Grant obviously needed to position his gunboats south of the city, which required them to run the mighty guns of Vicksburg itself, as the current was too strong to go upriver. ","Since Grant and the commander of his naval forces, Admiral David Porter planned to slip the gunboats past the fortress, many precautious had to be taken. As outlined in Porter's confidential General Order of April 10, 1863, his captains were to take \"every precaution possible to protect the hull and machinery\" of their ships. Such precautions included towing coal barges on the starboard side (going south, Vicksburg would have been on port), keeping all lights extinguished, even when returning fire, and of course, making as little noise as possible.","  The after action report of James A. Greer, one of Porter's captains, filed seven days after the above-mentioned orders and one day after the operation itself, records that the ships departed anchorage at 9:15 PM and first came under fire from the city at about 11:15, with the Union gunboats returning fire eight minutes later. As the night was moonless, the Confederates were forced to light bonfires alongside the bank to see better, but it was not enough: of 525 rounds fired, only 68 hit, while only one of the three transports and none of the eight gunboats were sunk. At this point we see the bluffs that had been Vicksburg's blessing become its curse, as the Southern gunners were apparently unable to hit anything closer than a certain distance. Perhaps realizing this, Greer (and presumably Porter and the other captains) ordered their ship(s) to pass \"within 40 yards of the town, [so close that Greer] could hear the rattling of falling walls after [their] fires.\" At 11:52, the CSA gunners ceased fire, allowing the Union ships to complete their route without further interruption, even from the smaller Confederate towns between Vicksburg and their target.","Although this action was just the first gamble in a plan of Grant's that was basically one big gamble, the first step had been taken and the end had begun for Vicksburg. With the troops Grant was able to ferry across the river with Porter's fleet, the future president marched north and besieged Vicksburg. After a long and grueling siege, the town finally surrendered on July 3rd, 1863, the same day that the Battle of Gettysburg was decided in the East, effectively turning the tide against the CSA in one day after three years of near-unbridled success. Taken together, July 4th, 1863 was probably the most memorable Independence Day in US history since 1776.

This conflict, however, arose between the Executive and Legislative branches. It is quite possible that only a man of Lincoln's strength could have succeeded in handling the Reconstruction crisis that led to the feud, and Johnson, his successor, was unfortunately not of the same cut. As will be seen, given the nature of the crisis, few people would. ","Generally speaking, Reconstruction is divided into several phases, with the distinction between two of them being Presidential and Congressional Reconstruction, both of which are self-explanatory regarding who was in charge. When Lincoln, the helmsman of the former phase, was assassinated, his successor, Andrew Johnson, took it upon himself to follow through with Lincoln's plan for an amicable and (especially) rapid restoration of the Union. Unfortunately for Johnson, the so-called \"Radical Republicans\" that controlled Congress at the time abhorred the Southern States' passage of Black Codes and attempted to slow their reentry into the Union as punishment. Johnson, of course, still had speed as his priority and refused to back these punitive measures. When Congress realized they would get no help from Johnson, they decided to take matters into their own hands and proposed the Freedman's Bureau Bill in late 1865. The Bureau itself had been a temporary entity founded by Lincoln immediately after the war with the intention of assisting the newly freed slaves. Under the Bill proposed by Congress, however, the Bureau's longevity and powers would be greatly increased. While this was ostensibly to give more and better aid to the slaves, it was by no means coincidental that the Bill's passage would transfer <em>de facto</em> control of Reconstruction from Johnson to Congress.  ","From Johnson's point of view, this was a dilemma in the fullest sense of the word: oppose the bill and gain enemies or allow it and lose power. He chose the former and vetoed the passage of the Bill in February of 1866. According to <u>The New York Times</u>, Johnson gave several reasons for this, although the largest one seemed to be that passage of the Bill did not put enough faith in the abilities of the Southern leaders to handle Reconstruction on their own. Furthermore, the article states that Johnson claimed to believe \"that the question of the Union is paramount to all others.\" Taken together, these statements reflect an attempt by Johnson to rally the nation behind him more than anything else. Specifically, in the latter statement he seems to be likening himself to Lincoln and trying to take advantage of the late Lincoln's popularity in the North, with the former statement obviously being an attempt to put him on the good side of the Southern leaders. In the end, this would not help him, as Congress passed the Bill over his veto and basically used their new powers to make life miserable for Johnson, who would go on to have the dubious honor of being the first US President to be impeached.  ","In Johnson's defense, it cannot be denied that Lincoln, a popular man-of-the-people even before he was martyred, would have been a tough act to follow.  In that regard, it is not surprising that Johnson would remain so adamant on his quest to follow through with Lincoln's plan, as to change said plan would have seemed disrespectful to Lincoln's memory and therefore political suicide. The true irony of the situation becomes apparent here, as it was not changing the plan that would turn out to be the real suicide. Specifically, Johnson's unwillingness to deviate from Lincoln's hope for a fast rebuilding-even in the face of the Black Codes-led to Congress trying to seize Reconstruction authority via the Freedman's Bureau Bill, which in turn led to the lose-lose position that Johnson occupied in February 1866."],"display_date":"February 20, 1866","search_date":"1866-02-20","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4357,"title":"Passage of Shermans Special Orders No. 15\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-16","end_date":"1865-01-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Although many regard war as good for absolutely nothing, the truth of the matter is that troops are not the only things that advance in war. In fact, some of the greatest advancements made by mankind in fields ranging from medicine to the arts can trace their roots to military necessity. One such example made in the field of Civil Rights during the American Civil War was Special Field Orders Number 15, popularly referred to as \"Forty Acres and a Mule.\" Issued by General William T. Sherman shortly after the end of his infamous March to the Sea, the act placed captured Southern land in the hands of the freed slaves, something that had never been done before. ","The fall of the seaport city of Savannah, Georgia in late 1844 to Union General William T. Sherman brought an end to the general's famous \"March to the Sea.\" Over a period of two months, a fifty-mile wide front of Union soldiers had marched up to 12 miles a day, looting what they wanted and destroying everything else, including the metaphorical chains of untold numbers of slaves. Under the Emancipation Proclamation, all slaves in areas controlled by the Union were granted freedom, which would pose an unforeseen problem in this case. Specifically, Abraham Lincoln had drafted the Proclamation at the North's nadir, when obtaining half as much land and slaves in twice the amount of time as Sherman had just done would have seemed impossible. As such, the Proclamation's wording about what to do with freed slaves was much too vague. Thus, having no way to support themselves, many of the new freedmen attached themselves to Sherman's army.","On January 16th, 1865, Sherman, with the blessing of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, attempted to solve this problem with the passage of Special Field Orders No. 15. With the powers granted to him by the War, Sherman confiscated over thirty miles worth of plantations and islands from slaveholders and, taking a page from the 1862 Homestead Act, turned them over to the slaves for use as free settlements. It is interesting to note that while Order 15 is very explicit on such major rules and regulations as the maximum amount of land a single family could own (40 acres), it is remarkably silent on things that deal more with the day-to-day events of the settlement. To be sure, this would be in keeping with the Order's restriction of government interference with the settlement to protection and aid in setting up said settlement.","  Despite this, the Order itself unmistakably struck more of a blow against the CSA military and strategy than for Civil Rights. For starters, although the Order explicitly prohibited conscripting troops from the new settlements, it was no less explicit when it stated that all \"young and able-bodied negroes must be encouraged to enlist.\" Additionally, the Order effectively turned a great mass of dead weight on Sherman's army into something of an occupation force. In this case, one that would produce rather than just occupy or be refugees and free up veteran soldiers for the coming months of war. On a final note, it is interesting to point out that Section III of the Order contains a line that could be interpreted as preparing for Reconstruction. Specifically, the Order states that Congress has the power to \"regulate\" the titles of the freedmen, effectively laying the ground for a transfer of power when the martial law that created the settlements was rendered null. The legal ramifications of transferring power from military to civilian hands are more complex than many realize, and in giving Congress some authority, Sherman no doubt eased this transfer. Unfortunately, the old maxim that laws are silent in times of war is a door that works both ways, in that the noticed laws of war may be silent in times of peace. In this case, during Reconstruction, much of Sherman's Land Grant properties reverted back to their Antebellum title holders.

The first sub was developed by the Confederacy in the later years of the War in an effort to counteract the Union blockade, with Charleston Harbor being used as the proving ground. ","The boat that would become the <em>Hunley</em> first launched in July, 1863 for sea trials under the command of its designer, H.L. Hunley. Although Hunley himself (as well as his entire initial crew) would drown in one of at least five unfortunate accidents, the CSA command was impressed and brought the boat, renamed in honor of its designer, to the blockaded Charleston Harbor. Several months later, on the night of February 17, 1864, the <em>Hunley</em> set out into the blockade, targeting the USS<em> Housatonic</em>, a steam-powered sloop of war. Although sighted by the crew of the larger ship, the <em>Hunley</em> was able to destroy the boat, killing five Union sailors in the process. The submarine never returned. Although communicating with the harbor via a pre-arranged system of lanterns, the <em>Hunley</em> and its crew simply disappeared, becoming one of the many mysteries of the sea, until 1995, when the wreck was found by archeologists.","The <em>Hunley</em> itself was not the sleek predator of the deep that comes to mind with the word \"submarine.\" It was only 40 feet long, intended to accommodate a crew of only eight or nine men. Obviously, it could not stay submerged for long, since its tanks apparently only held three hours worth of air, although this is just as well since its range was only 15 miles. For armament, it carried a single \"spar torpedo,\" which was basically a bomb on a long pole sticking out in front of the sub itself, with locomotion being provided by the crew rowing.<em> </em>","The Union had been attempting to develop a submersible craft as well, although the <em>Hunley</em> was the first such craft to actually destroy a ship. As might be expected with a new project, the official naval records for both sides during the war hardly mention the <em>Hunley</em> at all, with one of its only mentions being made by the North in a short dispatch dated February 29, 1864. In it, the writer warns his subordinate to be wary of \"low, cigar-shaped steamer[s]\" like the one that sunk the <em>Housatonic</em>. Obviously, the sub itself is not referred to by name, in part because it was mistaken for one of the semi-submersible <em>David</em>-class torpedo boats. But despite the Union knowing the description of the ship (as opposed to it being a fully mysterious and unseen hunter), the <em>Hunley</em> still struck a blow against the blockaders' psyche. After all, they were unaware of the fact that the CSA did not have any more weapons like this, or even that one itself, technically.","Although not as grand an entrance as the ironclad, the submarine had nonetheless surfaced on the military stage, with the two combined creating a huge impact on naval warfare as we know it. When Sumter was bombed, naval warfare was in a steam-powered Napoleonic age. When Lee surrendered at Appomattox, it was poised for World War I, quite a leap for five years by anyone's standards.

With the end of the war, the issue of reuniting the country was topic of both local and national interest. The prospect of joining the nation under a common ideology and purpose was one that was imperative to piecing together the broken nation. However, the fact that the country has just emerged from a long and arduous civil war entrenched in the ideas of varying ideologies made this repair a daunting task. Although Montgomery was located deep within the former Confederacy, the Advertiser's outlook of the upcoming convention was positive. The paper described an idyllic prospect, claiming a \"spectacle of men from the North and South mingling together in harmonious counsel will go a long way towards sustaining him [Andrew Johnson] and breaking down the power of those who are alike, enemies to him and to constitutional liberty.\"","    Upon the end of the Civil War, many people, both of northern and southern origins and loyalties, had become weary of the war. Families longed to be reunited and there was a hope for a return to a normal and stable way of life. As the Advertiser described, there was the hope that both Northerners and Southerners would be able to find common ground through support of Andrew Johnson, but, Johnson's blatant opposition to proposed legislation such as the 14th Amendment and the Civil Rights Act made it unclear exactly how dedicated Johnson himself was to fully reuniting the nation. ","    Although there was a feeling among Americans that the country was in need of repair, there were many Southerners and delegates to the National Convention from Alabama and other former Confederate states who, \"though willing to concede defeat at the hands of the Union army...would not, as the unionists demanded, admit wrong doing in 1861.\" This failure to accept war guilt also extended into other facets of life as well. Many southern states refused to acknowledge the rights of blacks following the end of the war. Governments across the South instituted Black Codes to restrict the rights and lifestyles of African Americans, or simply tried their best to return freedmen to a status as close to slavery as possible. Highlighting this Southern attitude, it became obvious that the issue of rebuilding the nation and the policy of Reconstruction that soon ensued was not enough to the cause the South to forget the war and ideology that fueled it in the first place."],"display_date":"July 11, 1866","search_date":"1866-07-11","locations":[{"id":301,"lat":32.2488115675,"lng":-86.1666274124,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4362,"title":"Reverend McGill Offers His Religious Views on Slavery\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1862-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Alexander T. McGill believed very strongly in the 1860s that slavery should be abolished because it \"degrades and destroys the children of men.\"","Slavery needed to be abolished immediately, but slaves needed to be educated first, because, \"neither slavery perpetuated, for its own sake, nor slavery abolished before its subjects are educated for freedom will comport with the determination of God our maker.\" He also believed, as did many other people at the time, that African Americans were an inferior race, and allowing freed slaves to stay in America would be a disaster. Blacks and whites were opposite races which could never coexist. McGill used Mexico as an example of what could have happened if the freed slaves were allowed to stay in America. After all races were made free and equal in Mexico, \"amalgamation advances, degradation deepens; anarchy prevails; laws, constitutions, and the ballot box are a mockery.\""," The only possible way the slaves could be freed without greatly harming the country, according to McGill, would be to send freed slaves to Liberia, to return to the home of their fathers, which McGill claimed was determined by God. Sending the freed slaves to Liberia was thought by some as a \"New Testament Exodus\", mirroring the Old Testament Exodus in which the Israelites were sent out of Egypt.  McGill wrote that by doing this, the freed slaves would gain a Christianity better than white men could ever hope to have, and were doing a wonderful thing for Africa, which desperately needed the freed slaves to come home.

The miners also ran into wet quicksand-like soil that Pleasants called \"marl\" which caused a section of the mine to collapse on July 2, and had difficulty circulating fresh air into the 510.8 foot long mine shaft.

She lived in a place close by called Chambersburg.  On June 15, 1863 she wrote how she saw all sorts of wagon trains make their way through the town.  She experienced the panic that shot through the town due to the Rebels.  There had been a cry that the Rebels were in Greencastle, but it turned to be false, they would be there in an hour.  She wrote that her confidence in God would keep her safe from the Rebels.","The Rebels had not moved in at the time she thought, but the next day about \"11 ½\" as she wrote it, they rushed by on horses.  She actually saw them riding by her window, which shows how close she was to the action.  Going to bed at 2:00 AM, Rachel reported that it was very quiet except for the occasional Reb.  Eventually, around 5:00 AM, she said that the Rebels became active again and she would have to lie still in order to stay out of the sight.  If the Rebels saw her she would be a part of the Contraband that she saw, only being children and women.  This relates to a document that was reported to the Headquarters in Virginia by a Rebel force saying that they took few men and close to 175 women and 225 children as contraband.  ","The following day, she said that she had an interesting visitor, preacher Miller's daughter.  She had run away from the Rebs and had no place to stay.

After the Rebs left, the town was out and about doing all their things they had to do.  A lot of women were doing the wash from the previous days, because the town was occupied by Rebs.

One such story, about Union spy Pauline Cushman appeared in the <em>Valley Spirit </em>on June 8, 1864. Ms. Cushman was arrested by the Confederates, freed by the Northern troops and rewarded with the honorary title of Major in the United States army.","When the war began in 1861, Cushman resided in Cleveland, Ohio. She was, however, originally from New Orleans and of French and Spanish descent. She was an actress by profession and, as such, moved to Louisville, Kentucky where she continued to perform. In March of 1863, while performing at the Wood's Theatre, some paroled Confederate officers asked her to make a toast to the Confederacy. Because of her own loyalties to the North, she consulted with the local provost marshal who then asked her to become a spy for the Union. As such, she did offer the requested toast. She was then subjected to a mock arrest and dismissed from the theatre. She went to work, thereafter, at a theatre in Nashville where she was called to the headquarters of Confederate General Bragg. She first swore an oath to the Government of the United States of America and then proceeded to join the Cumberland Army.","Eventually, she had been caught by the Confederates and charged with being a Union spy in June 1864. In particular, she was questioned about her \"Yankee twang\" which she explained by the fact that she had been playing Yankee parts. She was threatened with hanging if the letters she had been found carrying proved her to be a spy.

They both had a classical education, taught by their mother and live-in tutors, and both enjoyed reading and writing.","They lived a content, carefree existence, hunting, fishing, and \"galloping around the country,\" but there easy, hard working life was not to last. The threat of this new war loomed and Maurice, at 17, joined the army of the Confederacy, followed by his father and lastly, his brother Will Henry. Thompson served in the 4th Georgian Infantry, and served in the Confederate army throughout the War.","His poem, \"The High Tide at Gettysburg\" is different from poems of wars from previous authors, as it is of an \"elegiac strain.\" The poem is definitely in tune with the mid-nineteenth-century \"preoccupation with mortality and morality,\" which makes sense as Will Henry would have been very young when he joined up, and still young when he wrote and published this work in 1888. It begins with the much repeated lines, \"a cloud possessed the hollow field, the gathering battle's smoky shield. Athwart the gloom the lightning flashed, and through the cloud some horsemen dashed, and from the heights the thunder pealed.\" From this verse, the poem could be about any battle, or even any of the many Gettysburg battles, but it is not much later that Thompson mentions Pickett, and \"leading grandly down,\" implying that this poem is about Pickett's Charge, the final surge of the Confederacy and Lee to push north. As we know, Lee failed and in the process many thousands died at the Battle of Gettysburg.","It is written without poetic flourish, and fluffy language; Thompson created a smoke filled atmosphere with guns and flashes and death surrounding it all. The reader of this poem is taken to Pickett's Charge, and shown in no uncertain terms that the war was gruesome and horrific, that men died, and for leaders who had almost forgotten the original cause. Thompson compared the fight to the fiery losses of the British at Waterloo, and shows how straggled the Confederates are by 1863, by discussing the colours or the battle flags. He writes \"Virginia heard her comrade [Tennessee] say: 'Close round this rent and riddled rag',\" and a little later, he says the \"tattered standards of the South,\" both double entendres, as they don't just mean the actual flags are torn and full of holes, but the Confederates and the South as a whole, is tattered and torn, and full of holes.","The famous lines \"they smote and stood, who held the hope of nations on that slippery slope,\" has been attributed the first use of Slippery Slope, by language specialists and the surprise is that here it is literally slippery from blood, but now means something different. The last verse is beautiful, with Thompson changing tack slightly, using love as a reason to stop fighting, and finishing with the image of a mother \"lamenting all her fallen sons\" This is possibly why Colonel Will Henry Thompson was commissioned to prepare \"proper wording\" for Edgar Allen Poe's mother's epitaph. He wrote similar words of a mother leaving someone very special behind.

The Confederates appeared utterly defeated, and yet some still were willing to fight. But the South was not the only problem for the North. Corruption was rampant in Forts Smith and Gibson (Indian Territory, now Oklahoma); safe havens for both southern and northern refugees, from brutality, but both Government officials and Union officers practiced fraud, deception and robbery. They took livestock, and sold it back to the government to be given to those they took it from. Officers of the Indian regiments added names of dead, deserted or created soldiers to their rosters and collected their pay, but with the reinstatement of Colonel William A. Phillips, his command and agents were cleaned up. He had agents watched by trusted men, and made some seek political refuge.","But this was not Col. Phillips' only problem. General Ulysses S. Grant had ordered that all Indian troops must be mounted, but by this time Phillips had only forty useful horses left to give to his men. Scouting remained entirely necessary with the Confederates still fighting; with little bands of brigands and bushwhackers destroying everything and rumours abound that Confederate General Cooper was putting an army together for one last offensive into Missouri. Phillips sent his men south to learn all they could.","Lieutenant Francis J. Fox, of the First Indian Home Guard, sent out a party of four mounted and four dismounted men to see what was happening. The Sergeant reported a wonderful meeting of scouts, with nine mounted Southerners firing dismounted. Then they remounted and charged both the footmen and cavalry. The Sergeant wrote that his men decided on \"prudence\" as \"the best part of valour and charged also, but with their ponies' tails toward the foe,\" which was probably a better idea.","Finally, on April 23, 1865, Phillips reported a capture of rebel mail from a rebel scouting party.

Furthermore, when Phillips discovered the news of Cooper and Stand Watie's intentions to push into Missouri, one last time; it was evident that Cooper had not heard that General Lee had surrendered at Appomattox earlier that month. Phillips prepared to evacuate both Forts Smith and Gibson of its refugees in case Cooper arrived with an army, but after heavy spring rains the Confederacy folded and \"commands across the southern states followed General Lee's lead and surrendered.\"","All, that is, except the Indian tribes, with Cooper not wishing to sign a treaty on behalf of the almost obliterated Indian tribes, so he left it to the tribal leaders, with Brigadier General Stand Watie being the last Confederate Commander to surrender along with his people."],"display_date":"1864 - 1865","search_date":"1864-12-31","locations":[{"id":10691,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Unorganized, Oklahoma"}],"tags":[{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4445,"title":" A New Hero Rises: Andrew Jackson and the Battle of New Orleans\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1828-01-01","end_date":"1828-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When an individual's legacy spawns something as seemingly minute as a musical composition to be written in their honor, a new level of greatness has been achieved.  Andrew Jackson was no stranger to this after growing into one of the most popular personas in America in his day and age.  James Hewitt (1770-1827), a local composer that left England as a young man to begin his own American dream in the port cities of the Northeast, wrote the piece \"President Jackson's Grand March\" in 1828 to honor the man whom many attribute as helping to define the modern, free United States of America.  This arrangement helped to immortalize Jackson in song as the new hero of the US.  ","Nearly two weeks after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed to end the War of 1812, with the unprecedented victory of the American militia over the far-superior British Navy on January 8, 1815 at New Orleans, the glory of the victory spread rapidly across the nation, never straying far from the name of Andrew Jackson.  An early 1815 issue of the <em>Niles' Weekly Register</em>, a publication based in Baltimore, proclaimed: \"Glory be to God that the barbarians have been defeated.  Glory to Jackson…Glory to the militia…Sons of freedom…benefactors of your country…all hail\"  Alas, the United   States had fully claimed its sovereignty and removed any speculation as to the longevity of its existence.

Beautiful women adorned the balconies that hung over the Place d' Armes. Each country, represented by its own amount of officials and military, watched as the France flag descended and the American flag ascended succinctly down the pole, meeting halfway to acknowledge exchange of powers. President Thomas Jefferson instructed William Claiborne, Mississippi's current territorial governor at the time and General Wilkinson, commander of the United States Western Army to receive Louisiana from France, who just received it from Spain within the same year. The transaction happened in a time frame of less than 20 days. With the documents signed making the Louisiana Purchase official, Governor Claiborne made a speech to the inhabitants that promised their way of life would not be disturbed. The United States received the \"keys\" to the city and thus the elected William C.C. Claiborne began to act as governor of the territory of Louisiana.","            The Portrait of Governor Claiborne was painted in 1840, 23 years after his death. It is probable that E.B. Savary chose to paint the Governor at a time where New Orleans had a growing population. According to U.S. Bureau of the Census for Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places, New Orleans was the third largest city in 1840 with a population of 102,193 persons. Aside from the rise of popularization of New Orleans, many Louisianans favored Claiborne due to his passiveness in government. Many considered Claiborne qualified for governor because he had served as assistant to a Congress clerk, opened a law firm, appointed as a Tennessee Supreme Court Judge, and selected by President Thomas Jefferson to preside as Mississippi territorial governor. From the very beginning Claiborne sought to appease the people of New Orleans. He adopted their style, delayed the necessary revisions to the laws, and appointed locals to the political office.  This led to a number of critics including that of Andrew Jackson, major General of U.S. forces. In his opinion, he thought of Claiborne as \"much better qualified for great pomp and show, and courting popularity-quiet life- in civil walks- than military achievements amidst peril danger\". Vincent Nolte, a local German-born merchant described Claiborne as \"a weak, intriguing, and gutless man who had not the energy necessary to give a great impulse to the population of Louisiana and cared only for his popularity and preeminence\". Claiborne resented Jackson upon his arrival into New Orleans because now he would be forced to take orders from a man whom had absolute authority and Claiborne considered Jackson to be inferior. ","            According to the painting, one would assume that Governor Claiborne symbolized a man with great military strength, but on the contrary he was not known for fighting battles. Perhaps the military uniform shown speaks of Claiborne's desired image to be taken seriously, but his smirk in the portrait speaks volumes of how the governor was gullible. Although Governor Claiborne aided the U.S. military with war supplies during the Battle of New Orleans, he did not directly win its victory. Despite his shortcomings on the battlefield, Claiborne is remembered for his numerous contributions in advancing Louisiana such as building new roads, establishing a mail service, and developing a public educational system. After serving as Governor of Louisiana he was elected into the U.S. Senate, but died before ever taking office. Claiborne, as a result of his serene administration is prescribed honor and place in the history of New Orleans, thus he is remembered by this grand portrait to credit his contribution."],"display_date":"January 20, 1840 - August 20, 1840","search_date":"1840-05-05","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":29,"tag":"New Orleans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":47,"tag":"Governor Claiborne"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":56,"tag":"Battle of New Orleans"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4512,"title":"<strong>Chamberlain Holds His Ground at Little Round Top</strong>","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-02","end_date":"1863-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"Y","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On July 2, 1863, the second day of Battle at Gettysburg, a crisis was at hand for the Union army.

This placed the Union left flank open for an attack. Chief Engineer General Gouvernur K. Warren atop Little Round Top spotted Confederates forming for an attack on his position. He sent word of this attack and Sykes' Fifth Corps was notified. Colonel Strong Vincent's 3rd Brigade of Sykes' Core moved his men into position on Little Round Top and anticipated a Confederate attack.","            Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, commanding the 20th Maine Regiment, commanded the extreme left of Little Round Top.

Seeing that the enemy, comprised of the 47th and 15th Alabama regiments, was a threat to the left of his line, Chamberlain ordered sharpshooters from his regiment to move to this vulnerable position that threatened his flank. Confederate attacks (mounted from Big Round Top) were driven off with high casualties. Chamberlain, in a after action battle report, stated, \"We opened a brisk fire at close range, which was so sudden and effective that they soon fell back among the rocks and low trees in the valley, only to burst forth again with a shout…\" This renewed attack failed as \"the terrible effectiveness of our fire compelled them to break and take shelter.\"  Continued attacks were driven back and fighting became brutal as Confederates made it close to Chamberlain's line. Hand- to- hand fighting resulted as the 20th Maine's line thinned but Confederates forces were still unable to break through.","            As ammunition ran out, Chamberlain was forced to order a bayonet charge against the advancing enemy. This attack, directed at the slope of Big Round Top, was effective and Chamberlain captured four hundred prisoners. \"The effect of the charge was surprising; many of the enemy's first line threw down their weapons and surrendered.\" The rebels who were not captured fell back and Little Round Top was not attacked again.  Colonel Chamberlain is remembered for his bayonet attack that secured the Union's victory at Little Round Top.

The cartoon entitled \"Compromise With the South\" was one of his most powerful and effective cartoons, and one of his personal favorites that he dedicated to the Democratic Chicago Convention in particular. Harper's Weekly, the first periodical to achieve national circulation, featured the cartoon on its front page on September 3, 1864. Nast's staunch Unionist stance, including those of the Republican editor and owner of Harper's, helped to earn the periodical its reputation in the North and earning him threatening letters from the South. One admirer declared: \"Nast would have been burned at the stake had he been captured on one of his visits to the front.\"","    The cartoon itself depicts a possible grim outcome from the Democratic convention. Nast paints the Democratic convention as a betrayal against the principles for which Union soldiers fought. On the left, a defeated and disabled Union soldier, his face hidden in shame, extends a feeble hand of surrender to a triumphant Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy. Davis stands with one boot disrespectfully on the grave of another Union soldier, while Columbia kneels mournfully. In the upper-left, the American flag is hung upside down as a sign of distress. Nast's point in his cartoon was that if there was going to be a compromise with the Confederacy, Union soldiers will have died and served and lost limbs for nothing. He also believed the Democratic platform would return blacks to slavery, as there is a despairing black Union soldier in the cartoon. Overall, the cartoon made a statement against the peace wing of the Democratic party (who were also known as Copperheads).","    The 1864 campaigns and convention was the event that helped Nast earn his national reputation. For up to twenty years after \"Compromise With the South\" was put to print in Harper's Weekly, Nast exerted a tremendous influence on the political life of the United States. He always held a principal interest in politics. His crusading ardor can be attributed to his upbringing: his father fled from Europe rather than be faced with compromising his political ideals and carried from that a sense of conscience rather than a spirit of compromise which was the dominant thought pattern in the country in the Civil War era."],"display_date":"September 3, 1864","search_date":"1864-09-03","locations":[{"id":2539,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"COOK, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4468,"title":"<strong>City Set Ablaze: The Burning of Chambersburg</strong>\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-07-30","end_date":"1864-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Confederate cavalrymen under the command of General John A. McCausland set the city of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania ablaze on the morning of July 30, 1864.  According to a letter sent the following day by D. McConaughy to Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin and Major General Darius N. Couch, the commander of the Susquehanna Military District, the \"lowest estimate of loss [from the fire] is 1,500,000.\"  He reported that the Confederate soldiers \"fired the whole center portion of the town, embracing twenty squares.\"  Historian Everard H. Smith claimed that a little over half of the 6,000 natives of Chambersburg lost their homes in the fire.  McConaughy wrote that the town was ostensibly burned because McCausland did not receive a 600,000 ransom, of which he demanded 100,000 be paid in gold.  However, there are a few other reasons why Chambersburg, a seemingly unimportant city in Pennsylvania's Cumberland Valley, was burned to the ground in such an appalling fashion.  ","Chambersburg was not a randomly chosen target for retribution.  Its location in the Cumberland Valley, the Pennsylvania name for the Shenandoah Valley, granted easy access for the Confederate army. It also had some strategic value for the North.  According to historian William Vatavuk, General Robert E. Lee sent General J.E.B. Stuart to Chambersburg in October, 1862 to gather supplies from Chambersburg and burn a railroad bridge that provided a \"vital transportation link to the west.\"  Smith offered that the Confederate soldiers had a sense of superiority over the common, predominantly German population in the area, and were thus able to dehumanize them.  Smith further asserted that dehumanizing their enemy allowed the southern soldiers to adhere to Carl von Clauswitz's belief in the necessity of total warfare.","The burning of Chambersburg was seen in the North as a Confederate atrocity.  Smith wrote that \"drunken Confederates cavorted among the ashes, pillaging freely and robbing citizens of sums large and small.\"  According to McConaughy, even McCausland was drunk.  Smith related that Confederate soldiers locked two women in their houses and set them ablaze, but fortunately, both women were rescued by neighbors.  Many of the citizens, like the family of Captain Eyster, whom McConaughy described in his letter, got out of their houses with only the clothes on their backs.  Even Confederate soldiers were not immune to the effects of the catastrophe unfolding around them.  According to Vatavuk, when a woman carrying a dying baby in her arms asked a soldier, \"'is this revenge sweet?' a tender chord was touched, and without speaking, he burst into tears.\"","            The effects of the fires may have been difficult for the citizens of Chambersburg to bear, but according to Vatavuk, a \"scorched earth policy\" was being practice by Union generals William T.

Burnside, the newly appointed Commander of the Army of the Potomac, was regarded by General O. O. Howard as distrusting himself with the position, but was eventually persuaded to accept it. Along with the position came the responsibility for a plan of action that would differ from the failed plans of General George B. McLellan.  It turned out that Burnside's plan of campaign was sufficient on paper, but, as the after action report of Fredericksburg shows, the execution of the plan shattered Burnside's hopes for success. ","                As noted by Howard, Burnside planned to move small numbers of his army as McLellan had planned toward Chester Gap and Culpepper, but to use these marches as a feint to the Confederates so that he could move the majority of his army to Falmouth and cross the Rappahannock to Fredericksburg and gain control of Marye's Heights for future movements.   This plan required the repair of the railroad and delivery of pontoon bridges to the crossing very quickly, which was left in the hands of General Halleck in Washington. The element of surprise was a key for the success of this plan. ","                Burnside's plan did not turn out the way that he had hoped as shown in the after action report. He commented that he moved sooner than he had told the President, Secretary, and General Halleck. The reason he gave for this was that he had seen that the enemy had moved his forces down the river and he hoped by having a \"vigorous attack\" across the river at Fredericksburg that he could separate the troops of the Confederates which would cause them to violate one of the well-known rules of war: never divide your troops in the face of a superior enemy. Burnside and his army were unfortunately unable to accomplish this due to the \"fog and unexpected and unavoidable delay in building the bridges.\" This gave General Lee enough time to assemble his troops at Marye's Heights to defend against Union attacks and ruin the element of surprise Burnside needed. ","                Burnside admitted in his report that he and the army had failed, but had a few things been different, such as the pontoon bridges arriving on time, they might have won a victory for the Union. He reported on the over 10,000 casualties in the battle, but said that he was \"glad to represent the army at the present time in good condition\" which seem to contradict each other. Burnside expressed sympathy for those killed and praised the braveness of those who fought in the battle. The sentiment in the after action report was that Burnside knew he had acted hastily at the wrong time and was willing to take the blame for the loss, and it felt like he knew he would be demoted after this defeat because he thanked the government for their support and confidence almost as a farewell."],"display_date":"December 17, 1862","search_date":"1862-12-17","locations":[{"id":14293,"lat":38.1882210605,"lng":-77.65248979,"zoom":9,"place":"SPOTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4575,"title":"<strong>First to the Top: Lebanon, PA Man Earns the Medal of Honor</strong>","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-02","end_date":"1865-04-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["           In his official report on the final battle at Petersburg Captain R.

At the appointed hour, the Sixth Army Corp of the Army of the Potomac, charged forward and carried the enemy works.  \"In so doing,\" wrote Hean, \"the enemy opened with artillery and infantry, causing the first two lines to waver, bringing all lines close to mass, with the third line (93rd) as a front, which as first to plant the colors upon the works.\"   ","Hean officially gave credit to a Corporal Jacob Renkenberger for \"planting the first color upon the enemy's works.\"  However, in the history of the regiment, written by Captain Penrose Mark, Sergeant Charles Marquette was given credit for the feat, and \"was awarded a Medal of Honor by Congress for being one of the first to plant the colors on the breastworks.\"","According to Samuel Bates' <em>History of Pennsylvania Volunteers</em>, Charles Marquette was mustered into Perseverance Company 2, also known as Company F of the 93rd Pennsylvania regiment, on Oct 12, 1861.

Marquette entered the regiment as a private, but Bates noted that he was promoted to Corporal on May 5, 1864 and to Sergeant on January 3, 1865.

While Hean's official report does not give Marquette credit for planting the first flag upon the Confederate works, it is the first of three reports that credits Marquette \"for capturing a rebel color while charging the enemy's works.\" Marquette is also mentioned for capturing a Confederate flag in two reports written by his division commander General George Getty.","Despite the conflicting accounts of Charles Marquette's actions in the attack, Sauer's wrote \"On May 10, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courage.\"  It is difficult to determine exactly what Marquette did on the morning of April 2, 1865, but it is likely that both stories have some truth to them.  In fact Sauers gave him credit for planting the first flag on the enemy's works and capturing a Confederate flag. In light of the fact that Marquette was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions that day, it is probable that he did accomplish both things.

This resolution stated that every citizen should \"do all in his power to aid in the restoration of peace and harmony, and in no way oppose the policy of the State or General Government directed at that object.\"  Lee went on to say that people in charge of instructing youths should set the best example of submitting to authority.

The next year the whole curriculum was abolished and nine separate schools were established with students choosing which school they would attend.  With his forward-thinking ideas, Lee outlined the plan for a school of commerce in 1869.  He was unable to implement the plan during his lifetime due to poor health, but it was very similar to business schools today.  If he had been able to implement his plan, this would have been the first commerce school in the country; the first actual school began in 1881.

As historian Robert Edsel has shown, Hitler appointed staff members to museums across Europe before the invasions even began to start making lists of all the items in which they would steal throughout the war. When the Allies learned of the Nazi art plunder, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program was established to locate and return as many works as possible to their original locations.

Over the period in which Operation Ranch Hand was active, U.S. military forces would drop nineteen million gallons of herbicide over almost four million acres of land in Vietnam. Throughout the period that followed the use of these chemicals, reports came in from soldiers claiming that the agent had caused serious health problems.","While the government continues to reject the possibility of chemical poisoning, men such as Kenneth Pullen are the physical embodiment that something has gone seriously wrong.

His division was directly engaged in the three days of battle ranging from July 1-3, and he described the soldiers as they approach the enemy: “I at once noticed in the countenance of all an expression of intense seriousness and solemnity, which I have always perceived in the faces of men who are about to face death and the awful shock of battle.”","Welch’s letter outlined with the precise eye of one engaged in military pursuits the various advances and retreats of the two warring sides. He recalled how he avoided death by inches countless times, probably much to the distress of his wife back home. But his words also show us a sort of disillusionment that must have pervaded the increasingly ruined Confederate side; remarking on General Robert E. Lee’s retreat from the front lines, he claimed that the man was “hoping, I suppose, that the enemy would attack him; but they didn’t dare come out of their strongholds.” Welch must have seen the death about him and known the losses his army had incurred, but managed to stay positive regardless. Even Pickett’s Charge, of which his division was a part, only gained one sentence in his commentary.","The Battle of Gettysburg is seen by many to be the true turning point of the Civil War; it was the point in which the troops of the South were dealt a decisive blow that would define many of the battles to follow. The 28,000 dead Confederates were a greater loss to the Southern army, which had difficulties recruiting more men. Welch’s letter shows us both the hope and denial that pervaded the lives of these people; in a later letter written by his own wife, she mentioned calmly that the surrender of Lee was reported but not yet confirmed. The victory of the emancipated Southern states was almost a guarantee in the citizens’ minds, and losses such as the one at Gettysburg must have been a shock they desperately wanted to avoid; Welch’s letter shows, through his suppression of the true level of death and loss at the battle, that as if by denying it, the approaching end of the Confederate States could be avoided."],"display_date":"August 2, 1863","search_date":"1863-08-02","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5118,"title":"<strong>Information Passed On: </strong><strong>A German Attempt to Curb anti-Nazi sentiment</strong>","course_id":56,"status":"P","start_date":"8/8/33","end_date":"8/8/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Over seventy-seven years ago, on the eighth of August, 1933, Dr. Daniel Mulvihill (a New Yorker) was assaulted by a German citizen while he was visiting Berlin, apparently because he had failed to “salute a Nazi detachment.” A few weeks later, on the twenty-fourth of that month, Dr. Mulvihill’s assailant was taken into custody by Nazi authorities, and was then deposited into a concentration camp, where he remained until (at least) October 16, (the date on which the case was reported by the Associated Press). The German Foreign Office promised to pass on all pertinent information regarding their investigation into the case of Dr. Mulvihill on to the United States government. They promised the same for similar cases as well, such as that of Mr. Roland Velz, who had been similarly assaulted by two German men when he failed to salute an emblem of the Nazi party.","In these cases, the severity of the punishments may seem somewhat harsh, and also appear unusual to us due to the fact that our knowledge of the use of prison (or concentration) camps generally derives from the post-war period and not before, and we are rarely informed about non-Jewish, German prisoners.  However, at the same time that the Nazi régime was investigating and punishing the men involved in these crimes, the articles notes that there were also “problems arising from Germany’s severance with the League of Nations and the arms parley at Geneva.” Regarding the latter issue, between the years 1932 and 1933, a World Disarmament Conference was held by the League of Nations in Geneva at which the constituent countries (primarily the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Germany) could not come to an agreement.

The mirrors in the Green Room had been covered and everything was black, causing a dimness. Over seven hundred people came to pay their respects to the late President. A person described the scene in the Green Room: “The remains of the President lay in the Green Room, in a metallic coffin. On each side of the coffin were four silver handles, with stars between, a vein of silver winding around the whole cast in a serpentine form. This rested upon a canopied catafalque, and was decorated with wreaths of moss and evergreen, with white flowers and lilies intermingled.\" People such as Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant attended the funeral. At the end, the coffin was carried by twelve army sergeants to the hearse that was waiting outside. The coffin was brought to the Capitol. Thousands of injured and uninjured soldiers from the Union got up to participate in the funeral procession which was led by African Americans. Nearly forty thousand of them were gathered at the end of the funeral procession. Over one hundred thousand people lined the streets that day to watch the hearse pass by. Not an inch of sidewalk was seen because so many people came out. Those that could not come out stayed inside and watched through their windows and atop their balconies. Even though over one hundred thousand people were present, there was an eerie silence all around. People refrained from talking and if they had to, the conversation was kept between the people addressed and no one else. The Funeral Train would later proceed across seven states and more than ten city stops. The train itself passed more than four hundred cities on its way to Springfield, Illinois. Because of the numerous stops, it would not arrive at its final destination until almost three weeks later. Surprisingly, or maybe not so, the route to Lincoln's final resting place included all Union states and cities but no Southern states or cities. Scheduled stops for the special funeral train were published in newspapers so people could come and take a final look at their President. At each stop, Lincoln's coffin was taken off the train and placed in a horse-drawn hearse and walked through the city. Newspapers reported that people had to wait more than five hours to pass by the president's coffin in some cities because of the large number of mourners. While the assassination itself was a shocking tragedy that overwhelmed the nation after four brutal years of Civil War, the funeral train was a closure. The man who had tried to keep the country together throughout his entire presidency was dead, and the train that carried him symbolized not only the end of the war, but the fact that an era was truly finished.

Bierce, a writer and soldier, held a view of the battlefield of Chickamauga on September 19-20,1863, that few knew. His rank kept him acquainted with the everyday solider, but his horse and job gave him a vision that the ordinary soldier was not afforded. Bierce was a member of the 9th Indiana Infantry Regiment under William B. Hazen. His unit was at the core of the fighting under General Thomas’s forces on Snodgrass Hill during the Battle of Chickamauga. This was not only one of the most important battles of the Civil War but also for Ambrose Bierce.","Before Chickamauga, Bierce had been an infantryman in Hazen’s Brigade. After attracting the attention of his superiors, Bierce was promoted in April of 1863 to Hazen’s acting topographical officer, “his commander’s personal map maker who became his ‘eyes’ prior to battle”, writes David Owens. This role of topographical officer was at the center stage of any officer corps but was often overlooked. Chickamauga was his first major battle with his new title. His new role required him to be very familiar with the battlefield terrain, and this familiarity made Bierce’s memoir significant as it provided him a larger view of battle as he roamed on horseback, was in constant contact with high-level officers, and was directly involved in strategic high-ranking military planning. Moving from infantryman to staff officer greatly expanded his view of the war, and this would be reflected in his later writings.","His memoir, <em>Chickamauga</em>, told the story of this battle through a highly emotional and graphic lens. It was written in 1889 for the San Francisco Examiner, where he could write without fear of editorial constraints. In this intense short story, a little boy found himself lost in the woods among wounded men crawling to a creek. He innocently went among them looked into their faces and tried to play with them. Bierce wrote, “But on and ever one they crept, these maimed and bleeding men, as heedless as he of the dramatic contrast between his laughter and their own ghastly gravity”. He made his way back home to found it on fire and his mother dead. This loss of the child’s innocence to the brutality of war was perhaps a reflection of the loss of innocence throughout the United States as people at home and on the battlefield experienced this horrific war. Bierce’s role as a topographer paired with his writing skills provided a view of the Battle of Chickamauga that is intensely chilling and vividly detailed, something that cannot be seen in battle reports but only through the eyes of someone in contact with both the officer and the infantryman."],"display_date":"September 19, 1863 - September 20, 1863","search_date":"1863-09-19","locations":[{"id":12053,"lat":35.1803733014,"lng":-85.1633326083,"zoom":9,"place":"HAMILTON, Tennessee"},{"id":2308,"lat":34.7357841762,"lng":-85.3009353974,"zoom":9,"place":"WALKER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":177,"tag":"literature"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":64,"school_id":4}},{"id":5189,"title":"Chamberlain's Defense of Little Round Top","course_id":64,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-02","end_date":"1863-07-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 2, 1863, Colonel Strong Vincent looked to Joshua Chamberlain and the 20th Maine regiment to defend Little Round Top “at every hazard”.  It was vital for the Union army to not lose this hilltop position to prevent the Confederates from breaking through their lines. At Gettysburg, the 20th Maine and other Union troops took both Little Round Top and Big Round Top. They have become immortalized through the accounts of Joshua Chamberlain.","Writers and scholars alike have found the narrative style of Chamberlain’s after action report to be both unique and captivating. It was his own artful and inspirational portrayal of the battle that brought Joshua Chamberlain fame as America’s Gettysburg hero.","In his report, what Chamberlain did not disclose is as important, if not more, than what he did. The report of Joshua Chamberlain found in the Official Records, dated July 6th, 1863, was actually recreated from memory in 1884 because government editors lost the original. Combined with the the discrepancies of his report and the reports of other participants in the battle, Chamberlain’s accuracy and role in the victory on Little Round Top comes into question.","In Chamberlain’s report, the Union regiments initially opened fire at close range and pushed the Confederates into taking shelter. Soon after, a final assault by the Confederate forces came. All seemed lost for the 20th regiment on Little Round Top as their ammunition depleted, until a rash call by Chamberlain for the bayonet and hand-to-hand combat took the Confederates by surprise.  Chamberlain claimed, “the effect was surprising; many of the enemy’s first line threw down their arms and surrendered.”","In the view of the soldiers of the 20th Maine, many agreed that their attack with the bayonets was the result of their pent up frustrations in the battle. According to their accounts, Chamberlain never said “charge”, as he later claimed, he only called that they fix the bayonet and prepare for a charge.","At the time of this charge, Confederate Colonel Calvin Oates had begun to withdraw Confederate troops seeing the ineffectiveness of their rally for Little Round Top. Along with the move by Oates and Colonel Michael Bulger to disperse and detach Confederate troops prior to the battle, Chamberlain faced depleted Confederate forces that were much smaller than he would later claim.","Later in life, Joshua Chamberlain sought to defend his legacy and story against the contradictory reports of the battle. In particular, both Colonel Oates and Colonel Elias Spear challenged his presentation of the battle.  Chamberlain’s unwillingness to admit the true efforts of Oates’ troops and their thrusts on the crest of Vincent’s spur, led to the denial of a battlefield monument for Oates’ 15th Alabama regiment. Despite the discrepancies to his reports, Joshua Chamberlain has maintained his role as the Hero of Little Round Top at Gettysburg."],"display_date":"July 2, 1863 - July 3, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":103,"tag":"Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain"},{"id":912,"tag":"Gettysburg"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":64,"school_id":4}},{"id":5233,"title":"Lewis Parsons Writes Home","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-05-28","end_date":"1864-05-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Lewis E. Parsons served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War as a private in the Washington Artillery of New Orleans. During his time of service in the war, Parsons wrote around twelve letters that he sent to his family in Talladega, Alabama. Parsons tried to write a letter every chance he had some free time to himself. He specifically states in a May 28 letter “I write whenever I get a chance.” Parsons would write a letter every time he came in from the battle field. He also told his family “you don’t know how it relieves my mind to have a letter on the way home.” This one letter that he writes certainly shows how homesick he had become. He says “you all may miss me a great deal but not as much as I miss you.” This specific letter that Parsons writes gives a good description of how much he missed his family, and this could be said for many other soldiers of the Civil War. Many other soldiers felt the same way that Parsons did about missing his family, and these letters were taken very serious by everyone involved.","Writing to family members was very important to the soldiers of the Civil War. These men probably would not have been able to stay sane for very long if it was not for the letters that they got to write to their family members and also the letters that the families sent back to the soldiers. James Pate gives a historical account of some brothers in the Civil War that also wrote letters back and forth to their family. Pate comments on how the brothers “directed most of their letters to family members.” This family took these letters very seriously, and they made every effort to keep the letters going to each other during the war. It was so important to them that “each family member became a wartime correspondent.” The letters of this family and the importance of writing to each other show that Lewis Parsons was not alone when it came to writing to family members and being homesick.","The letters of soldiers during the war also became very important to the communities as well. The Parsons letters could have been read by the citizens of the town that he was from and not just his family members. Some solders’ letters got sent around to everyone in the town so that the people could know how the war was going or how their friend was doing. In his book, <em>Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama,</em> Walter Fleming says that “letters from the army gave news of the men of the settlement who were in the writer’s company or regiment, and when received were read to the neighbors or sent around the community.” Parsons’ letters might not have been read by the community or the neighbors, but he definitely sent them to his family. It was very important for the soldiers to be able to send letters to their families. These letters are very important for us to be able to understand these soldiers and their feelings during this war."],"display_date":"May 28, 1864","search_date":"1864-05-28","locations":[{"id":13598,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5260,"title":"Kennedy Hears from a Worried Soviet Premier","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"10/26/62","end_date":"10/27/62","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Between 6:00 and 9:00 PM on the night of Friday October 26, 1962, the tenth day of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the members of President John F. Kennedy’s Executive Committee of the National Security (ExCom) received sections of a long, emotional private message from Soviet Union Premier Nikita Khrushchev.  Khrushchev revealed the underlying logic of the Cuban Missile Crisis when he wrote, “I see, Mr. President, that you are not devoid of a sense of anxiety for the fate of the world, of understanding, and of what war entails.”  The following day, referred to by Ernest May and Philip Zelikow, editors of <em>The Kennedy Tapes</em>, as “black Saturday,” proved to be the longest and most trying day of the crisis for President Kennedy and the members of ExCom.  Kennedy and ExCom drafted a response in which Kennedy acknowledged that if a solution were not quickly found it would “surely lead to an intensification of the Cuban crisis and a grave risk to the peace of the world.”","Kennedy and Khrushchev attempted to avoid escalation during the Crisis because of the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction, or MAD.  According to political scientist Donald Snow, MAD was a doctrine formulated by the Kennedy administration that relied on the fact that any state contemplating a nuclear attack on another state with nuclear capability would be deterred from attacking by the knowledge that a nuclear retaliation would cause unacceptable destruction in the aggressor state.  Snow posited that the risk of nuclear war played a major role in decision-making on both sides of the crisis, and that both sides deliberately exploited this risk in the negotiations.","The MAD doctrine may have been one of the reasons why Khrushchev sent his private letter to Kennedy, which according to historian Max Frankel gave the members of ExCom a sense of cautious optimism as they went to sleep on October 26.  It weighed on his mind as he wrote “we are of sound mind and understand perfectly well that if we attack you, you will respond the same way.  But you too will receive the same that you hurl against us.”","Historian Gerard DeGroot quoted Robert McNamara after the crisis in saying that “President Kennedy and I were deterred from even considering a nuclear attack on the USSR by the knowledge that, although such a strike would destroy the Soviet Union, tens of thousands of their weapons would survive to be launched against the United States.”  MAD has been much maligned as a nuclear strategy in the years since the Cuban Missile Crisis, but McNamara argued in 1967, “Assured destruction is the very essence of the whole deterrence concept.”   Both Kennedy and Khrushchev understood MAD as part of the underlying logic for the crisis negotiations."],"display_date":"October 26, 1962 - October 27, 1962","search_date":"1962-10-26","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5262,"title":"Operation Crossroads:  Sailor Witnessed Atomic Bomb Test","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"7/1/46","end_date":"8/10/46","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At 0800 hours on July 1, 1946, the United States conducted the Able Test in Bikini Lagoon, the first of three scheduled atomic bomb tests that were part of Operation Crossroads.  Among those who witnessed the atomic bomb test was Joseph Patrick McShane Jr., a nineteen year old sailor from Oaklyn, New Jersey.  From the deck of a transport ship, McShane watched the blast, which was “I think about 20 miles from where we were.”  He was told to turn his back and issued dark cardboard glasses similar to “something you would have at a 3D movie,” as a precaution against the potentially blinding initial flash.  When ordered to turn, McShane spun and saw “the mushroom cloud up in the air.”  According to historian Gerard DeGroot, Operation Crossroads was a U.S. Navy-led project to test the effects of atomic weapons on naval vessels. The tests left many observers unimpressed, but this was most likely due to ignorance about the effects of radiation.","According to the article “The 1946 Atomic Bomb Test” by Lloyd Graybeal, the Navy placed about seventy out of date American and captured Japanese vessels in Bikini Lagoon to test the effects of blast pressure, heat and radiation.  McShane was assigned to one of the target ships, the <em>U.S.S. Lamson</em>, and trained to “get the ship out to the target area.”  In a separate article entitled “Bikini Revisited,” Graybeal explained that the Able Test atomic bomb was dropped two miles from its target and the <em>Lamson </em>was one of only four ships to sink.  Many observers were disappointed by the lack of immediate physical destruction caused by the test, and Dr. Frank Thone wrote in a contemporary article that some journalists described the bomb as “a sneeze in a windstorm” or “just another weapon.”  DeGroot related that the Joint Chiefs Evaluation Board reported afterward that as a result of radioactivity, any ship “within a mile of an atomic bomb air burst would eventually become inoperative due to crew casualties.”","McShane recalled that sailors and scientists were sent into the test area to clean the ships and collect data only hours after the mushroom cloud cleared, with only “coveralls, a hat, and work shoes” for protection. The second or Bravo Test, an underwater atomic bomb burst, caused an irradiated rain to fall on the remaining ships in the test area.  DeGroot recounts that sailors became “violently ill” while attempting to decontaminate vessels with soap and water in the days after the test.  Although McShane never ventured into the test area he saw that “even the scientists, and even the people who carried the scientists around” on small boats “didn’t know what was going on.”  DeGroot wrote that while journalists wrote of the “benign nature of the bomb,” the Joint Chiefs cancelled the third test and abandoned some ships due to the health risk to the sailors.","The scientific, military and media reaction to operation crossroads showed that even after dropping the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, McShane and many who witnessed the atomic bomb tests did not understand the long-term effects of radiation."],"display_date":"July 1, 1946 - August 10, 1946","search_date":"1946-07-21","locations":[{"id":26647,"lat":39.9658875933,"lng":-75.1032184193,"zoom":9,"place":"Camden, New Jersey"}],"tags":[{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5265,"title":"Jacqueline Rhoads copes with ethics as a nurse in Vietnam","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/71","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Jacqueline Rhoads landed in Vietnam in 1970 at the age of twenty-two.

Stuart’s most celebrated act was his encirclement of the Union General George McClellan’s Army of the Potomac in June of 1862. Newly appointed commander of the Army of Northern Virginia Robert E. Lee and Jeb Stuart devised the plan to circle around McClellan and gather intelligence. The aggressive strategy stemmed from the knowledge that McClellan was hesitant to attack the Confederate troops, which he believed to be incredibly large in size and powerful in strength.","In a message to Stuart on June 11, 1862, Lee expressed caution, stating that he should be careful not “to hazard unnecessarily your command or to attempt what your judgment may not approve but be content to accomplish all the good you can without feeling it necessary to obtain all that might be desired.” The letter from Lee to Stuart stressed the importance of the reconnaissance mission and the need for discretion. Stuart saddled his troops, consisting of 1, 200 men from the first, fourth, and ninth Virginia Cavalry, and the Jeff Davis Legion, on June 12, 1862, to determine if the Army of the Potomac occupied the land between the Chickahominy and Totopotomy Rivers. The value of the land between both rivers was essential for the Confederacy and the Union. During the reconnaissance mission ordered by Lee, Stuart realized that his position had been discovered, forcing him to find an alternate route back to Richmond. The alternate route led Stuart’s infamous ride around McClellan’s troops. Historian James McPherson stated Stuart gained fame from this event as well as “great personal satisfaction from the enterprise, for one of the opposing cavalry commanders was his father-in-law, Philip St. George Cooke.”","Stuart’s mission resulted in his troops spending four days behind enemy lines in which they covered over 100 miles. The troops captured 165 prisoners as well as 260 mules<em>.</em> Stuart fulfilled the desires of Lee, who stated in his letter the importance of “gaining intelligence of his operations, communications, &c., of driving in his foraging parties, and securing such grain, cattle, &c., for ourselves as you can make arrangements to have driven in.” The encirclement of McClellan resulted in the recognition of the need for a reformed Union cavalry. After the successful raid commenced, Stuart felt that he had the capability to outride and outfight any Union cavalryman, boosting Southern morale even more. The intelligence that Stuart gathered allowed Lee to attack at Mechanicsville, which was the first of the Seven Days’ battles, and contributed in the failure of McClellan’s Peninsula campaign."],"display_date":"June 12, 1862 - June 15, 1862","search_date":"1862-06-13","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5353,"title":"A Soldier Complains of the Army Life","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-02-16","end_date":"1863-02-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 16, 1863, a Union soldier from Huntingdon County Pennsylvania wrote home to describe the war as he saw it.  “Here we are yet stuck in the mud, crushing the rebellion, over the left, and enjoying our hard tack as usual.”  The soldier described the boring life that the Army of the Potomac went through as they were in camp.  The man known as “TIMBER DOODLE” in his writings was going through the slow and seemingly endless time spent in an encampment with monotony, unreliable paydays, and no battles to break up the drudgery of camp life.","He wrote about life as he saw it and the embedded sarcasm showed his true feelings about his situation.  The soldier seemed as though he would have welcomed battle just to end the way of life that soldiers endured in camp.  Soldiers often wrote home because of loneliness and even just to kill the time.  It was a way that they could keep their friends and family at home informed about the progress of the war and their feelings towards it.","They not only talked about the war in their letters but also of simple things such as the weather, rumors, accidents, ceremonies, and the tasks that they had to perform everyday.  They would also write about the social change that they witnessed in the areas of the South that they took control of.  The letters also served as their chance to complain about the Union Army and all of the things that they felt were wrong with it.","Many of them used an alias such as TIMBER DOODLE in order to preserve their anonymity.  The letters were important to the soldiers who wrote them and to the folks at home who received them.  In the case of TIMBER DOODLE, his letter was viewed by many of the members of the county because it was posted in the local newspaper.  These letters got at the war through the eyes of the common foot soldier and it is important to see the war from their point of view."],"display_date":"February 16, 1863","search_date":"1863-02-16","locations":[{"id":14302,"lat":38.4358602351,"lng":-77.3635484517,"zoom":9,"place":"STAFFORD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5355,"title":"Copperheads in Illinois Threaten Violence against the Act of Conscription","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-08-31","end_date":"1863-08-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an article from the <em>New York Times</em> on August 31, 1863, it is made evident that the Peace Democrats or Copperheads were not so peaceful. The article stated that, “The Copperhead troubles still continue in the central and southern counties of this Illinois.” A group of around 150 armed Copperheads went to the county seat of Paris in Edgar County. The Copperheads threatened aggression against both Federal officers and members of the Union military. However, “authorities in this State and Indiana were soon informed of the demonstration and an adequate force to squelch all the traitors was soon at hand.” While the Copperheads then dispersed without any bloodshed, they were said to be bold and swore that a draft would not occur in Edgar County, Illinois.","The term Copperhead was first coined in an article that appeared in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on July 20, 1861. The meaning of the term is derogatory in nature. It meant that this faction of Democrats were like snakes that were waiting to strike. In contrast, Copperheads defined themselves as “a man who designs to maintain our system of free government as our fathers founded it, as their successors administered it, and as we and posterity are bound by every motive of interest, patriotism, and honor to continue it.” Nearly all of the Copperheads were Democrats, but most northern Democrats were not Copperheads, and they were a minority faction within the Democratic Party.","Copperheads enjoyed popularity mainly in the Midwest. The reason for this was that some individuals within the Midwest had Southern roots. However, the Copperheads’ yeomen interests within the Midwest conflicted with the Republican industrialists, which precipitated bitterness.","Copperheads opposed the escalation of the sectional conflict into a full blown war.

More importantly, the morale and efficiency of troops was dependant on the fact that these food and munitions were particularly good. For this reason, the food rations provided to American soldiers were specifically monitored by the Army Medical Corps in an attempt to ensure their superiority over the supplies of the German or Japanese troops. The significant resource cost of the war made it difficult to ensure a fresh supply of food and beverages was getting to the front line or being available to the workers back at home. According to the US Army, American soldiers consumed about nine million pounds of food daily. This meant that a considerable amount of food had to be brought to the battlefront which would be nutrient rich, in eatable condition, and available quickly. The American soldier's ration was made up of easily mass produced, canned, and shipped goods such as beans, packaged meats and vegetables, soluble fruit drinks, chewing gum, and cigarettes.","Though the American soldier's rations were processed and not freshly made, the availability of genuine, vitamin-rich food should not be taken lightly. The Germans and Italians, by comparison, had trouble supporting their troops and munitions workers with food in the same way. The production capacity of the United States was colossal and was not subject to the same stipulations as some of the European powers. The Germans were largely dependent on domestic food resources which, while enough to survive on, could not provide both soldiers and munitions workers with enough nutrients to remain at full efficiency. As a result, the Germans suffered a loss in the supply of food and munitions due to worker malnourishment while the Americans were able to provide for the Allies.  Winston Churchill is even quoted as having said \"We have won the war!\" after hearing of the attacks on Pearl Harbor, knowing well the industrial power of the United States.  During war time, the importance of efficiency and support of the home front should not be underestimated, and it is without a doubt that well-fed and nourished soldiers and workers have a distinct advantage over their malnourished counterparts. People under the Axis often had to eat substitute \"sawdust\" food and rely on foods which engineered specifically for mere survival, and this was a clear advantage that the United States brought to the Allies.","The importance of steady and healthy food supplies was not lost on the United States, and the great economic advantage of the nation has always been something which could be exploited. After World War II, the Medical Corps continued to improve the supplies received by American soldiers, upgrading the synthetic food drinks of wartime into instant coffee, and providing a wider variety of meat as well as pastas and treats such as cookies to the troops.  Well nourished troops are very important to a war effort, and there is no doubt that the superior food rations of the Allied troops, particularly those of the United States, helped in part to ensure victory over the Axis. <br /><br /> <br />Works Cited: <br /><br />Merriman, John M.

Albert S. Johnston; an adopted Texan with questionable loyalties. Believing that Johnston posed a risk to Union control in California, General Winfield Scott dispatched Brigadier General E. V. Sumner to replace Johnston as the commanding officer on the Pacific coast.  On March 22, 1861 General Scott wrote to Sumner “Prepare to sail from New York the first of next month to relieve Bvt. Brig.-Gen [A.S.] Johnston, in the command of the Pacific department…” Scott also decided to keep the orders confidential and followed with “The order to sail, ect., will reach you by next mail, but will remain unpublished till you are on the Pacific Ocean, for confidential reasons.”  Despite the secrecy of Sumner’s deployment, word of his coming reached San Francisco a day ahead of him; this did not produce the uprising that Union authorities feared, but allowed Johnston to submit his resignation from the Army.","Upon his arrival in San Francisco Sumner issued the following statement: “In compliance with special order No. 86, dated War Department, Adjunct-General’s Office, Washington, March 23, 1861, I hereby assume command of the this department. All concerned will govern themselves accordingly.”  In a letter to Washington, Sumner described the command being turned over “in good order.” Sumner also commented that even after issuing his resignation, Johnston “continued to hold command, and was carrying out the orders of the government.”  Johnston’s actions were professional and in accordance with the orders of his superiors. It did not appear that he was in anyway prey to his southern sympathies.","While Johnston made no actions towards supporting secessionists in the region, the movement was there and it was a threat to Union control. In his work <em>Frontier Service during the War of The Rebellion</em>, George H. Pettis writes that secessionists were moving to take control of governmental property across San Francisco, ultimately using the military stores in the city to defeat the loyalist citizens.  Pettis claimed that is was the unannounced arrival of Sumner that dashed this plan, forcing the secessionists to delay, and then give up after Sumner consolidated western forces to fortify San Francisco.","Though there was a Secessionist plot afoot in San Francisco, Sumner reported to Washington that there was “a strong Union feeling with the majority of the people of this state.” He claimed that though a minority, the secessionists were “the more active and zealous party, which [gave] them more influence than they ought to have for their numbers.”  Despite the actions and schemes of the confederate sympathizers, California remained fully in support of the Union cause.  Johnson, however, was later named commander of the Confederacy’s western theater; and viewed as one of the best Confederate generals in the war, before he died at the battle of Shiloh."],"display_date":"March 22, 1861 - April 28, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-09","locations":[{"id":967,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":10,"place":"SAN FRANCISCO, California"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":715,"tag":"Military"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5581,"title":"Wheeler's Cavalry Checks Foster's Position in Tennessee","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-12-03","end_date":"1863-12-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In December of 1863 in Tennessee, as William T. Sherman marched a column of troops to relieve men who were believed to be in peril in Knoxville, J.G. Foster was cut off from Sherman by a division of Confederate cavalry under General Joseph Wheeler. Unable to move, Foster telegraphed Major General Gordon Granger, Commander of the Army of Kentucky and the man responsible for running cavalry operations in central Tennessee, requesting assistance. “I am held in check here by the whole cavalry force of Wheeler and Jones,” Foster Wrote, “a force more than equal to the whole command here.” Out maneuvered and cut off, Foster reported that, “So long as the cavalry force is in my front I can do nothing.”  In requesting relief, Foster indicated to Granger that if he moved quickly they “may be able to get Wheeler's cavalry between [them],” enabling them to force the cavalry to fight at a disadvantage as opposed to allowing them to use the hit and run method they preferred.  Understanding that cavalry seldom remained in the same place for long, Foster offered that, “if it withdraws, my cavalry will hang close upon the enemy and do all the damage it can.”","Such was the risk of invading enemy territory, as CSA cavalry rode off on long range raids on Union communication and supply lines, hampering troop movements and intercepting and seizing supplies. As J.P. Dyer outlines in an article on the cavalry operations in the Army of Tennessee, Union forces were required to maintain long lines of communication, which, by their very nature, were vulnerable to attack.  Protection of these lines required a large force of cavalry to patrol the lines and respond to raids as they happened, but even with these cavalry elements, response was not instantaneous.  Southern cavalry out-stripped their Union forces in number and in ability for the majority of the war; even by the close of the war, the forces were at best equal. Without being able to predict where and when the CSA cavalry would strike, Union support lines where constantly threatened.","As Christopher S. Dwyer explains in his article on Confederate raiding strategy, the hit and run tactic of Confederate cavalry stemmed from the CSA armies’ numerical inferiority. Launching lighting fast cavalry raids on Union supply lines and communication bases was an attractive alternative to more costly direct confrontations with larger Union armies.  This method allowed Confederate forces to hit the Union in a way that would remove the source of their strength, whilst engaging them where they were weakest, becoming a hallmark of Confederate combat in the western theater.  It proved to be a most viable combat strategy, allowing fast moving confederate forces to seek out and engage smaller Union elements, cutting them off from support and delaying a large, costly engagement.  It only became obsolete after Grant and Sherman decided to cut their tether to the North, feeding and supplying his army off of the land he crossed, rendering cavalry raids fruitless."],"display_date":"December 3, 1863","search_date":"1863-12-03","locations":[{"id":11922,"lat":36.4842835863,"lng":-83.666033113,"zoom":10,"place":"CLAIBORNE, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5606,"title":"<em>CSS Shenandoah</em> Boards Dutch Vessel in the Pacific","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-03-30","end_date":"1864-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 30, 1865 a vessel, thought to be the <em>CSS</em> <em>Shenandoah</em>, overtook and boarded the Hawaiian ship <em>Pfiel</em>, the Dutch captain reported the incident to Union authorities upon its arrival in San Francisco.  The captain wrote “On the 30<sup>th</sup> of March, latitude 3° 53’ N. longitude 167° E. at 6 P.M., [my ship] was brought to under a gun from a vessel of war; hove to, and was soon boarded by a boat, the officers and crew of which were heavily armed.” In an attempt to identify the <em>Pfiel</em> as a Union whaling vessel, and thus a viable target, “One of the officers demanded [the vessels] papers. After scrutinizing them he said we were all right.” Before leaving the deck, the officer “asked [the captain] if he had seen any whale ships on the line, or left any in port Ascension.” When the captain of the <em>Pfiel</em> asked the name of the boarding ship, the officer responded “the English ship Miaima, or Miami.” Then the officer and his crew promptly left, “evidently not liking to be too closely questioned.” The Dutch captain went on to say that though it was dark, he could see that “she was a propeller ship under sail, and [he felt] confidant it was not an English ship of war.” The Commandant of San Francisco’s Mare Island naval yard, reported that “There is very little doubt but what the ship described was the <em>Shenandoah.</em>”","In October of 1864 the<em> Shenandoah</em> launched from Glasgow, Scotland under the guise of a civilian steamer named the <em>Sea King</em>.  Once clear into the Atlantic, the vessel was renamed the <em>CSS Shenandoah</em>, she rendezvoused with Confederate naval forces in the Sea of Madeira, where she refit, rearmed and re-crewed as a  warship in the Confederate Navy.  As a Confederate commerce raider, the <em>CSS Shenandoah</em> circumnavigated the globe while sailing for the North Pacific Ocean, with an ultimate goal of reaching San Francisco, a city believed to be poorly defended.  While deployed across the world, the <em>Shenandoah</em> was responsible for destroying no less than thirty-two Union vessels and their cargos.","The <em>CSS Shenandoah</em> continued to prey on Union whaling ships in the Pacific until rumors that the war was over were confirmed, which it was on August 2, 1865.  Realizing that he had been fighting without cause or state, therefor moving from the category of enemy combatant to that of a pirate; James Waddell, captain of the <em>Shenandoah,</em> set a course to avoid Union ships and surrender on English soil.  According to the Department of the Navy’s Naval Historical Center, Waddell rounded Cape Horn in September, then arrived and surrendered in Liverpool in early November, becoming the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.

Since the fall of New Orleans in April 1862, Mobile had become the major Confederate port in the Gulf of Mexico, responsible for bringing in blockade runners carrying supplies from Havana.  The result of Mobile’s rise in importance to Confederacy was a rise in the priority of its capture for the Union.  Farragut’s fleet consisted of four heavy ironclads, vessels outfitted with heavy iron or steel armor-plates, and fourteen wooden warships, including the <em>U.S.S. Hartford</em>, Farragut’s command ship.  In opposition to this fleet, the Confederates only had four vessels.  However, this included the <em>C.S.S. Tennessee</em>, a ship that was renowned as the most powerful ironclad afloat.  CSA Secretary of the Navy S.R. Mallory described the two forces in a report to Jefferson Davis, dated November 5, 1864. “A formidable fleet of the enemy, consisting of eighteen ships, including four ironclads, mounting 199 guns, crewed by 2,700 men, under Admiral Farragut, crossed the Mobile Bar, where they were vigorously attacked by the forts and by our small squadron under Admiral Buchannan.”","Despite a valiant defense, the Union fleet pushed into the bay, forcing their way past the CSA forts, fleet, and mines.  Mallory reports, “In this action, the <em>Tennessee</em> and the <em>Selma</em> were captured, and the <em>Gains</em>, in a sinking condition was run ashore.”  The secretary totaled Confederate losses at “12 killed, 20 wounded, and 243 taken prisoner,” writing to Davis that, “Naval history records few contests between forces so unequal in ships, guns, and men, and but few in which the weaker side displayed such heroism.”","Beyond the battle’s importance to the Union campaign in the South, Mobile Bay proved to be the first test of the new ironclad against heavy fire. Mallory described the assault of the Federal fleet on the CSA ironclad. “The enemy ships, some of the finest afloat, were armed with IX, X, XI and XV inch guns, whose projectiles varied in weight from 84 to 428 pounds. Their broadsides, some of the heaviest known, were discharged upon the <em>Tennessee</em> at distances ranging from 3 to 30 yards, and three of their heaviest ships, fitted as rams, ran into her at full speed repeatedly.” In defiance of such punishment, Mallory claimed “The massive strength of the frame and the sloping armor of the ship resisted these assaults, and but one shot reached or made any impression upon the woodwork of the shield, and this did not go through it.” This test, as well as the success of the Union Ironclads running under the guns of CSA forts, demonstrated that, as the secretary put it, “The resistance offered by inclined iron armor to the heaviest ordinance ever used upon the sea was here fully tested at short ranges,” proving the durability of the new vessels and the success of advancing naval technology, in both offensive and defensive capacities."],"display_date":"August 5,

a letter written to the Editor of the <em>New York Times</em> on February 6, 1933 by Majorie Hill, Louise Porter and Gwendolyn Thomas (three female students attending Mount Holyoke College), the Geneva Disarmament Conference of 1932 was discussed (16).  The conference was noted to have received twelve million signatures from all parts of the globe, demonstrating the demands of citizens for a change in direction of the way international politics was viewed and carried out.  The year following that conference, and the same date the letter was written, Arthur Henderson, chairman of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, received cablegrams from thousands of Americans who were again advocating for cuts in military weapons.  These demands were in hopes of achieving peace by gaining international support in their efforts to end war.  What is important for one to acknowledge is the fact that the majority of cablegrams were from women colleges, where it was believed that the cause and consequences of war would befall them.","Like Hill, Porter and Thomas, women living during the 1930’s were actively seeking peace and prosperity in postwar America in various ways.  More specifically, World War One brought about death and disruption, greatly affecting the United States; there were huge negative transformations in American politics, economics, and social and cultural systems (Ford 2004, 664), including escalating inequality and increasing marginalized groups within society (665).  American women, being one of the marginalized groups, decided to renounce their stance in national and international politics by exercising their rights gained from the Women’s Suffrage Movement of the 1920’s (Hensley 2006, 150).  With their newly acquired rights, women demonstrated their commitment to peace and equality by forming feminist groups.  According to Melissa Hensley, these organizations conducted rallies and petitions, presented public demonstrations, and gave speeches in regards to the withdrawal of militarism worldwide (147).  Peace activities even filtered through universities and colleges, promoting ideas on campus through student strikes, and national and regional meetings (152).","Having said that, worldwide military disarmament became a main objective for feminists, as it was believed that pacifism would bring an end to war (Hill, Porter, Thomas 1933, 16).  Because during this time men were perceived as being incapable of achieving peace due to their “aggressiveness” and desire for “power and dominion”, women of the 1930’s jumped at the opportunity to organize peace, as they were seen as being well-suited for the cause; they were assumed to be “caretakers of life” and responsible for the preservation and wellbeing of earth (Hensley 146-147).  Thus, it is no wonder then, that students attending Mount Holyoke College wrote that letter to the Editor of the <em>New York Times</em> promoting international disarmament at the Geneva Disarmament Conference of 1932.  Women were taking prominent positions in national and international military politics, and the students attending Mount Holyoke College are just a few of the many women living in postwar America who were greatly influenced by, and participated in various feminist movements in hopes of achieving peace to end war."],"display_date":"February 6,

town.  Wives and children were told to lock themselves in their house and hide from sight in order to stay safe.  Rachel often speaks of the daily fear she went through, as well as her depression and concerns for her husband.  She spoke of lying in bed at night and hearing flying shells and bullets while she thought of her husband and hoped he was okay.  When the rebels traveled through her town the mail services often stopped and long periods would pass when she would not receive letters from her husband so the wait would stress her to no end.  Even while living in this fear daily personal lives would still have to continue as normal and the laundry would still need to be done, the children tended to as well as all the other household chores.  Religion was a major way that Rachel would try to maintain her sanity during the war and at times when she was not able to go to church due to the rebels being in town, she would sit and read passages and say her prayers for Samuel’s safety.  Rachel may not have obtained an official job but she had to do many jobs in her home life that she did not have to do prior to the conflict.","While Rachel stayed home to tend to her family’s daily needs, other women joined the war to help by becoming nurses, relief workers, or even serving as soldiers.  During the war a large number of women volunteered to become nurses during the war.  They tended to the victims and witnessed up close the horrible injuries obtained during the fighting’s.  The war relief workers would do jobs such as sewing new clothes for the soldiers to wear and they would also gather medical supplies, food and even bedding for the men of the war.  During the Civil War over 400 women disguised themselves and serves as soldiers and some even fought in the battles of Gettysburg, and Antietam.  These women would have to dress up and disguise themselves as men in order to fight, and many held their own and fought in great battles during these times.  After the wars these women often returned to their normal roles as housewives and mothers.","Rachel stuck to her job in the household during the war and kept a home for herself and her child so that Samuel could return home to the house he had left at the beginning of the war.  She often wrote about the possibility of leaving her home to get away from the rebels but was always scared that Samuel would return home and she would not be there.  She stuck through some very hard times during the war and did things she never had to do before as well as maintained her fight on the home front. Women played all sorts of roles during the Civil War and no one role was more important than the others.  The war was a very difficult time for most people and everyone put forth a fight to survive including the women of the Civil War."],"display_date":"1861 - 1865","search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":11033,"lat":39.9274533048,"lng":-77.7212153562,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":6059,"title":"<strong>Zenobia Defies an Emperor</strong>","course_id":122,"status":"P","start_date":"4/15/99","end_date":"4/15/99","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","During the summer of 272 A.C.E., Aurelian brought war to Queen Zenobia’s Palmyrene Empire. She only ruled because her husband Odenathus had been assassinated but the <em>Historia Augusta</em> tells us that it was perhaps she that ruled through her husband even before his death. She was said to have had a keen intellect and propensity for Greek and Egyptian language. There was even mention of her being descended from the Ptolemies and Cleopatra herself. The <em>Historia</em> also describes her in both a masculine and feminine light. She is said to have had qualities of a “good emperor.”","Her virtues as a leader came to the forefront when Aurelian arrived at her gates. He sent Zenobia a letter which asked for her complete surrender and that under the conditions he specified, neither she nor Palmyra’s citizens would lose their liberties. Zenobia was far too proud to accept these terms. Her letter back to Aurelian, therefore, was not what he was hoping to hear. In fact, Zenobia outright challenged Aurelian by telling him that, “Whatever must be accomplished in matters of war must be done by valor alone.” There would be no surrender without a fight first. Her letter also bordered on the insulting. Zenobia asked how Aurelian planned to defeat her when he could barely fend off the Syrian brigands that plagued the Roman advance to Palmyra. Aurelian answered appropriately… with battle. And with his valor, Aurelian and his army did defeat Zenobia and captured her as well.","Upon capturing her, Aurelian had Zenobia brought to him. He couldn’t understand why she had thought it wise to challenge him. He was Aurelian Augustus, Emperor of Rome. When this question was put to her, Zenobia’s claimed that Aurelian was the first Emperor that she had witnessed. Those that preceded Aurelian did not “win victories” and therefore she “never regarded them as emperors.” To speak so rashly would have been uncommon for a Roman woman. Yale historian and classicist, Ramsay MacMullen, wrote that women in public were “to be seen, then, not heard.” He went on to say that this did not mean that Roman women had no power. According to MacMullen, even the emperor, Claudius, was “wholly under the control of his latest wife.” According to the Historia Augusta, this was even true in regard to Zenobia having ruled through her husband until his death. It was a rare opportunity for her to be able to step into the public eye and rally the Palmyrene people around her in a system which seemed designed to prevent women from doing exactly that. She was no longer a whisperer but a challenge to the emperor of Rome."],"display_date":"April 15, 1999","search_date":"1999-04-15","locations":[{"id":52709,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":1760,"tag":"Gender Roles"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6064,"title":"John Woodall Amputates a Sailor’s Leg","course_id":122,"status":"P","start_date":"4/15/99","end_date":"4/15/99","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The sailor’s leg was putrid and rotting. The hole left from the gunshot wound was, according to surgeon John Woodall, 'venomous'. John Woodall went on to say that gangrene had set in, causing the injury to resemble ‘an affront against nature’. Rather than let the gangrene fester, Woodall took the only course of action left to him; he amputated the limb. Once the extremity was removed, the venomous disposition ceased. The sailor’s heavy fever abated, and he made a speedy recovery. Many of Woodall’s other patients were less fortunate. By the time he reached some of the victims of gangrene the disease had progressed beyond treatment. One child had a limb so rotten that the skin parted to the touch. Others died with the onset of fever.","Woodall’s emergency treatment, while useful, was based on incorrect science. Woodall attributed the spread of gangrene to an imbalance of the four humors. Additionally, he described wounds infected by the disease as an ‘affront against nature’. We now know that, while gangrene is a horrible affliction, it is purely natural. In Woodall’s opinion, these injuries were from outside the realm of nature, and therefore wicked, vile, and venomous. While Woodall’s theories were technically incorrect, they worked to save the lives of those afflicted by disease. His hack-job method of treating extreme cases of gangrene actually helped those stricken with the plight. This mixture of ‘superstition’ and science challenges the modern assumption that science was born out of the death of superstitious belief.","This complicated system of superstition and rationality perfectly illustrates Lorraine Daston and Katharine Park’s thesis. In their book, <em>Wonders and the Order of Nature</em>, they dismiss the faulty notion that science and magic were directly at odds with one another. Instead, they propose a mutable, intricate system of balances and counter balances. To Daston and Park, magic played and plays a crucial role in our understanding of nature. While a modern audience may have some trouble digesting this concept, the gangrene afflicted sailor that was rescued by Woodall’s ‘faulty’ hypothesis benefited from the effects of this complex relationship."],"display_date":"April 15, 1999","search_date":"1999-04-15","locations":[{"id":52709,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6076,"title":"An American Soldier Survives the Opening of the Tet Offensive","course_id":123,"status":"P","start_date":"1/30/68","end_date":"1/30/68","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For Sergeant Den Cook of the United States Air Force Security Forces, the Tet offensive was the defining moment of his overseas service. The assault began with rockets striking the Tan Son Nhut Air Base, as “thousands of tracers told [Cook] just how many VC and NVA were kicking at our door.” Cook heard over the radio that positions throughout the perimeter were being overrun shortly before the radio fizzled and died, leaving him in a communications blackout. While overcome by terror, the arrival of helicopter gunship support lifted his spirits, as Cook cheered every strafing run and shouted “Get ‘em” to every rocket launched.","However, Cook’s greatest test was yet to come. Out of the darkness lurched two shadowy figures, scrambling for his bunker at all costs. Cook, terrified but determined to defend his post, was about to fire when the pair called out in perfect English “Don’t shoot! It’s us!” Cook, confused enough to refrain from gunning the men down, was amazed to find that the pair were nothing more than terrified American ammo technicians. Cook’s amazement soon turned to self-loathing and regret, for he had failed. In failing to “blow their butts away,” Cook “failed to do his job.” Had the pair been Vietcong soldiers instead of terrified American technicians, Cook “would have been sent home early in a metal box…jeopardizing all the positions behind [him].” After Tet, Cook felt conflicted between his relief at not killing friendly Americans and his shame at ultimately failing at his duty. This despair, rage, and self-loathing stayed with Cook for the rest of his life, contributing to his PTSD, a condition he slowly learned to cope with.","For the majority of the Vietnam War, conflict was limited to the mountains, jungles, and rice paddies of rural Vietnam. The cities of the south were long considered impregnable bastions, untouchable by direct assault the combined forces of the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese Army. However, the launch of the Tet Offensive on January 30, 1968, shattered these illusions, forcing both the American military and American public to confront the fact that their North Vietnamese foes were more powerful than popularly believed.","The Tet Offensive proved a major turning point in the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese showed themselves a still-potent force, and the American establishment narrative of the war, mainly that it was nearly won, was revealed as fallacious. This had a twofold effect - spurring the anti-war movement to new heights and creating a “credibility gap” for the Johnson administration in the minds of the American public. This second effect was far more pressing, for while the anti-war movement had existed previously, America’s continued involvement in Southeast Asia was largely predicated upon the support of the average American. As a wider swath of America began to turn against the war, the political will necessary to continue the conflict began to evaporate, pushing America towards a negotiated peace and withdrawal from the theater."],"display_date":"January 30, 1968","search_date":"1968-01-30","locations":[{"id":52685,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":1554,"tag":"Vietnam War"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":2196,"tag":"Tet Offensive"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":123,"school_id":3}},{"id":6096,"title":"Grunt Witnesses the Enormities at My Lai","course_id":123,"status":"P","start_date":"3/16/68","end_date":"3/16/68","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At approximately 7:30 a.m. on the morning of Saturday March 16, 1968, the officers and enlisted men of Charlie Company of the 1<sup>st</sup> Battalion, 20<sup>th</sup> Infantry Regiment, 11<sup>th</sup> Brigade of the 23<sup>rd</sup> Infantry Division landed by helicopter directly outside the village of My Lai.  Private First Class Herbert L. Carter witnessed the unjustifiable and immoral events that ensued once his unit entered the village.  Charlie Company did not encounter any opposition from the villagers, but it did not matter.   According to Carter, the commanding officer ordered the men to “kill everybody, leave no one standing.”  Under the leadership of Captain Ernest Medina and spearheaded by Lieutenant William Calley, the men of Charlie Company tortured, murdered, and mutilated the inhabitants of My Lai.  When asked how many people were killed during the massacre, Carter responded, “There were more than 100, but I couldn’t tell you accurately how many people were killed.  I don’t believe there were any people left alive.”  The men of Charlie Company ceased fire between 9:00 a.m. and 10:30 a.m.  Carter shot himself in the foot and was evacuated at approximately 10:30 a.m.","The events of My Lai have been investigated and disputed since that Saturday morning in 1968.  Australian professors Truda Gray and Brian Martin claimed, “Upon publication of the news in late 1969, many people in the United States and beyond were shocked.”  The massacre at My Lai altered the American public’s stance on the war in Vietnam.  Since the military concealed facts surrounding the massacre, U.S. citizens felt left in the dark and increasingly protested the war once they learned what actually happened.  Top-level military commanders had no idea of what transpired on March 16, 1968 until the story reached publication a year later.  The cover-up process was kept within the middle ranks of the military.  The only person to be convicted for his actions was Lieutenant William Calley, reflecting injustice and bias within the judiciary system of the U.S. military.","Professors of sociology Joachim J.

The fighting in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, started in the early morning of July 1, 1863, and lasted three days, until July 3. Despite the Union’s decisive victory at Gettysburg, around 23,000 of their soldiers died during the three day battle, whereas the Confederate Army lost 28,000 [1]. Photographs were taken of the battlefield and serve as a reminder of both how many lives this famous battle claimed, and the humanity of the fallen soldiers. One photograph in particular, Timothy O’Sullivan’s <em>A Harvest of Death</em>, gives a dramatic, yet realistic portrayal of Gettysburg’s casualties and the horrors of war.","The famous nineteenth century photographer, Matthew Brady, is most often associated with Civil War photography. He was in charge of a substantial crew of photographers, and often attributed their photographs to himself, as well as those of other photographers to which he had no business relations [2]. Brady was the former employer of other accomplished photographers, such as Alexander Gardner. Gardner and his cameramen, James Gibson and Timothy O’Sullivan, were accomplished photographers in their own right. After leaving Brady’s employment, Gardner and his crew focused on the grisly, uncensored realities of war, taking photos of the dead men and horses strewn about the battlefields. These photographers traveled to battlefield locations in covered wagons, which served as both a mobile storage facility and a darkroom [3]. Gardner led a three-man team which arrived at Gettysburg late in the morning of July 5, 1863, soon after the defeated Confederate General Robert E. Lee left the battlefield. The photographers immediately began taking photographs of their bloody surroundings, and Timothy O’Sullivan, one of Alexander Gardner’s photographers, snapped his famous photograph [4].","The photo shows the bodies of dead soldiers scattered across a field, among the debris from battle, and in the distance, two living men with horses can be seen. Prominent among the dead, the decaying corpse of a Union soldier is seen with his legs splayed, right arm outstretched, head turned towards the photographer, and his mouth forced open due to bloating. The other men lie in similar positions, but their heads are turned away. The soldiers’ once-handsome uniforms are disheveled; several of their coats are unbuttoned, and some are missing shoes. The dead lie at varying distances from O’Sullivan’s camera; the scattering of bodies continues until they fade into the mist [5]. Because the battle ended two days prior to the taking of this photograph, the bodies are not those of freshly deceased men, although they remain unburied in the July heat. The photo was fittingly titled <em>A Harvest of Death</em>.","The photographs of the Civil War hold a great amount of significance, to both contemporary and modern audiences. O’Sullivan’s photograph immortalized the carnage of the Battle of Gettysburg, giving non-combatants and future generations a view of the battlefield, in all its gruesome authenticity. This photograph gives humanity to the unnamed fallen soldiers and, together with the many other photos published from various Civil War battlefields, brought the horrors of war to the attention of the American public. These photographs were a stark contrast to the portraiture of powerful figures that Americans were used to seeing – high-ranking officers and government officials posing for the camera. Aside from their families and friends, most of the dead men on the battlefield were unknown to the general public [6]. The idealized glamour of war – the stylish uniforms, well-groomed horses, and the heroic nature of the soldiers who would fight for their families, their country, and their values – all of this was pushed aside in the photographs to show the true, gruesome nature of the battlefield.","Due to public demand, these photographs were displayed in galleries for public viewing and printed in newspapers using a woodcut of the glass images [7]. The American public was simultaneously horrified and fascinated by the morbid scenes depicted in the photographs. The <em>New York</em> <em>Times,</em> speaking of the photographs (for which Brady was given undue credit), said that they had “done something to bring home to us the terrible reality and earnestness of war. If he has not brought bodies and laid them in our door-yards and along the streets, he has done something very like it.” [8]"," "," ","[1] George Sullivan, <em>In the Wake of Battle The Civil War Images Of Matthew Brady </em>(Munich: Prestel Verlag, 2004), 18.","[2] <em>Ibid</em>., 10.","[3] <em>Ibid</em>., 15.","[4] <em>Ibid</em>., 18.","[5] Timothy O’Sullivan, “A Harvest of Death, Gettysburg, July 1863” (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration).","[6] Mary Panzer, <em>Matthew Brady and the Image of History</em>, (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books, 1997), 106-109.","[7] Panzer, 106-109 and Foster Eubank, <em>Following Civil War Photographers</em>, (Henderson, NV: Jennings Sayre Publications, 2003), Introduction.","[8] Panzer, 106-109."," "],"display_date":"July 5, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-05","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1860,"tag":"Battle of Gettysburg"},{"id":1161,"tag":"Photography"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":124,"school_id":43}},{"id":6196,"title":"<strong>A Pennsylvania soldier sails to the Mexican War</strong>","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-01-29","end_date":"1847-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 29, 1847 James Skelly and the Cambria Guards embarked on the <em>General Veazie</em> in New Orleans during the Mexican War.  Rainy weather had played a continuous role in delaying the men from reaching port.  According to Skelly “owing to the Rain and we were Prohibited” resulted in another delay from sailing.  Several days later the ship finally made her way into the Gulf of Mexico.  James Skelly of Cambria County, Pennsylvania had enlisted with the Cambria Guards and kept a diary of what he experienced during part of the Mexican War.  Unbeknownst to Skelly, he would not only fight the Mexicans, but also small pox and sea sickness.","Skelly left Cambria County with the Cambria Guards on January 2 and traveled on steam boats down the Ohio and Mississippi River to New Orleans.  This expedition included the famous Lt.

Milroy in counterinsurgency fighting against Confederate guerrillas in Western Virginia early on in the war.  Napoleonic-style warfare practiced during the Civil War proved futile against the guerrilla warfare with the Confederates along the border region.  However, General Milroy developed guerrilla tactics of his own that proved highly successful against the rebels throughout Western Virginia.  The Confederates became so frustrated with losing at their own game of guerrilla warfare that they placed a bounty on General Milroy.","Unfortunately, he and his men did not arrive in southern Pennsylvania in time to stop the Rebel destruction due to an earlier encounter with Rebel troops in Winchester, Virginia that resulted in the scattering of part of his forces.

The British had impressed over six thousand United States citizens, and in 1807, <em>HMS Leopard</em> had opened fire on <em>USS Chesapeake</em>, killing three men. Great Britain had not responded to either diplomatic negotiations or threats made by the United States. Declaring war was the next step for many United States politicians, though not all congressmen agreed on declaring war against Great Britain. Federalists and some Republicans had strong concerns about the effects of war on the new nation.","Virginian John Randolph had previously voiced Republican apprehensions about the implications of the impending war for the United States. Randolph worried that American citizens would not want to pay increased taxes and that New England merchants would not support a war that would make their ports vulnerable to the British. Randolph tried to convince other Southern Republicans of the possible dangers a war would cause.","Federalist Laban Wheaton had opposed war with Great Britain since his time in at the Massachusetts Statehouse. In 1808 Wheaton presented the Wheaton Resolves in response and opposition to the national Embargo Act. James Sullivan, a Democratic-Republican and Governor of Massachusetts, had seen the Federalist Campaign in Massachusetts as a betrayal of President Jefferson, and he had feared that opposing the national government would lead to anarchy. Sullivan tried to present the Embargo Act in a positive light, as a federal action the demonstrated of unity and independence for the nation. The Federalist Party had dominated the Statehouse, and Wheaton had gained recognition for authoring the resolves. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1808, Wheaton maintained his Federalist stance through his four terms. He joined with other Federalists and some Republicans in resisting the declaration of war in 1812.","When the Senate presented the act to the House, Federalists and other members who were opposed to war tried to delay the vote. Virginia Federalist Daniel Sheffey proposed to postpone the vote indefinitely. Along with seventy other House members, Massachusetts Federalist Laban Wheaton voted in favor of the motion, which was opposed by forty-six nays. The motion was raised again, and Wheaton voted in the affirmative. However, the nays outweighed the yeas with an eighty-five to forty-four vote.

Sherman completed his official after action report of the engagement. Serving as a Colonel in the Union Army, Sherman commanded a brigade during the battle. In his report he addressed many of the problems he and his men had encountered while in action. These included the incompetence of some officers and confusion over uniforms. These problems and others similar to them would continue to hinder the Union army during the early days of the American Civil War.","Sherman’s account of the death of Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty clearly displayed the incompetence of some Union officers early on in the war. After encountering a Confederate force fleeing along a row of trees, Sherman recorded that, “Haggerty...without orders, rode out alone, and endeavored to intercept their retreat. One of the enemy, in full view, at short range, shot Haggerty, and he fell dead from his horse.” This would not be the only instance of incompetence on the part of commanding officers during the battle. The appointment of “political officers” who lacked military experience or military educations, as well as the practice of electing officers in volunteer regiments would result in many disasters similar to that of Lieutenant-Colonel Haggerty’s. According to historian James McPherson, on July 22, just one day after the First Battle of Bull Run, the U.S. Congress responded by authorizing “the creation of military boards to examine officers and remove those found to be unqualified”.  This would remove hundreds of incompetent officers from the ranks of the Union army and help to improve the quality of leadership.","A second major blunder of the battle, confusion over uniforms, can be seen in Sherman’s account of an incident of friendly fire on a Union regiment “uniformed in gray cloth, almost identical with that of the great bulk of the secession army.” Confusion over uniforms would be a major problem for both sides during the early days of the war. McPherson claims that confusion over uniforms played a major role in the outcome of the First Battle of Bull Run. This was undoubtedly the case during the fight for Henry House Hill when two Union artillery batteries were taken out of action by the “blue-clad” 33<sup>rd</sup> Virginia Regiment. Upon viewing the 33<sup>rd</sup> Virginia approaching them, the Union batteries ceased firing and awaited what they thought was the arrival of Union reinforcements only to be cut down by a volley of enemy fire. After the First Battle of Bull Run uniforms on both sides would become more regulated to avoid such mistakes.","McPherson has claimed that, “The United States has usually prepared for its wars after getting into them.” Sherman’s account of the First Battle of Bull Run appears to support this statement. Reading his words, it is clear that the 1840 West Point graduate was both annoyed and down right critical of the mistakes made during this first battle of the Civil War; mistakes that cost some men their very lives."],"display_date":"July 25, 1861","search_date":"1861-07-25","locations":[{"id":13632,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ARLINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2556,"tag":"Political Officers"},{"id":2555,"tag":"First Bull Run"},{"id":284,"tag":"General Sherman"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6292,"title":"Women Working on the Homefront during WWII","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/43","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When the men of America were called upon to serve their country during WWII, many job positions and duties on the Homefront were left unfulfilled. As a result, the women of America were encouraged to step up and take on the roles the men serving our country had left behind. The radio broadcast songs about women working in factories. Advertisers and propaganda agencies created fictional characters such as Rosie the Riveter to inspire women. Advertisements calling on women to support the war effort were widely published and distributed. All of these mechanisms encouraged women to enter the work force. Women answered the call. While women's wartime industrial work is well-known, less well known is the fact that women also engaged in homefront agricultural work by joining the Women’s Land Army.","The goal of the Women’s Land Army was to fill the roles men had left behind on farms while they were away fighting. During the course of the war, the Women’s Land Army had recruited over 1.5 million women to join the homefront efforts. Jean Wanamaker of Bel Air, Maryland, was one of the recruits. She was participated in the first nationally offered college course on farming for women, offered at the University of Maryland. The course was created to make sure that Women’s Land Army workers were appropriately trained before engaging in farm work. Jean joined mostly because she wanted the opportunity for training and income. Jean was one of several thousand women in the Maryland agricultural industry. They produced 40 percent more food than average, despite the fact that there had been 30 percent decrease in farm labor.","Jean’s story is just one of millions that reflected the common attitude of women on the Homefront during WWII. Many felt their civilian role was just as important as men’s military role. They, too, were working for victory, by keeping the country's economy running. Though many of the women returned to their original domestic roles when WWII ended, they made strides for future generations of women."," "],"display_date":"1943 - 1945","search_date":"1944-07-01","locations":[{"id":25324,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"Prince Georges, Maryland"},{"id":26216,"lat":39.5358347431,"lng":-76.0898051386,"zoom":9,"place":"Harford, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":2564,"tag":"Women's Land Army"},{"id":242,"tag":"WWII"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}},{"id":6344,"title":"<strong>Women at Work during WWII 1940s</strong>","course_id":140,"status":"P","start_date":"10/3/42","end_date":"10/3/42","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shortly after World War I (1914-1918) ended, trade unions were concerned that men returning from the war would have to accept lower wages since many women had filled their jobs during the conflict [3]. Their concern proved to be overstated, but it remained relevant when the United States entered the World War II at the end of 1941. During the war, there was a sudden upsurge in industrial production in such a short amount of time that additional workers were needed in order to replace the men that were leaving for military service. Since women \"taking\" jobs from the men was seen as unacceptable, the initial turnout of women workers was not as successful as the government had hoped. In order to overcome these stigmas, the United States government launched a campaign to entice women into industrial work by selling the importance of supporting the war [4].  Joseph Purcell’s <em>Hie From Altar to War Jobs</em>, was one of hundreds of articles that was published portraying working women in a favorable manor [5].","Millions of women were conscripted to fill empty jobs that had once been worked by men [2]. Primarily, women were believed to not work as well as men and received lower wages. However, even with minimal experience and no training, women were confident that they could perform equally as well as the men. In Joseph Purcell’s <em>Hie From Altar to War Jobs </em>(1942), Virginia Brown, who is depicted in the picture, was a perfect example of someone who was not afraid of taking on work requiring “plenty of elbow grease.” She is shown in the article working on a gun barrel at the Watertown Arsenal in Massachusetts. Virginia Brown, along with Alice Barnes, was determined to aid the war and take on new responsibilities, including inspecting gun barrels. The article noted that Alice Barnes, Virginia Brown’s coworkers, had postponed her honeymoon to begin work. This information was emphasized in the text by a bolded heading; suggesting that she went straight from the altar after getting married to her job to continue helping the soldiers. These women were worried about the soldiers having enough equipment and focused on learning everything involved with operating heavy machinery to aid to war. WWII provided an opportunity for the women exercise greater rights in the workplace and helped to change cultural notions that women were inferior and unequal.","The government also created \"Rosie the Riveter,\" a fictional character that provided an illustration of the ideal working woman: \"loyal, efficient, patriotic, and pretty [1].  Rosie was branded in a poster with the words \"We can do it\" [1].  Initially, women were influenced by patriotism, persuaded by this successful campaign, but shortly after, the economic incentives became greater. Women between the ages of 20-30 were recruited to work in war industries and Armed Forces [3].  Propaganda flyers were distributed in mass quantities, urging women to partake in war work. One propaganda in particular shows various pictures of women working in those roles which were once men's [4]. The headline \"Women in war industry: Women <em>Must </em>keep'em rolling,\" speaks of these women highly by proving that these jobs are still being maintained through these women, keeping the economy moving.  These marketing leaflets can also be seen in John Cilio's book <em>Women's Work in WWII</em>.","While all the efforts of the men fighting in the war were constantly spotlighted, the women who were working hard to maintain stability at home were easily forgotten and often not credited with the work they accomplished.  However, from the start of WWII in 1939 to 1943, there was a 26 percent increase — 5.1 million to 7.25 million — in women employees, with 90 percent of single women between 18 and 40 employed [1].  Even though they may have taken over the workforce, their pay was still not equivalent to those of their male counterparts [4].  The war opened doors for working women by providing opportunities for them to join workforces where they were extremely unwelcomed before.  Women that were exemplified in the campaigns, such as Virginia Brown and Alice Barnes, were able to set an example of patriotism to other women and help shape the entire working industry for women.  Women that were represented in the campaigns, such as Virginia Brown and Alice Barnes, embodied patriotism, helping to shape the entire work industry for women.","References"," "],"display_date":"October 3, 1942","search_date":"1942-10-03","locations":[{"id":25375,"lat":42.3399569086,"lng":-70.8833658099,"zoom":9,"place":"Plymouth, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":199,"tag":"working women"},{"id":242,"tag":"WWII"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":140,"school_id":43}},{"id":6478,"title":"Washington D.C.

In 1991 they were invited to take part in what the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>termed “the biggest victory celebration since the end of WWII,” in Washington D.C. Despite opposition from some, the “overall mood was of jubilation” and the day was marked by a sense of “old-fashioned patriotism.”","            The conflict attracted significant levels of popular support which foreign interventions by the US had not achieved since the end of the Second World War; for the parade on June 9 1991, the U.S. Park Police estimated 800,000 people turned out in support. The parade represented a “display of the American military might” which had completed its action in the Persian Gulf in just one hundred hours. As Michael Cairo has highlighted, the First Gulf War represented a “decisive military campaign,” of which Americans could be proud.","            President George H.W. Bush shared in the celebratory spirit and highlighted the validity of US intervention on behalf of the Kuwaiti people. He spoke of the freedom which Kuwait could now enjoy because “’we dared risk our most precious asset, our sons and daughters.’” The Kuwaiti ambassador also expressed his gratitude for the American intervention, which had “ousted an Iraqi army from his homeland.” Those in attendance at the victory parade shared in this sense of moral justification as well as in the legal justification. As Majid Khadduri and Edmund Ghareeb have argued, by invading Kuwait, Iraq had violated the “United Nations’ law,” thus vindicating intervention by UN members.","            The majority of those in attendance on June 9<sup>th</sup> celebrated the quick and decisive conclusion of the campaign in the Persian Gulf; at just one hundred hours of engagement over a forty-three day period, it was a remarkably short conflict. The Vietnam War had created a sense of distrust between the American public and politicians; a distrust George H.W. Bush was aware of, in Cairo’s opinion, when he made the conscious decision to not push on into Baghdad and to instead withdraw US troops. Indeed, in many of the statements collected by the <em>LA Times</em>, the sentiments of relief amongst the public are apparent. As Ethel Hammond- one of those interviewed- commented, “’I am just glad they’re back.’”"," ","            For the first time in almost sixty years, members of the US military returning to the United States were met with a victory parade which cost an estimated $12 million and with jubilant crowds. It was a distinct divergence from the welcome which had met veterans of the Korean and Vietnam wars; American attitudes had swung towards the positive regarding the US Army. "],"display_date":"March 17, 1991 - June 10, 1991","search_date":"1991-04-28","locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":2876,"tag":"Desert Storm"},{"id":2875,"tag":"Celebration"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":1577,"tag":"Victory"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}},{"id":6617,"title":"Constructing the Path to Victory through Island No. 10","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-03-23","end_date":"1862-04-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After conquering New Madrid, Union General, John Pope formulated a plan to secure the fortified Island No. 10 in order break Confederate control of the Mississippi River in Missouri. Pope’s bold design to evade the Confederate held Island No. 10 involved bypassing it by cutting a canal along the base of the northern “S” meander and directly connect the river areas between Island No. 8 and Island No. 9, along with New Madrid."," Engineers and an infantry regiment from Wisconsin devised ingenious tools to saw down trees below the level of the spring floodwaters. Some 600 soldiers eventually cleared a fifty-foot wide, eighty- mile long canal, taking about three weeks. With the Mississippi River being as unpredictable as it was, floodwaters would soon subside several inches a day after April 1, 1862, meaning that the tress that were cut at a higher mark would have to be cut again so the ships could pass. As Pope recalled, “To do this a cross-cut saw was attached, or rather was made the lower side of a triangle, the upper angle of which was fastened to the tree just at the water-line, and the depth from this point to the lower side of the triangle (the cross-cut saw) was about five feet.” With the canal completed on April 3, 1862, it was fully operable for ships and other vessels to use with the existing water levels of the Mississippi.","With the completion of the canal, on the stormy night of April 4, Captain Walke ran his gun boat, the <em>Carondolet</em>, past the battery of enemy troops on Island No. 10 untouched. Two nights later, Walke ordered his other ship, the <em>Pittsburg, </em>past the battery for Pope’s use. With these two ships, Pope intended to silence the battery on the bank called Watson’s Landing, in order to land troops for battle. On the morning of April 7, Pope ordered his men to open fire on the enemy using their ground battery and gunships to silence their weapons so he could land troops. According to Pope, “I at once communicated the fact to Paine and ordered him as soon as he effected a landing to leave a guard and push on himself with his command as rapidly to Tiptonville, to which point all the forces of the enemy were tending, assuring him that the rest of the troops would cross rapidly and be up with him soon.”","At about four o’clock in the morning on April 8, the Confederates evacuated Island No. 10 and were driven back to Reelfoot Swamp on the Tennessee side, unable to resist the Federals anymore.

They faced many struggles along the way including disease, thick mud, and broken roads, but the men pushed forward to the Confederate-held town. The Confederate General John McCown had caught wind of the movement of Pope’s divisions and decided to strengthen his defenses. McCown had a grand total of fifty-two pieces of artillery on his side, along with five foot thick bags of corn and dirt that could hold up to three regiments per fort. On March 3, Pope and his men set up their field guns in order to cut off Confederate communication, as well as to try to seal the fate of McCown’s remaining two forts.","On the night of March 11, the 10<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> Illinois moved heavy artillery into place, about 800 yards from the Confederates lines, without the enemy knowing. Pope commanded Captain Mower, the Union siege gun commander, to concentrate fire on the C.S.A gunboats until they were silenced and then to batter the fortresses, in order to save ammunition. Confederate General McCown went into complete panic. He demanded that Polk and Beauregard give him 20,000 more men to fight because he thought that Pope had constructed an army of 50,000 soldiers, when he only had 12,000. On the evening of March 13, McCown realized that the heavy artillery that Pope’s men had brought through the swamps would lead to failure for his army. McCown, in defeat, told his leading commander Stewart to evacuate New Madrid and head to Tiptonville, Tennessee.","According to Pope, “A few minutes after daylight a flag of truce approached our lines with information that the enemy had hurriedly abandoned the works both below and above New Madrid, and been carried to the other shore of the river by gunboats.” The Union Army of the Mississippi defeated the Confederates with perseverance and dedication due to their fearless general, John Pope.

Stuart and 2,000 of his fellow Confederate cavalrymen laid a swift and destructive raid upon the Union encampment known as Catlett’s Station. Stuart’s inspiration for the raid can be traced back to his own near capture by Union cavalry in the town of Verdiersville, Virginia, several days prior to this attack. The loss of valuable information to the Union forces included, “his hat and haversack, containing his maps, having been captured,” recalled Stuart’s comrade Lieutenant Colonel W.W. Blackford. Motivated from his own irresponsibility and supported by his commander Robert E. Lee, Stuart established a plan for redemption. He would invade the Union encampment, commanded by Brigadier General John Pope, with the main purpose of burning a strategically important Union supply bridge along the Orange & Alexandria Railroad. The Confederates believed that this raid could prolong the arrival of invaluable resources to the Union camp, essentially increasing Lee’s opportunity of success at this time during the war.","Stuart and his men arrived in an area adjacent to Catlett’s Station, where he placed the reconnaissance in the hands of W.W. Blackford. “I rode all around the outskirts of their encampment, and found a vast assemblage of wagons and a city of tents,” stated Blackford, “…but no appearance of any large organized body of troops; and with the exception of a small camp guard at a crossroads.” Having been several hundred yards away from the main Union camp, the guards stationed at the crossroads became the first victims of Stuart and his well-trained cavalry, as they were quickly captured and questioned for intelligence information. With Federal troops on the camp’s outskirts under Confederate control, Stuart set his sights upon the bulk of the Union encampment, including the headquarters of General Pope. Stuart’s inability to locate Pope’s headquarters led to a halt in his attack, but a sudden change in fortune turned in favor of the Rebels, when they crossed paths with a Union contraband. He agreed to lead them to their desired location. Blackford recalled he; “readily undertook to guide us to the spot on the terms we offered: kind treatment if faithful, and instant extermination if traitorous.”","At the sound of the bugle, Stuart and his men hastily invaded the camp, carrying out their plan. Each regiment was given a specific task, one attacked the depot, the second attacked the Union Pope’s quarters, and the rest plundered the camp. The ransacking included burning tents and wagons along with taking prisoners and resources. The Confederates quickly gained an advantage over the Pennsylvania Bucktail defenders and gathered many resources in horses, mules, and money. Though unable to burn the bridge because of conflicting reports of rain dampened wood and unnavigable darkness, the Rebel’s attack appeared a success. The Confederate cavalry also obtained important documentation from General Pope’s headquarters that provided valuable information regarding the Union army and their current positioning.

As Bleier carried the last dead body out of the area, a machine gun opened fire and every soldier dropped and held their position until the firing ceased. The companies set up camp there overnight and when Company D arrived to help with the remaining bodies the next day, the enemy machine gun again opened fire upon the soldiers. Bleier’s responsibility was to provide cover fire on the machine gun so his troops could continue to move. “When I rolled over to get a grenade,” he recalled, “I heard the medic behind me hollering ‘Rock! Rock!’ As I turned around, I felt a punch in my leg and it started spurting blood.” Bleier and the medic relocated their company and got into position.

During the Civil War, when medicine hadn’t advanced to the point where ambulances only served a means of stabilization, and transportation to a hospital like they do now; it was the ambulance-wagon, and those who pushed its integration that no doubt saved thousands of lives.   ","Hammond demanded (and got) one ambulance for every 150 soldiers and got two medical supply wagons for each regimental corps. His improved transportation system proved itself, and at the battle of Antietam (September 1862) his stretcher bearers and ambulance-wagons had every one of the Union Army's 9420 wounded soldiers off the battlefield before the day ended. It was a remarkable feat in the early history of ambulances. At first, ambulance at the time was used strictly for combat zone purposes, but was quickly adopted by hospitals soon after. "],"display_date":"April 12, 1861 - May 9, 1865","search_date":"1863-04-26","locations":[{"id":53115,"lat":32.7523476,"lng":-79.8746925,"zoom":7,"place":"Fort Sumter, South Carolina"},{"id":52839,"lat":37.09024,"lng":-95.712891,"zoom":7,"place":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":3500,"tag":"William A.

Once the doctor had to operate by the book, which means directly from a book.  He recalled, “I had taken one medical book to Korea with me…I remember opening it to whatever page it was, which showed the hilum of the lung, and I propped it up on an ammunition case.” Dr. Grillo described the circumstances further, “…of course, the first thing I encountered was a massive outpouring of blood from the hilum of the lung.” He then proceeded to simultaneously read from the book and perform the operation. The Interviewer then asked “So you, in essence, were operating by the book.” “By the book,” Responded Dr. Grillo.","During the Korean Conflict (1950-1953) the United States fought alongside South Korean and United Nations troops seeking to oust communist North Korean and Chinese forces.  As an innovation based on lessons from World War II, the U.S. instituted MASH (Mobile Army Surgical Hosptial) units that moved medical personnel as close to the front lines as possible, and also brought women closer to the front lines than ever before.  The goal was to help improve the survival rate of casualties.  If a soldier got to the surgeon quickly enough he had a quite good chance of survival. According to medical surgeon Dr. Grillo “… very few of them died… the worst wounds never make it; they’re dead. And then a lot of others die in transport.”  Still, to be able to save almost all your patients is an impressive feat. During 1951, MASH 8076 treated 21,143 patients and of those patients only 188 succumbed to injuries or illness. This means that only 0.889% of their patients died in 1951.","MASH units played the role of unsung hero of the war at least until the feature film and highly successful television show made Americans much more aware of their history. In World War II there were no MASH units and each soldier had a 1 in 56 chance that he was going to die. When you look towards the Korean War the soldier had a 1 in 171 chance of dying. That is a dramatic difference and a huge number of young men who did not need to die."," ","The doctors of the Korean War did everything they could to keep the soldiers that came into their care alive. Thanks to them and the system that was set up they were able to keep more people alive than in any previous war.

The strategically titled article “Life-Saving Aerial Spray Missions in Vietnam” appeared in the March 1969 issue and provided the audience with broad understanding of how defoliation missions took place. More than that, the tone, title and content of the piece explained and endorsed the necessity of such missions. In favor of herbicide and defoliant use, the article relied upon education to inform those reading the article of how vital the use of defoliants can be to American lives as “Their task: aerial defoliation at various strategic areas to help save the lives of their fighting compatriots.”","            Misunderstood and misjudged at the time, the use of defoliants in the Vietnam war, through Operation Ranch Hand, unleashed unintended environmental and health effects on those in targeted areas. Ultimately, the U.S. used eleven million gallons of defoliants leading to unimaginable destruction. The defoliants remained hidden in the soils, water systems, and fats of humans and animals following exposure and as a result, defoliants affected areas such as rice fields and rubber plantations that had not been intended targets. With dioxin levels at estimated concentrations of 1000 mg/kg in highly exposed areas, some zones in Vietnam are still considered harmful to humans. One study, published in 1998, that surveyed areas adjacent to the former A So airbase in Central Vietnam suggested that fish still contained concentrations of dioxins that would be harmful to humans if consumed. This further raises the question of whether defoliant use was necessary.","The monthly magazine held a distinguished position as the foremost provider of valuable herbicidal and agricultural information covering developments in farming techniques. With such a title came the responsibility of producing pertinent and informative articles each month.

This use led to the significant destruction of native Vietnamese vegetation, along with severely affecting human health through cancer and birth defects, prompting an international questioning of its use and accusations of violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol.

Born in Scotland, the two had immigrated to America. Unlike Sandy, though, James served as a lieutenant in the Confederacy. Sandy Campbell lived in the North, while James lived in the South, leading to the siblings being on opposite sides of the conflict. The two brothers had just fought against one another in the same battle, demonstrating the brother versus brother adage.  ","            The Battle of Secessionville was a planned Union attack on the Confederate-held James Island, South Carolina. This plan called for the U.S. to take the island, and gain a foothold to stage a land attack upon Charleston. Brigadier General Henry Benham commanded the Union forces, while the Confederates were under the command of Colonel Thomas G. Lamar. The Union troops assaulted the Confederate fort near Secessionville, but the fort was heavily defended and soon augmented with reinforcements. Taking the fort proved too tough a task for the Union, resulting in a Confederate victory, despite the small size of the battle. The total numbers for the Union were approximately 6,600 men, while the Confederates had a strength of around 2,000 men. ","            After the conclusion of the battle. James learned of Sandy’s presence this from some of the Union prisoners of war, and soon wrote to his brother. In this letter he stated “I was astonished to hear from the prisoners that you was colour Bearer of the Regmt that assalted the Battrey [sic] at this point the other day.” He went on to state that while he hoped they would never meet on the battlefield face to face again, he would continue to fight for his cause. An interesting note is that he wrote a request to his brother, pertaining to their sister. “When you write north you will please Let Sister ann know that I am Still alive and in good health. I am verry anxious to hear from her but surcimstances does not afford a chance.” Even though his sister remained loyal to the Union, the family bonds weighed heavily even in the midst of conflict.

On November 24, Canadian delegate Arthur R. Smith addressed the United Nations (UN) General Assembly’s special political committee regarding a refugee crisis. In the aftermath of the 1948 Palestinian war, 1,000 refugees were displaced from their homes. On behalf of Canada, Smith requested Israel, the Arab States, and members of the UN to reach a solution to the crisis. Three things were highlighted: the urgency of the situation requiring immediate action; the collective responsibility the global actors had to end the crisis; and the wellbeing of the future generations. Smith noted that the actors involved need to change their approach to the crisis. Instead of arguing with each other, the actors need to find a practical solution to ensure the safety and wellbeing of present and future generations. It was also suggested that a collective and collaborative approach must be implemented to resolve the crisis. Furthermore, the meeting also emphasized that if the actors involved fail to come to a solution, they will be held accountable by future generations.","The historical context behind the Palestinian war of 1948 is the Arab-Israeli conflict: a result of the actions of the UN and the British Empire. In 1917, in the aftermath of World War I, the British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent a letter to Lord Rothschild[1]. This letter became known as the Balfour Declaration and was considered as a legally binding document in which, the British government recognized the right of Jews to <em>Eretz Israel</em>[2].  Thus, using this document, the British government endorsed the creation of a Jewish state and encouraged Jewish Zionist migration from Europe to Palestine. On November 29, 1947, the U.N General Assembly adopted resolution no. 181, which acted as another catalyst to the conflict[3].  The resolution proposed the creation of a Jewish state: 55 percent of the Palestine Mandate would be given to the Jewish State and 42 percent of the Palestinian population will be governed by the Jewish state[4]. After the resolution passed, Palestinian civilians were expelled by the Jewish forces and prevented from returning[5]. After the British army left on May 15, 1948, Arab army (from neighbouring Arab states) arrived in Palestine and war broke out between the Arab and Jewish forces[6].  An estimate of 550,000-962,000 refugees resulted from the exodus[7].
