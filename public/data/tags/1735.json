Babero, was an African American soldier enlisted in the United States Army during World War II. While stationed at an army base in Pennsylvania, he was surprised to find that segregation was practiced that far north. Although African Americans and Caucasians were fighting in the same war for the same cause, Private Babero still experienced racial injustice. Out of the four movie theaters on post only one was allowed to be used by black soldiers. Having strong emotions of injustice and social inequality Private Babero wrote to attorney Truman Gibson numerous time of the segregation on the army base, not in the hopes that he would file a claim against the base, but rather in hopes that he and other like him would realize that what was happening was wrong and would one day have the courage to do something to change it.","As with the Great War black soldiers returned from WWII as champions of democracy to a society that still treated them as second class citizens. During the 1920s the older generation pushed a civil rights agenda but with little success. World War II bought about irreversible change. The defense jobs that were held by African Americans at the time rose from 3 to 8 percent. A new sense of mission was forged and black Americans joined by some white allies began to express resistance to passive acceptance of the pre-war status quo. The number of registered voters in the south increased to 12 percent by 1947, led by black soldiers.","At this time in American history the practice of Jim Crow laws and segregation was a common thing throughout the country. While training and fighting on the war front there was still fighting going on the home front even in different military divisions. While fighting in Europe African American soldiers returned home with a new sense of pride and accomplishment. They had this militaristic attitude that they were not going to return home to the same segregated theaters, dinners and restaurants, transportation, or being banned from voting."," "],"display_date":"March 13, 1944 - March 13, 1947","search_date":"1945-09-11","locations":[{"id":28078,"lat":41.3021722403,"lng":-80.2577161025,"zoom":9,"place":"Mercer, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1734,"tag":"WWII, African Americans"},{"id":1735,"tag":"World War II, Racism"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}},{"id":5731,"title":"Treatment of Soldiers During and After Duty","course_id":110,"status":"P","start_date":"9/27/43","end_date":"9/27/43","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A soldier stationed at Camp Gordon Johnston, Florida, wrote to a newspaper reporter about the conditions that they were forced to live in and the treatment that they were subjected to. For the first two weeks the troops did nothing. After this they were ordered to clean the white officer’s rooms including their beds and latrines. The troops ranking from Majors, Sergeants, and CPl were not allowed to go to the church services on camp and couldn’t worship God when they pleased.  The soldiers discovered that that were banned from a service club when a black Staff Sgt. and some fellow comrades went to the company to get some sandwiches and were told by a civilian that they don’t serve colored. Another incident at a dance given for the colored soldiers arose when there were about 30 lounge chairs for the black troop’s guests and they had to give them up for the white officer’s wives.","African American soldiers were not only had restrictions at events and gatherings for themselves but also in their division. There was a two front battle that they were engaged in, the one overseas and on the battlefield and the prejudice at home and in the military. There was racism not only on the military bases but also at the businesses surrounding the bases. A pub keeper hung a sign over his business saying, “This Place for the Exclusive Use of English and American Negro Soldiers.\" United States had their own Jim Crow laws which they then bought to those in Europe and influenced their culture with negative American ways. James Jones, who served in the 761<sup>st</sup> Tank Battalion said that the French had a profound impact on his life and that they had a certain kind of openness and warmth about them that they exhibited towards minorities. The relationship between black and white soldiers was mixed.","Despite being of a different race many soldiers had different experiences. The majority of them suffered discrimination and segregation they received the same treatment in their divisions. Many were not given field experience or were labeled “unfit.”  Those that were able to get positions in which they would get to see combat were a lot of times treated as the officer’s servants, who were the majority of the time white. They were not only treated cruelly by their commanding officers but also the civilians in whom they were helping to defend. Although Europe had their own feelings toward African Americans; those feelings became hardened since America has their laws and Caucasian troops treated blacks cruelly as well."," "," "],"display_date":"September 27, 1943","search_date":"1943-09-27","locations":[{"id":26917,"lat":29.7925410318,"lng":-84.93839964,"zoom":9,"place":"Franklin, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1735,"tag":"World War II, Racism"},{"id":1736,"tag":"African Americans,Solider"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}},{"id":5799,"title":"Japanese-Americans Forced to Evacuate to Internment Camps","course_id":115,"status":"P","start_date":"2/19/42","end_date":"2/19/42","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, \"<em>giving the War Department authority to establish 'military areas'in which designated people would be subject 'to whatever restrictions the Secretary of War imposed.'\" </em>(Patton). Congress then implemented the order on March 21 the same year. At first the Western Defense Command encouraged voluntary evacuation, but after that they began <em>\"involuntary removal and detention of West Coast residents of Japanese ancestry.\" </em>(Executive Order 9066). There were many people who raised their voices and expressed their dissatisfaction with the race hatred and compared the government's actions with those of Fascist countries. Larry Tajiri who was a former Washington D.C. correspondent declared to a Japanese news service, <em>\"We are loyal to the American flag but race hatreds are being stirred up now in the Fascist pattern.\" </em>(\"FR orders closed military areas\").","The FBI had already started raids to take in Japanese people. <em>\"One hundred twelve enemy aliens, some of whom were members of organizations rooted in enemy countries, were siezed today by the Federal Bureau of investigation in Wide-spread raids.\" </em>One of those seized in the area of Palo Alto was the head of a Japanese-American Society.","<em>\"\"Volontary\" evacuation actually began before Executive Order 9066. Enemy aliens had been excluded from areas designated by the Department of Justice as early as December 1941, and many had moved out of the prohibited areas voluntarily.\" </em>(Kashima 101). At first both German and Italian aliens were meant to be evacuated as well as Japanese-Americans and Japanese aliens, but eventually the order was applied only to the Japanese. Nevertheless, the voluntary evacuation failed and a mandatory evacuation plan was made, and the government started to look for areas suitable for both short and long term camps for the evacuees.","The first evacuees arrived at the new relocation centers in May of 1942, and by the end of June there were over 27,000 people at three relocation centers, or relocation camps -- Poston, Arizona, and Manzanar and Tule Lake in California (Kashima 149)."],"display_date":"February 19, 1942","search_date":"1942-02-19","locations":[{"id":27686,"lat":36.5107097541,"lng":-117.409766133,"zoom":7,"place":"Inyo, California"},{"id":25719,"lat":41.5926480759,"lng":-122.540368188,"zoom":8,"place":"Siskiyou, California"}],"tags":[{"id":872,"tag":"Japanese"},{"id":1848,"tag":"Executive Order 9066"},{"id":1847,"tag":"Tule Lake"},{"id":1846,"tag":"Manzanar"},{"id":1845,"tag":"Internment camps"},{"id":1735,"tag":"World War II, Racism"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":115,"school_id":40}}]}
