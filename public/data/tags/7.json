However, this does not diminish the significance of the convention itself.&lt;br /&gt;The women's movement was spreading across the South. Since the end of the Civil War more and more opportunities and responsibilities were coming to women. This increase in power corresponded with a rise in women wanting to have voting privileges. The very face that there was a convention in which, according the paper ladies who pay the rent for the hall' and have male delegates speak at it tells volumes about the extent to which the beginnings of the women's movement had.

The author stated that women have been credited with gentility, humility, and upstanding morals throughout the centuries and many believed they would clean up politics if they won the right to vote. However, in his own personal belief, the author takes the exact opposite view. He proclaimed we would caution her against arrogating to herself a monopoly of the good traits of the race;.[because in] almost every instance in history where she has been clothed with power, she has outrivaled men in the commission of deeds of cruelty and crime.' He believes that women should be satisfied and grateful for the subordinate position which man in his wisdom has assigned her, her evil tendencies suppressed' and she should not venture into the world of politics. The author's theory is that women's exclusion from politics enables her to enjoy an immunity from the cares of government at the same time preserves her from the perpetration of crimes and follies such as have characterized her administration of power in every age and every country.'&lt;br /&gt;This harsh article condemning the participation of slavery was a result of the changing role of women following the Civil War and Reconstruction. Women had taken on new roles in the community and assumed greater responsibility than ever and now were encroaching upon gaining a political voice. However, this met strong opposition in the heavily traditional South which idolized women and their submissive role. The beginning of the women's suffragette movement was met with tough opposition and fury."],"display_date":"January 11, 1878","search_date":"1878-01-11","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":438,"title":"The founding of the Women&#39;s Exchange for Women&#39;s Work in Charleston\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-01-01","end_date":"1885-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Women's Exchange for Women's Work was founded in Charleston in 1885 with the intention of helping the educated poor' become self-sufficient.  Numerous goods were sold there, including foods, flowers, and various crafts.  So that it would not be a humiliating charity,' they placed a 10% surcharge on the goods.  A similar exchange was soon opened in New Orleans.  These organizations and others continued the trend of charity work in which numerous Southern women engaged before and during the Civil War. &lt;br /&gt;More information about the principles and organization of the Women's &lt;br /&gt;Exchange for Women's Work can be found in annual pamphlets issued by the Richmond Women's Exchange in 1888 and 1889.  These documents demonstrate how the exchange began with a simple purpose , namely, to help needy women become financially secure both systematically and delicately,' as they put it.  Although it was founded as a charity, it was run on what they called purely business principles,' accepting work completed solely due to its virtues and not because of any undue sympathy for the laborer.

He wanted niggers. In particular, he wanted the ability to hire an overseer, to raise himself to a higher class distinction. Some of his hunting buddies had overseers, and their constant dialogue about plantation life left Keen on the outside. He wanted nothing more in life than a plantation of niggers so I could talk about my overseer. Keen decided he would marry a rich, old widow to fulfill his slaveholding aspirations.","His first matrimonial expedition failed miserably. He found no rich widows waiting for him, and, in fact, he actually fell in love with one of the prettiest girls I ever saw in my life. Her name was Martha Hooker, but she was 16 and poor; she offered no hope of a suitable dowry to hire an overseer off of. Love was just a mere distraction to Keen. Over the next few weeks he began to write to a widow who filled the bill, but only received silence in return. Frustrated, he obtained a letter of introduction and set out to call upon the old lady. Her name was Rhoda Dean, and her youngest of nine children was 26. Keen was only 22. On his first visit, Keen got straight to the point, for he was never favorably impressed with long courtships; would she marry him? The answer took a few minutes but she consented. Numbers raced through Keen's head, for Rhoda Dean's estate was valued at seventy five thousand dollars. He could finally hire the overseer of his dreams and more slaves to accompany him. As Historian Walter Johnson might say, George Keen was constructing himself out of slaves, literally. Keen saw his value as a man in the amount of slaves he owned and if that amount qualified him to hire an overseer. He was affectionately called a Florida cracker, a plain folk white with little or no slaves. For Keen and other pioneers, he viewed his station as temporary. Non-slaveholding status preceded slaveholding without an overseer which preceded planter status. Each step Keen took in Columbia County brought him closer to the pinnacle, to manhood, and to conversing with his hunting buddies about their overseers.","Slaves were southern symbols of masculinity and whiteness, but they were also literal commodities and property. The ownership of property lay at the foundation of southern society and stood as a barrier to participation within that network. Political involvement, economic leverage, and social interaction hinged upon the amount of property possessed, and Keen knew this very well. He saw numbers everywhere. The widow was worth 75,000 dollars, and Keen himself was worth 4,000 dollars in niggers, land, cattle, horses, and money. Free blacks on Virginia's Eastern Shore in the seventeenth century were able to interact with patrons and have legal standing before the court because they leased, then owned, land tracts and raised cattle. As the South moved westward and into Florida, the frontier communities that developed were full of men like George Keen, ambitious, industrious men seeking opportunity in a society still forming. To progress upward in the hierarchy, Keen was willing to do anything, even marry a widow three times his age."],"display_date":1847,"search_date":"1847-07-02","locations":[{"id":1311,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"COLUMBIA, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1935,"title":"Capturing the Moment\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-12-12","end_date":"1857-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a private letter to her granddaughter, an unnamed woman described a simple scene with such poignant detail that an ordinary moment in history became remarkably touching on paper. The elderly woman wrote to her granddaughter, Kate, about several incidents in her everyday life, one of which was a portrayal of her young cousin, Harry. The writer used small, humorous anecdotes to describe both Harry and his behavior as active, underscoring the fact that he liked to sing and dance, and was also very talkative. In fact, his family tried to take a likeness of little Harry, but his energetic and lively behavior did not mesh well with the photographer's intentions. According to the writer, the photograph did not turn out well. ","Since its conception, photography has become more and more widespread throughout American society as the years progress.

Others held the view that sex after marriage had procreative purpose only. However, many so-called free thinkers such as Charles Knowlton, Abner Kneeland, and Samuel Thompson recognized that Victorian ideals clashed with the reality of everyday life. Many unmarried women who found themselves pregnant used abortion as commonplace birth control practice. ","Abortion practices were not always safe. Local doctors replaced local midwives who had previously performed abortion procedures. However, little actual gynecological medical training or practice complicated the procedure. Many in new medical professional groups pushed for greater autonomy and influence of highly trained medical practitioners to replace the backward practices of quacks who advocated abortion. In Missouri and throughout the South, this growing influence created a greater movement towards white professional doctors. The effect led to the passage of the 1835 St. Louis, Missouri abortion statute, a full twenty years before many states passed similar laws. However, this law hardly stopped sex among unmarried couples or hindered adulterous relationships. Women and men circumvented the law by turning to the work of the free-thinkers, who published and distributed pamphlets on sexual and reproductive health and contraceptive methods. In the South alone, liberal literature included topics about contraceptive methods and sexual advice. This literature circulated to more than 200 agents by 1836, many of whom operated near St. Louis and along the Mississippi river. One popular example included Knowlton's Fruits of Philosophy, which made it to third edition within three years of its original publication in 1830. Popular mail-order items in Missouri-among other states nationwide-included condoms, feminine cleansing products, and abortifacients. Though free-thought groups flourished nationwide, they often kept semi-private for fear of being thought liberal and infidel in their causes. More readily available and cheaper contraceptive devices for men-a dozen condoms sold for three dollars in 1850-allowed couples to engage in sexual relationships, although secret, with fewer consequences.","Many kept their sexual freedoms covert in Missouri and the South not only because of the abortion law, but also because of the issue of interracial sexual relationships. As Nathan Stormer notes, reproductive control for early opponents represented a cacophonous...threatening assault on the status quo of gender, family and class relations. Many feared that if fear of pregnancy were removed from sexual intercourse, wives' sexual faithfulness could not be assured, legitimate children might not so easily be distinguished from illegitimate children, and bloodlines and inheritance might, in consequence, be jeopardized. Because inheritance often dictated property rights in the South, the case of illegitimate-and perhaps mulatto-children produced from an adulterous relationship made easier with birth control brought this issue to the regional and national forefront."],"display_date":1835,"search_date":"1835-07-02","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2003,"title":"Attorney C.S.

Palmore, an attorney in Fayette County, Tennessee, wrote a letter to one of his colleagues. Attorney Edward Brown received the letter from Palmore in Ballsville, Virginia. Palmore boasted the supremacy of the state of Tennessee to the state of Virginia. I will say nothing about the fertility of our soil and other advantages afforded here to the young and enterprising, Palmore declared. He quickly transitioned into the matter he wished to discuss: the issue of the settlement of John Robinson's estate."," C.S. Palmore acted as the administrator of Robinson's estate. He discussed primarily the placement of John Robinson's negroes. Initially Palmore left them with a woman by the name of Miss Frances. Yet as Palmore specified, Robinson did not name Miss Frances as the legatee of the estate. By legatee Palmore meant beneficiary, or the person named in a will to receive part or all of the state. In fact, in his letter to attorney Edward Brown, Palmore acted concerned only with the need for the legatees to pay Miss Frances for her trouble and expense as caretaker of Robinson's slaves. He hoped that Brown could help him find the legatees, a family he finally referred to as the Merymans. Palmore proposed that Brown act as (his) agent in the matter and if the legatees apply for their negroes if they will pay all charges and will release me in your better judgment you may let them have them or if they will sell them to you it will meet my full and harty approbation."," John Robinson?s written will provided instructions for the delegation of all his estate. C.S. Palmore struggled and sought help on only the matter of the future of Robinson?s slaves. Although the woman he referred to in his writing seemed to willingly look after Robinson?s slaves, Palmore pointed out the imposition of this to Edward Brown. Miss Frances benefited only marginally if at all from keeping Robinson's slaves. He seemed to insinuate that the cost was more than she can afford. Palmore declared to Brown that Miss Frances' account for raising George (one of Robinson's slaves) up to the first of February 1845 was 66.73 dollars. "," Slaves like George could either be an asset or a liability in the South. Robinson?s slaves became a liability to Miss Frances and she could only profit from their sale. Bobby Lovett's <em>The African-American History of Nashville, Tennessee</em>, describes a similar exchange that was had with a slave named Frank. When Frank's owner died he was left to his heirs who promptly made plans to convert this asset into cash. Whether in Tennessee, Virginia, or elsewhere in the South, inherited slaves posed a problem to both executors and beneficiaries of estates. Slaves required housing, food, and clothing. Slaves possessed too great a value to just give up, but created a cost that some inheritors could not afford to bear."],"display_date":"March 1, 1846","search_date":"1846-03-01","locations":[{"id":11986,"lat":35.1984324227,"lng":-89.4156896322,"zoom":9,"place":"FAYETTE, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2009,"title":"Women in Central Virginia Take Action against Poverty\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-01-01","end_date":"1885-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In January of 1876, Hester Tomlin was a troubled woman.  Hester discovered that her husband, Harry Tomlin, Jr. had written a letter to Dr. Cary C. Cocke of Fluvanna County, Virginia in December of the previous year in which he asked to rent a tract of land on Cocke's plantation.  Hester felt impelled to interfere.  A month after Harry wrote the aforementioned letter, Hester wrote an additional note to Dr. Cocke in which she begged him to deny her husband the land.  Hester explained, I hate to see [Harry] undertake anything that will not bring in money. . .for we are very destitute.  Women of the Central Virginia in the 1870's and 1880's felt trepidation when they envisioned a life of poverty; therefore, women played an active role in maintaining or improving their family's welfare.","Hester Tomlin was not the only woman in Central Virginia who feared poverty.  On the contrary, poverty was a salient topic to women across the region, as they contemplated their marriages, both present and future.  On January 30, 1885, Fredericksburg's local paper, <em>Free Lance</em>, printed a story about a woman who chose to marry a wealthy man and secure her economic future instead of marrying the poor man whom she loved.  This story appeared on the front page of the Fredericksburg paper.  In the aftermath of the economic depression of the 1870's, the topic was salient to the women in Central Virginia.  ","Many women in Central Virginia struggled or failed in their attempts to prevent or end their family's battle with poverty.  In Hester Tomlin's letter to Dr. Cocke, she admitted, I am living now on the charity of others and must continue to do so unless I can help myself in some boarding deportment. . .  Hester and other women of the time considered allowing people to live in their home as boarders so that they could earn money.  Yet, as Edward Ayers explains in <em>Southern Crossing</em>, Women [in the South] found exceedingly few opportunities to earn money in the countryside.  However, those who lived in rural areas, such as the farming areas in Central Virginia, could aid in farm labor.  An advertisement in the Fredericksburg newspaper in 1886 requested a farmer with a wife who understands the dairy business to help with the labor. ","Women, like Hester, throughout Virginia and in other southern states improved the economic wellbeing of their families by using a variety of methods for making money during the late nineteenth century, according to Ayers.  Ayers explains that farm women of the late nineteenth century normally produced and mended all of their family members' clothing.  Some women sold items such as butter, eggs, milk, and honey in order help their families earn more money.  Others made a profit by serving as a midwife to neighboring women.  Ayers also describes the vital role that women played as teachers in their communities during this time period.  In fact, Ayers points out that the number of female teachers in the South doubled in the 1880's. ","In the latter half of the nineteenth century, Central Virginians recognized the active role of women like Hester who worked diligently to better their family's financial situation.  On January 28, 1887, the <em>Free Lance</em> of Fredericksburg printed an article entitled They Never Strike that commended women for their hard work.  Yet, secretive or more subtle actions these women undertook in order to secure their family's future were undoubtedly overlooked.  In Hester Tomlin's letter to Dr. Cocke, she opened by admitting that writing the letter carried the great risk that her husband would find out about her interference.  In closing the letter, Hester requested that Dr. Cocke burn the note and never tell anyone about its contents.  Hester was both frantic and fearful. At times, women in Central Virginia acted against the wishes of the men in their lives in an effort to save their families or themselves from the poverty that threatened the families of Central Virginia during this time."],"display_date":"January 1, 1876 - January 30, 1885","search_date":"1880-07-16","locations":[{"id":13822,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2024,"title":"Girl Chooses Death Over Shame\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The majority of farms in Brunswick, Missouri used slave labor up through the Civil War. H.C. Bruce was a slave on one of these farms. Many years after the Civil War, Bruce reflected on his experiences as a slave and recorded them in a book. According to Bruce, slave owners in Brunswick believed in having their slave women live a virtuous life. About nine miles from his farm lived a slaveholder named V. Harper. Harper owned quite a number of slaves, including one particular family that was respected by whites and blacks alike for their moral worth and character. In 1858, one of the daughters in this family, who Bruce described as having clean character, discovered that she would soon become a mother. This girl had not yet married nor was she engaged to a man at that time. Rather than dishonor herself and her family by bearing a child without a husband, she walked two miles to reach the Missouri River, plunged herself into it and was drowned."," During his account of the girl, Bruce acknowledged that it [was] not known who led her from the paths of rectitude. He also admitted however, that there would occasionally be a black mother with a very light-colored child. Bruce's diction suggests the slave was impregnated by her master. At that time, slaves were not considered as people, but rather as property. As property, slave owners often treated their slaves as they wished. Historian Joshua Rothman suggests, sexual contact between masters and slaves specifically and whites and blacks generally was commonplace in Virginia and in all slaveholding states. Because relationships between masters and their slaves were common in the antebellum South, it was reasonable that Bruce suggested such a relationship between the girl and her master. "," There are a few reasons why the girl in Bruce's account would have had sexual relations with her master. It was not uncommon in the antebellum South for a master to rape a female slave. As Rothman argues, a black woman's body was her greatest vulnerability. Rape was an effective weapon that slaveholders used to physically and mentally degrade their slaves. It was also a means to assert a racial hierarchy. Second, there were some instances where a slave woman would exchange sexual relations for preferential treatment on the plantation. However, the fact that the nineteen-year old girl drowned herself suggests that she probably did not engage in a sexual relationship to obtain preferential treatment on the farm. "," Though rape was not uncommon between master and slave, Bruce made it clear that slaves considered the action an attack on their honor and morality. Bruce stated that the girl decided that death was preferable in her case to disgrace. Rothman argues that in the antebellum South, a woman's honor resided in her sexual purity. The girl in Bruce's account realized that her pregnancy would bring shame to herself and her family. Instead of giving birth to her master's child, the girl decided to kill herself. With this action, she attempted to salvage as much of her honor and morality as she could."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":7480,"lat":39.5145426187,"lng":-92.9626052094,"zoom":9,"place":"CHARITON, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2027,"title":"Reverend Jackson Proscribes Church Code for Moral Conduct\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-04-27","end_date":"1869-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Reverend J. Edward Jackson woke up tired on the morning of April 27, 1869. He had been traveling the country for eight years preaching in Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri and South Carolina. Evangelicalism stressed the importance in traveling from place to place to spread the good news of the Bible. That morning he gave a sermon on heavenly mindedness at the Church of the Holy Communion in St. Louis, Missouri. In this sermon, Reverend Jackson urged listeners to live a moral life and remain in the good grace of God. Jackson spoke of bowels of mercy, where people should willingly give to the poor and needy. In such acts of kindness, he continued, one should be clothed with humility. Jackson also spoke directly to the women in attendance, and suggested they adorn themselves in modest apparel and sobriety, not with broidered hair or gold or pearls or costly array. Good works, he argued, should be used as a [substitute] for the vanity of outward ornaments. Jackson finished his sermon by reflecting on those who spoke out against missionaries. Those people could tolerate zeal in business, learning, and the arts and sciences, but not in religion. Only if the preachers were moderate and [kept] it to themselves did they have no objection.","Reverend Jackson was one of the hundreds of preachers who traveled across the nation following the Second Great Awakening. Historian William Lee Miller argues one of the great results of the Second Great Awakening was reaching out to the newly settled West, where those 'unchurched' folk were available to be 'churched', or at least 'saved.' While Missouri was not a newly settled territory in 1869, it still had many towns and cities that lacked a Christian presence. Historian Perry McCandless explains that traveling preachers were pivotal in the religious life in areas like Missouri because of the state's sparse and scattered population. By traveling and converting new areas of the state to evangelicalism, new churches developed throughout the state. Data collected in <em>A History of Missouri: Vol. II</em> shows nearly a two-fold increase from 880 churches in 1850 to almost 1,600 churches in 1860."," In his sermon, Reverend Jackson supported the idea of perfectionism, where society was capable of infinite improvement. McCandless points out, Ministers and other intensely religious-minded people viewed Missouri's early society as being overrun with drunkenness, gambling, fighting, general disorder... Jackson believed he could help shape the morals and code of conduct in Missouri and other states through his sermons. While Reverend Jackson stressed universal sin and the importance of meekness, mercy, piety, and good works, he said that he does not ask these questions to discourage, but to provoke [them] to good works. He challenged his listeners to avoid the worldly activities that led to sin. Rather, he argued they should remain meek, humble, and look to serve mankind to the best of their ability. "," The church worked to regulate the moral conduct of Missourians. Reverend Jackson pointed out however, that some people did not appreciate the church's attempt to impose their moral code on the public. Despite such opposition, evangelicals continued to play a large role in religion throughout the South. Jackson continued to preach to areas throughout the nation until 1894."],"display_date":"April 27, 1869","search_date":"1869-04-27","locations":[{"id":7918,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2032,"title":"A Soldier&#39;s View of the Role of Women in the Civil War Effort\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-13","end_date":"1865-02-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Charles James lived in Missouri but fought for the Confederate army in Virginia during the Civil War. In a letter to his sister on February 13, 1865, he discussed the problem the Confederate Army had with absentees and deserters at the beginning of 1865. In an attempt to coax these soldiers back into the army, James stated that General Lee [issued] a general order granting amnesty to all who will within twenty days from the publication of said order report to their commands... The Confederacy had offered amnesty to deserters before, but James stressed this was their last opportunity to avoid the punishment which they deserve. Even though James stated these soldiers left when the army and the people were depressed in spirits, he also blamed women and the allurements of home, as reasons why soldiers left their post. While James placed part of the blame on women, he also added women of the confederacy [had] the power, if they [had] the will and determination, to save the country. It was the women's role to lead the Confederate soldiers away from the pleasantries of grand balls and home life. If they [did] this, James argued, 1865 [would] be the last year of the war."," Charles James kept his sister informed of the state of the Confederate army while he was in Virginia. These letters were the only way that his sister could follow the fighting. According to historian Edwin C. McReynolds, the fighting had ended in Missouri in November 1864. In his February 13, 1865 letter, James clearly stated the role Virginia women should have played during the Civil War. It was their duty, he argued, to put pressure on Confederate soldiers to resist the temptation to remain in their home. Historian George Rable claims, Women had to shame these cowards into doing their duty. James's sister would have been surprised to hear the extent Confederate women contributed to the war. Women in Missouri played a much larger role in fighting for the Confederacy than in Virginia. In his essay Women and Guerrilla Warfare, historian Michael Fellmen argues that Missouri saw the most intense guerilla fighting of the war. Women played an active part in this warfare, both as participants and as victims. They made both verbal and physical attacks against Union soldiers. "," Charles James said women had the opportunity to prove themselves equal during the Civil War. While James implied that this would happen if women focused on preventing deserters, women expanded their role in other areas as well. Historians Eric Foner and Olivia Mahoney claim that while the men were off fighting the war, women played a larger role in managing the plantation, slaves, and participated in other professions previously limited to men. Because there were great casualties for both sides during the war, these women were often forced to continue these new roles at the conclusion of the war. Historian Anne Firor Scott argues that the experience women gained during the Civil War opened doors for women who put their newly acquired skills to good use. James predicted 1865 [would] be the last year of the war.

The exploits of these Northern armies quickly became propaganda for Southern newspapers. The Milledgeville, Georgia Southern Recorder, hearing of the Union capture of Barnwell, South Carolina, reprinted a sensational letter from its correspondent, The Constitutionalist. The article, full of rhetoric and exaggeration, recounts Union troops bursting into homes, where the privacy of ladies apartments...was not respected while searching for gold and valuables. After stealing everything worth taking, the troops spoiled the remaining food, assisted throughout by the faithlessness of negroes. The Recorder quotes the men as saying, We cannot whip your men and are determined to make the women and children suffer. After burning much of the town to the ground, General Kilpatrick arrived and put a stop to the attack, though the Recorder's letter insists that he gave secret orders to burn the town after dark.","Sherman's march through Georgia and the Carolinas focused on destroying infrastructure and demoralizing Confederate troops. With most of the Southern armies in Tennessee and Virginia, Sherman faced few troops until near the end of the march. In the meantime, he burned and pillaged his way through the heart of the South, focusing special attention on South Carolina, first to secede and thus a potent symbol. Before General Sherman began his march through South Carolina, he received a telegram from Chief of Staff Halleck noting that he hoped that upon Charleston, South Carolina's fall, by some accident the place may be destroyed, and if a little salt should be sown upon its site it may prevent the growth of future crops of nullification and secession. Barnwell was not a particularly important county for the war effort, lacking major cities, fantastic wealth or even a particularly large population. It, like much of South Carolina, was burned as an example to the South as a whole.","     Historians have long debated the role that public morale played in the conclusion of the Civil War. Through articles such as the Constitutionalist's, the Confederate press attempted to turn Sherman's efforts at demoralization into public resolve to continue fighting. The Confederate government, through limited censorship and influence, used the press throughout the war as a tool for propping up continually-declining public morale. The letter reprinted in the Southern Recorder has the subtlety of a lead brick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, most of the Confederate press' efforts at morale-building were ultimately unsuccessful. While the importance of public morale in ending the war remains open for debate, this loss of popular confidence was certainly a serious problem for the South by 1865."],"display_date":"March 1, 1865 - March 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-03-15","locations":[{"id":11438,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2052,"title":"The New Teacher&#39;s Institute\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-10-21","end_date":"1886-10-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In Warsaw, Superintendent Robert Hall called a meeting for the new teachers of the Northern Neck Peninsula. The teachers needed to talk about the best way to educate the hundreds of students entering the new public school system. Reverend A. B. Kinsolving opened the session by leading prayers. Mr. Hall began the discussion by encouraging the teachers to express their candid views on each topic covered over the course of the day. The first topic was whether teachers should allow whispering and talking during class. One young woman delivered an emphatic speech about the dangers of tolerating this behavior. Since everyone unanimously agreed on this issue, the group proceeded to the next topic: corporal punishment. There was a lively and animated debate. Since no consensus was reached, the teachers decided to postpone this discussion. They next talked about the best ways to teach reading, writing, arithmetic, and other subjects. The body reached an agreement much more quickly on these issues, finishing just in time for lunch.","Few people were familiar with public schools in the 1880s, especially in rural regions like Virginia's Eastern Shore. If they could afford it, parents sent their children to expensive private schools at remote distances. However, nearby Accomack County had opened eight local public schools by 1886, and Richmond County wanted to close the gap. Taxpayers provided 1.126 per child for schools in the Northern Neck, inequitably distributed between white and black schools. Many people wanted to increase this funding for religious reasons. While the teachers disagreed about corporal punishment, everyone at the Institute understood the important role Christian principles would have in the budding school system. Accordingly, the Institute opened its session with a prayer led by the local Reverend. As early as 1875, concerned citizens held concerts of prayer to recognize the importance of studying the Scriptures in all of [the] schools.

Christmas was a time to spend with family, both close and distant. Mary Fitzhugh had moved to Richmond almost two months ago, and it was too great a distance for her to make the trip. In a letter, Lizzie Fitzhugh wrote to her sister: So many young cousins are assembling to-getther, at first one house and then the other. Most visitors stayed for many days, since family gatherings happened only a few times each year. Saturday was Christmas, and the celebration began with a visit to the huge Christmas tree outside the Fitzhughs' home. While the adults laughed and talked, the children rushed to the presents underneath the tree. Willie, Oscar, and Edward, Lizzie's brothers, received Roam candles, candy, and nuts. Bessie and Fannie, Lizzie's younger sisters, combed the hair on their new dollbabies. Brother Frank received a little wagon and horse.","Everyone knew that Christmas was truly a celebration of the birth of Jesus. On Sunday night, all of the family listened to Mr. Boggs preach at the church down the street. On Tuesday night, Lizzie went to a dance at the Mr. Moyer's house. She writes, there was such a crowd of strangers that all of us got two of the fiddlers and went in the dining room, where we had a very nice time. The parlor was crowded. But there was a young man who caught her eye, Lizzie tells her sister. She danced with Tom that night, even though she dared not sit with him on the sofa in the parlor.","Christmas was an opportunity for the Fitzhughs to meet and socialize with family and friends who were ordinarily separated by the difficulties of traveling. The distances between family members were not long by modern standards. However, traveling by horse made even these trips impractical unless it was a special occasion. Even though Richmond was less than 70 miles away from the Fitzhugh home, Mary still could not attend the celebrations. Railroads greatly accelerated the speed of travel, but rural areas such as Virginia's Eastern Shore had to depend on horses or private sailing vessels. In fact, the first railroad to reach the Eastern Shore only opened in 1884, running to Cape Charles. For most of the rest of the year, family members could only communicate through letters like those Lizzie wrote to her sister."],"display_date":"December 24, 1888","search_date":"1888-12-24","locations":[{"id":13919,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2059,"title":"The Gallant Knight of Hereford\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-09-05","end_date":"1878-09-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 5, 1878, Richard Hereford represented Prince George's County in a jousting tournament. The sixteen knights, clad in armor and flashing colors, paraded the streets of Baltimore before the event. Long lines of fancy barouches followed the men and their steeds. A brass band heralded the knights as they passed the judges' stand. Each knight had a preliminary ride, but then the contest began. At stake were a gold watch with chain and a pair of Smith & Wesson's improved revolvers, but the Knight of Hereford rode to win the honor of crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty.","Sir Hereford clipped eight of nine rings during his first three runs, but the riding was particularly strong in this tournament. In the fourth tiebreaking round, the three rings were a mere inch and a quarter wide. As he prepared for his run, Hereford tried to act cavalierly: a knight's demeanor reflected on himself, his county, and his state. The trumpets [blew] out a challenge, the drummer [gave] a scientific trill, and the Chief Marshall called out in a booming voice, Charge Sir Knight The heralds echoed, and Sir Hereford thundered down the 90 yard track. In full gallop, he poised his lance. He neatly clipped the first two rings, but just missed the third. The crowd cheered as the trumpets blared triumphantly. A pair of pages escorted the Knight past the judges. The ladies in the stand waved their handkerchiefs. It was not enough to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, but the joust was still a success for any knight who conducted himself with gallant bearing, majestic mien, and superior horsemanship.","After the Civil War, Maryland's image had deteriorated in the eyes of many southerners, who accused Marylanders of being submissionists to northern oppression. The joust became popular in southern Maryland because many Marylanders wanted to redeem their identity as southerners. In the 1890s, the journalist Hanson Hiss claimed that jousting may be ... the only remaining relic of that romantic and picturesque age which has furnished the bards of centuries with themes. Marylanders linked this romantic image of jousting with their image of the Old South, and through jousting, they renewed their southern identity. Many Maryland knights chose names like the Knight of the Lost Cause, the Knight of the Sunny South, and the Knight in Grey to show their sympathy for the plight of the southern states. Jousts strengthened ties to the South in other ways as well: this joust in Baltimore was used to raise money for yellow fever sufferers in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1878","search_date":"1878-09-05","locations":[{"id":6035,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE GEORGES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2060,"title":"Testimonies at the Turlington Camp\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-08-07","end_date":"1881-08-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Wagons loaded with fried chicken, vegetables, figs, fruits, grapes, cantaloupes, and watermelon crept towards the sea of tents. People also packed carpets, mattresses, plates, bowls, bed linens, lamps, rocking chairs, and even clocks. The annual, week-long, Turlington camp meeting had finally arrived. The big bell tolled, beckoning everyone to the benches. It was quite a congregation: almost 8000 people would attend some portion of the meetings. James Cannon, Jr. from Salisbury, Maryland, sat with this father and listened: the substance of the preaching was the same as ... [his] church back home. There was somewhat more pressure brought to bear upon the church members to bestir themselves to hunt the sinners, and stronger more impassioned appeals to the sinner to forsake their ways and return to God. People jumped and shouted Hallelujah, especially the older white men and blacks who sat in the front of the wooden tabernacle.","The next morning, James rose promptly at 7 a.m. as the big bell clanged. After breakfast, there was a time of prayer. In the two hours of free time that followed, James took the opportunity to meet different families from Virginia's Eastern Shore. At 10, the lovefeast began, with the preacher incessantly calling for another testimony, another testimony James attended religious services at 3 and 7:30. After the little children were tucked in their tents, there was one more evening service. Organ and piano led stirring hymns like Blessed Assurance and What a Friend We Have in Jesus. Despite all the preaching, the camp meetings were a mix of the secular and spiritual. At night, women traded recipes, and young children spent their allowance at the candy stand. Young men and women joined nightly promenades around the grounds. One night, James heard giggling in a girl's tent as he walked by. He entered and found the girls laughing at an old lady in a rocking chair nearby, smoking a pipe. Each time she rocked, her shadow expanded and contracted on the wall of the tent. James wasn't as amused: he explained to the girls that smoking was an evil habit. This was a lecture the girls would not forget for many years.","The original idea of the Turlington Camp Meeting was for Methodists, rich and poor, black and white, to leave the comforts of their normal lives for a time of rededication to Jesus Christ. Early on, there was dramatic revival at the annual meeting. Each year, the meetings grew more and more popular (in 1889, nearly 1,500 people showed up each night). They also became grander, finer, and more institutionalized. In 1876, the church added a wooden tabernacle. In 1891, they added a choir loft. The dresses of the ladies became fancier and fancier, and the expected time for testimonies became shorter and shorter. For the Turlington Camp Methodists, religion became more secular with each passing year. While Christianity declined in spiritual significance for many southerners in the late nineteenth century, other regions of the South still resisted secular influences. In the early years, northern Methodists from Maryland shared in the fellowship at Turlington. While newspapers reported the friendly and brotherly feeling between these groups during the Methodist Centennial Conference in 1884, the situation soured quickly. In 1885, the northern Methodists split from the Turlington Camp, fearing that the original purpose of the meeting had been lost."],"display_date":"August 7, 1881 - August 15, 1881","search_date":"1881-08-11","locations":[{"id":13591,"lat":37.9436744077,"lng":-75.3696408508,"zoom":9,"place":"ACCOMACK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2077,"title":"Women and Temperance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"12/31/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the 1890s, <em>The Voice</em>, a leading newspaper on temperance, raised its concern on a new issue threatening the temperance movement and specifically women. It seemed that people supporting the temperance movement had overlooked another venue in which alcohol might have been ingested, which could cause harm. The newspaper warned of the use of alcohol in food preparation, specifically in the pleasant sauces and the dishes of home. It was seen as more dangerous because the use of alcohol in food preparation may not be seen as harmful. It would leave one vulnerable to the evils of alcohol in not recognizing that any ingestion of alcohol would be detrimental to his or her life. The article further delved into the relationship between women and whiskey. It claimed that women and whiskey were natural antagonists. Also, the use of any form led to the destruction of the women's home and family and so the article urged women that it was their duty to refrain from the use of whiskey to save the peace and purity of the home. Finally, the article urged the women of the home to drive out the snake of intemperance. It warned against the use of alcohol for medicinal purposes reporting that physicians claim that whiskey did more damage than the human ill itself.","This article illustrates the shift in focus for the temperance movement in the late nineteenth century. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, temperance based many of its assertions upon explicit biblical texts. The temperance movement during these times made it a religious duty resting upon divine sanctions. Many of the anti-temperance organizations and meetings resembled evangelical prayer meetings, with those that signed pledges to sobriety called converts giving testimony and signing hymns praising temperance. ","The shift in the focus of the temperance movement began as early as the 1840s with the formation of the Washingtonians and fraternal temperance organizations that did not make religion a prominent issue. Also, the formation of the Christian Women's Temperance Union in 1874 and the Anti-Saloon League in 1893 resulted in a shift in the overall structure basis of the temperance movement. These organizations had Protestant tones, but did not rely upon explicit biblical text as the reason for abstinence, but shifted more towards pragmatic reasons, demonstrated in the article above. Reference to the snake of intemperance makes an allusion perhaps to the devil, but the crux of the article against drinking focuses on more practical reasons, such as detriment to one's health. Prior organizations focused upon the moral aspects that surrounded the temperance movement, while later groups focused on legal means to achieve an alcohol free society. With this type of shift, the explicit biblical arguments did not hold much weight in support of temperance."],"display_date":"1890 - 1900","search_date":"1895-07-02","locations":[{"id":14278,"lat":36.8438879121,"lng":-81.53700883,"zoom":9,"place":"SMYTH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2078,"title":"Love Letters from William A.

Moats wrote love letters to Nela Miller. Each letter was structurally similar to the previous, always commenting on his good health and the hope that the letter reached her well. Moat made continually plans to visit her and her family in the months the correspondence took place. As the letters evolved chronologically, his profession of his undying love for Miss Miller becomes stronger and more prominent in his writing. However, Moats had his concerns that his love for Nela Miller was unrequited and continually questioned the deepness of her love for him. Similarly, Nela had expressed the same concern in that he did not love her as much as he had written, but William Moats adamantly wrote that his love for her runs deep. It seemed that the courtship between the young lovers had not occurred over an extended period of time. Moats remarks in one letter that he hopes that he is not being too fast in this short courtship. ","These love letters exemplify the greater courtship rituals that are prevalent throughout this period in southern history. Most of the suitors met their potential wives at social functions, including parties or church events. The man would visit the women he was courting either at home or when great distances were present through love letters, which is the case with William Moats and Nela Miller. Although it is not known from the love letters, most suitors would get the approval of the father before the couple became engaged, which was followed by a small marriage ceremony usually in the bride's parents house. It seems the antebellum period in the south, status in marriage was not as greatly emphasized as prior to the Civil War partly due to the somewhat quieted political upheaval. ","Also, during this time, the judicial system had its hand in the courtship rituals and consequently the sexual behaviors deemed acceptable at the time. This reflects the overall sense of morality expected of young southerns. Every Southern state during this period prohibited fornication to preserve the sanctity of marriage and not to discourage the act of sexual intercourse itself. Many times convictions were upheld when it threatened the institution of marriage, which arose when sexual relations occurred between a married and non-married person or two non-married people were cohabiting. ","The judicial system, through common law, ruled upon cases of seduction, described as a young man promising marriage to gain sexual intercourse, but later abandoning the young girl. In the case of William Moats, if he was found to be seducing Nela Miller in hopes of sexual intercourse and then later abandoning her, Moats would be expected to pay compensation to the father for shame and mortification and the pain and suffering brought to the family. In some states, even the women were able to sue their seducers, not for the sexual act itself, but for the emotional abuse they sustained causing her to be disgraced. Under criminal law, in the late 19th century, seduction could be penalized if there was proof that the man made intentions of marrying the women, which in the case of William Moats, could be found in his correspondence and love letters. ","The love letters from William Moats to Nela Miller could be an example of the acceptable courtship rituals allowed at the time. If Moats and Miller abstained from sexual intercourse until marriage, and if Moats did not deceive Miller into entering into a sexual relationship, then their actions would not be deemed impermissible and would be free of judicial sanctions. However, once that line was crossed and they entered into a sexual relationship, many times the court would intervene, not to stop sexual behavior, but as a commentary upon the acceptable morality of the time."],"display_date":"April - December 1889","search_date":"1889-08-16","locations":[{"id":14761,"lat":38.6807273925,"lng":-79.3508959054,"zoom":9,"place":"PENDLETON, West Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2087,"title":"Ellen Long&#39;s Concern for Newly Freed Slaves \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-05-23","end_date":"1865-05-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Throughout the Civil War, Ellen Call Long had thought that the end of fighting would bring her great relief. However, when fighting did cease and Ms. Long saw the Union flag flying above Florida's capitol building, she instead felt crushed and disappointed.

She wrote, The blacks will be the sufferers, for there is not one in a hundred that knows how to make a living and many must starve and die for the need of the fostering care of their masters. Ms. Long went on to write that black mothers, in particular, were inadequate and habitually careless and neglectful. ","Ellen Long's fear for the immediate future of the slaves was one shared by other Floridians who did not think that blacks knew how to care for themselves without the provisions provided by the white plantations owners. However, blacks were not the only party for whom Long and other southerners expressed concern. They were, more than anything, anxious about how planters would cultivate their crops if they suddenly found themselves without the loyal assistance of slaves. When the war ended, planters throughout Florida assumed that they could retain their slaves for a few years and follow a process of gradual emancipation. The Federal authorities, however, prevented this and as a result, Ms. Long explained, the Southern planters hated the United States with a hatred that cannot be measured. ","The moral issues which Long brought up after the Civil War were not dissimilar from those introduced earlier by white Virginians in response to Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831. Since that time, white Southerners perpetually told themselves that slavery was just and Godly and perhaps even the most beneficial arrangement for the slaves themselves. Historian Melvin Ely explained that many Southerners believed that blacks would live in a state of civilization only so long as whites ruled and guided them.

GREAT REDUCTION IN CHARGES the ad announced, continuing with a brief description of the oldest Female College in the Southwest. Favorably located, easy of access and remarkable for its healthfulness. Thoroughly furnished in all of its departments and supplied with a large corps of competent teachers. "," The fervor with which Mr. Jones sought pupils for his women's academy reflected the competition of the market. His particular ad, for example, was just one of half a dozen such announcements for women's colleges in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky run in that particular day's paper alone. In the years after the war, higher education for middle class white women became more commonplace in southern cities, and as a result, educated and socially conscious women began to assert themselves in communities across the South."," According to historian Marsha Wedell, the beginnings of social movements among middle class white women were well in place in Memphis by the end of the 1870s. Not only were the women organizing, but they were doing so in meaningful ways with significant impact on their surroundings. According to Wedell, these women of Memphis adopted a wide range of urban issues as their personal duties, and succeeded in focusing the attention of the community on the appalling living and working conditions of many of the city's residents. Their work in initiating efforts to address such conditions contributed significantly to the eventual recognition by the city of its responsibility to provide municipal welfare and social services for its citizens. "," As women fought to change their surroundings, they found themselves and their own relationships changed as well by their fight. Groups such as the Nineteenth Century Club, an all women social club formed in Memphis in the spring of 1890 with the purpose of encouraging women to socialize and study together, brought their members out of their homes and into a public sphere where they could interact with one another in a network of support and activism. It was these women - in many cases the daughters of mothers who had held their families together through the trials of the Civil War - who were products of schools like the Memphis Conference Female Institute and the harbingers of a new role for women as a new century approached."],"display_date":"September 2, 1878","search_date":"1878-09-02","locations":[{"id":12370,"lat":35.182488505,"lng":-89.8964012565,"zoom":9,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2100,"title":"The Great Democratic Procession\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-06-26","end_date":"1875-06-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the summer of 1875, Jane Pryor of Vicksburg, Mississippi wrote a warm letter to Caroline Kiger of Warren County in anticipation of the coming week's political events. Encouraging Mrs. Kiger's husband to come to Vicksburg, Pryor wrote: tell him to try and be here 24th in the Great Democratic procession at 6 o'clock in the afternoon that will be tomorrow & we will show him the elegant Democracy of our town. "," Pryor was not alone in her admiration of the growing Democratic party, a group that was evolving during the 1870s into a political class known as Bourbon Democrats for their aristocratic white backgrounds and policies. As historian Ed Ayers notes, Democrats regained control from Radical Republican reconstructionists in 1876, or the election year following Pryor's 1875 letter. Reconstruction was led by a loathed coalition succinctly described by southern political historian Monroe Billington as Yankee carpetbaggers, southern scalawags, and blacks - in other words, former Union soldiers or citizens who had moved South after the war, the former Confederates who cooperated with them, and worst of all, former slaves. "," As its finally regained power, the Democratic party inspired pride in Jane Pryor and many of her position in white society. Ayers alludes to this sense: Many of the Redeemer Democrats bore impressive pedigrees and could claim distinguished service in the Confederacy. In counties and states across the South white veterans with education and property stepped forward to seize the power they considered rightfully theirs. Under democratic rule, they promised, political bloodshed would cease, race relations would calm, the economy would flourish, and honor in government would prevail. These promises struck a chord with whites like Pryor, who tired not only of the shame of being governed by their former military foes and slaves but also of the violent backlash and sense of lawlessness that came from groups outside the electoral process like the Ku Klux Klan. "," These Democrats postured as the defenders of an old South way of life. Democratic politicians called themselves Redeemers, emphasizing their role in reclaiming the South from the humiliation of not only the Civil War, but of the Republican Reconstruction as well. Their background and breeding represented the best, in the minds of many white Southerners, of a genteel and honorable past, and their platform emphasized a return to a way of life longed for by these sort of voters.

Encouraging Mrs. Kiger's husband to come to Vicksburg, Pryor wrote: tell him to try and be here 24th in the Great Democratic procession at 6 o'clock in the afternoon that will be tomorrow & we will show him the elegant Democracy of our town. "," Pryor was not alone in her admiration of the growing Democratic party, a group that was evolving during the 1870s into a political class known as Bourbon Democrats for their aristocratic white backgrounds and policies. As historian Ed Ayers notes, Democrats regained control from Radical Republican reconstructionists in 1876, or the election year following Pryor's 1875 letter. Reconstruction was led by a loathed coalition succinctly described by southern political historian Monroe Billington as Yankee carpetbaggers, southern scalawags, and blacks - in other words, former Union soldiers or citizens who had moved South after the war, the former Confederates who cooperated with them, and worst of all, former slaves. "," As its finally regained power, the Democratic party inspired pride in Jane Pryor and many of her position in white society. Ayers alludes to this sense: Many of the Redeemer Democrats bore impressive pedigrees and could claim distinguished service in the Confederacy. In counties and states across the South white veterans with education and property stepped forward to seize the power they considered rightfully theirs. Under democratic rule, they promised, political bloodshed would cease, race relations would calm, the economy would flourish, and honor in government would prevail. These promises struck a chord with whites like Pryor, who tired not only of the shame of being governed by their former military foes and slaves but also of the violent backlash and sense of lawlessness that came from groups outside the electoral process like the Ku Klux Klan. "," These Democrats postured as the defenders of an old South way of life. Democratic politicians called themselves Redeemers, emphasizing their role in reclaiming the South from the humiliation of not only the Civil War, but of the Republican Reconstruction as well. Their background and breeding represented the best, in the minds of many white Southerners, of a genteel and honorable past, and their platform emphasized a return to a way of life longed for by these sort of voters.

The Randolphs of Richmond were one such family. In 1830, William Randolph and his clan maintained several houses and a handful of slaves across the state, living prosperously in the antebellum Virginia. Judging by records left behind, Randolph provided very well for his family, feeding, clothing, and educating them according to the standards of a wealthy southern patriarch.  ","One of Randolph's daughters, Elizabeth, received the same upper-class Southern education given to most wealthy females at the time. While her father was away from home, Elizabeth's schedule was packed with music, drawing, and sewing lessons taught by a private tutor. I have just finished taking my Music lesson, and Mr. Barry thinks I have improved a little, she wrote her father. I have practiced more than usual lately. This routine of music lessons, drawing, and other instruction expected of an antebellum housewife was standard fare for wealthy girls in the process of receiving their training. Rarely did girls get the kind of classical education in philosophy, history, and the sciences that their male counterparts received. Still, at the time Elizabeth wrote in the 1830's, women's education in the South was beginning to undergo a profound change - one that would make her form of schooling obsolete.","     Immediately after the Revolutionary War, female education was valued very highly. Educational reforms at the time favored higher education for women in order to prepare them to become republican mothers and pass on classical schooling to their children. After a time, however, that sentiment began to decline. In the antebellum South, classics and philosophy were increasingly replaced by drawing and embroidery. Higher education for women would not regain its former popularity until the 1850's when a new wave of reform swept over the South. Elizabeth Randolph, forced to study music and sewing instead of Plato, was the product of a Southern culture that failed to see classical education and domestic training as compatible. It was very common, even expected, for wealthy fathers like William Randolph to train their daughters as housewives instead of intellectuals."],"display_date":"August 24, 1830","search_date":"1830-08-24","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2138,"title":"Adoption of an Ordinance in Marietta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-02-13","end_date":"1852-02-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Jenny, an African American woman residing in Marietta, Georgia, desperately wanted to move. In 1852, the local government of Marietta passed an ordinance against negroes hiring out their own time or living on lots to themselves. This new law was greatly at odds with Jenny's current living situation. Jenny believed that under the law she would no longer prosper at her current residence. Faced with these unfavorable circumstances, she traveled to Atlanta to see if her options there would be any better. In the city, she encountered a certain Mr. Jeremiah who agreed to take her in on his lot and protect her. To determine whether or not Jenny could take this course of action, Andrew J. Hansell sent a letter to Farish Carter asking for him to approve of her removal to Atlanta.","What remains unclear in this episode is the status of Jenny, the African American woman who desired to relocate. It seems as if Jenny's lifestyle had been seriously affected on account of the passage of Marietta's ordinance. Her displeasure with the new law indicates that she was either hiring herself out for work or living on a lot to herself. Considering these factors, one might conclude that Jenny was a free black. However, the letter sent from Hansell to Carter requesting approval for Jenny to move to Atlanta implied that Jenny was not free to make decisions concerning her place of residence. This letter also mentioned that Jenny would have to return home if she was not permitted to move to Atlanta. The use of the word <em>home</em> indicated that her inhabitance of the dwelling in Marietta was only temporary. ","This incident shows the types of measures local governments in the Antebellum South took to deprive African Americans of what little freedom they had left to enjoy. Due to the passage of Marietta's ordinance, a free black community, like that of Israel Hill in Virginia that historian Melvin Ely describes in his book <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, would never be realized in Cobb County. On Israel Hill, free blacks were permitted to live independently and hire themselves out as laborers. Ely does note, however, that as the issue of slavery grew on the federal level in the 1850's, whites tried once again to reduce the status of free blacks down to a level very close to slavery. It is quite possible that this retrogression of attitudes towards slavery was what the slaves and free blacks of Marietta saw with the passage of the Ordinance in the early 1850's.

An enslaved African American woman of Polk County, Tennessee put an end to the lives of her children and then took her own life one September night in 1852. Authorities confirmed that the woman killed all four of her children by slitting their throats while they slept. After the gruesome deed had been carried out, she too ended her life in the same manner. When questioned about the possible basis for the woman's actions, the slave's master, George M. Garrison, alluded to the possibility that the woman may have overheard him discussing the potential sale of herself and two of her children while keeping the others in his possession. Beyond this, the owner could think of no other impetus for such an act.","Only the woman ever knew for certain the rationale which drove her to take her own life and the lives of her four children. The insinuation of her master, however, that the slave woman had knowledge of his intent to break apart her family, offers valuable insight. When viewed from this vantage point, it appears that for this mother, the possibility of a life without all of her children was just too much for her to bear. It is probable that after overhearing her master's plans to divide her family, the woman decided that ending the lives of her entire family would be less painful than separation. Based upon this speculation, it can be inferred that this heart wrenching act was committed out of desperation. ","This incident underscores the adverse impacts that the slave trade had on the African American family. The breaking up of families was not at all uncommon in the Antebellum South. Husbands and wives, parents and children were all constantly faced with the threat of separation. In his book <em>Soul by Soul</em>, historian Walter Johnson claims that 50 percent of interstate slave trades tore apart nuclear families and therefore, the strength of family ties was never certain. Through examples similar to the episode above, Johnson argues that self destruction or the threat of self destruction was a common method utilized to avoid trade. According to Johnson, these instances portrayed the dark side of slave trade and served as a foundation for its opposition. In effect, this tragic account along with many others brought to light the horrors of slavery. In the bigger picture this increased awareness spawned anti-slavery reactions and eventually influenced the American abolitionist movement."],"display_date":"September 1852","search_date":"1852-09-15","locations":[{"id":12302,"lat":35.1199101303,"lng":-84.5233135097,"zoom":10,"place":"POLK, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2182,"title":"Albemarle Women Hold a Fair for Colonization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-05-14","end_date":"1830-06-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 14, 1830, after months of anticipation, <em>The Virginia Advocate</em> celebrated the triumph of a grand fair held in aid of the American Colonization Society by the Female Association of Albemarle County.  The newspaper proudly proclaimed that it went off with a success, which we believe has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations of its friends.  Despite the heat of the day the decorated hall attracted great crowds with its cool refreshments and informative exhibits about colonization. Although the paper did not report the total amount of money raised, it praised the women's philanthropic motives to help black colonists overcome the disease, famine, and...hostility...[that] threaten [a new colony's] feeble and precarious existence.","This altruistic effort by women was not unusual in the antebellum South; women commonly managed associations for the sick and poor, but it was their desire to assist free blacks that distinguished these women from later women of Virginia.  The women of the Female Association of Albemarle County were largely upper class women who lived in a slave-based society and yet, because of their fear of violence and desire for missionary activity, they staunchly supported colonization when they might have considered themselves above such a concern.","The recent slave rebellions led by Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Denmark Vesey in 1822, and Nat Turner in 1831 were only too recent in the minds of southerners and had generated great social fear, particularly for Virginians.  In these revolts, slaves had revolted against the rule of their white masters and free blacks had violated the privilege of their freedom, labeling themselves as a threatening group of people who endangered the property of the South. The violence of these revolts particularly endangered white women and children who had been among some of the blacks' first victims.  As an act of self-defense therefore, Albemarle County's women joined in the intensified protests on behalf of African colonization to reduce the unnecessary and dangerous amount of blacks in the South.","Other Virginian women hoped that colonization would spread Christianity in Africa. The women of Albemarle specifically praised the American Colonization Society for its desire to plant a germ of christianity and civilization, which will spring up to bless Africa, whose fruit will sustain the principles of Liberty in unborn generations.  As Robert Johnson, Jr. discusses, these women, along with many other southerners, credited slavery as the institution that had introduced Christianity to blacks; for this reason, they hoped that the free blacks who emerged from the system of slavery as Christian, civilized beings could spread these virtues to all of Africa.","On June 1, 1830, only a few weeks later, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>published a brief letter addressed to The Reverend Mr. Gurley of the American Colonization Society concerning the funds raised from the Albemarle County fair.  The Female Association offered the Reverend a gift of 500 dollars to aid the Colonization Society and requested that a lien be retained on the funds contributed by this association, by which, at any future period, any free people of color from this county, who may wish to go to Liberia, shall have the precedence of all others in any embarkation, at least to the full amount of the funds contributed by this association.  The <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported this news because the state of Virginia had one of the largest networks of colonization chapters in the United States and many would have been encouraged by their efforts.","Other states would have also been interested because during this era similar support for colonization was prevalent throughout the South.  Johnson contends that while some in the South displayed a genuine humanitarian concern for the well-being of blacks, the majority of southerners advocated colonization on account of their fear of black rebellion, the uncertainty concerning the future of free blacks, and the lagging economy. In Johnson's view the South believed colonization would protect the value of the slave property and remove those Africans who were an economic drain upon the plantation system. Thus, the American Colonization Society became a popular cause in the South but for a variety of different motives."],"display_date":"May 14, 1830 - June 1, 1830","search_date":"1830-05-23","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2183,"title":"The Romance of Love Letters between Albemarle and Richmond, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-08-26","end_date":"1844-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the late summer and fall of 1844, B. Johnson Barbour and Caroline H. Watson had little else on their minds than what the next post would bring as they anticipated November 7 - the day when they would finally be united as husband and wife.  The distance that separated the young couple heightened their anticipation, for Caroline lived in Richmond while Barbour lived in the rural county of Albemarle, northwest of the state capital.  To overcome this hardship, Barbour and Caroline relied on letters to remain intimate and plan for their future.  While Barbour's visits to his betrothed were carefully chaperoned or in the presence of social parties, he took advantage of the private nature of letters to express some of his deeper feelings for Caroline and establish a closer relationship.  Barbour shed any shyness he may have had and wrote explicitly of his love, even employing poetry and metaphor to describe to Caroline his anticipation of the day when You have promised to resign, One half of that dear name, And thenceforth own no other, Name but mine. Despite his zealous love, Barbour never violated the rigid expectations of decorum and addressed his letters to Miss Caroline H. Watson, not daring to refer to her by her Christian name until only a few days before their marriage when he wrote, As this is the last letter I may write you before our union I beg leave to salute you as - My Dear Caroline.","Barbour was not entirely sentimental, however, and also wrote practically to plan for their future. Concerned about how Caroline would adjust to a country life, he warned his future wife that she might have to face the dullness, the tedium, the monotony of country life and renounce the busy, alluring society of Richmond.  Albemarle County, as a largely agrarian county, differed greatly from the colorful excitement of Richmond and was clearly a concern for the future groom.  He worried if a lady of her social status could truly adapt to become the happy wife of a country gentleman - an apprehension common to brides as well.  In marrying Barbour, Caroline was sacrificing her social life, friends, and family to move to Albemarle and lead a largely quieter life despite Barbour's insistence that it was social enough for all of its inhabitants. Barbour assured his betrothed however, that they would overcome those trials with their love. ","As opposed to couples on the frontier or in a less developed area of the south, Melinda S. Buza notes that Virginian couples such as Barbour and Caroline were fortunate that the commonwealth had a fixed system of roads to allow for travel and mail by the time of their romance.  Regular written correspondence, Buza argues, allowed for Virginians to distinguish themselves from other engaged couples in the antebellum South because it provided them with the opportunity to establish intimacy and love within the South's rigid social system. ","Adhering to the propriety demanded in southern society, Brenda Stevenson observes that courtship involved a series of intricate social expectations and conformities for all concerned parties. Barbour's mother, Mrs. Lucy Barbour, felt inclined to extend a proper welcome to Caroline, assuring her of her son's wonderful qualities and of her confidence in the couple's future happiness. Parents like Mrs. Barbour tended to be proactively involved within their children's future marriages as they hoped to find companions of compatible character, solid education, moral standing, and economic stability to advance their family's own social standing and reputation.  Many historians have consequently questioned if love was a true facet of antebellum courtship and marriage or the institution became solely an instrument of social and economic improvement.  Virginia, however, appears to have allowed for a greater degree of love within the personal advancement associate with marriage; Lucy Barbour's desired to be involved in the courtships affairs of her son, not primarily as a schemer of economic gain, but as a guardian of his happiness in finding true love with Caroline.  While other southern couples were restricted by the existing social norms, Buza argues that the roles of Southern lady and male patriarch clearly did not hinder the development of deep bonds between many husbands and wives. Buza holds that due to greater access to mail and a growing emphasis on love, nineteenth century Virginia was one of the earlier states to witness real romantic love between husbands and wives of the South."],"display_date":"August 26, 1844 - October 30, 1844","search_date":"1844-09-27","locations":[{"id":13596,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2188,"title":"Eugene Davis&#39; Appeal for Temperance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-10-23","end_date":"1842-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On October 23, 1842, Eugene Davis wrote a draft of a speech advocating temperance in Albemarle County.  While in the North many cities had embraced the temperance movement, in the South, country counties like Albemarle led the way for social and moral reform.  Evangelical congregations and women in particular expected the temperance movement to solve common social vices and fashion a society rooted in a moral tradition. Davis, truly believing in the positive results of temperance, called upon the people of Albemarle County to promote the common good [,]... to reduce an enemy whose ravages tell fearfully upon our national prosperity [,]...to rescue our national character... [, and] to redeem our national honor from the tarnish of taking rank with the...most drunken people in the world.","Many historians have defined the temperance movement as a reaction against the threat alcohol posed to the family and the evangelical church movement.  Alcohol not only wasted money that could have been used to support the family but it encouraged unacceptable habits and behavior that threatened the morality of the family.  Moreover, prominent leaders of the Second Great Awakening supported the temperance movement as part of the moral and spiritual reformation continuing among the rural South during this period. As historian Ted Ownby observes, this newfound evangelical fervor often found itself at odds with an essential part of southern culture - male honor and recreation.  Drinking and debauchery were present in almost every male activity: sporting events, social engagements, and even in the workplace.  Because of the pervasiveness of alcohol, temperance advocates worried that drinking among men encouraged a loss of self-control and restraint - two essential standards of the evangelical church and southern culture in general.  In Ownby's opinion southern men neither wanted to live outside of the all-encompassing evangelical community nor to abandon the alcohol and belligerence that defined their male identity. Their desire for compromise however proved impossible because the regional revival meetings of the evangelical church encouraged local populations to uphold an ideal of upright behavior and remain unyielding to forms of social excess.  In Ownby's words this demonstrated ever more clearly the ever-present tension between evangelical self-control and the aggressiveness of the masculine world. ","        To combat the threats posed by a culture submerged in alcohol, Davis encouraged the citizens of Albemarle County to set an example by taking a two-part abstinence pledge in which members vowed they would first themselves abstain from the use of all intoxicating liquors and second, that they would discourage the use of them by others.  By this oath, Davis believed that their community would exorcise the demon of intemperance [,] allay the devouring thirst and still the raging passions which had hitherto defied control.  He assured people that an oath of temperance would transform filthy rags into decent clothing and instill Christian morality within their society.  ","Southerners believed that this type of moral transformation would in turn positively reform all sinful areas of the southern male culture.  Prostitution and gambling were almost inherently linked with alcohol and by ending or limiting the occasion to drink temperance advocates hoped the South would be cleansed of these other vile institutions.  Bertram Wyatt-Brown notes that eventually, the temperance movement's public appeal for moderation hardened into Victorian repressiveness that struck many southerners as too severe. This extremist view irked some southerners and an opposition movement arose in the South proclaiming that temperance infringed upon individual liberties.  They resented the religious doctrines the temperance movement used to further its arguments and the subtle ways in which it attempted to force its views upon the South.  Thus, while Eugene Davis' speech rang of a genuine belief that temperance was the only way to revive the moral traditions of the South, Albemarle County would have been divided in its reaction because of the controversial social implications of his message."],"display_date":"October 23, 1842 - December 31, 1842","search_date":"1842-11-26","locations":[{"id":13596,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2207,"title":"Fighting in the Schoolyard\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-01-10","end_date":"1873-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The schoolyard of the Colored Academy at Pine River was alive with excitement on the afternoon of the tenth of January, 1873. George Green, a sturdy young man of around eighteen years, attempted to kiss the little bronze beauty Roberta. When Professor Thomas Henaforth discovered what had transpired outside of his school, he set out to punish the mischievous youth. At four o'clock in the afternoon, the Professor found Green and hit him over the head with a heavy cudgel, inflicting several open, bleeding wounds. The battle seemed to be a clear victory for the Professor until later that day when Green attacked him as he exited the building. Green triumphed in this round, beating Professor Henaforth until he yelled Nuff.","R. E. Porter, the Staunton Spectator's editor, drew four conclusions from this incident. Young darkies should take care in their efforts to kiss girls at school, as only the professors may claim this benefit. Schoolteachers should mind how they try to discipline the older male students since the stronger will win out in the battle. Women are responsible for all disobedience as they lead others into temptation. Finally, Porter suggested that if it had been a white professor assaulting a black student the incident would have gained much greater publicity, but since it occurred among individuals of the same race, it is not as notable."," Implicated in this incident are the state of the school systems in the Reconstruction South and the quality and character of race relations. The historian Eric Foner describes how public education collapsed during the Reconstruction as a result of widespread tax cuts, sinking to the point that a state governor considered it a luxury. Black students endured the worst of this educational ruin, but their situation was markedly better than it had been during slavery when education was altogether forbidden. The difference in the quality of education and the creation of a Colored Academy to separate the races revealed the tension between the black and white populations. The language used by Porter to describe those involved in the fight supports Foner's argument for the beginnings of the system of racial subordination, especially in Porter's description of Green as the brawny young Buck whose muscles have been developed at the plough handle and the anvil. White southerners still saw African Americans in terms of their roles during slavery, despite the new constitutional amendments guaranteeing equal rights. Although positioned as a professor at an educational institution, Porter impugned Henaforth's qualifications by suggesting sexual relations between a teacher and his students and placing Henaforth's title in quotations (Professor). Though the fifteenth amendment said it must be so, blacks were still not equal to whites in the eyes of the inhabitants of Augusta County."],"display_date":"January 10, 1873","search_date":"1873-01-10","locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2209,"title":"Reverend J.

Reverend Miller was also charged with intentional negligence in his failure to admit the newly baptized adults into Church membership and his failure to require the confirmation of baptismal vows.

Though Reverend Miller's actions were against the rules described in the Constitution, the Synod accepted Miller's explanations as satisfactory. The council and congregation of the Lutheran Church of Staunton were appalled by the decisions of the Synod, which in their opinion stemmed from the failure of the Synod to observe its own rules of procedure, to decide the grave questions involved according to the evidence. So upset were they by this ruling, the council and congregation decided to dissolve their connection with the Virginia Synod on the sixth of June, 1880 with a vote of 59 to 30."," Historian Donald Mathews argues that early believers in Evangelicalism perceived their religion as liberating thousands by raising them from their low positions to the higher planes of sophistication and enlightenment. This same notion of liberty dictated the actions of the Staunton Lutheran Church, reflecting Mathews's argument. Like the American Revolution that promoted independence from governing by an outside party, the southern states at the time of the Civil War encouraged the autonomy of state government from the greater nation. The division of governments that resulted from these quests for greater liberty demonstrated why the Staunton church separated from the state Synod. The disagreements between the two reverends was raised by their congregation to a question of state versus local power when they decided to criticize the decisions of their governing body. The belief that the congregation was the true unit of Lutheran church placed the power in the hands of the worshippers so that their beliefs took precedence over those of the Synod. The shift from state to local control paralleled the shift that occurred when the southern states demanded their right of succession."],"display_date":"March 24, 1878 - June 6, 1880","search_date":"1879-04-30","locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2212,"title":"A Jealous Murder\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-08-18","end_date":"1884-08-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["   The possessive feelings that accompany jealousy occasionally lead to violent actions, as in the case of Elzy Middlebrook. On a Saturday evening Elzy Middlebrook was arguing with Thomas Brown outside the house of Wilson Goings, the father of Middlebrook's wife. Middlebrook accused Brown of being overly familiar with his wife, showing jealousy to be the source of the conflict that emerged. Wilson Goings, after listening to the quarrel outside his home, asked Brown inside. Middlebrook's wife was in the house and when Middlebrook was denied entry to the residence he became furious and tried to force his way inside. He managed to open the door enough to fire his pistol and hit Goings, resulting in a severe arm wound. Middlebrook then made his way to another door, gained entrance, and fatally wounded Brown.","   Elzy Middlebrook was arrested on Sunday morning without any attempt at escape. He was indicted on Monday for murder and malicious maiming, all a result of his suspicious love for his wife, barely mentioned throughout the article. The Valley Virginian specifically indicates that all of the parties involved [were] colored.","   The newspaper's report on the race of the individuals involved in the crime is essential to understanding its significance. It is an assertion that violent actions of this sort occur only within a certain set of people, implying that white Americans could rise above such crimes of passions. While under slavery Middlebrook was obliged to accept his wife's sexual contact with men other than himself due to his subservience under his master, his new freedom granted him the liberty to defend what he believed should be rightfully his. The wife becomes a question of property, evident in her absence in the reporting of the incident, and Middlebrook had a right to his property. Steven Hahn contends that the South following the Civil War was formed out of black struggles such as this one, illustrating the nature and complexity of race relations in the nineteenth century. The racial identification is indication of a level of racial prejudice, but the Middlebrook's indictment and trial indicate the due process of law given to every criminal regardless of race.

Its female members, like Mrs. O. A. Parish, directed and managed the self-proclaimed C.L.S.C. diligently and passionately until 1887, only to be replaced thereafter by another intellectual group with many of the same members, The Society of Friends Council. Mrs. O. A. Parish, the secretary for the Circle, kept detailed recordings of their meetings for most of this time period. The preamble for the Circle states that the female members of the C.L.S.C began to meet, for the purpose of mutual improvement, and that its members were uniting because of a mutual recognition of, the value of frequent interchanges of thought and experience. Historian Gail Collins notes that these groups typically functioned as, a sort of informal, do-it-yourself junior college system. The idea of doing something unrelated to their families was an enormous breakthrough. The 1886 C.L.S.C. record book stated that the women studied wide-ranging topics with everything from, the poetry of the Elizabethan Age, and philosophical discussions of, mind and matter to, the formation of coal beds, and the, Geology of the Atlantic Ocean. The women undertook these endeavors earnestly and with enthusiasm, each member presenting a different topic for discussion in any given meeting; Mrs. Tolfree, an active member of the C.L.S.C, for example, would present Current Events, while Mrs. Travers would be prepared to speak on Congressional Proceedings, once particular bills were made law. "," The late nineteenth century gave birth to a new, small triumph for southern women. Across America, pockets of female intellectuals gathered together in order to discuss everything from the most classical works of academia to current affairs. The Queen City Chautauqua Circle was one such gathering. By 1900, there were roughly 5,000 such groups that were part of the General Federation of Women's clubs alone, while hundreds more, like the Queen City Chautauqua Circle formed on their own. Gail Collins suggested that women at this time were, reaching for something beyond the household. In an apparently spontaneous movement, women's study clubs started popping up all over the country. In cities, small towns, and even some rural areas, middle class housewives organized themselves into groups to study current affairs, world history, or English literature. And, indeed, these intellectual support systems for women seemed popular in the South; a roster taken in 1885 by Mrs. O. A. Parish had as many as 23 female members recorded. "," Collins noted that the Civil War was an earlier turning point responsible for this new way of life for southern women. She said that at a time when, southern manhood, 'the mighty oak,' had been, 'hit by lightening,' women began to forge bonds with one another and take on new societal roles like never before. In the late nineteenth century of the Gilded Age, women were showing up in the workplace in both the North and the South, or taking more active roles in their communities while still taking care of their families-which was more often the case in the South."],"display_date":"1885 - 1887","search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":7853,"lat":37.8246035682,"lng":-92.2076649652,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2228,"title":"The Female Dunker Preacher\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-10-30","end_date":"1859-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a letter to her friend Sally Ann, M.L.

The Dunkers, or the Church of the Brethren, was a movement that came to the United States, specifically Pennsylvania, in search of religious freedom. Related to the Mennonites, Methodists and Dunkers, the followers emphasized simplicity in their adherence to religion and utilized such practices as adult baptism, lay ministry, non-violence and non-swearing of oaths. Dunkers lived in very close knit communities and, while not uncommon in the South, distinguished themselves from the rest of society through distinctly plain dress."," Additionally, as pointed out by Stephen Longenecker, the Dunkers also differentiated themselves in the South because of their stance on slavery.

In a letter addressed July 14, 1846, Bucktrout revealed that Godfrey Powell had just died, and a woman claiming to be his wife was attempting to claim his estate. Bucktrout wanted to know if this woman truly was Powell's wife, as his interactions with the couple made him question their marital status. According to Bucktrout, the woman had an extremely violent temper, and was often very mean to Godfrey. When Bucktrout intervened, the woman claimed that she wanted nothing to do with Powell. Godfrey was often kept from going to church on Sundays because the woman would take his clothes and refuse to return them- actions that spurred Bucktrout to expel her from the congregation. The woman claimed that she never would have given a cent to Godfrey, nor would she have had anything to with his death if the inheritance were not present. Bucktrout maintained that he had told Godfrey to leave this woman and have her arrested, though he would constantly refuse to take such action. Because Godfrey was a quiet spirit and always said he would try to bear it, he continued to stomach this marital abuse until the day of his death.","Domestic relations in the antebellum South are generally perceived to follow a common stereotype. People often believe the image of households dominated by a single, white patriarch. However, this stereotype is far from the true. Marital relations in the South during this time were influenced by an intricate web of social interactions, one that depended on various local contexts and relationships. Kinship ties, community networks, and personal reputations all contributed to form this complicated structure. Women often had the ability to exploit these social factors in order to achieve authority in their households. Attempts to gain this power often led to aggressive, violent domestic relations. However, women would use social networks to publicize their husbands' faults, bringing shame and uncertainty to their authority. Another great factor in which a woman violated her marital relations was interracial adultery. Though far more common among white males and female slaves, interracial sex still occurred between white females and black males. When this happened, Southern men felt that their wives were not abiding by the ideal wife's paragon of virture- that she should be chaste, devoted, and affectionate. In order to achieve a divorce for such actions, males had to convince lawmakers that their actions were not responsible for the adulterous behavior of their spouses. A woman that cheated on her husband left an indelible mark on his masculinity and honor- an act that further shows the white woman's ability to achieve dominance in the household. Though Southern men are often believed to have steadfast control over their households, women, through the exploitation of social networks and their adulterous behavior, had the ability to shift the balance of power, and achieve the dominant status in the household."],"display_date":"July 14, 1846","search_date":"1846-07-14","locations":[{"id":14407,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2240,"title":"Widow made executrix of 3,500,00 property","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-12-01","end_date":"1897-12-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 1, 1897 the papers of the recently deceased John E. Ligget declared his widow the sole executrix of his account. This meant that she had exclusive control over seeing that the provisions of Mr. Ligget's will were satisfied, and had control over all other matters concerning the deceased's estate. Mr. Liggett was a wealthy tobacconist, and upon his death, relinquished his entire estate in St. Louis, Missouri valued at 3,500,000 to Mrs. Liggett. ","The legal status of women in the nineteenth across America was still far below their male counterparts. Edward Pessen noted that this was particularly the case in marriage at this time, where women were often even considered their husband's property in the eyes of the law, and denied many of the same property rights. These social and legal constrictions made it very hard for women like Mrs. Ligget to come into sole possession of any property at all because normally, as Pessen remarks frankly, the wife is dead in law. This suggests that even inheriting property easily turned into an uncertain ordeal in the nineteenth century, because if a man contested a woman's rights to the property, it is very likely the law would recognize his claim over a female's. "," In Pessen's view of women's legal status in the 1800s, Mrs. Ligget is an exception to the general law applications in the nineteenth century. One explanation for this, however, could be that her fortunate property circumstance was affected by where she lived. St. Louis was a growing industrial city, and often cities were not only the first to shift to modern economics, they also tended to be ahead of many rural areas when it came to social and legal reforms. Significant changes in women's rights occurred in the early twentieth-century, so it's possible that St. Louis, as a modernizing city, already began to broaden the legal liberties given to women at the time of Mrs. Leggit's inheritance. The fact that she was of a high social class also could have helped her bypass some legal restrictions against the female possession of the estate after Mr. Leggit's death. "," Though Mrs. Ligget's property circumstance may have been unique to places like St. Louis, it was not uncommon for tobacconists like the Ligget's to hold a high economic status in the post-bellum south at large. One of several economic booms for tobacco companies as a prosperous industry came right after the Civil War. Men like Washington Duke who developed a machine that could produce two hundred cigarettes per minute and Julius Carr who sold about five million pounds of tobacco in a year, proved that the tobacco trade was lucrative in an industrializing South. "," The fact that a woman was on the receiving end of such a profitable business, especially one that functioned on a national level, marked the beginning of a shift toward women's legal rights. Before the Civil War, southern women were often unable to be a significant part of anything politically or economically meaningful. During the Civil War this mentality changed for many southern women, and as Elizabeth Hayes Turner observed in John B. Bowles's A Companion to the American South, roles that formerly had belonged to men blurred as women assumed control over children and slaves, in the absence of their husbands. As the war came to a close, women became more prominent figures in the management and labor of textile mills in particular. With this modification of the social and economic role of women, by the end of the war Confederate soldiers came home to a new woman. But, for the most part it was not until later in the twentieth-century that they were willing to fully recognize it."],"display_date":"December 1, 1897","search_date":"1897-12-01","locations":[{"id":7921,"lat":38.6407017012,"lng":-90.4430188422,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2254,"title":"Death, Love, and War","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-06-30","end_date":"1861-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The operation was dangerous: destroying a bridge near a railroad ten miles away from camp in Martinsville, Virginia.

She was supposed to be fragile and flirtatious while also sexually innocent. She was beautiful but risky to touch, like porcelain. Every southern belle was expected to be up-to-date on the latest fashions, which often proved tricky and expensive because fashion was constantly changing throughout the nineteenth century. A true lady embodied the ideals of the South, and was thus hospitable and graceful. Newspapers often took it upon themselves to update their lady readers on the newest fashion trends. The Natchez Weekly Democrat reported on November 22, 1873, that lady readers will be interested to know that spotted short veils are no longer fashionable. Bracelets are now made to twine around the arm and require no clasp. In the new style of hairdressing, called the Josephine, chignons are entirely abolished. The hair is drawn up from the back of the head and piled on the top in thick coils or braids, and loosely frizzled in front. "," By following the newspapers' reports, women had easy access to the information about the changing fashions, but only the wealthiest of them could actually afford to keep up with them. In some families, being overly concerned with the latest fashion was looked down upon because a southern lady was supposed to solely exist to support her husband, raise their children, and submit to God. The Natchez Weekly Democrat also reported on October 25, 1871, that an unnamed woman declared to her husband that she loved another more than she loved him, and was leaving him for the other man. She intended on taking their five children with them and the next day she took up house with her new lover. This woman's acts were disgraceful to the people who upheld the southern ideal that a woman existed to benefit her husband, because she was clearly not faithful to the man she had married and had five children with. "," Southern women possessed the characteristics of much of what the South is known for. They were supposed to be southern belles, who were pure and untouchable until they were married. They were honorable (or supposed to be) in the sense that they were faithful to their husbands, who in return would defend their honor if it was ever challenged. Their loyalty lay with God and their families, but it was also tacitly expected that they were to keep up with the latest fashions of the time to the best of their ability. The presence of southern women and the graceful air that supposedly surrounded them was not only felt in Mississippi, but throughout the entire South and became one of its defining characteristics.

Their eloquent correspondence is evidence of pressure against customary social norms which would increase in intensity from the early nineteenth century through the Civil war and Reconstruction. ","In the early 1800's, the doctrine of separate spheres, the cult of domesticity, and the cult of single blessedness were widely held beliefs and concepts in the South. Men and women occupied separate and exclusive spheres of influence, one external and societal, the other internal and domestic. Women could not vote, hold property in most circumstances, or engage in economic transactions; husbands acted as brokers for their interests (coverture). Marriage was a way to gain status and influence through males, but single southern women, such as Ellen, could also carve a special niche in society, that of the maiden aunt who was blessedly single. An aging single woman, the maiden aunt, cared for family members and children in times of sickness and death and maintained a close-knit family through communication. These maiden aunts were especially close with their brothers, such as Mannevillete, who offered male companionship and attention, as well as outlets for political discourse and debate.","The Civil War and Reconstruction offered even more opportunities for women to expand their spheres of influence and redefine their roles in society. The percentage of single women had already begun to rise in 1830 and increased with the loss of thousands of men in the Civil War. Southern households were transformed. With the removal of slavery, women assumed new domestic duties but also moved outside that realm to become schoolteachers in new public and private school systems. In all these changes, women began to have a choice: choice of marriage, choice of profession, and choice of civic responsibility. Marriage was expected, but single women of the elite classes were not universally exiled to the periphery of southern society; they found meaningful roles to fill within the family and later, civic life. The correspondence of Ellen and Corinna Brown is more of an anomaly-atypical and unrepresentative of the whole of southern women. The Brown sisters were incredibly intelligent and well-educated, having the time and resources to write and preserve their daily opinions, thus offering a glimpse of social norms in flux. Most southern women were not so privileged. Still, as more women began to choose to be single, they helped shape their futures more than societal forces that once constrained them."],"display_date":"July 9, 1837","search_date":"1837-07-09","locations":[{"id":1324,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2289,"title":"Bradley Tyler Johnson&#39;s Woodlands\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-08-21","end_date":"1899-08-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1899 Bradley Tyler Johnson posted a flyer titled For lease on Ninety-Nine Year Terms that advertised a 99-year lease on his property, the Woodlands, located in Amelia County. Johnson had a very specific vision for the property; I want a colony of ten families from the Northwest to settle here, he wrote. Traditionally Southside Virginia, including Amelia County, had a rural background with very few towns of any size. In both the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries until the end of slavery, Southside Virginia had borrowed from the Chesapeake region the tobacco economy based upon slave labor, only lacking the wealth and sophistication. Johnson knew that the area would not attract those seeking great wealth, so he aimed his advertisement towards families committed to a rural lifestyle.","Bradley Tyler Johnson promoted the property through its location and land attributes. First, Johnson advertised on his flyer that the Woodlands was located only two and a half miles from the Amelia County Courthouse and 36 miles southwest of Richmond by the Southern Railroad. Other benefits the property based on its location included receiving mail twice a day, two newspapers - one from Baltimore, Maryland and the other from Washington, D.C., and telegraph service. Next Johnson went into detail in describing the many land attributes such as the red clay soil, the alluvium river bottoms, the oak forest, and plentiful streams and springs. He said that the Uplands have never been ploughed since the flood 'Before the Wah'. I suppose they were scrathed for an inch to an inch and a half, in depth by a mule and a n----r, but below that depth has never been stirred by the hand of man, and is just as virgin, as the morning Noah landed on Arabat. Johnson made plans to divide the Amelia County land into farms of 150 acres each and suggested that the settlers grow orchards of apples, grapes, pears, plums, and cherries.","Although it was not entirely clear whether Johnson would have leased the land to sharecroppers, sharecropping was a very common practice during and after Reconstruction. Sharecropping was leasing land to families who would pay their rent by giving the owner a portion of the crop grown on the land. During Reconstruction not only freedmen and women but also poor whites without land practiced sharecropping in Virginia. The practice continued strongly after Reconstruction especially in rural areas formerly based upon the labor of slaves such as the tobacco farms in Amelia County. Sharecropping exploited the people who worked the land by charging high interest rates on borrowed goods and by demanding large portions of their crop. Plantation owners in rural areas found themselves without labor after the Civil War and the practice of sharecropping helped to alleviate the burden of labor.","Johnson was a wealthy man who owned land in Amelia County while spending much of his time in his Richmond, Virginia home. He had a strong desire to lease his land to a colony of families who are neighbors and friends at home and would be so in a new country instead of Virginia locals who were likely to be freedmen and women. It is clear from the language of the advertisement that Johnson only planned to lease the land to white families based on a discussion of black labor and the use of derogatory, racist language. Johnson told the story of rural farmland and woodland where a family could find happiness but not riches instead of telling the story of sharecropping and how difficult life could be."],"display_date":"August 21, 1899","search_date":"1899-08-21","locations":[{"id":13617,"lat":37.3359551661,"lng":-77.9760581709,"zoom":10,"place":"AMELIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2297,"title":"Three Women Graduate from the Women&#39;s Medical College of Baltimore\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-05-02","end_date":"1888-05-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Women's Medical College of Baltimore in Maryland held its sixth ever graduation ceremony in the afternoon on May 2, 1888.

As historians William Cooper and Thomas E. Terrill explain, the income of southern whites fell with the fall of the Confederacy and recovered at a very slow pace. Because of this, there was less money to spend on education and commonly if money was tight, boys were favored to send off to school. Poor white women had to look for work. Southern ideals, however, called for women to stay away from masculine things like politics and work or else they would corrupt their femininity.","Shirley may have held this idea of womanliness, wanting to come home and help her so she would not be ruined by such masculine endeavors. Shirley may also have simply been concerned with the economic state of his mother. While living the life of luxury and comfort in Baltimore-seeing operas and getting his picture taken-he is also staying in contact with his mother.

By Mary Evans' comments on how thankful she was for his money and how helpful Lillie Reid's gifts of food were, the impression is given that Mary Evans was not well off. Her quick letter of thanks back to Brian Philpot could be more than good manners; it could be an attempt to appeal for money in the future. Also, calling herself a servant, what one would consider a demeaning reference, might be said in order to get on the good side of her former master.

She claimed to have knowledge of the whereabouts of Peter McQueen, an Indian prophet whom the United States Army had been pursuing for some time. General Jackson had recently just narrowly missed capturing his at Natural Bridge. As per his quick temper, the general was enraged. This Seminole woman presumably heard through word of mouth-there were some Indians serving under General Jackson's command-about his near miss. She offered to turn McQueen over to the United States in return for General Jackson to allow her people to be transported to the land of the upper Creeks, with sufficient provisions to tide them over until they could establish themselves agriculturally. In his furor, Jackson readily agreed to this pact, and she departed with a letter to the commanding officer of Fort St. Marks detailing the agreement. This was, however, the last recorded sighting of her. She never upheld her end of the bargain, nor did she seek further assistance from General Jackson in the relocation of her people. McQueen was, indeed, never captured.","The Seminoles, including the unnamed woman, were directly related to the Creeks. They were in fact originally members of the Creek confederacy in Alabama and Georgia. They migrated to Florida, however, in three distinct phases. In the first half of the eighteenth century, they executed small invasions of Spanish territory, but with the intent to raid white villages, rather than to establish settlements of their own. In the second half of the century, they began establishing villages; by 1812, the Seminoles inhabited at least six towns in Spanish Florida. From 1812 to 1820, the political and cultural tensions in Georgia and Alabama led many Creeks to move to Florida and join the Seminoles already living there. So when the Seminole woman asked General Jackson to help her people move back to the upper Creek nation, she was not asking for him to help her people invade another tribe's land. She was just asking to go home.","This incident is also a clear indication of the growing power of Seminole women. From 1812 to 1820, they experienced a significant increase in their ability to exist formally outside of the household. With the migration of Seminoles to Florida, they came increasingly into contact with whites, allowing them to enter into small trade with them. These agricultural business transactions-primarily involving Seminole women growing and selling oranges, melons, corn, rice, and peaches to whites-greatly increased the political legitimacy of these women, thereby giving the unnamed woman the authority to strike her deal with a general in the United States Army."],"display_date":"April 18, 1818","search_date":"1818-04-18","locations":[{"id":1280,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2341,"title":"Sylvia, the Runaway Slave","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-09-30","end_date":"1836-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1836, Sylvia, about twenty years of age, of common size, very likely and almost black, was sold from her plantation in Conecuh County, Alabama to the plantation of Thomas L. Stark in Washington County. Perhaps she was separated from her husband. Perhaps she left behind a child. Whatever the circumstances, Sylvia decided to run away. After several months with no sign of Sylvia, her owner finally decided to make a more public announcement. On September 30 of that same year, the Mobile County Register published a 10 reward pending the return of this runaway slave. Sylvia's rightful owner expected her to return to her former plantation in Conecuh County and whomever she missed there.","Across the South, the domestic slave trade daily uprooted slaves from their homes and dropped them into some foreign land without regard for their personal well-being. Of all the interstate slave sales leading up to the Civil War, twenty-five percent destroyed first marriages and fifty percent destroyed nuclear families. Essentially, slaves were property, and property could be bought and sold at will-whatever was economically profitable. With this in mind, the families of slaves were always in danger of being separated.","Sylvia's new master, Thomas L. Stark, valued the young girl enough that he provided a reward for her return. Slaves were vital to the livelihood of the southern plantation owner. As William Rogers explains, slavery was a crucial part of the Cotton Kingdom in Alabama and inherently tied to the economic success of planters as their most valuable asset. Therefore, Mr. Stark valued Sylvia as one of the highest commodities in his fortune-one that he could not let run away.","Surely, Sylvia knew that punishment was awaiting her upon her return. In Alabama, most small infractions were handled on the plantations, while more serious crimes were handled within the legal system. Essentially, corporal punishment was a way for white southerners to demonstrate their power and keep the system of slavery functioning to their advantage.

Landowners and local merchants often took advantage of sharecroppers, many of whom were still illiterate, and maintained economic control. Indeed, because of the way in which sharecroppers were caught in a cycle of debt and were at the mercy of landowners, Claudine Ferrell refers to sharecropping as a form of economic slavery in her book <em>Reconstruction</em>.","While many poor white men also made a living as sharecroppers, a disproportionately high amount of blacks took part in the practice. Life as a tenant farmer was certainly not as grim as it had been for blacks living in slavery; black men and women technically had the ability to spend their time, money and energy as they so desired. Still, as Reconstruction came to a formal close in 1877, the plantation system remained firmly entrenched and many white landowners saw overseeing sharecroppers as a variation of the duties they had retained during slavery. The landowner maintained control over the individuals on his property and thus a relationship based on domination and vulnerability persisted between many blacks and whites in the South.

Landowners and local merchants often took advantage of sharecroppers, many of whom were still illiterate, and maintained economic control. Indeed, because of the way in which sharecroppers were caught in a cycle of debt and were at the mercy of landowners, Claudine Ferrell refers to sharecropping as a form of economic slavery in her book <em>Reconstruction</em>.","While many poor white men also made a living as sharecroppers, a disproportionately high amount of blacks took part in the practice. Life as a tenant farmer was certainly not as grim as it had been for blacks living in slavery; black men and women technically had the ability to spend their time, money and energy as they so desired. Still, as Reconstruction came to a formal close in 1877, the plantation system remained firmly entrenched and many white landowners saw overseeing sharecroppers as a variation of the duties they had retained during slavery. The landowner maintained control over the individuals on his property and thus a relationship based on domination and vulnerability persisted between many blacks and whites in the South. Regardless of the inequity it perpetuated, sharecropping shaped the economic and social atmosphere of much of the agricultural South long after Reconstruction ended and on through the Depression."],"display_date":"April 19, 1888","search_date":"1888-04-19","locations":[{"id":12543,"lat":31.0376697014,"lng":-97.4782357231,"zoom":9,"place":"BELL, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2352,"title":"Fighting for Equality in the Public Sphere\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-08-25","end_date":"1898-11-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though Reconstruction ended officially in 1877, the country and its people were far from united as racism and segregation became a growing force. Texas, though on the edge of the South, was certainly no stranger to this battle over inequality. On November 18, 1898, the Galveston News ran an article detailing how Isabelle E. Mabson, a black resident of Galveston, TX, filed suit in the district court against the Missouri, Kansas and Texas railway company of Texas and the Wagner palace car company. The lawsuit was for a total of 1,800 in damages based on the fact that Mabson was denied the ability to ride in the first-class car based on her race. On August 25 of that year, Mabson had purchased first-class tickets to take herself and her children from Kansas City home to Galveston. She was able to ride in the first-class car until the train reached Denison, TX where she was ejected from the car by company officials because Mabson and her children were black. The fact that she was forced from the car in front of her fellow passengers caused her great embarrassment. She and her children were offered to ride in the car for black clients, which was cited as dirty and filled with filth of person and language. Mabson was sick at the time and desired the luxury provided by the first-class car, so she left the train and purchased tickets for the remainder of the journey through the Houston and Texas Central railway.","Isabella Mabson was among the first black women to take a stand for equal treatment in the public sphere by filing suit in federal district court. While the outcome of her case is not known, the article highlights the issues that blacks continued to face in Texas after Reconstruction ended. The Fifteenth Amendment passed in 1870, creating equal rights for all men despite race or color; however, women were not included in this amendment. While the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1875 encouraged many to fight public segregation, efforts were soon curtailed when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the section of that act pertaining to public accommodations unconstitutional. This act enabled states, including Texas, to pass Jim Crow laws at the state and local level which greatly constrained the rights of black men and women. Texas, along with other southern states, put into effect a great deal of laws restricting the day to day behaviors of black residents.","Southern history is full of accounts similar to that of Mabson. Frequently, black passengers would purchase tickets to ride in cars with more pleasant conditions only to be demanded by railroad officials to remove themselves immediately. If the black passenger did not comply, the situation could quickly escalate and at times even resulted in assault. In the 1880s and 90s, railway cars became the first site of state-mandated segregation laws in the South. After the Texas government created legislation for railway-car segregation, the practice of segregation in public settings expanded from there; while the frequency of segregation increased, so did racial tensions. As Edward Ayers emphasizes in his book <em>The Promise of the New South</em>, new generations of whites became squeamish about black people in ways their grandparents could never have imagined-- or afforded. Laws such as this were reaffirmed at the national level in 1896 when the U.S. Supreme Court gave its ruling in the case <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, in which it declared segregation was permitted under the separate but equal clause. In protest of this kind of segregation, blacks practiced civil disobedience and took legal actions such as the above case initiated by Mabson, while many others simply left and went further north in favor of areas such as Kansas which promised more equal treatment.

Cranfill, a resident of Texas, an ardent supporter of temperance and prohibition, packed his bag, headed for Crawford, Texas, and prepared to defend prohibition in what would be a heated debate in August of 1885. His opponent was to be Roger Q. Mills, a man formerly an advocate of prohibition but whom since had taken the side of whiskey men. Cranfill compared the encounter to that of David and Goliath, and by the time the debate started at 8 PM, there was standing room only.","Mills began by quoting men such as Thomas Jefferson and discussed personal liberty, democracy, and other popular arguments used by anti-prohibitionists; he received a standing ovation. Cranfill then took the stage and began with a reading from the Bible and quoted William E. Gladstone as saying It is the duty of the government to make it easy for people to do right and hard for the people to do wrong. Then, he introduced his next quotable authority with high praises and began to read excerpts from <em>The Prairie Blade</em>; this was a pro-prohibition publication which Mills himself had been editor of in 1856. Following the reading, Cranfill exclaimed Ladies and gentlemen, the quotation I have just read is from the pen of Honorable Roger Q. Mills of Texas As the applause grew to a roar, Mills was clearly embarrassed. Cranfill closed his argument by asking God to strike him dead that night if he was to be tempted away from the principles of prohibition and good will, as Mills had been. Cranfill later reflected on that evening debate as the greatest argumentative achievement of his career, enabling him to send a strong message on the reformation topic which he supported so passionately.","Prohibition, a reform movement to place a ban on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic drinks, was a topic of discussion and an influence on politics in Texas, the South and the entire nation starting in the 1840s. Drama and debate over the subject would continue until 1933 when Congress passed the Twenty-first Amendment repealing the Prohibition Act. In the 1830s and 40s, people in the United States began to notice an increase in the levels of violence and poverty; many blamed this on the increased levels of alcohol consumption and wanted to revive morality and decency by banning alcohol.","After the Civil War ended, the cause was met with renewed fervor and led to the creation of organizations such as the Anti-Saloon League, the Women's Christian Temperance Union and the Prohibition Party. Prohibition was a topic which enticed groups usually silent on political issues to voice their opinions, such as women and religious groups. The topic was debated from the biggest cities to the most rural areas. Nationally, the Prohibition Party received most of its support from Northern voters. This impeded united support of prohibition to an extent since many Southerners were reluctant to take up a common cause with the same people who had previously supported abolitionism and the Republican Party and who now supported female suffrage. The issue did, however, bring together some groups as many white and black voters joined together to fight for the dry laws they supported. Still, in the South the debate over prohibition largely took remained at the local level, and with the decision at the time still up to individual localities, many counties in Texas became dry.","Moving into the twentieth century, the prohibition cause, coupled with religious revivalism, increased in strength across the nation and eventually resulted in the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919. Despite the enthusiasm with which the cause had originally been championed, popular sentiment saw a shift in the 1920s and people soon became disillusioned with prohibition. The Twenty-first Amendment passed in 1933 and Texas voters repealed the state's dry law in 1935, thus leaving the decision up to individual localities. Regardless of the legal outcome of prohibition, the movement it inspired had brought together previously alienated groups through a common cause and enticed many others to have their voice heard for the first time in the political realm. A series of reform movements would follow through the years as politics was invigorated at the local level with passionate individuals eager to improve their country."],"display_date":"August 1, 1885 - August 30, 1885","search_date":"1885-08-15","locations":[{"id":13019,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MC LENNAN, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2359,"title":"A Typical Monday for Mary Austin Holley\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-02-26","end_date":"1838-02-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In her diary Mary Austin Holley jotted down the events of her afternoon with friends.

Holley's friends, Mr. and Mrs. Wharton, boasted all sorts of fascinating relics, once owned by famous figures in Mexican history. Holley wrapped up the account of her delightful afternoon by recognizing Mr. Wharton as a cultured gentleman and Mrs. Wharton as all that a lady should be. ","In the early stages of Texas colonization, most of the colonists were like Holley and the Whartons: ladies and gentlemen from the American South. Being southerners, they brought with them several aspects of southern life and culture. One of these was slavery and the way of life it provided. Domestic slaves took the burdens of household work off of slaveholding ladies, supplying them with an abundance of leisure time. Having free time enabled Holley to receive a thorough education. Her education made her interested in rare editions of books and figures in Mexican history. Holley appreciated the finer things in life and put emphasis on the importance of being a gentleman or lady. ","The ladies of the antebellum South revealed an important aspect of southern class hierarchy. In his book Soul by Soul, Walter Johnson describes the white upper class as a society made by slaves. Wives of slaveholders demonstrated this particularly well because the mark of a gentile lady was the leisure time she had to engage in pleasantries. She could not have this leisure time without the help of domestic servants, thus her slaves made her a lady. These women's husbands also benefited from their wives' leisure time. It became a credit to a man's reputation to have a wife that did not work.

The groom, Mister Richard P. Deshon, was marrying Miss Mary E. Herndon, the daughter of Hon. Thomas Herndon M.C., an Alabama Representative in Congress. They held their wedding in the parlors of the Representative's home in Mobile, address  515 Thirteenth Street Northwest. The ceremony was done simply considering the two parties getting married; the bride wore a modest white toilette, with satin and lace trimmings, and her veil was decorated with orange blossoms. The couple had opted for a traditional Presbyterian ceremony, and they chose the chaplain of the Senate, Dr. J.J. Bullock, to marry them. The guest list was limited to the Alabama Congressional Representatives and a few close family friends. Mr. Herndon's co-representatives in the House, Samford, Herbert, Williams, Shelley, Forney, and Lewis all came with their families, as did Alabama Senators Morgan and Prior. A few other Representatives, all close friends of Mr. Herndon, were also in attendance with their families. The bride was overwhelmed with the generosity of her guests, and was especially surprised by the beautiful embossed silver service that was hidden inside a magnificent casket-a gift from the Alabama delegation. The elated couple, following a simple reception, left for an extended Eastern bridal tour later that evening.","This marriage is not typical of an Alabama family of the Herndon's social stature. First of all, the simplicity of their wedding does not seem fitting to the public nature of the family's life. Secondly, the service itself, a Presbyterian marriage, was uncommon in the Mobile area. Presbyterians were somewhat of a minority, and were much stronger in the black belt of Alabama than they were in the Gulf Coast region.","However, soon after this ceremony, Presbyterianism would experience a rise in the state. In 1883 the Presbytery of Northern Alabama was made a part of the Synod of Alabama, thus consolidating the faith within the state. This was known as Alabamian Presbyterianism's golden age. The traditional ceremony of marriage between Richard Deshon and Mary Herndon was a prime example of the modest values Presbyterians would try to promote in the years to come."],"display_date":"February 18, 1880","search_date":"1880-02-18","locations":[{"id":287,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2389,"title":"A Woman&#39;s Valiance on the Battlefield\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-05-02","end_date":"1863-05-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Mrs. Holstead became a widow when her husband died in the Civil War.

During an evacuation provoked by the confederates in Corinth, Mississippi, she paused during all the chaos to stop and care for the wounded during the battle.

Historian Katie Ross argues that many times the sick and wounded lay unattended and often unprotected for days on the battlefield or river's edge waiting for transportation down the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers to hospitals along the Ohio.

The Methodists were one of the Christian denominations more accepting of leadership among women though they usually prohibited women from gaining official denominational positions.

The depression started in the North, Maverick reflected, and worked its way down the coast, finally hitting Texas. Prior to this time, the country was undergoing a post-war boom and Maverick explained ...there had been a perfect orgie of speculation in everything and nearly every town was over built. Citizens were searching for a better life, coming up with plans to get rich quick. Many families were picking up and moving to cities. Why do people crowd themselves into great cities when there is so much beautiful land? she asked. Maverick blamed the nation's economic hardships on idleness and gambling on the part of the American people, adding that her husband was among those guilty people. When financial difficulties set in, her husband lost all of his land except for their house. All went but the big stone house, which that blessed homestead law of Texas saved, she wrote.","The Texas Homestead Law was based on a concept of exempting a house from seizure by creditors, and it originated in Texas in the early 1800s. Permanently established in the state's constitution in 1845, the law protected citizens from losing their houses to foreclosure due to debt which occurred frequently, especially for farmers, during the economic instability following Reconstruction. The Constitution of 1869 defined the rural homestead that was exempt as being less than 200 acres while an eligible urban homestead was viewed as a house worth less than 5,000. The Homestead law did not protect debtors who owed their money to the federal government.","The Homestead law saved many families, in addition to the Mavericks, from becoming homeless when economic hardships took their toll on the country. After the Civil War ended, the United States entered into a period of economic turbulence. This period was marked by great gain but also by the Panic of 1873, strikes by organized labor groups, and falling agricultural prices; all of these factors culminated in the economic depression of the 1890s. Nationally, economic problems are pinpointed as beginning in 1893 with conditions worsening through the rest of the year. Some recovery took place in 1898, but the economy was not fully restored until 1901 or 1902. This depression is considered to be the second only to the Great Depression in terms of severity. Perhaps hit hardest by the economic downfall were the southern and western states as 153 of the 158 national banks that failed during this period were in the South and West. During this time, the cotton textile industry was the only southern manufacturing industry to prosper. Farmers in this field still faced financial issues and the instability of cotton crops due to weather and fluctuating prices.","The economic hardships also exacerbated race relations in many areas. Poor white workers now frequently found themselves competing with blacks for the same jobs and for similarly low wages. This eroded the desired sense of white superiority and caused many bonds which had been formed across the color line to be strained or broken and increased distrust and feelings of ill will between the two groups.

She very much wanted to visit him and worried about his health."," As Elizabeth waited on the homefront she faced Union suppression of her own. Union troops occupied Nashville arresting prominent men and confiscating property.

The men left the women to represent their strong sentiments while they were away. Their husbands risked their lives fighting for their important ideals, so it was the least a woman could do to vocally support them. Letting down their resistance meant letting down their husbands and families, as well as their town. In Elizabeth's case, she was with her children and needed to go home.

Trail roads were rough, there were high rivers to cross, diseases to contend with, and of course the possibility of meeting up with Indians. Mary Maverick was making such a journey in the summer of 1837. She was traveling by wagon train from her home in Alabama to the new land of Texas. One day when her party was moving camp, 17 Tonkawa warriors surprised them. Still in war paint, the Indians greeted Maverick's party brandishing several pieces of human flesh. Maverick remembered the Indians coming up to her carriage and asking to see her baby. She denied the request and made sure to show the warriors her pistol and bowie knife. Maverick expressed annoyance when the 17 decided to ride along with the train instead of leave. The 17 Tonkawas did eventually quit the party much to the relief of Maverick. She was certain that had they gotten a hold of her baby, they would have eaten it. ","Meeting Indians was a regular occurrence as whites encroached more and more on tribal lands. The fear and aggravation Maverick experienced was common among settlers who encountered Indians. Maverick's fear that the Tonkawas might eat her baby was not completely unfounded. Tonkawa warriors did have a reputation for cannibalism. Accounts described warriors cutting off the hands and feet of their victims and then eating them. This, along with other obvious cultural differences and bad blood, made the two groups wary of each other. ","From the earliest days of Texas Stephen F. Austin anticipated conflict with Indians in the new settlements. In his first presidency (1836-1838), Sam Houston passed laws providing for frontier defense against both Mexicans and Indians. Houston wanted both protections for his people and to stay on friendly terms with Indian allies. There were, however, problems with the Indian land claims; the Texas government refused to recognize their legitimacy. When Mirabeau B. Lamar became the second president of the Republic of Texas in 1838, Indian tribes found him to be no friend of theirs. Lamar called for, an exterminating war on [Texas Indian] warriors; which will admit no compromise and have no termination except in their total extinction or total expulsion. Lamar wanted the Indians gone because he saw them as dangerous people and competitors for prime real estate. Lamar's attitudes mirrored those of the Texas people. Maverick was afraid of what the Tonkawas might do to her party and just wanted them to go away so that they could camp in peace.

B. family. Eleanor McC. (daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Walter B. B.) moved from Baltimore to Chicago when she married Mr. McC. and brought Margaret Blake with her. In the winter of 1879 Eleanor decided to visit her mother and family in Baltimore, Maryland for Christmas. She took with her, her daughter and Margaret Blake. Blake quickly caught a cold that grew into erysipelas. Mrs. McC. left her with her family in Baltimore expecting her to return to Chicago when she was well; however, the sickness grew worse and they sent her to the Baltimore Infirmary. She died there on March 10, 1880. Mrs. McC ordered her a headstone with her name and date of birth on it. Mrs. Walter B. B. requested the stone to read Faithful unto Death.The relationship between Margaret Jane Blake and the McC and Walter B. B. families existed during the period after Reconstruction when African Americans were exposed to greater freedom from the days of enslavement but also new forms of repression. As Edward Ayers describes, segregation existed but was not completely nor universally defined. There was heavy racism and separatism, but also advancements in the black community. Race relations were complex and varied; friendships and positive relations could exist while being entwined in race traditions. This environment allowed for a variety of race relations to exist, including ones like that of Margaret Blake and her employers. ","Just how positive or negative Margaret Blake's relationship was with her employers is unclear. She spent years with them, becoming a constant in their lives. While Mrs. Walter B. B.'s request for the gravestone to say Faithful unto Death is at first glance a gesture of affection, it also reemphasizes Blake's role as a servant. Margaret Blake's relationship with her employers, while positive and described as loving, was unable to break out of the Southern race relation tradition of looking at African Americans as inferiors and servants."],"display_date":"January 1, 1879 - March 30, 1880","search_date":"1879-08-16","locations":[{"id":5933,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2411,"title":"Capturing the Moment\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-12-12","end_date":"1857-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a private letter to her granddaughter, an unnamed woman described a simple scene with such poignant detail that an ordinary moment in history became remarkably touching on paper.

The diary of Dr. Walter Wade proved that even in the mid-nineteenth century that this concept was not a foreign one. A large percentage of his journal was dedicated to a documentation of his private medical records. In a February 21, 1848 entry, Wade described his Monday night visit to a woman named Sarah. Wade devoted few words to the entry, but his impact was nonetheless powerful. He succinctly stated that, Sarah had an abortion at 3 mos. Wade provided the reader with sparse details about Sarah, but he did mention that the terminated pregnancy had consisted of twins. However, he was unable to learn the gender of the pair, presumably because the pregnancy was not far enough advanced. Wade maintained a business-like and professional tone throughout the passage; one can only assume that this detached air his writing emanated was reflected in his actions as a physician."," An individual's livelihood was undoubtedly unstable in the mid-nineteenth century. As a result of, High infant mortality rate and tragic loss of loved ones to disease or accident in the prime of life, according to historians James and Dorothy Volo death became an accepted and inexorable fact of existence. As a whole, individuals found it easier to resign themselves to the reality of mortality, and doctors, who were already required to uphold an air of formality concerning their patients, were no different. Doctors undoubtedly practiced abortion in the antebellum South, but because it was a sensitive and often taboo subject, it is difficult to find example of it recorded. Some instances of abortion have been discovered among the records of slave women who were either unable to care for their children due to the harsh demands of their required work or whose children were often sold by avaricious masters. According to Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, one woman was forced to watch as her master put all of her infant children up for sale, until, taking matters until her own hands, she decided that she was not going to let her master sell that baby. 'She got up and give it something out of a bottle and purty soon it was dead'. Says Fox-Genovese, these desperate women saw either terminating their pregnancies or killing their own children as a, ... way [to reclaim] it as their own. In a perverse way, infanticide could be seen as a means to give children life. "," There is no way to tell from Wade's brief diary entry what the primary motivation was behind Sarah's decision to abort her babies. However, both the succinctness of the Wade's words and the nature of the entry itself reflect societal attitudes towards death in the antebellum South."],"display_date":"February 21, 1848","search_date":"1848-02-21","locations":[{"id":7096,"lat":31.7342121703,"lng":-91.0371521217,"zoom":10,"place":"JEFFERSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2422,"title":"Northern Traveler Endures Southern Transportation\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Frustrated by the stagecoach's delayed start, Northerner Frederick Olmsted waited no longer to commence the next leg of his southern exploration.  He began the 26 mile journey from Gaston to Fayetteville on foot and let the coach catch up with him along the way.  By one o'clock, though he had covered almost ten miles, he doubted he had passed even half a dozen farms.  Olmsted took lunch at the Banks' plantation where fresh horses for the stagecoach grazed in the field.  To Olmsted's dismay, the fresh horses could do but little more than stand up.  At last the stagecoach arrived but its ineloquent driver could only mutter distressed comments about the horses: There ain't a man in North Car'lina could drive them horses up the hills without a whip. With the help of several black men, the driver at last thrashed and verbally harassed the ostensibly-fresh horses into action.  Three miles later, using real, outright, old-fashioned, uncompromising English oaths, as loud as he could yell, the driver again resorted to violence as onlooking passengers idled.  This time he used a rail.  Exasperated by the wait, some of the weary passengers offered assistance. Olmsted resorted again to his own legs and by eight p.m. arrived at Mrs. Barclay's inn where his fellow passengers did not arrive until three a.m.","In this vignette from North Carolina and in many other instances throughout the South, Olmsted journeyed down isolated, poorly-maintained roads, detailing the poor condition of transportation.  The roads he traveled often comprised little more than deforested trails.  At points, he traveled for several days and never saw two dwellings of mankind within sight of each other. Several plantation patriarchates were miles apart. He recorded his many experiences and minute-by-minute conversations in over seven-hundred pages, which he gave to the New York Daily Times.  That Northern editors considered Olmsted's observations exotic enough to be published attests to a communication gap between the North and South.","Olmsted's accounts of Southern transportation deficiencies support Stephen Goldfarb's analysis of geographical isolation as a limiting factor to Southern industrialization.  He endured the same arduous traveling conditions as Piedmont farmers who sought distant markets for their produce.  Writing for a Northern audience, at points Olmsted takes pleasure in contrasting the efficient transportation networks of the North with the ridiculous networks he encounters in the South.  He was also struck by the low density of homesteads; Edward Ayers explores a similar phenomenon of slave-holding counties in comparisons between Virginia and Pennsylvania during the Civil War.  The immense challenges to transportation in North Carolina's Piedmont, exacerbated by a sparsely-populated landscape, represent an insularity from national trends of industrialization."],"display_date":1853,"search_date":"1853-07-02","locations":[{"id":9380,"lat":35.1897473693,"lng":-78.9269058663,"zoom":8,"place":"CUMBERLAND, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2432,"title":"Female College Prepares Women for Society and the Domestic State\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-06-04","end_date":"1847-06-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the final examinations for girls at Greensboro Female College, a local newspaper commended the institution in its effort to develop and cultivate the intellect and give dignity to the mind while at the same time preparing women to bear with dignity the responsibilities and trials of the domestic state. According to the Greensboro Patriot, the sister women's college, Edgeworth, founded by Governor Morehead, was also producing successful alumnae who were taking their social stand in many circles.  North Carolina produced white female graduates who could bring scholastic knowledge to the affairs pertaining to wives and mothers in 1847. ","      The article attested to the paradoxical nature of antebellum female education inasmuch as it professed to develop and cultivate the intellect and give dignity to the mind while at the same time prescribing limited roles for women in society.  The examinations of Spring 1847 occurred in the midst of an Intellectual Awakening which had begun in 1839 with the spread of free common schools for white children.  From the age of ten onwards, however, white men and women received different educations.  Women were encouraged in domestic skills and were less eligible for college education.  Greensboro Female College itself was only established through the patronage of the Methodist Church, and could not have been sustained by the State.  ","Anya Jabour, in her work with the family letters of the southern slaveholding U.S. Attorney General William Wirt, exposes more of the paradoxes to female education.  While Wirt encouraged his many daughters to rigorous standards in academia, he wrote to one daughter in 1820 that an intelligent Woman may be admired but she will never be beloved. Jabour's work correlates with the notion that a female education was considered valuable only in so much as it catered to femininity rather than intellect.  In so much as women were encouraged to develop their intellect, Jabour suggests it is to the extent that doing so improved their marriage options.  Thus the efforts to elevate the female intellect seem in large part efforts to improve their capabilities as domestic entities."],"display_date":"June 4, 1847","search_date":"1847-06-04","locations":[{"id":9488,"lat":36.0793885003,"lng":-79.7889995015,"zoom":9,"place":"GUILFORD, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2437,"title":"Woman Suffrage Summarily Disposed of in Missouri\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-02-17","end_date":"1871-02-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Missouri Congressional session of 1871, women suffragists from across the ","state drafted a proposal which was given to the State Senate Committee.

Prior to the Civil War, women were keepers of the home. The average, middle-class women raised the children, kept the home and prepared the meals. Both before and after the Civil War, women were subservient to men and their marriages were entirely patriarchal.","Of course, there are exceptions to every rule - George Fulgham's wife was one of them. In October of 1871, a verdict was handed down in the Fulgham vs. the State of Alabama. In this case George Fulgham's privileges and rights as a husband were in question despite his race and status. ","It was early 1871 when George Fulgham, an emancipated slave, was discovered beating his children. The discovery was made by his wife, another emancipated slave. The wife interrupted midway through the flogging. When she voiced her distress over the excessive punishment, Fulgham turned the whip on his wife, striking her twice on the back. Fulgham's wife bravely reported the incident and once in court lawyers for both the complainant, Mrs. Fulgham and the accused, Mr. Fulgham, argued a number of different points. The case focused primarily on the right of chastisement. The right of chastisement refers to a man's limited ability to discipline his wife and family. Prior to Fulgham, a husband not only had the ability to physically reprimand his spouse but he also acquired the rights to his wife's person, the value of both her paid and unpaid labor, and as well as any property that accompanied their nuptials. ","Sex and class equality certainly served as social landmarks for what was acceptable and unacceptable behavior. However, incidents in the home blurred the line between private behavior and public record. Accordingly, justices hearing the case were asked to take into account what qualified as appropriate both in and outside the home. What could be questioned about the closed-door occurrences in private quarters? The significance of class was also questioned. Citizens of lower classes, who simply did not know better, could possibly be exempt from the law due to mere ignorance. Fulgham not only recognized class and gender but race as well. Justices in the case were asked to consider whether or not black relationships were inherently different from white relationships.","The case was on appeal in the Alabama Supreme Court when it reached its final verdict as to the validity of the right of chastisement. The verdict came down on October 6, 1871, essentially in favor of the woman, Mrs. Fulgham. The court claimed that the rule of love superseded the rule of force by denying the privilege of brutality against women.","The Fulgham case, while significant for its time, proved to serve as precedent for later and similar cases at the turn of the century. The verdict provided precedent for gender equality in male and female marital relationship cases to come. Furthermore, the verdict defined the role of women in Alabama and the South on a greater scale. Through Fulgham women were endowed with the assertiveness to defend themselves against the wrong doings of not only their husbands, but society on the whole.

In October of 1879, Dr. Bryce, the superintendent, expanded his report, by including particular conditions and patient numbers, among other details. Averaging 400 patients, the hospital treated anything from pneumonia to cerebral softening to utter, indefinable insanity. The Hospital was neither gender nor racially divided. Of the 394 patients present in October of 1879, 208 were men, 186 women; 65 blacks and 329 whites. The Hospital received considerable amounts of state funding, nearly eighty-five thousand dollars in total. The funds were unrestricted and therefore used for anything from building improvements to employment benefits like free medication and services. The state not only offered funding but went so far as to appoint a special committee to examine causes of insanity, collect all pertinent information about practical ways to reform insane asylums and to ascertain details, expenses, etc. The committee's findings were positive. Officials called the care a labor of love for mankind. The committee also focused on defining particular deficiencies, namely, intemperance. Intemperance, deemed a disease by a panel of Alabama doctors, was said to have been acquired through multiple sources. Intemperance was most often contracted through habit and as the result of temptation put before the weak. The state of Alabama refused to take responsibility for those afflicted with intemperance. However, the committee returned suggesting that perhaps those infected with intemperance in the state of Alabama be secluded in a specific facility. The suggested facility would provide a place guarded from temptation and protected from danger. It would provide an environment to treat, cure and restore victims of intemperance to society. Interesting is that the symptoms of intemperance were never clearly outlined by the committee. Not to mention, the disease itself is found in no medical journals of the time. However, it is obvious through language analysis that intemperance is a condition of corruption which religious factions in Alabama sought to squash.  The question of intemperance is not nearly as alarming as the mention of the Insane Hospital in the first place. The disabled and disfigured were disregarded during the nineteenth century. People sequestered citizens with disabilities in insane asylums to distance themselves. That said, these asylums were rarely mentioned. The mere acknowledgment in the Montgomery Advertiser was a testament to the progressive nature of Alabama's social politics."],"display_date":"October 1, 1879","search_date":"1879-10-01","locations":[{"id":204,"lat":33.5726362717,"lng":-86.9006076776,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2467,"title":"Raleigh State of the Art\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-11-16","end_date":"1835-11-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Raleigh Theatre was the grandest in the land. After attending the grand-opening, all the men and women of the city agreed that they had never seen their own theatre surpassed in beauty and style.  The curtain drapery over the hollow wooden windows and stage doors was fitted with precision, and the walls were no longer glum and drab but instead featured variegated colors trimmed in gold.  The Ladies' box had been completely remodeled for comfort as well as decorated with crimson, cushioned seats. The theatre was fit for royalty but available as a weekend diversion for the public.The man responsible for the theatre and its restoration was Mr. Preston, who had transformed the neglected building with thorough repairs and improvements.  There were new scenes and drop curtains painted by Mr. Vincent, and a new Stock Company was set to provide the best talent in the country to be featured regularly, along with a new band that was sure to impress.  Mr. Preston would stop at nothing to preserve the theatre, provide a safe environment, and also to ensure that Raleigh had the proper venues for leisure and courting.  Upon visiting the theatre, a reporter opined there is no greater asset to Raleigh, and no better reflection of the dignified and cultured population that calls our marvelous city home.This narrative focuses on the influx of culture and opportunities to the South; attempts to rival those of the North.  This can also be seen as an effort to equalize rural an urban by fostering greater education and confidence for Southern farmers who felt inferior to the increasing civilization of urban areas.  However on a local level, this was clearly a venue for class division to be recognized, thus resulting in greater oppression of poor whites who could not afford leisure activities and blacks, who never dreamed of attending such events.  Bringing a theater to the South was also in accordance with unforeseen surpluses of time that had been unavailable in earlier decades when both men and women worked daylight to dawn.  The institution of slavery allowed blacks to handle duties in and around the home, while also watching over a master's house. This freed the master and his wife, or a young suitor and his date, to go out on the town on evenings.

Bibb received a letter from Dealia Ann Smith, a woman from Mineral City requesting help with her divorce case. According to William Cooper, divorce had become more common at this time than in the earlier part of the nineteenth century, however; it was still an anomaly of society. Whether or not Dealia Ann Smith was granted a divorce was not determined in the letter's contents, however, it would have been much easier for her to get a divorce during this time period in comparison to earlier parts of this the nineteenth-century. Changing of the laws helped ease the process of divorce. Earlier laws dictated that a private bill had to be passed by a state legislature in order to grant a divorce. Eventually, the law progressed to where it was easier to get a divorce. According to Cooper, cruelty, abandonment, adultery, impotence, and consanguinity were new grounds for divorce. Smith's husband had been gone for two years and during that time she had received no aid from him, and even while they were together he was still of no use to her. Smith claimed that everything he earned, while he was with her, he gave to his mother and left her with nothing. At the closing of the letter, she said that the last letter he wrote her told her not to write him anymore, thus blatantly implying that he wanted no further contact. Judging from the letter's contents, it was very likely that the state considered Smith's situation as abandonment and granted her divorce. ","The courts also became more sympathetic towards women in other aspects. For example, cruelty was an extremely loose term and often encompassed physical and mental cruelty and judges tended to be pretty lenient. However, a woman still had to prove beyond a doubt that she had not committed adultery, which denoted the archaic attitude that was still present towards women. Divorce also advanced women's rights. In the past, a woman surrendered many of her rights and property to her spouse once she got married; essentially, she possessed the same rights of children. Divorce empowered women to stand up for themselves in one aspect, however; it would be three decades before women received the ultimate symbol of equality in the United States, the right to vote in politics. So although divorce was usually seen in a negative light, in this case, Dealia Ann Smith and the other women who petitioned for divorce during this time were an indirect driving force and stepping-stone to more women's rights."],"display_date":"April 25, 1891","search_date":"1891-04-25","locations":[{"id":14015,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2489,"title":"Murder in Portsmouth, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-01-01","end_date":"1855-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On October 14, 1854, a neighbor found the Braden family of Portsmouth, Virginia dead in their home. An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was excessive amounts of laudanum in their stomachs. The town was outraged and astonished. Who would commit such a heinous crime? The members of the community greatly respected the Braden family, and mourned their loss. A carpenter who was in the house that morning remembered seeing a seamstress, Mrs. Gray, preparing coffee for the family. After the carpenter left the house, he saw Mrs. Gray hurriedly walking down the street. Later that day, the neighbor found the bodies. The town formed search parties, and soon they found a frail, terrified woman in the woods surrounding town. Portsmouth had found its murderer.","Mrs. Gray was actually Maria Black Thorn, a woman who led a very troubled past. Maria was traveling on a boat to New York City when it stopped for repairs in Portsmouth. In ill health and lacking money, Thorn stayed in Portsmouth, and found a job working for the Braden family. During the trial, Thorn revealed that the Bradens' deaths had been unintentional. The night before the family was found dead, she had stolen 500 dollars from the house. With this money, Thorn intended to leave Portsmouth and make her way to New York City. Thorn deposited laudanum in the coffee to put the family to sleep during her getaway, not kill them. Nonetheless, the jury of Portsmouth sentenced Thorn to death. Thorn became very ill after the trial, and stayed in her prison cell for months awaiting her execution. The town never received a chance to hang Maria Black Thorn though, as a guard found her dead in her prison cell on March 20, 1855. She had committed suicide.","Bizarre murders like the Thorn case rattled the security of a community. The fear and confusion that arose left the town in an unsettled state. People grew suspicious of each other, and the citizens lost their mutual trust. Thorn's trial reveals the necessary actions taken by a local court to stabilize the community after such an event. Ill and poor, Thorn had no intentions of murdering the family. Nonetheless, the court gave the only sentence that could possibly compensate for the death of Portsmouth citizens-death. Though Thorn was a woman, she was an outsider to the community, and the court's objective was to restore peace and trust within the town. Therefore, no lenience was shown. ","The Thorn case correlates to a situation that Rothman examines in Notorious in the Neighborhood. In the case of Peggy, a sexually abused slave who was an accomplice in her master's murder, similarities arise between the two situations. Constantly raped by her master, Peggy lived a harsh life, and probably deserved to murder her master. However, the testimonies of the involved slaves leave uncertainty surrounding Peggy's role in the murder. Similar to the Thorn case, doubt surrounds the motive of the murder, and the woman's lifestyle is almost unbearable. After her sentencing, many citizens petitioned for her acquittal, citing her living condition and uncertain role in her master's death. Nonetheless, the court of New Kent County, Virginia hung Peggy to restore harmony to the town. Both cases reveal a local court's social duty to re-establish order in the community. In tight-knit communities, it was the court's role to maintain justice and stability within society. Violent acts of crime weakened people's feeling of security, and increased their suspicions of outsiders. In Thorn's case, the people of Portsmouth were more fearful of outsiders to their community; in Peggy's, her master's murder brought slave owners' fears of slave retaliation to reality. Citizens had sympathy for both women, but the death sentence was the only option-lenience was not. Though the accused were both women, the community took precedence. In order to uphold the safety and security of the society, both courts took the necessary action by issuing death sentences to the women.

Also, the Arkansas family was wealthy, and this woman came from a plantation, which owned around 200 slaves at the war's commencement."," Levering's proposal was initially rejected by Mrs. S? who even cried at first sight of Levering and during various parts of their tense conversation.She feared he would take her house and her livelihood from her in order to benefit the Union army with a residence full of supplies and food.In addition, Mrs. S-- had already planned to provide her only spare room for her cousin who was returning from the Confederate army after receiving a severe injury."," Levering flatly informed her that this ex-Rebel soldier would not be moving into her home.Levering's adamancy eventually coerced her into submission; Mrs. S-- had no choice but to agree to co-inhabitance with this northern family.Levering asked her at what time they would dine every night; when her answer did not satisfy his schedule, Levering mandated a later supper time.At this point, Mrs. S-- was very discontented and greatly feared what others in society would think of her housing a Yankee colonel."," Eventually, a friendship grew between the Levering family, Mrs. S-- and her Arkansas lady friends who visited the house often.Mrs. Levering and Mrs. S-- became very intimate and both women were melancholy when the Union army left Little Rock and, in turn, the Leverings returned to Indiana. Levering notes his gratification of witnessing an earnest expression of regrets for my leaving, as were manifest, upon my coming. "," Dallas T. Herndon narrates that on September 10, 1863, Little Rock, Arkansas became a Union-controlled city, and everything north of the Arkansas River fell under northern control.Consequently, the inhabitants of the city adapted to northern presence, but the hearts of many Little Rock residents were overflowing with animosity and disdain.When Levering demanded to take up residence with an Arkansas lady and her family, the northern power over Little Rock, and other southern cities, was quite evident.Women, in particular, experienced Union occupation, as they remained at home while their husbands fought in the war.Many homes housed Union soldiers who entreated these women to accommodate them.Levering, for example, listened disconcertingly to a southern woman?s wishes.According to Herndon, women in Little Rock continued to aid the Confederate cause, sewing and helping as much as possible; and a monument in Little Rock even honors the ?Mothers of Arkansas? for their sacrifices and labor.Both northerners and southerners alike found their new relationships challenging and confusing, but they adapted to the times.As the Civil War dragged on, southerners found themselves living side-by-side with Union soldiers, as southern cities fell across all parts of the South."," The peculiar relationship between these two families illustrates the possible transgression of regional and ideological differences that many people faced during the Civil War.Levering is shocked that a clergyman?s family could descend from a plantation bearing such a large quantity of slaves and also fight with religious zeal for slavery?s continuance; the cultural differences between Levering and his southern tenants reflect the tensions, which were widespread during the occupation of an antebellum city.Their flourishing friendship, however, offered hope that large ideological differences could be bridged and the Union eventually might be reunited."],"display_date":"September 10, 1863 - December 31, 1865","search_date":"1864-11-04","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2503,"title":"A Union Soldier and a Southern Belle Meet on a Trolley Car\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-01","end_date":"1865-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Looking around the city of Baton Rouge, one could easily see the distress the people of the city were facing.

Rich men were also able to buy others to substitute their spot in the troops. There were also heavy taxes on farms, even on farmers who had little to spare.

Would the Chicago news reach her parents back home in Tuscumbia before she made it home to tell them in person? On May 17, 1890, the Chicago Tribune ran a special on the miraculous case of Helen Keller; a blind, deaf and dumb child from Alabama. Keller's wealthy parents had sent her up north to a special institution for the blind. According to the article, Keller's parents had heard of the great progress made by another student, Laura Bridgman, and hoped for the same results for Helen. Her success however, far exceeded that of Ms. Bridgman and in the first year Helen acquired a vocabulary of 3,000 words. Her teacher, Miss Fuller, gave her instruction as to how to place her tongue and the child would feel of her teacher's throat and lips when she was talking, thus learning the mechanical elements of articulation. The Tribune reported that Helen subsequently spoke quite readily and praised her remarkable accomplishments. After announcing Helen's feat to the entire city of Chicago, the Tribune concluded, The child has kept her wonderful recovery of speech secret, as she wishes to surprise her parents, whom she is to visit in the South soon. "," Born a healthy baby in Tuscumbia on June 27, 1880, a fever rendered Keller deaf and blind at the age of eighteen months old. Despite all odds, Helen Keller had achieved an international reputation even before studying under Sarah Fuller in 1890. By 1888, at the tender age of eight, Keller was recognized in the Chicago Tribune for her wonderful power. The article spoke of Helen's education in Tuscumbia with Miss Anne Mausfueld Sullivan. At the age of seven, Helen's parents hired Miss Sullivan to teach the child in Alabama. Subsequently, Helen traveled north to continue her education with another teacher, Sarah Fuller of the Horace Mann School. Helen Keller's story became a widely recognized and heartwarming tale by the turn of the century and her dedication to learning earned her both a spot in the public eye and that of history. "," Helen Keller's first educational breakthrough occured at home in Tuscumbia. Why then would her parents then send her away from Alabama to continue her learning? The Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind was established in the 1860s and served as a special needs school close to home. And yet, Keller traveled north to further her education at various private institutions including the prestigious Horace Mann School. Though Keller proved an exceptional case with respect to her achievements in education, she was not alone in her journey north to further her schooling. Many wealthy Alabama natives sent their children north at the end of the nineteenth century in search of higher education. The ill-defined school system and educational deficiencies throughout Alabama led many to look outside the state for higher educational purposes. Furthermore, racial segregation throughout the South created similar education problems as those faced in Alabama. State biographer William Rogers observes, In Alabama, as in the rest of the South, the problems of educational support were compounded by the decision to establish parallel institutions for whites and blacks. Due to racial tensions throughout the South, many southern families turned north for the best educational opportunities. If families had the private funds to find the best education available, many southerners looked north during times of educational and racial turmoil in the South.

Passing by a young lady on the street one fine afternoon, an elderly Alabama politician caught an eyeful. Was she wearing an article of male clothing? The <em>Greeneville Advocate</em> documented the growing women's fashion trend with a sense of urgency: THE BLOOMER IN ALABAMA. The article informed the readership of the so-called Alabama Bill in the December 9, 1896 edition of the Advocate. An unnamed, yet old-fashioned member of the Alabama legislature had drafted the bill in hopes that immediate action would end the growing ladies' fashion trend du jour. The operational definition of bloomer was of particular concern at the time. The Alabama Bill leaves no doubt that it aims at that article especially, and yet a general consensus as to the bloomers' rightful wearer did not exist. Was it, in fact, an article of male clothing or simply inappropriate women's apparel? The Alabama legislator knew for sure that a woman wearing an article of male clothing violated Biblical code and quoted Deuteronomy accordingly: The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to the man; neither the shall a man put on a woman's garment; for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord. "," The mounting concern over the bloomer in Alabama had its root in southern conservatism. Fashion in the South mirrored the southern way of life and changed accordingly to reflect the times. During the antebellum years fashion helped preserve southern values in a time of rapid change and national fragmentation. In a time of southern instability during the Civil War, women played an important role maintaining southern tradition through fashion. The southern woman's clothing became tighter, heavier, and longer in attempts to idealize her heightened morals and purity. Women in both Alabama and the larger Southern culture were seen as a paragon of chastity, piety, and virtue. They were expected to be submissive in all respects to their husbands and lead quiet lives raising the children of the South. However, the arrival of the bloomer in Alabama in the late 1890s brought a change to southern fashion. Social historian Jeanette Lauer notes, The decades following the Civil War witnessed a growing democratization in southern fashion. According to Lauer, this democratization of fashion mitigated against the presumed uniqueness of the southern way of life... In The final decades of the nineteenth century and continuing throughout the twentieth centuries, southern fashion increasingly reflected national trends. The bloomer provides one example of a national phenomenon that extended south and into Alabama. "," The bloomer in Alabama signified societal change in the South. In his appeal to Biblical codes, the old-fashioned Alabama legislator demonstrated his staunch southern conservatism. However, by the late nineteenth century, the link between conservative values and accordingly conservative fashion had significantly weakened. On the other hand, perhaps only southern women felt relief in casting aside the shackles of fashion. After all, for decades women fell prey to the oppressive conservative southern values, which in turn dictated fashion. The unbearable weight of hoop skirts, the excruciating pain of corsets, and the insufferable summer days spent in layered petticoats all contributed to the popularity of the bloomer. The bloomer offered a chance for freedom at the end of an era characterized by male domination. At the end of the nineteenth century, fashion proved a juxtaposition between traditional male conservatism and a new female liberalism.

Recently re-stationed to the city from New Orleans, he found the best hotel in town uncomfortable and unsuitable for a Union officer. In January 1865, Levering encountered a desirable solution. Levering casually visited a local, celebrated lady of society, a Mrs. S--, and informed her that he and his family would be moving in to her house. Levering cited several reasons in his diary as to his selection of this residence. Firstly, it was the comfortable looking home of a clergy man. Levering was informed that Mrs. S--'s religious husband was away from home fighting for the Rebel army. Also, the Arkansas family was wealthy, and this woman came from a plantation, which owned around 200 slaves at the war's commencement. Levering's proposal was initially rejected by Mrs. S-- who even cried at first sight of Levering and during various parts of their tense conversation. She feared he would take her house and her livelihood from her in order to benefit the Union army with a residence full of supplies and food. In addition, Mrs. S-- had already planned to provide her only spare room for her cousin who was returning from the Confederate army after receiving a severe injury. Levering flatly informed her that this ex-Rebel soldier would not be moving into her home. Levering eventually coerced her into submission; Mrs. S-- had no choice but to agree to co-inhabitance with this northern family. Levering asked her at what time they would dine every night; when her answer did not satisfy his schedule, Levering mandated a later supper time. At this point, Mrs. S-- was very discontented and greatly feared what others in society would think of her housing a Yankee colonel."," Eventually, a friendship grew between the Levering family, Mrs. S-- and her Arkansas lady friends who visited the house often. Mrs. Levering and Mrs. S-- became very intimate and both women were melancholy when the Union army left Little Rock and, in turn, the Leverings returned to Indiana. Levering notes his gratification of witnessing an earnest expression of regrets for my leaving, as were manifest, upon my coming. Dallas T. Herndon narrates that on September 10, 1863, Little Rock, Arkansas became a Union-controlled city, and everything north of the Arkansas River fell under northern control. Consequently, the inhabitants of the city adapted to northern presence, but the hearts of many Little Rock residents were overflowing with animosity and disdain. When Levering demanded to take up residence with an Arkansas lady and her family, the northern power over Little Rock, and other southern cities, was quite evident. Women, in particular, experienced Union occupation, as they remained at home while their husbands fought in the war. Many homes housed Union soldiers who entreated these women to accommodate them. Levering, for example, listened disconcertingly to a southern woman's wishes. According to Herndon, women in Little Rock continued to aid the Confederate cause, sewing and helping as much as possible; and a monument in Little Rock even honors the Mothers of Arkansas for their sacrifices and labor. Both northerners and southerners alike found their new relationships challenging and confusing, but they adapted to the times. As the Civil War dragged on, southerners found themselves living side-by-side with Union soldiers, as southern cities fell across all parts of the South. he peculiar relationship between these two families illustrates the possible transgression of regional and ideological differences that many people faced during the Civil War. Levering is shocked that a clergyman's family could descend from a plantation bearing such a large quantity of slaves and also fight with religious zeal for slavery's continuance; the cultural differences between Levering and his southern tenants reflect the tensions, which were widespread during the occupation of an antebellum city. Their flourishing friendship, however, offered hope that large ideological differences could be bridged and the Union eventually might be reunited."],"display_date":"January 1, 1865 - January 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-01-15","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2564,"title":"Ex-Mistresses and Ex-Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-01-07","end_date":"1866-01-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Louisa Minor's life was changing all the time. More and more of her former slaves left her land as 1866 began. She felt sad to see people go whom she had known all her life. Louisa Minor mentioned in her diary the change in everyday life as the ex-slaves departed. She stated that though ice was available outside, no one brought it inside, because there were no servants left to do the work. She wrote as if that kind of labor was totally foreign to her. Louisa Minor respected the right of her former slaves to leave the plantation, but she had trouble seeing her ex-house slaves go. When she described her children's nanny, Nancy, as well as other former house slaves named Mammy, and Aunt Peggy, she revealed the reason for her sadness, constant proximity. White slave-owners gained closer relationships with their slaves when those slaves were working alongside them. When her freed slaves left her land, Louisa Minor and her children found the absence of those they spent time with everyday to be the hardest to bear. ","This relationship between black and white women was a common element of slavery because of the nature of work done in whites' houses. This does not mean that close proximity always turned into friendship, however. These relationships were sometimes worse for slaves because a cruel master could deride the slave all the time if they were always around. Thus Louisa Minor's pain at seeing her ex-house-slaves leave was an expression of the relationships by which whites took advantage of slaves while acting as if they were doing it out of good-natured paternalism.

At that time few Women's Property Laws existed in Virginia. Thus Mrs. Rives may have wished to keep most of the family land securely in male hands when she wrote her will. Her will is significant because it demonstrates the complexities of women's property in the Virginia legal system before the passage of Women's Property Laws. The Virginia legislature did not a pass a full Married Women's Act until 1877. By 1875, the year Judith Rives wrote her will, there was only a preliminary law in place protecting a wife's pre-matrimonial property from her husband's creditors. Thus, though progress had been made for women's property rights by the time of Mrs. Rives wrote her will, leaving land in her daughters hands have could still resulted in the loss of that property to her daughter's future husband.

A large amount of railroad graft involving carpetbaggers also took place that year. The Panic of 1873 made hurt the struggling companies even more. The Richmond and Danville Railroad was one of many southern railroads that Mrs. Brown went on her trip. That year the railroad company registered costs at 61.8 percent of receipts. Railroad travel in south was very significant because southern railroads were absolutely inadequate in comparison with the North. Their lesser capabilities were clearly evident during Civil War and prolonged economic recovery after the Civil War. Mrs. Brown's railroad trip in 1868 exemplified the most modern means of travel, and the possibilities for modernization in the South.

The abundance of disease contributed greatly to a negative stereotype of the entire region. Yellow fever and malaria were the two most terrifying diseases that were prone to the South. During the Civil War, more Americans died of disease than from wounds received in battle. Though this was common for wars before the twentieth century, the sheer number of sick soldiers bears some relation to the diseases prevalent in the South. Union soldiers suffered particularly from malaria because they had no immunity to it. After the Civil War, diseases like yellow fever and malaria made the health situation worse. The overwhelming poverty in the states of the former Confederacy brought about a spike in disease. Hookworm and tuberculosis also crept up after the Civil War as the post-war South gave birth to cities with poor public health, and widespreadrural poverty. E.J.

Unlike the stereotypical image of the upper class southern belle isolated on a large plantation, Fannie studied Latin and Greek every day until she could leave the farm and attend the prestigious Mary Sharpe School in Winchester, Tennessee.  Her father, a wealthy planter, and brother opposed her decision due to her young age, but she persisted until they sent her to college.  Fannie's pictures and biographies of women's suffrage leaders such as Susan B. Anthony showed that she intended to use her education.Mary Sharpe College in Winchester, Tennessee opened in 1853 with the statement a statement of purpose that read: educate the mothers and you educate the world.  Even though this statement of purpose seemed patronizing, Mary Sharpe offered women the best classical education in the South.  It was a competitive college that required that young women take four years of Latin, Greek, and mathematics. Only the wealthiest planter families could afford to send their daughters to an institution like Mary Sharpe.  Some planters sent their daughters to college to study Latin and Greek as a symbol of a high level of sophistication and class that would elevate their daughter's status in the marriage market. Before the War, high cotton prices meant that college women returned to the plantation for a life of domesticity.   After the Civil War, however, tough economic realties meant that girls like Fannie went to college to prepare themselves to earn a living through teaching or nursing.   Although Fannie may have been an exception, she studied hard to get into college in order to seek her independence from a domestic life on her father's farm.  Contrary to the stereotype of the southern belle, women's higher education in the South developed faster than other regions in the United States during nineteenth century.  By 1860, North Carolina had thirteen female colleges and just six male colleges.  Georgia also had at least ten female colleges.  Academically, female colleges were equivalent to male colleges in math and science with the exception that women studied more classical languages, art and music.  While wealthy families throughout the South sent their daughters  to college as a status symbol, Fannie used the opportunity to become more independent and perhaps challenge male dominated professions.

While style began to spread across the nation- the South was not always the most up to date.

They dresses were purchased in New York however as the train stopped at each station, she felt her attire gradually becoming outdated with each successive mile. Everyone she saw was wearing newer and more elegant dresses than she. While still trying to keep up with the times, it was nearly impossible for women of the plantations of the South.

However, as the war progressed, many men felt that they would be almost better served at their homes, protecting one piece at a time.

Boynton in a hot air balloon above the clouds. The bride was an orphan, born in Northampton County, Virginia, and adopted by Mrs. J.L. West of St. Louis as an infant. With over 6,000 spectators present, the bridal party left the Fifth Avenue Hotel for Central Park. His sister and the owner of the balloon accompanied the young bride and her fiance for the ceremony. They floated away from the Park, exchanging vows and signing the marriage contract while ballooning through the sky. Such a fairy tale wedding made reality for a young girl who once had no hopes for such a comfortable future. Social status was determined in large part by family and as an orphan she was left in the cold. She had little hope for education, medical care, and would have most likely been forced to work in a factory to support herself even as a teen. She was so lucky to avoid all of that. ","During the years preceding the war, slavery continued to fade away and forced by low profitability of small scale farming, many men were forced to find other means of work. Often these farmers could not produce enough substantial crops to feed their families, much less enough to commercially sell at market. Livestock also required larger treks of land to sustain profitability. Fishing and hunting were often alternate ways that the poor obtained food. Economic expansion created a great struggle between the classes. As lumbering, steel, and iron industries emerged, employers began to look past racial lines, hiring whites and blacks as equals. Many men who saw their skin color as the only valuable asset they possessed were stripped of their pride when forced to work side by side with newly freed African Americans. ","Occupation, residence, religious affiliation, and such too often determined much of one's societal value. The poor worked for minimal wages while the socially elite could afford luxuries such as Mary West's wedding dress made of the richest of poplin, trimmed with rich velvet, with a silk hat and gloves to match. Wealthy southern aristocracy shared many of the same privileges as those of the north, but often gaining their wealth by use of slaves. Many owned plantations, but other chose to invest in industrial endeavors. The Duke and Winston families prospered from the tobacco market in North Carolina and Mary Ann Todd, wife of Abraham Lincoln was from a Kentucky family that made its money from banking. Southern wealth was no longer the result of solely slave labor.","Mary West's marriage to Dr. John Boynton was certainly one of exceptional status. They were both highly educated. She attended Monticello Seminary in Illinois and was quite talented in music and drawing. John graduated from a medical institution and was well known for his lectures in geology. He also at one time held government office. Their wedding was elegant and very original even by today's standards. Her dress was rose in color and the hot air balloon was adorned with lace curtains and tassels in the colors of the American flag. After landing at sunset, they took a train back to the Fifth Avenue Hotel to share their first night as husband and wife. Mary West was fortunately raised by a loving mother that was more than able to give her all the comforts that she would have never experienced as an orphan on the eastern shore of Virginia. While Mary West's economic prosperity did not make her happiness, it was far more promising than the life that she was born into.

The Richmond Daily Examiner reported that the city council of Richmond now required that Hotel-keepers, restaurant owners, beer saloons, or any place that sells spirits, beer, or cider must close every day at ten o'clock at night and may not open at all on Sundays. Violators of this ordinance were subject to fines of twenty dollars a day. "," In the absence of copious amounts of potable water, Americans consumed alcohol in large quantities during the nineteenth century, becoming a strong target for social reform. Alcoholism continued to become more and more common - husbands abusing or raping their wives, drinking away all of their pay, leaving their children with nothing to eat... and eventually women had had enough. "," Women held an important role in the beginning of the temperance movement. They increasingly became discontented with their place in society. They formed prayer groups and rallied against saloons, preaching that temperance meant purity, marital stability, economic improvement and prosperity, and religious salvation. Women wanted to resettle their lives and rid society of the substance that caused such economic disparity. "," Petitioning continued. Newspapers often ran stories of bar fights, domestic violence, and street scrambles caused by alcohol. Political cartoons published in magazines such as HarpWeek, featured wives with their young children, minus their drunkard father who never returned to provide for his family, leaving them in the cold. Temperance reformers insisted on total abstinence from alcohol and demanded legal prohibition. Many brewers and liquor producers organized public campaigns against women's rights because they knew that once women had a vote, prohibition would not be far behind. "," Temperance became a fight for peace on the home front. Many women felt that their lives had been disrupted by the repercussions of alcoholism. Some Christians believed drinking was sinful against God. Families were falling apart. Something had to change. "," Richmond passed the no sale of alcohol on Sunday's law to appease those who favored prohibition. Limiting the sale of spirits was at least a step in the right direction for reducing the stresses alcohol caused. Many were angered by the passage of the bill. It decreased profits for restaurants and bar owners. Most viewed this act as the precursor to nation-wide prohibition."," Temperance began by encouraging moderate use of hard liquor, but the movement turned quickly into complete elimination. Prohibition by law became a hot topic in every political campaign at every level of government. The Prohibition Party was created to support a candidate for the prohibition efforts. Religions divided between wets and dries. Strong Methodists, Baptists, and Quakers were strongly in support of temperance, while the wets including Episcopalians and Catholics, did not believe that the government should have the power to define morality. "," The war temporarily interrupted the movement simply because everyone was preoccupied with a larger struggle. Nevertheless, after the war, the Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded in 1874 forming one of the largest woman's organizations in the world. Due-paying membership exceeded 200,000 in the late 1800s. Its message was education, if it could 'get to the children' it could create a 'dry' sentiment leading to prohibition."," Temperance was a nationwide issue after the war. Virginia was not alone in restricting the purchases of alcohol. The numbers of women who joined temperance was overwhelming, proving their rising concerns. Women slowly started to gain a voice in government and not long after in 1919, nationwide prohibition came into effect with the passage of the eighteenth amendment.

Louisiana wrote, I begin to be quite impatient for your return, as I am anxious to return to my studies... This demonstrates the close relationship of General Cocke and his daughter. He also apparently, served as her tutor while he was home. Families in the antebellum South were close- knit structures, because of the distance between neighbors. The detachment created less opportunity for friendship outside of the family, and produced families that were a close unit."," According to Charles Wilson and William Ferris, the father acted as the head of the household and was responsible for the overall support of the family. All of his family was identified through him. Children had a special relationship with their father even though he was absent most of the time, especially in the case of General Cocke. The legendary Southern father was much like the myth of the Southern gentleman: well- educated and genteel, with a firm and commanding personality, which demanded deference from all family members and from nonaristocratic whites.

Children's roles were oftentimes separated by gender by the time they were pre-teens. ","Even though parents were not always the primary caregivers in wealthy southern families, they became closer as they grew past the care giving age. Parents cared about their children's futures and how they learned to interact with others. Since family farms and plantations were spread out in the South, people did not come in close contact with others on a regular basis. This isolation led families to develop closer relationships. The strict rules at home encourage family members to respect each other and to know their place in the family.

Johns requested the presence of John Ambler and his family to their Tuesday morning wedding in the area of Louisa and Hanover counties. The bride's family sent out the invitation and they requested that the Ambler family attend the wedding. The ceremony was scheduled for Tuesday morning at nine am. "," Weddings traditionally took place within the community and then the couple stayed within the community after their marriage as well. Localism and pride were major components in this society as a result of the way of life in the antebellum South. People of the antebellum South rarely knew anyone but their neighbors and stayed within their community for their entire life, even after marriage. This action brought about local pride and a close-knit community. ","Because farms and plantations were spread out, people oftentimes had to come to common areas to run errands, go to church, and just be in contact with other people. Community members were often on a first name basis with other community members because of constant interaction with each other within different aspects of the community, from seeing others at the market to arranging marriages between their families. "," Feeling a strong sense of community, people wanted to share their ceremonies and celebrations, such as the wedding invitation in the Ambler Papers, with their entire community. Many counties in the early nineteenth-century South, including Louisa and Hanover counties, did not have a regional newspaper, so many community members were invited through personalized invitations. The family of the bride used invitations as a way of announcing the celebration since they could not put an advertisement in the newspaper."," Connecting families within a county was a major theme in early nineteenth century marriages and many people strove to do this as often as possible to pull their assets together to create more land, more enslaved people and ultimately more profit. The marriage between Helen Lane and Arthur Johns was a community event in which many people would have shared the event with them; they were also combining their resources. British law transplanted itself into antebellum southern society in terms of marriage. Once a woman got married, she gave over all of her property rights to her new husband and he could then earn income off of her land as well as his. The parents of the bride literally gave their daughter away. She is transferred from being inferior in one family to being inferior in another, except with the responsibility of running a household. "," This marriage between the Johns and Lane family demonstrates a way of life within the planter class of the Antebellum South. The ceremony would have brought the community together to celebrate the uniting of two community families. The wedding would have been the place to be because most people in the small community would have been invited and there would have been nothing else for the community members to do.

They sent flowers down to the representatives who were supportive of temperance and prayed together that it would pass. After the bill passed, the women made sure that they were on record saying that the Women's Christian Temperance Union [was] bitterly opposed to the wine and cider clause and really was aiming for complete prohibition. Thus, the women in this group were successful in getting temperance put in place but did not achieve total prohibition.","Evangelism had an important impact on society in Georgia during this time period. Christian women had joined together to form the Women's Christian Temperance Union to try to promote temperance in society. As Cooper and Terill noted in their book, <em>The American South: A History</em>, Southern women formed groups within their religious organizations and used them as a means for protest and actions against a whole range of social ills. The Christian women in Georgia began their social protest against alcohol. Jeannie Whayne writes in her chapter that the historian Anne Firor Scott thought that the formation of women's groups allowed them more power and the ability to influence movements in the Progressive Era. Thus, women were beginning to play a larger role in society and were beginning to impact their government. Instead of allowing men to make all of their legal decisions for them and staying within the realm of the household, women were joining groups together and influencing legislation. According to Whayne's chapter, the historian Jean Friedman feels that the evangelical nature of society initially hindered women in their pursuit for more gender equality since, for example, women had to give all fundraising revenue to the men in the church. It is significant that Southern women were able to overcome the patriarchal practices of the South in order to form women's groups that could influence the government. Women were forced to take a more active role in their households after their communities were destroyed in the war. This activity carried out of their households and into the community and even politics.

Penn, her owner, badly injured Hanna, an African American, who was very lucky to have survived. The rape was not the only disaster in this story. The biggest mystery of all was the disappearance of Lina Hanna's mother and sister. Many suspect that Penn, in order to silence the witnesses, murdered both women. Some townsfolk believed that he discarded of the bodies in another state. Regardless, Penn was successful in covering up his actions and destroyed any way of himself being accused of such a violent crime. Penn terrified Hanna's mother and sister, and they did not want to accuse him in fear of the possible consequences. ","White masters raping their young black workers was a frequent occurrence, before, during and after the Civil War. This instance involving Hanna and Penn was just one of many situations in which sex crossed the color line. Some were voluntary actions of both parties, while some, such as the story of Lina Hanna, were rapes. ","Beginning around the 1890s and continuing on throughout the decades, interracial sexual relations and marriage became less prevalent. Whites opposed interracial relations because they believed that venereal disease was widely spread in blacks; this discouraged white men from approaching black women. Black men and women began to try to stop the abuse; whenever a black woman would enter a store where a white man would be, there would be a group of black men waiting outside for her. "," Although its prevalence declined, interracial sex did not stop; it moved from the plantations to the towns, where there were more opportunities for a sexual act to go unnoticed. The populations in towns were constantly changing, and the chance of an intimate moment between two people of different races, who were unacquainted, was far more common without the possibility of affecting the lives of either person. "," The rape of Lina Hanna is different from the trend at the time, because it occurred on a plantation. This specific instance became less common after slavery ended and time went on. Although the trend was changing from plantations to towns and less defined areas, rape was still happening between the white masters and their black slaves.

The first lynching happened just five days into the new year. Each week the names, race, alleged crimes, place lynched, and date of the lynching were listed for all those who had been lynched during that year.

Two of the 28 were women, Mollie Smith and Amanda Franks, both from Jefferson, Alabama. They were accused of using poison and as a result were lynched. Out of all 28 of the people who were lynched, only one survived, William Clement, a black man of Cambell County, Virginia, who was accused of striking a white man.","Lynching increased in the late 1800s at a steady rate. During the 1890s, according to William Brundage, a growing number of conservative whites, concerned that lynching threatened the social tranquility and economic future of the state, agreed that lynching must end. They discussed whether certain crimes deserved mob vengeance or if they should be handled at the courts' discretion. Lynching affected the region, the state and the south as a whole, as it disrupted the economy. "," During the early 1890s, African Americans debated how to protest using appropriate measures and desperately searched for a way to protect themselves from violence. A picture depicted a few lynched men in the Richmond Planet, the question is posed: Shall this barbarity continue until the God of retribution marshals his strength against the barbarians? The idea growing in Virginia was that lynching was unnecessary and need not be tolerated. Some whites also hoped to end lynching and the violence, believing that it hurt their economy. Many blacks and whites did not want lynching to continue, and yet the there was an increase in the numbers lynched in the 1890s. "," Lynching increased in the south after 1880 through the 1950s, where 80 percent of the nation's lynchings occurred. The number lynched each year did not drop below 100 until several years after the turn of the century. Lynching was a community event, in which mothers and children watched, and the lynchers were very rarely arrested. According to William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E.

In addition to taking jobs, women were still expected to take care of their homes. William Cooper and Thomas Terrill called this role domestic feminism.

Lee's surrender.Sharitt saw no way that his company's retreat into Texas would sustain the crumbling Confederacy, and he chose to aid hiswife and childreninstead."," Southerners were quickly losing hope for a victory in the later years of the war; many, like Sharitt, wanted an immediate cessation of fighting, even if it meant surrendering to the North.According to John B. Boles, the desire for survival was more important than the national cause of the Confederacy.As the Federal forces overran and decimated the Cotton South, many southern soldiers recognized the nearing defeat.Boles notes that the plummeting morale and the looming defeat led many southerners to desert the army.Joe Gray Taylor states that many Louisiana soldiers deserted the Confederate cause shortly after the Union army dominated southern strongholds.White southerners chose between protecting one's family at home or fighting in the Rebel army.Sharitt himself yearned for honor in warfare but recognized that his family's honor and livelihood were of supreme importance.","--J.R."],"display_date":"December 4, 1864 - December 31, 1865","search_date":"1865-06-18","locations":[{"id":5635,"lat":31.2197514707,"lng":-92.724986908,"zoom":8,"place":"RAPIDES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2719,"title":"The Post-War Union and Reflective Poetry\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-09-14","end_date":"1873-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" The famous poem by Francis Miles Finch entitled The Blue and the Grey commemorates soldiers who fought for both sides during the Civil War.<em>The Planters' Banner,</em> a local newspaper of Franklin, LA, published this poem on September 14, 1867.William T. Palfrey included the memorial poem in his plantation diary.The poem contrasts the North and the South, the robings of glory (the North) and the gloom of defeat (the South), and the dead and the living.Images of death and the grave beneath the sod and the dew run throughout.The poem also paints the vivid, gory picture of warfare, describing the flow of inland river where the iron fleets had once traversed and the grass beneath which soldiers lie in their graves.The rivers are no longer sullied by the red flow of soldiers' blood, and now flowers bloom around the scenes of battle.The poem shows life after war: it transitions from the gloom of defeat into a sunny spring day full of blossoms blossoming for all.While the seasons change and the weather varies, the Love and tears for the Blue, Tears and love for the Grey remain."," The poem memorializes the soldiers who fought and died for both sides; sentimental poems remember these fallen heroes.Yet, The Blue and the Grey challenges the pointlessness of the war itself, probing, Sadly, but no with upbraiding, The generous deed was done, In the storm of the years are fading, No braves battle was won.To Finch, little honor came from the Civil War, merely death for soldiers fighting for their causes.The poem paradoxically and simultaneously eulogizes and glorifies the Civil War in its pointless destruction and its grandiose battles. In memoriam of these soldiers of both the Union and Confederate armies, Finch paints a picture of common loss, equal splendor, and the remembrance of soldiers by visiting their graves."," Finch's poem was written to honor the universality of mourning in the North and South in the years preceding the war's end.Through the acknowledgment of mutual sympathies, he epitomized the new national tradition of memorializing the soldiers.According to David W. Blight, the poem was published in<em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> in Boston, and was very popular. Recitals of the poem continued for years to come at Decoration Days and Blue-Gray reunions.At these events, men and especially women commemorated the lost soldiers by visiting and decorating gravesites, convening at graveyards, and holding communal memorial services to honor those who fought for either side.Thepoem reflects the emerging reunionism that these events created.By 1866, southerners had founded memorial associations, with a majority of their constituents being women.These Memorial Days, described in detail by Blight, grew in popularity, and the North soon had their own."," Memorialization intertwined with civic life.Blight reveals that the memorial days were a means of coping with Reconstruction and its debilitating consequences on the South.In a different way, memorial days were a small tie to the ideals white southerners had been forced to desert in their defeat and in Reconstruction.Not only had slavery ceased to exist, but also the Confederacy, their nation of four years, faded with Robert E. Lee's 1865 surrender.According to Charles Vincent, the end of the war saw the end of the world as they knew it.Demoralization and social dislocation encompassed many white southerners' post-war lives.Some southerners still held on to their unique southern identity.Blight narrates that in John A. Bilmer claimed, The world had <em>conceded</em> to Southern courage, Southern devotion, Southern skills, and Southern power, as displayed in that war.Southern citizens still lived under the reign of Reconstruction and felt the aftermath and destruction caused by the war.Memorializing dead Rebel soldiers was a way of channeling this grief into a positive source, visiting the graveyards and battlefields in order to move forward, like Finch challenges his readers."," The North, too, began eulogizing the dead Union soldiers in much the same way.According to Blight, in May 1868 and 1869, General John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, asked for all Union veterans to honor the dead soldiers by conducting ceremonies and visiting gravesites.Northern memorials grew to encapsulate fallen southerners as well as black and Union soldiers.Finch's poem was a stepping stone to a reunified nation.","--J.R."],"display_date":"September 14, 1867 - December 31, 1873","search_date":"1870-11-06","locations":[{"id":5519,"lat":32.1808059275,"lng":-91.7158468561,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2723,"title":"Louisiana Lady Battles with Regional and Human Attraction\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-10-17","end_date":"1863-11-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" As a young twenty-two year old Louisiana woman, Miss Sidney Harding was completely caught off-guard when her prosperous family had to flee their plantation because of Yankee pressure and become Civil War refugees in DeSoto Parish, LA.Harding was not unlike other southern women: she faced internal and external conflicts throughout her years as a refugee.OnOctober 17, 1863, Harding commented on the disdain she felt at the sight of other girls being friendly to northern soldiers and the disloyalty of the lower parishes, but she would redefine what was acceptable in a war environment with her former country."," On November 4, 1863, Harding met a handsome man, a cavalier, born in New York who had only lived in the South for six years.He was remarkably handsome, tall with black eyes and dark skin.She boldly invited him to stay the night at her house, an offer he graciously declined the offer, saying that he would love to visit again another night instead.The two passed most of the night talking with one another, enjoying each other's company in the midst of wartime struggles. The next day, Harding could not take her mind off this gentleman, who she admitted to having second thoughts about.Her friends wondered if it was acceptable of her to be speaking with a northerner who had lived in the South for only a few years before the Civil War began.She, however, convincingly rationalized her fondness for this former northern gentleman.First, he had fought and been injured at the battle of Shiloh (fighting for the Confederate army) and was the son of an Episcopal clergyman.She viewed these qualities as honorable and pleasant.In addition, Harding described the man as a good southerner with elegant manners and courtesy.Harding delighted in this chance encounter with a handsome gentleman during her stressful refuge in DeSoto Parish."," According to William J.

In 1891 a girl married at the age of 13, which showed that the year 1891 was starting off at a fast pace and that marriage rates did not seem to be declining. "," Marriage rates were increasing not only in Virginia but all over the South as well. According to Margaret Farley, marriage functioned to determine relationships between families, establish inheritance lines, create and reinforce gender roles, circumcise sexual activity, determine rights and duties in sexual relations, and provide for the legitimacy and rearing of children. Marriage had long since changed from being for meeting the needs of families and kinship groups-economic, political, and social needs to the need for love and affection. Marriage for convenience and for other reasons, such as land acquirement and the joining of families, still occurred, but the primary purpose shifted. "," Marriage became very important after the war and it became closely tied with religion. Marriage rates increased as Accomack showed in 1890. Many men chastised themselves for having impure thoughts of women and thought that the Holy Spirit should be directing all their thoughts. The thought at this time was that God would provide everything you needed, and one should long for anything but be comforted that God is always there.

Once word got out that a black man was having a relationship with a white woman, the people began to speculate that he must be forcing Miss Corder to have sexual relations with him. Arthur approached Miss Corder and convinced her to run away with him. Whether she did it willingly or not, it was to no avail.

The transition from the slavery system to this kind of caste system, as C.

Woodward mentions that it sometimes seemed that race relations at this point had deteriorated since the time of slavery instead of improving. It is unknown in this particular instance whether Arthur Jordan was guilty of raping Miss Corder and forcing her to do things against her will or if she willingly engaged.

On the night of his execution, Pratt was provided with spiritual advice in preparation for his execution.  While get readying himself for death, Pratt confessed to the crime for the first time.  At 12:00 a.m., thirty guards escorted Pratt out of the jail to the gallows near downtown Marietta.  The guards allowed Pratt to smoke a cigar, and they talked pleasantly amongst each other.  When Pratt arrived at the gallows, 8,000 people were waiting to witness his execution.  After an African American minister recited a prayer, Pratt publicly confessed his crime and expressed a willingness to die.  At 12:45 a.m., the drop fell, his neck broke, and he completely stopped moving thirteen minutes later.  The guards cut down Pratt's body, giving it to his father, brothers, and sisters who witnessed the execution.","Pink Pratt's execution demonstrates an uncommon instance when a nineteenth-century southern judicial system legitimately accused, convicted, and punished a black man according to the law, even though he committed a violent crime against a white female.  While a white perpetrator may have received a lighter punishment, Pratt was treated in a reasonably fair manner, considering the usual treatment of black offenders in the late nineteenth-century American South.  Pratt was executed as a criminal who committed a heinous offense, but the legal system fairly granted him the traditional religious rituals that it granted white offenders upon their execution.  The nineteenth-century Cobb County judicial system deemed a black criminal worthy of humane treatment, despite the horror of his crime.  ","Pratt's story challenges the traditional account of white reactions to black violent crime against whites.  As historian Edward Ayers argues, southern whites in the post-Civil War era were convinced that blacks were more dangerous than whites and that black men were more inclined to commit crimes of passion.  Nevertheless, the <em>National Police Gazette </em>did not portray Pratt as an atrocious creature, but depicted him talking pleasantly to his guards and expressing a willingness to die for his crime.  He was not portrayed as the brutal, dangerous monster that many southern whites declared blacks to be.  In addition, the public allowed his execution to occur through the legal process.  Ayers argues that black criminals were frequently kidnapped from jails, tortured, burned, and hanged by white mobs because whites believed such blacks were unworthy of legal execution.  However, Pratt was allowed to die through legal execution even though he raped a twelve-year-old white girl.  According to Ayers, whites often justified a lynching simply because the black offender committed the usual crime of sexual assault upon white women.  Whites assumed that black men lusted after white women and they even justified lynching blacks when they committed a minor violation of white womanhood.  Nevertheless, despite Pratt's severe violation of the dignity of an innocent white child, he was permitted to die through formal execution.

","The conflict centered around the supposed violation of female dignity and propriety. The article protected both the respectable and high toned women of St. Clair and the kind lady of Church Hill, Mrs. Nugent. This protection of female dignity supports historian James C. Cobb's argument that white womanhood was a symbolic assertion of white southern manhood in the late nineteenth century. According to Cobb, men sustained their own dignity and manhood by protecting female dignity. Cobb argues that this symbolic protection of dignity stems from the southern man's failure to protect women during the Civil War, leading them to ardently protect female dignity in response to their failure. The newspaper article sought to protect the honor and dignity of the females involved in the conflict, while deriding the honor of the male who spread the rumors against the women's character.

The sheriff of Catoosa County sent a deputy to pursue Nation, and they arrested him as he stepped off the train in Chattanooga on August 13, 1880.","It is impossible to determine whether Martha Sharp's intercourse with Thomas Nation was forced or consensual. Nonetheless, Sharp possessed much shame about her pregnancy. Her father's reaction to the incident reveals the severity that nineteenth-century southern society bestowed upon such a scandal. The fact that Mr. Sharp was willing to kill his son-in-law and then end his own life, suggests that Sharp lost all desire to live because of his family's disgrace. However, the community blamed Nation's membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as the reason for the scandal, accusing Nation's religious associations as the cause for the Sharp family's problems.","The <em>National Police Gazette'</em>s article on the scandal supports historian Sarah Barringer Gordon's claim that most Americans of the nineteenth century believed the Latter Day Saints were an uncivilized and barbaric religious group. According to Gordon, anti-Mormon and anti-polygamy Americans argued that no civilized group could disagree about the fundamental question of domestic relations, declaring the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to be an inhumane, undemocratic, and un-American church. The article supports Gordon's argument, as the story castigated Nation more for his Mormon affiliation than for his adultery. Nation was, in fact, practicing adultery with his wife's sister and was not practicing polygamy. However, the article and community emphasized Nation's crime as a Mormon polygamy problem, rather than a problem of morality in general. The article's attack on the Latter Day Saints displays the Protestant community's desire to frame the incident as an isolated Mormon problem, rather than a moral problem that breeched religious divides.

The woman worked for an upstanding white family in Georgia and experienced continuing skin lightening for many months.  White spots covered her face and body, slowly enlarging and spreading across her skin.  The spots gradually bleached her skin, making her appear white.  The woman was apparently in good health and did not suffer from any illness other than the seemingly harmless skin disease.  The woman was not fearful or anxious about the dangers of the disease, because she felt no pain or discomfort from the ailment.","The Saturday Evening Post carried the African American woman's story, entitling it Freaks of Nature.  The woman's story appeared in the article alongside accounts of strange and unusual animals that committed extraordinary feats.  Thus, the article dehumanized the African American woman, comparing her to abnormal animals.  The article declared that the woman's skin disease created a wonderful transformation, by turning a black woman's skin white.  The article suggested that white skin was preferable to black skin and implied that the woman's skin disease was truly a blessing for her.  Thus, the article glorified the white skin, while vilifying black skin.","  The Marietta woman's story reveals that the majority of nineteenth-century white Southerners, and white Americans in general, upheld the superiority of white skin.  Historian Edward Ayers argues that no matter how clean, well-dressed, or well-mannered African Americans were, whites continued to associate them with a sense of pollution.  The whites' idea that the Marietta woman's skin disease was a wonderful transformation suggests that whites saw black skin as polluted and inferior to white skin.  As the article declared her disease to be wonderful, the articles' author assumed that the black woman preferred to have white skin, never considering that she might have seen the disease as unfortunate and undesirable.  In addition, the Marietta woman's story supports historian James C. Cobb's argument that white southerners created the identity of the black individual by deeming blacks inferior to whites because of the color of their sin.  By promoting their own skin color, whites in the South and throughout America denigrated black skin and black identity, preventing African Americans from forming their own identities for themselves and forcing them to perceive themselves as inferior."],"display_date":1884,"search_date":"1884-07-01","locations":[{"id":1678,"lat":33.9414430151,"lng":-84.5767277131,"zoom":10,"place":"COBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2752,"title":"Emily Austin Endorses Industrial Education for African Americans\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-01-01","end_date":"1883-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the 1870's, Northerner Emily Austin founded the Austin School for African American children in Knoxville, Tennessee. When Austin moved into an African American neighborhood, the white community in Knoxville ostracized her for her work and the area in which she lived. While the community did not object to educating African Americans, they believed that only a very destitute and lowly woman would fraternize with blacks. Initially, Austin worked under the Freedman's Bureau, but when the Bureau was dissolved, she financed the school with personal funds and donations from northern friends. When the school became overcrowded, she erected a large schoolhouse, which she donated to the city, requiring that it always be used to educate African American students. In 1881, Austin grew to believe that she needed to reform her curriculum, as she believed that teaching the arts and sciences left the black students idle, thriftless, and contemptuous of work. Thus, Austin began to declare that industrial training was the only practical education for African Americans, because African Americans could only find employment in the industrial sector. She established industrial training for her students in the departments of sewing, gardening, domestics, and carpentry, but she faced much opposition from the students' parents. The African American parents opposed their children studying different subjects than white children. Austin continued to teach the industrial classes, but split the school day into sections of traditional teachings and industrial teachings.","Austin faced much difficulty in her profession, as both whites and blacks snubbed her for work. Austin said that her greatest difficulty was the African American opposition to her work, but she continued to educate her students because of her strong belief in the importance of industrial education for African Americans. Austin argued that African Americans held a great disadvantage in professional studies, making it impossible for them to compete with white students and gain professional positions. She also argued that education in the arts and sciences lead black students to despise manual labor. Thus, she argued that African Americans needed industrial training to convince them that good, honest work was the only way to make them good citizens. ","Historian Edward Ayers argues that the majority of educated African Americans in the South were limited to employment in manual labor because of their skin color. Ayers states that many educated African Americans despised manual labor, as they believed they were wasting their education if they accepted such work. This hatred explains Austin's belief that educated African Americans had grown to despise the only kind of labor they could acquire, leading her to assert the necessity of African American industrial teaching."],"display_date":"1881 - 1883","search_date":"1882-07-02","locations":[{"id":12158,"lat":35.9932218718,"lng":-83.9370888963,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2773,"title":"First Annual Report Issued on the State Industrial and Normal School for Women\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-12-20","end_date":"1892-12-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The North Carolina State Normal and Industrial School for Women in Greensboro, N.C. had been open for four months when President Charles D. McIvers wrote the college's first annual report to the Board of Directors on December 20, 1892. In this document, he discussed the institution's goals, claiming that the main objective was to prepare women for positions in the house, business office, and most importantly, the school room. McIvers then commented on various aspects of the institution, writing about how pleased he was with the multiple economic demographics represented in the first class. He also explained his philosophies on discipline and administration, believing that the female students should be treated as a self-governing body and made responsible for maintaining and upholding various rules such as curfew and study hours. He believed it had been working very well, and was delighted with the outcome. McIvers then discussed the role of religion in the institution, and mentioned that several women have organized a Young Women's Christian Association, and others attend a Bible class once a week. He ended the letter listing various items that the college needed, and suggested that he and the Board of Directors make an appeal to the General Assembly to help finance these objects. ","Charles McIver was part of a large educational reform movement that began in the 1880's when he and his college friends Edwin Alderman and James Yadkin united in their efforts to lead region-wide school reform. As they campaigned for improvements in the quality and number of schools in North Carolina, they also pushed heavily for the establishment of higher educational institutions for women. In 1891, McIver and his supporters joined forces with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), and a smaller group called the King's Daughters to crusade for a vocational school for white women. It was a success, and the State Normal and Industrial School was built in 1892. Many women who composed the first class of 223 students the first year the institution opened had little economic means, and 25 percent of them were orphans or daughters of widows who were pursuing jobs in order to support themselves or those closest to them. ","While some parents were reluctant to part with their daughters, historian James Lelouids claims that many encouraged them to attend the State Normal and Industrial School.

He argued that instead of sending their daughters to large overgrown establishment outside of Athens, they should take advantage of the good teachers and schools available closer to home.  There are two advantages that this Old Citizen found in using the schools closer to home: it would keep the daughters at home and it would keep the money spent on education in the local economy.  ","The Old Citizen firmly believed that daughters should receive an education, just through different means than were popular at the time. Though his editorial implies that educating one's daughters was a common thing to do, he was writing to a specific audience who could afford to send their children away for private schooling. Though there was a push for the establishment of public education earlier, it would be six years before Georgia established a successful public schooling system.  Before 1858 almost all primary and secondary education took place in private schools or from private teachers.  The ability to pay for private teachers was limited to the upper classes, but sending children to boarding schools caused an additional burden because it prevented them from helping at home.","The advantage of keeping daughters at home is likely related to the important housework women performed.  In her book The Politics of Education in the New South, Rebecca Montgomery suggests a parallel between the position of women and the position of slaves in antebellum society.  She explains that legally both slaves and women were dependent on the patriarch.  In addition she draws parallels between the functions of the two groups.  While slaves did the hard labor in the fields, the women did the domestic work.  The importance of the woman's role in the house may have prevented people from wanting to send daughters away to school where they could not help at home and would not learn the domestic skills they would be expected to perform when they got married.  In addition the Old Citizen may have believed it better to keep daughters at home so that their morals could be guarded.  The patriarchal system centered in the home was the primary source of discipline and moral values in the antebellum South. ","This editorial also reflected on the economy of private education.  The Old Citizen wanted people to school their daughters in Athens so that the money they paid went back into the Athens economy.  This implies that there was an awareness of the value of the local economy in the antebellum South.  Though transportation systems were rapidly developing in the antebellum period, there was still a sense that keeping money at home, in the local economy, was a way to benefit one's community.  This was especially true in a developed urban area like Athens, which by the time of this editorial had been established for 67 years.  The city in 1852 had much to offer its citizens, largely due to its extensive manufacturing system."],"display_date":"January 8, 1852","search_date":"1852-01-08","locations":[{"id":1656,"lat":33.8831653504,"lng":-83.4095667489,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2800,"title":"Governor Dismisses Woman&#39;s Execution\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-03-30","end_date":"1898-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 30, 1898, Elizabeth Nobles prepared to live her last day on earth. The State had found Nobles guilty of murdering her husband three years prior, and sentenced her to death by hanging the following day. Yet the Twiggs County facility where Nobles was being held received a last minute notice to cancel her execution. Georgia Governor William Atkinson, the only body left with the power to pardon her death sentence, sent the notification that afternoon reducing her punishment to serving life in prison. The governor came to this conclusion after immense pressure from women across the state. Once the Pardon Board had declared that it could do no more for the accused, individual women as well as organizations sent numerous petitions and requests on behalf of Nobles to the governor. Women's growing power to influence politics and social matters was realized as their efforts proved to be successful in Nobles' stay.","Around the turn of the twentieth century, women's issues and rights started to take center stage, especially on the political level. By the time of Nobles' scheduled execution, women across the South had already secured property and age of consent rights, fought for higher education opportunities, and even battled for suffrage. Certain territories in the West had even granted suffrage for all women by this point. Although Georgia had not yet permitted women to vote, women still held power and exerted their influence over everyday affairs. They formed committees and organizations concerned with reducing social ills such as illiteracy, child labor, and the consumption of alcohol. They joined preexisting groups such as the National American Woman Suffrage Association in order to further their own desires to win political recognition. But most of all, they became a presence in society, fighting and lobbying openly and relentlessly for the political and social causes they believed in.

As the proud mother of two Confederate soldiers, James and Hines, Zillah found strength in her Bible. In her diary, Zillah wrote of her fear for her sons' safety and her pride in their dedication to the Confederate struggle for independence, but always found comfort in God's words. When both James and Hines were killed in service in late 1862, Zillah's worst fears were realized. On January 9, 1863, she wrote in her diary that the remains of our dear sons...reached home last Monday 5th of January 1863. Zillah's unwavering Christian faith consoled her and she explained that although I wept sore and do weep yet I know that in our heavenly Father's house are many mansions. It was a comfort to Zillah to know that her sons shared her religious devotion. Reverend S.S.

According to the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</em>, evangelical denominations provided education to women prior to the Civil War. Because religion was so closely tied to knowledge, women were especially religious in the South. After the Great Awakening of the nineteenth century (religious revivals in the South), evangelical Christianity became a bedrock of southern culture. The impact was felt even stronger by women because religion was family oriented. Women like Zillah raised their children according to their religious beliefs, and in Zillah's case, those beliefs were devout. Religion was also somewhat of an equalizer; women and men were equal in God's eyes in terms of sin. Women were free to ask for forgiveness of their sins just as men were.","To Zillah Brandon and women like her, religion was not just a matter of church on Sunday.

Her parents had thrown her out of their house when they discovered she was pregnant, and while she had tried to seek refuge at several other houses, she was repeatedly refused, and the barn was her only option for shelter as she gave birth. The child, however, did not survive, and died shortly after its delivery. The young mother picked up her baby's body and tried to walk to a nearby house, but fainted on the way over, and was found by the family who owned the barn. They called in Dr. Martin, but he could not save the mother who suffered from hypothermia and an excessive loss of blood. She died the following day. Davie Times, a resident of the town where Graves died, heard this sad story and wrote the Salisbury Truth in order to comment on what he believed was the family's and neighbors' terrible and inhuman behavior. He was shocked that an event like this could take place in a Christian community. "," Whether or not the people Times considered responsible for Graves' death were apprehended and punished is unknown. What is known, however, is that Graves' premarital pregnancy reflected an issue in the South that provoked much controversy, particularly in the late 19th century. Patriarchal society was firmly entrenched at this time as well as the notion that all Southern women were pious, gentle, and modest daughters, wives, and mothers. North Carolinian law reinforced this concept, making a woman legally bound to reveal the name of her illegitimate baby's father. The local government would then force him to provide money for child support if need be, ensuring that neither the mother nor child would not become a ward of the state. The mother's punishment usually varied from a monetary fine to a damaged reputation, a simple notion with heavy penalties in a society that placed emphasis on the purity and innocence of respectable women. "," By the end of the 19th century, premarital pregnancy was steadily decreasing as the structure and sexual repression of the Victorian era began tightened. According to historians Daniel Scott and Michael Hindus, an upsurge in religious activity also lowered the number of premarital pregnancies at this time, especially in the South where the evangelical movement of the Social Gospel was strongest. A woman who was guilty of fornication and bastardy would have sullied not only her reputation but her family's as well, claims historian Victoria Bynum, and therefore it was not uncommon for people like the Graves to refuse to accommodate their daughter during a premarital pregnancy since they were regarded as social pariahs and outsiders. However, while a stronger religious presence in the South led to more stringent moral policies and a reduction in pregnancy out of wedlock, it also defined Christian morals and values more clearly. This new and strengthened Christian community made the Graves and their neighbors' actions look like sins as they failed to forgive the young woman and treat her with compassion that the Bible extols. The parallels between her story and the Biblical story of the birth of Jesus (Mary and Joseph being rejected from several inns, only to find shelter in a manger where she gave birth to the baby Jesus) only reinforced this notion. However, while Times' reaction to this event was supported by countless other people, many Southern communities continued to spurn and reject those young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.

She expressed a specific dislike for a young woman by the name of Clara, whose social conduct she perceived as being distasteful, not only to herself but to others as well. At the first of two dances Mary attended while visiting, Clara, in one of her mischievous acts, put her head out an open window and mingled her 'snorings' with the sweet sounds of twilight dews.  To this, she said the gentlemen at the party burst out laughing and retreated to another room soon after.  As a visitor, she hoped that the gentlemen would not relate Clara's poor conduct to her. Mary concluded that Clara was as wild as an untamed deer and would hesitate at nothing for attention. Mary's account of Warrenton's social life only gives a glimpse at what Virginia social life was like at the time, though it does show that strict standards of social conduct were held.  While Mary's perceptions of Warrenton's men go along with the longstanding stereotype of the 'Virginia Gentlemen', her comments about Clara do not portray the stereotypical 'southern belle'. Clara irritated the social order, which is why Mary was so aware of her conduct and the men left the room shortly thereafter. In the antebellum South, women's actions were evaluated according to unique standards for each class, race, and gender.  Being that Mary and the others at the party were probably all within the same social class they would have had similar social standards.  When Clara did not adhere to these standards a conflict arose between her and the others, who were abiding to them. Clara's conduct could also be attributed to an unwillingness to conform to the rules of society, rather than a lack of social prowess.

The primary reason for their delay of the wedding was because of how young the couple was. However there was also rumored to be tensions between the two families, for unknown reasons. So, instead of waiting for the blessing from her family, Miss Lizzie Hutter and her fiance fled by rail to Brisol, Virginia, and then went on a honeymoon touring the southern states. This scandal made it into the local paper, primarily because of the shock of such a perfect girl doing something so inappropriate. "," In Southern society, the ideal Southern woman was a young lady who was submissive, weak, modest, beautiful, innocent and self-denying. She supported her family and her husband and sacrificed everything for their sakes. This ideal also upheld the white male duty to protect white ladies from harm (especially from black men). By all accounts, Lizzie Hutter was the epitome of that woman. Hutter's elopement was newsworthy because of her status in society. She had all the training and all the experience and was no outcast; everyone loved her. Yet she chose to elope and break the rules of her society, which is completely uncharacteristic of a southern belle. Even in the midst of her elopement however, there was sympathy towards her decision. The quarrels between the families were petty. Her elopement probably did not completely estrange her from her family entirely, but she definitely took a risk since she was being disobedient. She was risking her reputation because this elopement was contrary to the expectation of society to be that ideal woman.

Macon authorities originally sought Gibson out for a suspected assault on a white female that occurred earlier in the week. The manhunt intensified after he reportedly shot and killed another man during an argument on the morning of the 12th. After a drawn-out chase and multiple shootouts, Gibson was finally apprehended by the police that evening. However, Gibson's life was then placed in the hands of the public instead of being sent to jail. In a momentary absence of the sheriff and deputies, the growing mob of concerned citizens seized Gibson and hanged him from a tree, protecting the city from any more of his wrongdoings.","At the turn of the twentieth century, race relations worsened as racial violence became the most common form of interracial relations. Crime increased during this period which in turn caused people's responses to crime to grow more severe. Lynching became a popular way for whites to threaten and maintain justice over black suspects and criminals. Rural areas with little law enforcement, and areas with transient populations, were subjected to the most lynchings in the South. Georgia housed both of these types of places, where there was an average of ten lynchings per year.","This lynching was just one of the many rape-inspired attacks that occurred in the South. Over 60 percent of the lynchings of black men corresponded to an alleged sexual assault against a white woman. A third of those also involved mutilation and castration of the offender. The pretense for this common occurrence was the need to preserve the honor of whites. The code of honor in the South was heavily adhered to by white men at the time. This involved carrying out the duty to protect and uphold the honor of the women of their race and defending against black men who would denigrate that dignity. Any relations between a black man and a white woman were seen as immoral and a threat to white male dominance in the area. White men viewed the relations as the blacks' infiltration into white's territory and property and took whatever means necessary to protect it. Lynching was the most drastic and public manner in which white men could reassert their power and status in the racial hierarchy of the South."],"display_date":"September 12, 1897","search_date":"1897-09-12","locations":[{"id":1553,"lat":32.8067094598,"lng":-83.6980226314,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2839,"title":"Teaching in the South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-10-09","end_date":"1886-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Education in Southside Virginia during the late nineteenth century was sporadic and not completely uniform. While there had been an educational revival after the Civil War, public education was still defined by the typical one-room schoolhouse, taught by a young woman with children whose ages ranged from 6 years to 16 years. Teaching was not an ideal job; it was very difficult. Even with the difficulties, many Southern women were schoolteachers. These jobs gave women some independence in a primarily male-dominated world. "," In 1886, a young woman named G. E. Thomas agreed to teach in the Flood school-house for 35 dollars per month, which was just above the national average of 34.27. Her responsibilities included the upkeep of a school register and keeping the school room neat with the floor swept. She had to open school at 9 AM and had to give the children a one 1 hour break for lunch. School was over at 3:30. She was subject to a fine if she did not complete her duties, and she was required to attend a monthly meeting of teachers. While this was clearly a difficult job, G.E. Thomas signed the contract along with Mercer H. Gray, the chairman of the board. ","   Women throughout the South were often forced to work due to economic necessity. Teaching was the most common job that was socially acceptable for young women. Teaching was acceptable because it was an extension of a woman's role to nurture and care for the next generation. Women chose teaching in order to be economically self-sufficient. If a young woman was a spinster, teaching allowed her to help provide for her family and not to be an economic burden. It is unclear why G.E. Thomas decided to teach. She may have been unmarried and therefore needed the job to support herself since, without a husband, she was in a fragile position in Southern society. Regardless or her marital status, it was evident that she needed this job. Her school was for white children, as education was segregated at the time. Therefore, however small her school house may have been, her supplies and equipment were superior to any black school. Through teaching, women were able to contribute to the public sphere and gain some independence in a world where she was expected to be dependent on her family. Teaching was possible for many women because of the increasing standards of education throughout the United States. Especially in an increasingly industrialized society, education was important.

Harrington, CSA of Franklin County, Mississippi. It seems Mrs. Jones, most likely a widow at the time of her writing (note that it was she and not her veteran husband who penned the request), had been unable to secure the pension entitled to her by state law as the widow of a Confederate soldier. Although, according to Joanna Short, the most common reasons for this were failure to provide sufficient evidence of military service, disability, or poverty, it seems Mrs. Jones was simply having trouble with the paper work; as most people not directly affiliated with armed forces or government usually were (and still are), she had, up until the time of her writing, been stumped as to the proper procedure for filling out the proper forms and thereby obtaining the proper compensation. To this end, she sought the assistance of Major Harrington.","Mrs. Jones' case was not uncommon during the time period. During the period after the Civil War, many states began giving benefits to families of those killed during the conflict. With the backing of the Federal Government, the practice was most prevalent and more generous in the North, as the northern states could better afford to compensate families, but southern states also adopted the practice. Originally, pensions were afforded only to war widows, or wounded soldiers with variable extent of... disability, from 5 per year for the loss of a finger or toe to 150 per year for the loss of two or more limbs or total blindness. Then, according to the U.S. Government National Archives, Mississippi began granting pensions to indigent Confederate veterans or their widows in 1888. In other words, now any veteran who was down on their luck could be compensated, even if the reasons for their hard times were unrelated to the Civil War. ","The reasons for this expansion of benefits, according to Theda Skocpol, were mainly political, as straightforward compensation for wartime disabilities [turned] into fuel for patronage politics. The issue became so pressing nation wide that in 1882, Representative Roswell G. Horr of Michigan observed: I think it is safe to say that each member of this House receives [at least] fifty letters each week in regard to aid obtaining a pension. The subsequent bureaucracy that grew to deal with the large number of requests resulted in confusion, extravagance, and injustice, claims Judge Parry. The issue grew so large between 1880 and 1910, says Skocpol, the U.S. federal government devoted over a quarter of its expenditures to distributing pensions, which, aside from interest payments on the national debt in the early 1880s...exceeded or nearly equaled other major categories of federal spending. (This figure stands as a stumbling block for historians claiming an absence of federal involvement in social welfare before the New Deal.) ","Returning to Mississippi, Joanna Short notes that the average pension by 1910 in the state was 43.36 per year (41.08 in 1893 by a CPI conversion), and that for many Confederate veterans who struggled to earn a living because of disabilities or their widows, who did not have as much access to the work force, this amount was not trivial. It is unknown whether or not Mrs. Jones was an original war widow, in which case she would have been missing out on a great deal of money due her since 1865, or was trying to take advantage of the expansion of grants since 1888. Either way, the amount of money she would hopefully soon be receiving, with the help of the gentleman Major P.C. Harrington, would certainly help her during the economically challenging post war times in the South. The issue would be especially pressing to her, as the country had just experienced what the Hon. John W. Daniel called, in a speech before congress, the most acute stage of the panic of 1893, the result of which was a large across the board fall of prices, and the minimization of the United States financial system. This deflation and minimization most definitely affected many Mississippians. Mrs. Jones, therefore, most likely needed the help of Major Harrington as quickly as possible."],"display_date":"November 1893","search_date":"1893-11-15","locations":[{"id":7031,"lat":31.4771528974,"lng":-90.8978368524,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2850,"title":"A Beautiful Marriage\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-06-16","end_date":"1878-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" As a proud and happy mother, Mary Randolph Page Harrison watched her lovely daughter Lucia Harrison get married on June 16, 1878.

Although he was a good deal older than Lucia, he was a kind, Christian gentleman. Mary was confident that this was a good match and was very hopeful for her daughter's happiness. Sadly, the family could not afford a lavish wedding tour, but this was inconsequential since her daughter was happy. Instead, her daughter went to their new house in Cumberland County to start their new life together. Mary couldn't wait to write to her friend Annie Coleman and brag about her wonderful daughter and the beautiful wedding. "," Weddings were clearly an important part of Southern social life. People could come together and celebrate, especially when the match was so highly regarded like the one between Lucia Harrison and Captain Cooke. Women in the South were expected to be married, and marriage was a sign of social status. Marriage was also an economic necessity for most women. A husband provided financial support, for the wife as well as for her family. In order to have a position within society, women needed to be married. Reconstruction had provided more legal rights for women, especially in the courts and with abuse cases. However, women were not equal to men, and they needed a husband to represent them in society. Mary was clearly proud of the marriage, however if Captain Cooke had not been a Christian, or respected, then the situation would be very different. The values of this family, like many other families in Virginia, were based on a sense of morality and religious ethics, and this marriage was everything that the family hoped for their daughter. Christianity and marriage were important aspects in what established, especially in regards to respectability with their neighbors.

According to the Clarion Ledger Jackson had been selected as the site of the Mary Holmes school for the colored people, despite protests of many newspapers and citizens. They did not, however, formally attempt to stop the project, as it was, according to Samuel Rogal's account of Holmes' educational ministry, a only seminary founded by a white woman working with a white staff and a white faculty to educate young Black girls in the domestic arts. Thus, a service to consecrate the twenty acres of ground acquired for the seminary occurred at Jackson, Mississippi, on 24 December 1891 with no protest from the locals. The school officially opened on September 28, 1892, and was dedicated to Mary Emilie Holmes's mother on October 12 of that same year.","At first glance, establishing such a school seems to be an incredible achievement. Mary Holmes, who was trained first at Rockford Female Seminary and later at the University of Michigan and was the first woman to receive a doctorate in the earth sciences, had succeeded in establishing a school for black young women in the heart of the Deep South. After benefiting Swift Memorial College in Rogersville, Tennessee and Monticello Academy in southeastern Arkansas, despite resistance from white communities in the areas (especially in Tennessee), Holmes's commitment and mission to the education of black children, principally females, which she saw fit to channel through the missionary arms and agencies of the Presbyterian Church, had paid off for a third time. Not only that, but within only twenty-six months, Holmes and her father had enlisted the direct assistance of the Board of Missions for Freedmen of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.; of local Home Missionary societies; of the Woman's Board of Home Missions in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, and New York; of the Balck communities of Jackson; and of individual families in Rockford. It is no small wonder that whites in Jackson were not outraged at such an institution.","The reason for this, however, is that perhaps Mary Holmes's school was not such an achievement after all, as the curriculum emphasized courses of instruction in sewing, mending, cooking, laundry, and general housekeeping, almost [guaranteeing] that her charges would never rise beyond the various states of domestic service. Furthermore, it seems that Mary Emily [sic] Holmes...simply avoids the issue of racial segregation in the Deep South. She accepts it (although perhaps not agreeing with it) as a fact of life and goes about her business. Therefore, because she was not directly challenging the status quo, the whites of Jackson (and later West Point after the original establishment burned down in 1895) tolerated the existence of a school educating young black women.","Yet, Mary Holmes was indeed a pioneer and did in a way challenge the status quo. Mary Emily [sic] Holmes... stood above (or at least beyond) her generation of American educators by promoting the notion that education would certainly prove beneficial to every American Youngster, no matter what his or her social, economic, or racial classification. With this motivation, she attempted to teach young women something, no matter how seemingly inconsequential, that would lift them from the moral, mental, physical, and spiritual degradation which had been the background of the race for 250 years; through her Presbyterian missions and schools, she gave black women a reason to hope for something beyond the racial boundaries set for them by society, which was especially important in Mississippi.

She trusted that the railroad would deliver her package safely to her home in Savannah, yet she was mistaken. In her letter to Georgina, a family friend, she discussed a problem with the package and the freight system. Pember explained her frustration about the system in her letter because the package she sent by freight never made it to its destination. Shipping by freight was quicker and more efficient, but Pember's letter showed that some frustrations and undependability came with using the freight system.

Perhaps the most important news of the letter was the complication during child birth that her other daughter Mollie had gone through two days before. Mrs. Wyche noticed her daughter was acting strangely and sent Walter, one of her sons, for a doctor or and old woman. Mrs. Wyche told her son to first call a Doctor and then on Martha Wade, who presumably was a trained midwife.","Although the practice of midwifery is no longer in widespread use, during the nineteenth century it was still a part of American culture. It is true that the practice had begun to take a secondary role to trained male doctors among middle and upper class white citizens, but the practice had not entirely faded. It was especially prevalent, note Richard and Dorothy Wertz, among isolated whites (and others). Certainly, on their plantation, Green Lawn, the Wyches were somewhat isolated, as were many living on farms or plantations in the South at the time; if a doctor could not be found immediately, a midwife would have to be called upon, which was exactly Octavia Wyche's understanding of the situation on February 15, 1885.","The practice of midwifery had changed dramatically in America since colonial times, when after, 1750, American men began to return from medical education abroad to practice in colonial towns and cities. The Wertzs note that this began the involvement of men in childbirth, and it was men who actually at first began the practice of educated midwifery. The training spread to women, and In the years after 1810... the practice of midwifery in American towns took on the same unregulated, open market character it had in England where men and women of various levels of training competed to attend births.","During the latter half of the nineteenth century, however, women began to be excluded from midwifery. Despite the fact that American doctors were not as well trained as their more formally educated European counterparts and therefore well trained and experienced midwives most likely could have done the job just as well, it came to be regarded as unthinkable to confront women with the facts of medicine or to mix men and women in training, even for such an event as birth. Nevertheless, by 1885 midwifery was once again being practiced by women such as Martha Wade. Perhaps this is due to the expansion, however slowly, of women's rights during the time. ","Ultimately the decision whether or not to employ a midwife would have been up to Mollie Wyche, and she apparently decided to consult at least one trained midwife as well as at least one doctor. The Wertzs note that it was probably very wise of Mollie Wyche to use not only a trained midwife, but also a woman who had herself borne a child and who might be more patient and discerning about birth processes. The level of experience of Martha Wade is not known, but presumably her being an old woman implies a higher level. Unfortunately, Walter Wyche could find neither Martha Wade nor a doctor in time, and Mollie Wych miscarried.

Because of rampant childhood diseases and absence of many other options of sustenance for infants, breastmilk played a vitally important role in the development of society and families. Many slaveholding women designated enslaved women to be wet nurses for the newly born white children. As Robert Mallard describes in his memoir, As a babe, I drew a part at least of my nourishment from the generous breasts of a colored foster mother. Growing up on a plantation in Georgia, Mallard was certainly one of many young children who were cared for primarily by slaves instead of his own parents. "," This use of enslaved women as wet nurses caused a great deal of debate among Southerners. Many slave holding women did not even see nursing their children as part of their normal responsibilities as mothers. Other women however did look upon this practice with a skeptical and critical eye. In one woman's judgment, 'that woman is but half a mother who does not suckle her own children'","Many southerners were disconcerted by this practice of allowing an enslaved woman to be the primary care taker, however, Mallard felt quite differently. He wrote that his colored foster mother...always held a peculiar place in my regards. A black nurse taught me, it is probable, my first steps and first words, and was as proud of both performances as the happy mother herself. Mallard clearly has an ambiguous relationship with his wet nurse, as he shows by choosing the word peculiar to describe it. Enslaved women acting as wet nurses also had tenuous feelings toward their job as nurse. Most slave women who had children of their own were only allowed one or two months away from their duties before their masters required them to return to work, leaving their children with another slave. Being deprived of time with their own children, enslaved women must have resented time with their slave master's children. In Stephen V. Ash's book A Year in the South: 1865, he describes how Matilda Hughes, an enslaved woman, had to work so much that her twins died because she was unable to breastfeed them often enough. If enslaved women's children died of neglect, how must they have felt when asked to care for other children? But other historians have asserted that often, slave women caring for white children did form strong attachments with these children.

Over and over again, he painfully tried to recite the Lord's Prayer, but each time he failed. First, he could not remember how it began. After a hint from his grandmother, he ran into trouble with the latter parts. After many long, frustrating hours, his grandmother, with a pained expression on her face, tied Robert up by his hands and whipped his small back, all the while praying that her grandson would be able to memorize his prayer. "," Years later, Anderson recalled this event when writing his memoir. His account demonstrates the high premium some slaves placed on religion, because of the hope it offered. Anderson's grandmother clearly valued her grandson's learning the Lord's Prayer, if she was willing to whip him over it. "," Christianity offered enslaved people hope. The promise of a better life after this helped slaves defend themselves against the psychological horrors of being property. Anderson's grandmother obviously saw the necessity of this hope and was therefore to do whatever it took to give her grandson access to this hope. When Anderson finally did learn his prayer, though the necessity for this sense of hope was lost on such a young boy, he was, as glad as you ever saw a little fellow. After buying his freedom from his master, Anderson became a renowned and respected pastor, so this incident clearly shaped his life. "," This memorization was, in fact, quite disconcerting for slaveholders. Though most slaves in the South could not read, they did know several significant passages from the Bible, including the Lord's Prayer as well as other, not so innocuous (at least in the slaveholders' eyes), verses about freedom, equality, and the poor. By memorizing these verses, enslaved people combined the oral tradition of their African culture with the Christian religion they had been exposed to in America. This combination gave enslaved people hope and a way to constantly remind themselves of this hope.

Eliza Oswald Hill heard reports of New Berne while she was seeking refuge away from the coast in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In her diary, she expressed how her hope for a Confederate victory slowly faded with the news of every loss to the North. The rumors she heard about New Berne were finally confirmed to her on March 15 1862. It was extremely distressing to Ms. Hill to learn of the advancements the Yankees were making into her state. She articulated her utter distaste for what lengths the North would undertake to gain ground in the South. Eliza Oswald Hill's reaction to the news of yet another Confederate loss of coastal land was representative of the general hopeless attitude shared by many North Carolinians as the Civil War progressed.","The Union force understood what it needed to achieve to take control of the South. Part of this strategy included seizing significant locations in the Carolinas. As Herbert, Baker, and Holt argue, by turning its efforts to coastal ports, the Union could establish a tight blockade of the Southern coast which would have very detrimental effects for the Confederacy. In February-March of 1862, General Ambrose Burnside successfully undertook this task. After important victories scattered through out North Carolina, General Burnside turned his attention to the strategic port of New Berne. At this time, it was the second largest city of the North Carolina Coast. Despite its size, however, New Berne was only defended by no more than 4,000 Confederate troops when Burnside's drive arrived at its doorstep. This small number of men was under the leadership of General L. O'B. Branch. The Rebel soldiers fought well, but they could not overcome their lack of numbers, and many had to flee inward to avoid capture. By the end of the day on March 14 1862, New Berne was in Union hands.

Many Southerners did not see education as a way to enlighten women, but rather to refine and polish them, and make them more suitable for marriage. In the Argus newspaper, published in Savannah, Georgia, an advertisement appeared in September of 1828. It announced Mr. Phillips's new school for young ladies, where they will be instructed in every branch of a polite and finished Education. Mr. Phillips's ad attempted to present his school as safe and innocuous. He called the subjects he would be teaching, polite and finished despite the fact that the formidable list of subjects he planned to teach was 11 topics long and included Writing, Astronomy, Rhetoric, and French. This attempt to make the school sound safe made sense given the tenuous position women's education had in the minds of southerners. "," The education of women in the South was both frightening to white men and necessary to the structure of southern society. In the male dominated South, men acted as heads of the household, and relied on domination of their wives and daughters as much as they relied on domination of their slaves to hold their position in society. An educated woman posed a threat to this domination by setting herself on an equal plane with white men. Education, however, also was a hallmark of the middle and upper classes in the South and a southern woman could not hope to be accepted into higher class society without a minimal education. If a woman was educated it meant that her family had had enough labor in the form of slaves or servants so that she did not have to work to help the family but instead could devote her time to studying. This concept of leisure time for women was intricately connected to the concepts of class and education. Mr. Phillips's advertisement perfectly demonstrates these tensions between male dominated society and the preservation of existing class structures by publicizing a school that he presents as both harmless and impressive at the same time.

Three of her sisters had already suffered equal fates at the hands of the slow wasting disease.","Her obituary, which took up two full columns, detailed mostly the religious aspects of her life, stating that at nineteen she decided to commit herself fully to the church. She was Methodist. Among her many attributes, the obituary cited her meek, quiet nature, and her extreme piety. The author touted her as a loving wife and devoted member of the church, although it did not mention any children. Although the actual newspaper in which this obituary appeared is unknown, W.D.

The clipping is pasted into the first page of his 1864 journal, and the subsequent entries do not explain his connection to Mrs. Bondurant.

Because of slave labor, women of any wealth did not have to cook, clean, sew, or do other women's work, since it was all relegated to the female slaves. Thus, the attributes that were most sought-after in southern women were fairly unique to the South. As shown by the obituary, religiosity and commitment to one's church were extremely important. A demure, submissive manner is also praised, as well as complete devotion to husband and family. Beauty is also extolled, although that at least is certainly not unique to the South. ","Joshua D. Rothman, in his book <em>Notorious in the Neighborhood</em>, provides some examples of the culture that shapes southern white women in this time period.

At least, this was true in Georgia in 1828. On May 19, 1828 the Argus, a newspaper in Savannah, printed an extract of a letter from a member of Congress, to the Editor. In this letter the politician explained that the mood in Washington was changing in favor of removal of the Native Americans currently living where they had been for a long time on some of the richest land in the heart of Georgia. The Congressman refers to our Indian difficulties and the perplexities of Indians within [Georgia's] boundaries. The words difficulties and perplexities make the Indians sound more like pesky flies than anything else, though they had been on that land far longer than the white Americans had been."," White Georgians did not just take issue with the fact that the Native Americans occupied some of the best cotton soil in the state. Though this fact bothered them, they were far more disconcerted by some of the implications of this occupation. The United States Government had, until this point, attempted to treat the Native Americans as a separate nation. (Whether or not the government actually believed that they were a separate nation is another question.) Because the government signed treaties with the Native Americans and recognized them as separate nations, they were raising the Native Americans up to an equal footing with white males, thus destroying the idea that only white males could enjoy the full rights and privileges offered by the government. By implication, therefore, African Americans should be freed and be allowed to vote, and women should likewise be allowed to cast a ballot. Native American presence in Georgia, therefore threatened the social system that the South rested on. Furthermore, Native American territories offered a convenient place for runaway slaves to hide, thus undermining white supremacy even more. "," The government further encouraged Georgian support of Native American removal by promising to distribute the land to white Georgian farmers by lottery. This guarantee ensured near universal support from white males in Georgia. The possibility of good cotton growing land combined with the reestablishment of white supremacy proved altogether too powerful. Public opinion in Georgia forced Georgia politicians to make Indian Removal a priority in their campaigns and tenures in office, as this letter from Congress clearly demonstrates. In the North, many were opposed to Jackson's proposal. The most vocal groups, religious groups, eventually evolved into abolitionist organizations. Angelina Grimke, before becoming a Quaker or an abolitionist, focused many of her early energies on opposing the Indian Removal Bill. This evolution, though unknown to Georgians in the late 1820s and 1830s, underscores the corollary between Indian rights and African American rights.

They prescribed all sorts of medicines: Castor oil salts, elixirs, chocolates, chicken broth, snake root, and creamor tartar.  She took magnesia, took Emitics, took cathartics.

On the plantation, women formed associations based on religion and domesticity.  Jean E. Friedman notes in <em>The Enclosed Garden </em>how the participation in evangelical communities prevented antebellum Southern women from forming any sort of collective identity.  The extended neighborhood kinship groups and the evangelical emphasis on the nuclear family bound women in their sexual roles.  The issue of death was formative in the community since, in the evangelical context, death was the first step in joining a supernatural community.

As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men.

Bachman announced the importance women held in the medical effort in coastal South Carolina. She explained, in a local newspaper, a proposed arrangement concerning the delivery of imperative medical supplies to Florence, South Carolina. The Northeastern Railroad had been sending donated supplies free of charge, but there was a need for them to be properly collected and distributed. She proposed that an appointed female agent travel to Florence from wherever they might be on Tuesdays and Sundays to complete the receipt of the supplies. Ms. Bachman stressed the importance of paying prompt attention to all donations from around the country to make sure none went to waste. After all, she said, it was their sole object and view to alleviate the suffering of their brave defenders. In this way, the women of coastal South Carolina could contribute to the war effort without officially being recognized by their country. They used whatever outlet they could as an opportunity to help their beloved soldiers. ","Not until September, 1862 did the Confederate Congress officially authorize women as nurses. Thereafter, women were welcomed by the Southern army as a recognized source of medical help. In his book <em>Ordeal by Fire</em>, historian James McPhearson argues how women in the South, because of this late recognition of aid, did not play as large of a role in the war as did Northern women, since these women were allowed at an earlier time to be official nurses. However, women, such as Bachman and her partners, found ways in the South to significant ways to contribute to the war effort and assist their wounded. ","Women played a vital role in the Civil War, and without them, the war would have been very different. Female efforts during this time were especially important in the medical field, since fighting was seen solely as a man's job. They did most of the hard work in the civilian volunteer agencies that were created to aid the growing number of wounded soldiers.

Wiltberger, while sitting at breakfast one morning, was interrupted by his overseer. The overseer angrily informed Wiltberger that Jane, one of Wiltberger's slaves, was missing. Other slaves were being questioned but so far, the overseer could find out nothing. Incensed, Wiltberger questioned his slaves further, but to no avail. He then picked up his pen and proceeded to write an advertisement to the Argus, the Savannah newspaper, calling on all whites to help him regain his property. He offered a 50 reward for the capture of his slave. He described her as a Mulatto Female Slave, named JANE, about eighteen years of age-5 feet two or three inches high-stout and well made-a pleasing and intelligent countenance-long jet black hair. The ad first appeared on July 14, and two months later, was still being printed in every issue of the newspaper. "," Wiltberger's description of Jane does a great deal to reveal why Jane had been successful in evading capture thus far. First, he described her as mulatto meaning that she had lighter skin than most enslaved people. Often, potential slave buyers were hesitant to buy lighter skinned slaves because they had a better chance of successfully escaping. Also, once away, a lighter skinned African American would have a better chance of blending into white society. Wiltberger's ad and the length of time it stayed in the newspaper, both demonstrate the basis on which these fears were founded. Wiltberger also described her as having a pleasing and intelligent countenance. Because many white southerners associated whiteness with intelligence and blackness with ignorance, lighter skinned slaves proved more of a liability and a threat to slaveholders because they were thought to be more intelligent and thus more able to run away."," One of a slaveholder's biggest concerns when debating whether or not to buy a slave was if that slave would run away or not. Many For Sale ads in newspapers made a point of stating that the slave being advertised would never run away. This emphasis shows what a huge issue it was in slave society and the lengths to which a slaveholder would go to in order to regain his property. Jane might not have been perceived as such a huge liability initially, however, because of her gender. Seventy-five percent of runaways were male, simply because female slaves gave birth and had the responsibilities of motherhood so early in life. Jane, at age 18, might already have had children that she was abandoning in her bid for freedom. Her gender also, no doubt, helped in her success because a black woman was perceived as far less of a threat than a black man in the South; therefore, she would likely have had an easier time blending into a crowd.

Sally described her living situation in the city, telling her mother that she participated in the gaieties of the city, however more moderately and prudently than she had in her first year residing there, as some of the novelty [had] worn off a great measure. There were parties almost every night of the week, and Sally greatly enjoyed attending these functions, particularly those of Dr. Brockenbrough, whom she described as delightful. Sally was yet to visit the theatre, which always seemed to conflict with those social events (she was planning to go soon though). Her favorite outfit to wear in social settings was a pure white dress, with pearl earrings and a necklace. Her Uncle John (perhaps her mother's brother) had complimented her on the simplicity and chasteness of the attire. At the end of her correspondence Sally sent her regards to her siblings, noted that she had enclosed money for her brother to by a hat (15) as she had an abundant supply of money, and wished her family well. She left her mother by saying my letters are sacred, and my communications are too free and unreserved for any eye save that of a parent or sister, requesting that her letters be kept private."," In the nineteenth century (before the Civil War), Richmond was considered the finest city in the south, and Sally seems to have been privy to see the bright side of it. Richmond was truly a big Southern city, with more than 16,000 people by 1830. Joshua Rothman went as far as calling it the most important city in the Upper South. Carter wrote of having abundant money (as 15 was no small sum in 1827) and going to social events, a luxury of being a member of Richmond's upper class. She seemed to truly enjoy her environment and her life in Richmond, as most in her luxurious position would have. Her Uncle John's comments on her attire show the typical appropriate dress for a young lady in antebellum Richmond, and her description of all the young men shows that she was treated like a true lady.

Their goal, under the guidance of their president, Rev. Howard Hyde Russell, was to unify the anti-alcohol sentiment already brewing in society and to enact further legislation to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcohol. Grounded in moral and religious ideals, the movement was able to spread information via pamphlets, newspapers, and the spoken word. Originating in Ohio, the American temperance organization was able to flow southward, slowly encompassing a nation. ","An article written in the Washington Post in 1897 exemplifies the efforts made by the organization to illustrate their cause and purpose throughout society. The realized the need to come together as a cohesive unit in the area. The Washington D.C. area, with 15 temperance organizations, convened with the Montgomery, Maryland County League seeking greater cooperation. The article made it seem relatively easy. However, the J.C. Jackson understood that the league struggled at first due to organizational and financial difficulties. Besides discussing organizational problems, the meeting conferred about the actions taken by members to badger grocers who profited from alcohol-related sales. The President was then authorized to appoint a committee whose purpose was to prepare a list of all grocers who recently received a liquor license. This was essential to the cause of the Anti-Saloon League. They wanted sales to cease, thus patronizing liquor salesperson was one of many necessary tactics incorporated. Such agitation meetings were usually held on Sunday with official leaders present. In 1908, there were at least 15,000 meetings. This number, however, fails to take into account the numerous meetings regarding prohibition, political good-citizenship, and law enforcement that the league had either a direct or an indirect relationship with.","Such meetings of prohibition in the country were essential to the South. Prohibitionist began making headway beginning with the execution of a new, more powerful liquor law was put into place. It exemplifies the coming of the Progressive movement that was extensive throughout the early years of the 20th century South. Church and political leaders believed that a large portion of societal problems, such as poverty, sickness, and crime were heavily due to alcohol. Due to the help of the evangelicals, Protestants, and Republican party, prohibition laws were able to be ratified. The Anti-Saloon League as well as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, were able to gain local and state wide option laws in most states; finally culminating in 1919 with the passage of the 18th Amendment. Prohibition dealt with humanizing institutions to adhere to newfound prized values and traditions. The southern ethos of the 20th century hurt the liquor industry doing the prohibition era. This resulted in the rise of moonshining.

After heartily endorsing the editorial, the Telegraph ran the entirety of the article.","The <em>Knickerbocker </em> began by reviewing the failure of male education and, thus, the necessity of educating females. Because even schooling had failed to save the male mind from its aggression and sexual deviance, females needed to be educated in order to help lead society. Now, the woman who should be seen rather than heard symbolized an abandonment of useful knowledge and a trifling waste of time. A woman who desired to shine in society and win the hearts and minds of educated men should herself be educated.","According to the editorial, the time for ignoring female intellect had passed. While it wished not to detract from earlier accomplishments, this article pushed on for an exaltation of the female mind. Contrary to popular belief at the time, the scientists behind this editorial knew that the capability of the female mind did not differ in potential from that of the male mind. Despite the subjugation of the female by society, female accomplishments numbered many and this number would grow infinitely if given the proper opportunity. ","The editorial closed by noting that mankind is often copyists of the old world, or simply blind followers of tradition. If the women of the United States were to succeed, they would do through formal education, an increased appreciation of literature, and increased morality, not by remaining within the bounds of society's conventions. The refreshing shower expanding into eloquence and beauty via the cultivation of female intellect became the rallying point for the Knickerbocker, and in turn through their endorsement, the Georgia Telegraph.","For a major newspaper, the Georgia Telegraph was ahead of its time culturally. While colleges and female seminaries called for equity in education for females, society largely constructed a much more traditional standard for women and education. While other newspapers hosted advertisements for women's schooling, most of these schools featured sewing, knitting, child rearing, and housekeeping. In this way, much of southern society demanded the training of ladies, but the <em>Knickerbocker </em>and the Telegraph sought a well-rounded, equally educated woman for a changing antebellum South.","Despite the general sentiment of the population against the education of females, education in the South was actually far less gendered than most realize. As a focus on human rights and evangelical Christianity swept the nation, women's education for the sake of education itself and so that women had the ability to read and understand the Bible for themselves gained increased attention. Despite the focus on the cultivation of the female mind, specific institutions often remained loyal to societal consensus in their academic practices. While schools focused on the educational development of the female mind, they also sought to reinforce cultural expectations of what it meant to be a woman. Housework, child-rearing, and the expectations of life as a southern lady in plantation society remained on the educational docket, even as a focus on the academic lives of women grew."],"display_date":"July 6, 1835","search_date":"1835-07-06","locations":[{"id":1547,"lat":32.8060034472,"lng":-83.7076277097,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3027,"title":"Samuel Whitall&#39;s Correspondence with Mr. J.

This included anything from daily proceedings, like crop production, to more serious matters, like the sale of land.  Interested buyers would contact Mr. Whitall, who would then let Master Washington know of their inquiry and offer.  This particular correspondence is a postscript to a previous letter Mr. Whitall had written to Master Washington earlier that morning, concerning the state of a piece of land.

Subject focuses by which women may be qualified to earn independent support, or to make their homes more comfortable, more economical and more beautiful were also to be major players in a student's life at the college. The board decided to include one year of prepatory study in the curriculum while incorporating the pedagogies, English, the classics, the sciences, industrial arts, the arts and other varying departments. The faculty was to control the institution under a president; professors were to be entrusted with the instruction and control of the several collegiate departments of study and the concept of texts. As an outside body, the board of trustees was to have the ability to appoint instructors, determine terms of office and salaries, and determine meetings for delegation. "," While Reconstruction inspired change through government orders and social reforms, the 1890s incorporated developments involving the education system and women. Throughout southern history, the women have predominately been domestic characters that were, if educated at all, taught in the home through private tutors. According to Edward Ayers, the bicycle, the right of petition and the push for admission into centers of higher education all show the metamorphosis of the southern white woman into a new woman of independence. In the example of Winthrop Normal College at Rock Hill, women were allowed into a college in order to expand their knowledge; this showed a sense of growth of women's rights in the state. However, according to Elizabeth Colton, Southern women often specialized in the more feminine studies, like art and hospitality, which differentiated the Southern female education experience from many other parts of the country at this time period. While the female students were often focusing more on beautification and art at relatively early stages of their college careers, the progress of female education is still apparent in the expansion of the Winthrop Normal College at Rock Hill into its present location."],"display_date":"January 24, 1894","search_date":"1894-01-24","locations":[{"id":11686,"lat":34.9901378817,"lng":-81.2182346044,"zoom":9,"place":"YORK, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3065,"title":"Miss Lu Lucas, the Manager of a Large Estate in Madison Parish, Louisiana","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-09-20","end_date":"1884-09-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" In Madison Parish, Louisiana, Miss Lu Lucas manages a large estate, and spends the greater part of her time in the saddle, wrote Harper's Bazaar in the Personal section on September 20, 1884.  This excerpt, though very brief, is packed with information about women who lived in the Reconstruction era South.  Most striking at first is that Luc Lucas was a Miss, that she was an unmarried woman who was operating a plantation.  The fact that Lu was not married could have multiple explanations, but most likely Lu had inherited the estate from her father.  It is possible that her father died a natural death at home, but it is also likely that he was killed or injured while fighting in the Civil War.  As George C. Rable writes of Jane Turner Censer's book The Reconstruction of White Southern Womanhood, 1865-1895, After the war, women increasingly inherited real property and served as executors of men's estates.  So many Southern men had died during the Civil War, or were unable to manage a plantation when they returned home, so women were often responsible for taking over their families' estates.  Rable goes on to include that Censer asserts in her work how  marriage prospects declined for Southern women after the war, emphasizing that more young women apparently chose to remain single during this time.  Whether Lu could not find a husband, or if she decided not to marry is not specified.  However, it can be concluded that simply her ability to function in such a role of high status (that of operating an estate) proves that women in the South were beginning to step outside the lines that they had been previously been defined within.  "," The inclusion of Lu's short, simple biography in Harper's also reveals that her lifestyle was accepted.  Before the war, white Southern women were often confined to domestic chores and occupations; but with Lu's story, it seems that women's lives were expanding in that they were now recognized as capable of running an estate.  That this position was socially acknowledged shows that the role of women in the south was changing dramatically after the Civil War.   "," Lastly, the mention of Lu's ability to spend a lot of time riding horses reveals that although she was managing a large estate, she still had a great deal of spare time.  That Lu owned horses for sport and pleasure means that not only was she the proprietor of her own land, but also that she was wealthy and active enough to partake in leisurely entertainment venues.  "," Even though the larger details of Lu's life are unknown, the information found in this short passage and its broader implications show a great deal about how women's positions and roles in society were changing during Reconstruction.  Along with many other members of their society, women were experimenting with their notions of self during Reconstruction."],"display_date":"September 20, 1884","search_date":"1884-09-20","locations":[{"id":5578,"lat":32.147356423,"lng":-91.0322487665,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3082,"title":"Laura Merrick Entertains Union Soldiers\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-05-21","end_date":"1863-05-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["While many of their husbands and fathers went to fight in the Civil War, Southern women were often left at home to care for their families.

They strangely requested that Laura sing Bonnie Blue Flag, a Confederate song. Midway through the song Laura burst into tears and ran from the room. After the soldiers apologized for making her so upset, Laura unhappily returned to the parlor. The soldiers informed Laura that they had no hard feelings toward her, because Louisiana's decision to secede was not controlled by the people since African-American opinion was ignored.

Coming through inclement weather, they prayed with the ministers and found spiritual comfort. So successful and popular were these meetings, that the leading opinions in the town were in favor of extending the revival meeting for an entire month, to solidify the influence of Christianity in the region.

Revival meetings such as this one became common as preachers sought to extend their messages beyond the walls of their churches in efforts truly to evangelize the population. Historians tell us that a great many church members were women, so it is safe to say that the women of Rogersville and its environs probably attended this series of revival meetings. Indeed, they most likely brought others with them to hear the messages of sin, repentance, and rebirth being preached by the variety of ministers.

Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, coming from Kentucky, decided to open an academy for young ladies in Nashville. This Academy was very similar to those built for young Tennessean men even if some subjects were specific to women's instruction. Thus, the married couple taught subjects as significant as the pronunciation of English language, reading, penmanship, arithmetic, English grammar and geography with the use of the globes. The Academy was also organized like other schools: the students paid tuition fees (at first, it was 45 dollars per session but it increased a lot during the following year) and ladies who came from afar were boarded. So, the opening of the Arnolds' school had an impact both on Nashville's population and those of other states. This school was very successful from the beginning and the Arnolds quickly announced the Academy would stay open the following years. Ten years after its establishment, in 1826, it enrolled almost three hundred students whereas the University of Nashville, built for men, rarely had more than 100 students, since most men chose to study in other states. Nashville Female Academy soon became one of the best known schools for girls in the South and was considered as a local pride and an example to follow. When President James Monroe came to Nashville in 1819, he went into the school for an address before students and faculty members who were considered as full-fledged scholars. ","The Nashville Academy was created at a time when other institutions were admitting only men and tended to be religious. It was a really quaint institution, even if academies for ladies soon started to flourish elsewhere in the South. Education was by no means confined to the East and the North. Female education received a special attention in Tennessee which was, as far as women education is concerned, a pioneer state. For example, The Fisk Female Academy, created in Overton County in 1806 is considered as the first academy for girls in the South. Other schools for girls followed in the Volunteer State: in Knoxville, Memphis, Gallatin, Rogersville, Murfreesboro, McMinnville, Paris,and Lebanon for example. These schools were a part of the social and economic transition in Tennessee after the war of 1812. Indeed, this war, fought between the United States and Great Britain from June 1812 to the spring of 1815, had a big impact on Tennessee (the huge number of Tennesseans involved in this war even gave its nickname, The Volunteer State to Tennessee) and so had the ensuing panic that is to say a period of financial distress which followed. In Tennessee, reconstruction was also achieved by education. This transition started sooner in Tennessee and permitted the development, the democratization and the modernization of the state. For that matter, women education is still considered as an indicator for the level of development.

On June 1, 1821, a special court, held in Clarksville, Montgomery County, charged two slaves owned by Mr. William Sullivan with having killed Elizabeth Crockett. According to The Watchman, a Tennessean newspaper: the court and jury were occupied until about eleven o'clock, on Thursday night, with the examination of the case. Travis, one of the two slaves was acquitted, for the want of sufficient proof. The following day, there was the trial of his son, Kinchen, who was found guilty of murder and sentenced to be hanged on 8 June 1821. According to the journalist from The Watchman: The number of persons assembled to witness the scene was very great, not withstanding a heavy shower of rain, which commenced as soon as he was taken from jail and continued until near the time of execution.","Elizabeth Crockett's case shows how women, white and black, were vulnerable to the violence in the antebellum South. Indeed, being a member of a quite well-to-do family was not enough to be protected and it was sometimes a cause of their misfortune. As everywhere in the South, violence was part of the life of people in Tennessee, especially violence between different races. But Tennessee had to deal with lots of interactions between races, perhaps more than other states, notably because Tennessee was a frontier state with many Indian lands. It also had to deal with class cohabitation because there was a gap between rich planters and other Tennesseans. This is why violence was present in different ways in Tennessee: murder, robbery, revolts... The answer to this violence was justice: courts were enormously solicited, even for slaves such as in Elizabeth Crockett's case."],"display_date":"June 1, 1821 - June 30, 1821","search_date":"1821-06-15","locations":[{"id":12258,"lat":36.4871319194,"lng":-87.369253396,"zoom":10,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3132,"title":"Poisoning in the Hyde Family\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-07-21","end_date":"1841-07-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The entire Hyde family lay sick in bed and hoped that it was not their last hour. They had drunk their coffee and eaten breakfast as usual that morning, but began to feel ill soon afterwards. The shared pain made them wonder if someone had poisoned them. As it turned out, someone had slipped poisonous Jameson weed into their coffee. But who would do such a thing? That evening as the family recovered, the police arrested a black woman name Frances for the crime and planned to try her the next morning. ","Adolphus Sterne described this event in his diary on July 21, 1841. The only information Sterne gave about Frances was that she was a negro woman. This presumably meant that Frances was one of the Hyde family's household slaves, possibly a cook since she had access to their coffee. Frances's method of murder is significant as Joshua D. Rothman explains: In most cases, women were physically weaker than their owners. When they wished to harm a master or his family, arson or poisoning were more typical weapons of choice. True to Rothman's statement, Frances used poison as a way to injure her master and his family. Her physical limitations as a woman and the ease of obtaining poison and administering it made poisoning her preferred weapon. ","That their own household slave tried to murder them no doubt came as a shock to the Hyde family, and indeed upset many other white families in the area. When slaves rose up against their masters, regardless of the context in which they did so, they implicitly threatened all masters and all whites, observes Rothman. Frances's attempt set a dangerous precedent. If a slave woman could almost murder a family, what could a slave man, or worse a band of slave men do? Episodes like this created feelings of fear and distrust in the minds of slave owners. It also opened the way for other such crimes on the part of slaves. Thus the people had to act quickly on this matter. They planned to try Frances the very next day because they needed to show that they would not tolerate such undermining of a master's authority.

Kimball, from Shenandoah County, Virginia was suddenly, like so many other women of the South, thrown into a completely different world as the Civil War raged through the South. Mrs. Kimball was put in charge of her family's plantation while her husband was away at war and she kept the plantation records in a journal which she wrote in everyday. In this journal she wrote about the Soldiers Aid Society for which she paid dues and would make visits to the soldiers in the hospital bringing baked goods to help them gather strength. On February 10, 1862 Mrs. Kimball wrote Went to the hospital took bread + butter + Ham, soup. The Arkansas Hospital men seemed grateful, one man said he would have perished had it not been for the ladies.","Women through out the United States were subject to their spouse's needs and demands during this time, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese states. In the South, as in many other societies, church and state substantially reinforced the prevalent forms of male dominance. In the South, women's involvement in social committees and aid societies, like the Soldiers Aid Society, was largely an attempt to create their own sphere, separate from that of their husbands. While women in the higher, slaveholding class held more power and control over their day to day activities than lower class women, they were still in need of outside organizations to occupy them and solidify their say in society. Southern society discouraged involvement in these groups that were not connected to the church, for the most part, southern women did their charitable work individually, selectively, and close to home, if not with in their own households. The Soldiers Aid Society that Mrs. Kimball was a part of is a rare example of southern women stepping out of the male dominated worlds of their homes and churches and gathering to help their newly formed country. With so many southern plantation owners helping in the war effort societies and organizations were more likely to be formed. The men that for the most part governed the activities of women were now busy elsewhere and the women were left with time and freedom on their hands. Benevolent women easily explained such activity as natural extensions of their domestic duties and moral qualities, Elizabeth Varon asserts, so the absence of their husbands allowed them to do what they felt was necessary and normal but that they had been kept from before."],"display_date":"February 5, 1862 - February 20, 1862","search_date":"1862-02-12","locations":[{"id":14269,"lat":38.8584536791,"lng":-78.5704125087,"zoom":9,"place":"SHENANDOAH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3156,"title":"Chincoteague Prohibition\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-04-25","end_date":"1887-04-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On a late April weekend, Chincoteague residents gathered to celebrate the one year anniversary of their local option legislation, which barred their community from devastating alcohol consumption. Crowded in the town's Temperance Hall, because of rain outside, Friday night witnessed the much anticipated literary and musical entertainment. Despite the weather, spirits remained high and prominent male and female speakers generated great joy and thunderous applause. The night's favorite performance came in the form of nine year old Mamie, whose solos left the audience shackled by their laughter. The enthusiasm for the temperance celebration surprised even the event's organizers; as the anniversary resulted in complete success. Despite no boring pleas for money, donations covered all the expenses. Sunday, April 24, celebrated by all the local churches as Temperance Day, witnessed mass meetings at several churches, with gripping sermons that kept people in their pews long past when the doxology and benediction normally concluded services. "," Protestant churches in the South regarded the coming of a New, commercial South in the late nineteenth century as a threat to the Old South culture, so deeply rooted in Christianity. Thus, local organizations, often supported by churches, emerged to improve and perfect an increasingly chaotic society. Movements towards Prohibition grew out of these efforts, which more often than not had a strong female presence. Such a seemingly Puritanical movement generated resistance from those who felt the church had overstepped its bounds. Nonetheless, some isolated communities, like Chincoteague Island, were able to construct their own local temperance options, though areas with a larger lower class typically encountered more resistance. "," On a national level, a prohibition party could never succeed due to the differences between temperance supporters in the North and South. Most Northern prohibitionists were Republicans and former abolitionists, anathema to self-respecting Southern elites. Within Virginia, however, the Prohibition Party increased by 1887 to ten times its support in 1884. These followers tended to see bars and saloons as the basis for the wrongs of Southern culture, fostering lewdness and incessant swearing. Oftentimes, the prohibitionists would reach out to blacks for several reasons. First, they were seen as important swing voters who could counteract the usually dominant Democratic Party. Also, there existed religious and class based reasons that white professionals could associate and share the same values with their black counterparts. This sort of mutual respect appears in a statement made by a white, pro-temperance preacher, Let us make a great pile of all the unreasonable race prejudices, all political animosities, all sectional bitterness, all partisan hate.... The most successful nation-wide coalition in the nineteenth century; however, came with the creation of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the first group formed by solely women to act politically. Nevertheless, no state encompassing prohibition laws emerged until later on in the 1900's. Yet, by 1887, Chincoteague rejoiced in finding what they considered a more perfect society.

They declared their overarching objective to be the advancement of science, and, despite a great deal of bureaucracy, at least improved their own knowledge during each meeting. The Academy consisted of a certain group of 27 gentlemen, each one an original member and founder. They had strict rules about admitting other gentlemen and under no circumstances allowed women into their organization. This Academy was intended to further scientific knowledge, and generally succeeded in doing just that, despite giving off intimidating airs of self-importance. The years leading up to the Civil War were filled with political and economic overtones. The Union expanded its area and admitting new states into its ranks, the debate about slavery raged on, traders continued to do brisk business, abolitionists picked up steam, merchants shipped cotton all over the world, life carried on. The natural surroundings provided a constant backdrop for the many Americans buying and selling, arguing and forgiving, growing and producing. Most importantly, they also equipped the nation with a climate that made agriculture such a successful venture in its southern states."," The members of the New Orleans Academy of the Sciences were not as interested in the ramifications of this economic viability as they were in the natural processes themselves. These gentlemen went on to suggest a method of using levees and canals to protect the city from Mississippi River floods, and also made daily meteorological notes. This natural world, which provided both rationalizations for keeping people in bondage and for their owners to make a great deal of money as a result, greatly fascinated the Academy members. Many of them wrote their own individual papers - and presented the research to their fellow members - that stemmed from this absorption with their natural and scientific settings. "," Understandably, that same natural atmosphere affected the Academy members in very real ways. For example, yellow fever breakouts caused meeting suspensions in the summer months. Undoubtedly, inclement weather occasionally prevented some of them from being able to attend their meetings. Regardless, or perhaps because, of the way that nature affected their day to day existence, the members of the New Orleans Academy of the Sciences believed in the work they were doing.

She lived a life of luxury and refinement until tragedy struck and she lost several children and her husband, all by 1853. After her husband's death, she was forced into a dominant role in the running of the household, in both the domestic and business spheres. ","This new role meant that she often had to negotiate with men over money and labor. In August of 1866, Anne entered into a deal with a man identified only as Mr. Winston, over the cultivation of land unto for corn and the purchase and fattening of cattle. She asserts her authority throughout the letter in several ways, informing the reader, who is unidentified but not Mr. Winston himself, that I would be willing to pay Mr. Winston for his time in seeing the corn measured and put into the house. I don't see how he would be bothered in any other way about it, except to see that the tenants did not injure the land. With this assertive statement, Anne is implying that there is absolutely no reason that the deal should not go exactly as she wishes. ","Women in the South in this period were not typically valued for their shrewdness as negotiators or ability to successfully run a plantation.

In 1870, Ella Painter wrote her Aunt Lena many letters from Dublin, Virginia, with updates and inquiries about Lena's new husband and children. On her fourteenth birthday, Ella wrote her Aunt a lengthy letter which she felt was long overdue. Ella's love and admiration for her Aunt is clear as she nearly begs her to come back and visit. She writes about her recent visitors, her grandfathers new farm, and all of the new additions to the family. The startling aspect of the letter however, is the news of the many close acquaintances living in Dublin who had contracted serious illnesses. Lizzie Cecil had contracted Consumption (Tuberculosis), Ann Martin had Rheumatism, and Julia Jackson had been ill with Typhoid fever. Ella had found out that Dr. Stearns believed Miss Jackson would die, and while she seemed to be doing better, he still believed she could terminate in Consumption. ","Each summer, towns like Dublin saw their cemeteries, dotted with graves of upper-class youth who were victim of disease. Diseases did not discriminate. Death rates in the South remained higher than that of the North for much of the nineteenth century. Without formal vaccines, southerners turned to their own forms of medicine. ","When typhoid fever was believed to be caused by soured tree stumps giving off toxic vapors, entire forests were burned. Someone who had come down with typhoid, or the slow fever, would be treated through sweating, purging, and puking. A more adventurous remedy involved cutting a chicken in half and placing each half on the soles of the feet in order to pull the fever out. ","Rheumatism describes a form of arthritis and other muscle discomforts. For this, Appalachians had more unique remedies. Rattlesnake or red worm oil was sometimes rubbed into the ailing area. Some believed that bee stings would bring relief and advised sufferers to disturb a bee's nest and allow themselves to be stung until it was unbearable. ","Very little could be done for those with consumption. Some slept with ice packs containing their own coughed-up blood on their chests, while others were told to inhale the fumes of a skunk that was placed loose in their room. These remedies most likely did very little to stop the onset of death. It would not be until 1929 that the death rates in Virginia would reach the low of eleven deaths per thousand people.

These elaborate and beautiful adornments awaited guests of the Women's Department at Atlanta's 1895 Cotton Exposition. Women's social clubs from the entirety of Georgia labored to make their display a true success. To do so, they culled art and handiwork from around the country, including particular contributions from Virginia, Illinois, and Maryland. Once acquired, women then categorized the work into different themed rooms like the Baltimore Room, the Lucy Cobb Room, the decorative art department, the library, and the Columbus Room. Though the addition of a Women's Department in Atlanta's Cotton States and International Convention may seem somewhat superfluous, women's social clubs throughout the region deemed it important to showcase women's progress throughout the South. Indeed, the display by the Women's Department was one of the hotspots of the Exposition featuring beautiful novelties in art and domestic living and hosting many visitors. Exhibits like that arranged by the Legion of Loyal Women drew particular attention. The Legion arranged 45 dolls to illustrate the American Patriotic salute, each wearing a small shield on which is the name of a state. Displays like this one spoke to expected social and domestic roles of Southern women as its image called forth the patriotism and republican ideals which mothers should imbue in their children.","Before television and radio, a city's means of attracting tourists was extremely limited; however, in the late nineteenth century, fairs and expositions rose to prominence as one manner of luring visitors. The 1895 Convention was one of three conventions hosted by Atlanta to demonstrate the city's recovery and economic promise following the ravages of the Civil War and Reconstruction. In short, they helped establish Atlanta as the center of the New South. Displaying special buildings, collections of accomplishments by African Americans and women, and new technological marvels in the fields of transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, and the like, the Atlanta Exposition in 1895 sought to entice visitors and encourage new business development in the community. The Exposition also had an international element, for it hoped not only to foster trade between southern states and South American nations but also to show products and facilities of to the rest of the nation and to Europe. These objectives found expression in the official name of the event - the Cotton States and International Exposition. Though the focus of the event was on attracting visitors and potential investors, women played a large role in the Exposition, and the weight of representing an image of the classic South rested on their dainty shoulders. ","In flipping through the script of American political history, it is quite simple to assign men the role of title character and women the part of the ever-faithful sidekick. Naturally, there were those exceptional women in history who earned cameos in the public realm against the odds; however, the greatest proportion of women could be found backstage, arranging affairs like the Women's Department at the 1895 Exposition. Events like this were one of many manners in which women assumed a more social role at the end of the Nineteenth Century. They engaged in municipal housekeeping, reform, beautification projects, and to some extent even suffrage associations. Though the ideals of Republican Motherhood still somewhat constrained their liberties and social freedom, by the time of the Exposition in 1895, American women were progressively organizing and developing an identity as a whole.

Within his announcement, he introduced his sale of property, and then he listed three groups of property that he planned to sell. His first set only contained slaves: Milley, age 22, her two children, Mary, age five, Henry, age three or four, and Charlotte, a girl fifteen years of age, apparently not within Milley's family. The second set of property included a one-acre lot within the town of Athens, and four enslaved African Americans, a carriage and harness, a wagon, a cart, one yoke of oxen, one cow and calf, four tables, and four glasses.","Placed next to wagons and cows in advertisements, enslaved African Americans took on the face of property. Charlotte had been separated from every person within her family, and her situation sadly reveals one of the tragic truths of the slave trade. Charlotte was only a single example of what happened consistently throughout the South. We are unsure as to whether Charlotte separated from her family during the interstate slave trade or, as was the case in Sheriff Herndon's sale, an intrastate slave trade. If she had been separated from her nuclear family during an interstate slave trade, then she had something in common with one out of every two slaves she met.","Throughout the South, prospective buyers analyzed the slaves intensely and traders worked vigorously to make the sale. Consistent with the thought that many Southerners did not see slaves as much other than property, Jeanette Keith claimed that auctioneers saw women with their potential as 'breeders,' and auctioneers attempted to increase the present value of a female slave by convincing a buyer that she could produce inherently stronger and more efficient offspring in the future. Buyers, such as those that would appear at Sheriff Herndon's sale, however, to ensure that they evaluated their expensive and long-term investment correctly, examined the entire bodies of naked slaves and checked for scars from whip marks.

Rambin explained to her sister that the effort she put into cooking, housework, and the washing caused her to seldom feel like writing. Rambin put special emphasis on the fact that she did her own washing, because many women paid others to do their washing for them. Rambin told her sister that she too could pay someone to do her washing, but preferred to do it herself while she could. Rambin, however, did have help in the kitchen from the hired African American who stayed in the kitchen to get her water and wood.","In the letter to her sister, Rambin also addressed the issue of the girls' (presumably her daughters') schooling. Rambin did not see the point in the girls continuing to go to school for much longer, unless they meant to become teachers. Rambin found the idea of the girls learning French especially ridiculous, since she noted that what French I learned was of very little use to me...and if they were to remain in Louisiana they would not have much use to practice it. She also asked if her sister would write to May M. Allen to see if she would be willing to come to De Soto, Louisiana, to either live with Rambin to teach her children or to teach at the local Catholic Community School. Rambin, however, expressed her fears that Allen would marry and give up teaching, leaving Rambin to finish educating her children on her own.","Rambin's chief concern in her letter, her housework, represents the adjustment many white women had to make after emancipation. They found themselves needing to do their own housework, which required a large amount of time from the former plantation mistresses. Laundry could take up to three days to do, and women often spent just as much time sewing and mending the clothes. In addition to this, women needed to cook, bake, and keep the house clean. Rambin might have been willing to do her own washing, but she still turned to an African American to complete the tasks she did not have time to do herself, and could afford to allocate to someone else. Even with the help of a few African American servants, the adjustment for Southern women to household work often caused resentment towards the North, which was a dominant sentiment in the South during Reconstruction.","Rambin's letter also addresses the changes of education in the South and women's role in education. During and after Reconstruction, Louisiana experienced a statewide decline in public education that resulted in a decrease in white literacy between 1880 and 1890. Private and parochial schools, such as the Catholic Community School Rambin mentions, were often used by whites instead of the poor quality public schools. Rambin did not mention if it was the decline in the educational system that prompted her dislike of keeping her girls in school, but if the Rambins were paying for the girls' education the economic hardship that was continually present in the South probably created a more important use of the money than tutoring in French. Her willingness to allow them to continue school to become teachers reflects the start in the increased amount of female teachers, which would double in number during the upcoming 1880s.

The meeting brought together thousands of educators and their friends and was meant to restore strength and energy to them in the relaxing city on the sea. The committee chose among the top teachers in North Carolina to speak at the session and each department was assigned a specific day with a unique program arranged by a select committee. Among the sessions were Popular Education, Classical, Academical, County Superintendents, English Literature, Temperance, and General History. In addition to the education sessions, there was two public entertainments and a special lecture by Frank Beard who, as the popular and witty Chalk Artist, was said to have no equal in America. His lesson centered on the use of the blackboard in the school and Sunday-school as a way of rapidly illustrating important lessons and information to the pupils. Other special guests included the Reverend Thomas Dixon, Jr., a talented speaker through the United States, and the University Glee Club, an entertaining singing group. The event was entirely free to all members of the Teachers' Assembly who held Certificates of Membership.","By 1892, the Teachers' Assembly was a rapidly expanding organization whose success was due large in part to the general prosperity and expansion of the school systems throughout North Carolina. The annual sessions helped to encourage and inspire the teachers to continue their labor, in addition to providing support and appreciation for their hard work throughout the year. The teaching profession offered an outlet for woman to operate outside the home and thus gave them a degree of autonomy that many did not enjoy in other facets of their lives.","Lefler and Newsome described the 1880s and early 1890s as a time of much reform to the education systems in the South. Many new graded schools and colleges opened in North Carolina throughout the 1880s and 1890s. This era was the beginning of separate segregated schools for the blacks and whites in North Carolina and the beginning of a movement that saw the opening of colleges throughout the state. Lefler and Newsome stressed that while there were increasing opportunities for minorities to become educated, the white Americans continued to control the school systems and received the best education. Thus, it is likely that the Teacher's Assembly session was limited to people who taught in white schools."],"display_date":"June 21, 1892 - July 4, 1892","search_date":"1892-06-27","locations":[{"id":9234,"lat":35.538020448,"lng":-77.0550206325,"zoom":9,"place":"BEAUFORT, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3226,"title":"Annabella Porter Sells Cotton to Joseph Gammill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-06-21","end_date":"1824-09-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the summer of 1824, Annabella Porter sold seven bales of cotton to Joseph Gammill.

Mrs. Porter also subtracted on several charges because she paid other parties for their services, and her extra charges were 0.50 for mending, 1.75 for the storage of the cotton for one month, and a commission of 0.50 for each bale, which equaled 3.50 for the total commission charge. The overall charge for Mr. Gammill was the sum of the two sets of bales minus the extra charges, 184.96 and 105.63 subtracted by 5.75, which equaled 284.82.

Susanna Delfino and Michele Gillespie claimed that her responsibilities included ensuring religious and emotional succor to family, friends, and slaves, and entertaining her husband's business and political acquaintances. In many ways, the plantation mistress encompassed a significant position in the plantation lifestyle because she would often maintain the social structure and ensure that all areas of domestic life functioned properly. The plantation owner, or master, managed the economics behind running a Southern plantation. In this respect, Annabella Porter exemplified a case where the mistress was an active participant in the daily financial transactions of her plantation. This was, however, unusual given that the plantation owner usually managed the economics of the Southern plantation.","More importantly, the expansion of the blossoming cotton economy was evident within the note. Plantations distributed cotton from buyers to sellers. On a larger scale, planters who had grown rice and indigo, because of increased demand and the ability with the cotton gin to meet that demand, transferred their resources to cotton. The Georgia Piedmont, along with the foothill country of South Carolina, vied for the top echelon as the most significant cotton producing center in the U.S. during the early 1800's.

Slaves, being the property of their masters, couldn't just freely marry at their heart's desire. There was a standard protocol. In his biographical narrative, Allen Parker recounted how the process would likely unfold on a plantation in Chowan County, North Carolina. If a male slave wanted to marry a woman from another plantation, he first had to obtain the permission of the girl herself. Then, he would ask for consent from his own masters. If they approved, he would then travel to the girl's plantation and approach her owner. The conversation would go something like: Hello Sam Is that you? <em>Yes Massa, its me... </em>Sam, what message did your Master send by you? <em>Did'nt send no message, sar, I comed myself.</em> What You don't mean to say that you have run away Sam? <em>No sar, Massa told me as how I might come and see Massa Jones. </em>Well Sam, what is it, does your Master intend to hire you out next year and you want me to hire you? <em>No sar, Massa John don't let his niggers, he wants me hisself.

Then, he would prolong the matter: Well Sam, I like your looks, and I will think it over. You come and see me next week and I will tell you. <em>Can I see Sue, Massa? </em>Yes Sam, you can see her when she comes from the field. After spending some time with his sweetheart and waiting a week, the slave would then return to the owner: Hello Sam, you here again, what do you want this time? <em>Well Massa Jones, I comed to see as to what you thought about me and Sue getting married. </em>Get out you nigger. <em>But Massa told Sam to come. </em>How's that Sam? <em>Massa Jones told Sam to come in one week, and den Massa Jones tell Sam as how he can marry Sue or not. </em>O yes, I remember now, well Sam I have talked it over with Sue's Mistress and we have concluded to let you marry Sue, and I will have a cabin built down by the quarters and Sue can live there. <em>Thankie Massa.","</em>","African Americans strove to establish meaningful family relations under slavery. There was a strong desire for social space between slave and master, as Emily West notes in <em>Chains of Love</em>. Though slave marriages were not legally recognized under traditional white law, developing meaningful relationships that existed independent of white authority represented a means of resistance against oppression. These relationships also pointed out the gender differences among slaves, the male being expected to initiate romantic contact. Allen Parker recalled how his father would regularly walk ten miles in the middle of the night to see his wife and his family. Slave families often had to struggle to remain together as evidenced in Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul</em>.

The contest between the two opposing groups claimed to be a friendly one. The vote on prohibition also concerned other counties in Georgia. Rev. J. W.

These three other counties voted on the topic concerning prohibition on the same day.","The fact that The Constitution, an Atlanta based newspaper, which was far from the Georgia counties mentioned, noted these elections showed the importance of the issue of prohibition to all the people in the state.

The national prohibition movement involved many different types of people including judges, church leaders and women. ","Prohibition began in the 1840s in the United States. Religious groups at the time promoted prohibition as a way of cleansing society. As time passed, prohibitionists gained momentum and a larger following. During the 1880s, the prohibitionists gained a great deal of strength through the formation of different groups in the United States. The Women's Christian Temperance Union and the Prohibitionist Party both held great clout during this time period in history. These groups promoted the ideas of prohibition which mainly included no selling of alcohol or consumption of any kind. The ideals of prohibition continued in America for quite some time.

Alcohol consumption was generally acceptable in the Western states and territories. Movements against it would not occur until a decade later. By 1831, there were temperance groups in every state except for Louisiana, but the movement would only have small levels of support and more in the eastern seaboard states than in the West. More striking was an old woman's participation in business, although slaveholding mistresses often took on a significant part in managing plantations. But to help a husband was one thing; for a woman to run her own business was quite another. While it was true that living on the frontier encouraged women to be just as creative and resourceful as men, the subordination of women had a strong foundation in the law. Anything a woman owned in most states passed to her husband when she married, but upon her husband's death, some women chose to run their businesses or plantations on their own. Perhaps this aged gentlewoman was one such case.","Traditionally in Southern society, as in much of the Western world in the nineteenth century, women were held subordinate to men, and it was not terribly different on the frontier. This ideology was especially useful in the Southern defense of slavery: just like a woman was subordinate to her father or husband, a slave was subordinate to his master. There was order in life, everyone had their place, and white men enjoyed equality as free men and masters over their families. So this napping old woman seemed an oddity in this natural hierarchy; she ran a business and trafficked in alcohol.

The general assembly failed to pass a law that would prohibit anyone under the age of 13 from working in cotton factories. The Savannah Press was disturbed by the actions taken by the legislators in Georgia. The general assembly's actions showed that the need for production outweighed the importance of fair labor standards. ","During the nineteenth century many farmers planed cotton throughout the South. In Georgia, cotton was one of the main cash crops. Before the Civil War slaves worked on cotton plantations which attempted to meet the great national and international consumer need for the product. After the Civil War, freedom was declared for African Americans and many plantation owners lost much of their labor force. The owners of plantations needed people to work the land in order to make sure the need for cotton was met. At the time of the industrialization of America the cotton industry grew, and cotton factories were built throughout the South. Cotton manufacturers needed workers in these factories, and the age of the worker did not seem to matter. Manufacturers were willing to employ anyone and the age or the person did not matter. It seemed to the Savannah Press that the necessity for cotton outweighed moral values of the employers who ran the cotton factories. Employers tended to depend on women and children who were under the age of 16 as the main source of the labor force. One textile executive stated that many employers took no regard as to who should work and how many hours a person should work. The legislators in Georgia seemed to agree with the cotton factory employers on the idea that having as many workers as possible in order to meet the demand for cotton was of the utmost importance.

E. Edwards preached at length to a great crowd at the Granby Street Methodist Church, concerning the proper role of women. He claimed Eve's involvement in the first human sin left her with certain characteristics that trickled down to even the women seated there before him. In all women, Edwards claimed one found a frailty, a mental nature of modesty and affection, and a subjection to man. By no means did such tendencies position a woman to a role inferior to men; on the contrary, the two genders must work together, albeit in different realms of society. As man must participate in worldly affairs, women, more delicate in bodily frame, and more sensitive in mental endowments, instinctively demean a quieter and secluded life. Having succeeded in capturing the attention of the men and women seated before him, Edwards delegated specific duties to women, like rearing children and looking after the morals of society in general. The reverend culminated the ablest sermon on such matters, by exhorting all women, who wish to fulfill their roles, to feel the waters of baptism and embrace Christ, as that would be their only means to affect proper influence."," Edward's message illustrates a great social dilemma that faced the country, especially in the postwar South, as many different views of proper women had emerged. White, Southern females, often belied the stereotypes of languid Southern womanhood, while at the same time, as a result of war, females had carved out a greater measure of independence. When men left to fight, women found themselves running the economic situation at home, and if husbands never returned from the fighting, they became the head of the household. Still devoted to traditional values of quiet resolve and working their good influence within the church and home, women, nonetheless, seemed to crave more. Common with the era, women set about forming all sorts of civic and religious organizations aimed at improving society, yet also this trend reflected a desire for greater influence and authority."," In the North, females became much more apt to move towards achieving political freedoms, most specifically the right to vote. Suffragists combined their cause with the Radical Republicans, during Reconstruction, who sought to enfranchise former slaves. Eventually, they found themselves humiliated and betrayed by those they had supported, when the 15 Amendment gave only black men the right to vote. These developments certainly scared Southern gentlemen, so used to thinking of their women a particular way, and they became forced to confront, possibly, a new role for women. Their response, evidenced by Reverend Edward's paternalistic argument, became to try to use women's proper influence to reassert the Southern values of the past. Women were to be preservers of tradition and perpetuate antebellum values, but women themselves would answer the same dilemma in different ways over time. Though, by 1876, in Norfolk at least, they seemed content to abide in accordance with their preacher's biblical rationalization.

On September 3, 1892, the True Index published an editorial discussing the change in women's behavior. The unnamed author expressed his disappointment that women had begun to take on typical male roles. The author found this transformation unflattering. He saw women as sweet and lovable. In his eyes, however, women had become mannish because they were interested in many of the things men were. In particular, he abhorred the use of male fashion and short hair. He also expressed his disapproval of women who played cards and bet on horses. The author advised that women should hold on to their old-fashioned charms, and to forget the female pursuit of the male role.","The author of the editorial seems to express a general feeling that women's involvement in politics or the work force stripped them of their femininity. John Boles argues that men, such as the author of this article, glorified the image of Southern womanhood because they somehow understood how dreary and unrewarding the reality of life was for their mothers and wives. Many women were forced to perform manual labor following the Civil War. One reason is that many women lost their husbands during the war and had to take on the responsibility of earning income themselves. Second, the emancipation of slaves meant that some women were without help and had to perform their activities themselves. In addition, the price of cotton following the Civil War dropped. Women had to find ways to supplement their income by doing things like selling butter, sewing, taking in borders and accepting other odd jobs. ","Life for women following the Civil War provided many opportunities that were not available to them beforehand. Boles explains that state federations of women's clubs were organized. These clubs broadened women's interests. Furthermore, these organizations allowed them to get involved in their communities. According to Boles, women advocated health reform in schools, city beautification projects and other important civic improvements.

At some point during the day - or perhaps it was the night - of April 9, 1847 a certain enslaved girl called Harriet disappeared from her owner's home in New Orleans. Details are not disclosed: was Harriet a slave on a large plantation or smaller home within the city? Had she just arrived? Did she have any children - or was she even old enough to bear a child? For all the mystery surrounding her departure from New Orleans, the fact remains that at least her owner was convinced that she had run away.

According to the owner, Harriet spoke not only English, but also French and Spanish. Her Spanish skills are rather mysterious, as there was virtually no Spanish influence in Louisiana at that point in Antebellum New Orleans. This may have been unintentional, but the fact also remains that Harriet's first listed language was French.

The slave trade was very much alive and well in the world of 1847 Louisiana, but the importation of slaves from Africa to the United States had been put to an end in 1807, after Thomas Jefferson signed a bill with that explicit purpose. Of course, this government action merely meant to some that their business operations would from then on be considered illegal. At that point, slavery had already become an integral part of the American economy, and taking legal action against the institution did not mean that it would quickly or easily fade away into oblivion. Furthermore, in that same year of 1807, plantation owners approved of legislation in their new territory of Louisiana that effectively prevented any slave from potentially becoming emancipated.

Literally. A man named Owings had fought a Mr. Anderson over an issue of honor and had been stabbed in Bath County, Kentucky in 1830. The doctor had declared that Owings's situation was not life threatening, but this diagnosis proved incorrect as the stabbing victim soon passed away.  Owings had asked for trouble. He insulted a woman of Anderson's household, so Anderson returned the favor by stabbing Owings when they met in the courtroom. To Anderson, defending his family's honor was paramount."," Dr. Hood thought that Owings would not die, so the local court did not charge Anderson with murder and merely requested that the violent assailant present himself for judgment at the court's next session. Anderson left town, however, upon hearing that Owings death had made him a murderer. In any case, such violence was typical of the South because of its honor culture and differentiated it from the rest of the United States according to Ed Ayers. It became vitally important to southerners to fight for their honor because this proved that they had honor to defend and deserved respectable social standing. Unfortunately, this promoted a cycle of violence because southerners constantly had to defend their honor. "," Women and slavery encouraged a cult of honor in the South in different ways. Women's moral standing directly affected their husbands' and sons' social status, so men felt compelled to defend their female relations' honor in order to avoid ridicule. Women also informally doled out social rank by judging families' honor, which men had to define through violence. With slavery, whites gained an elevated sense of superiority by degrading black people that they felt compelled to defend. As Ayers notes, It was slavery that allowed wealthy whites to consider themselves the heirs to the manners and pretensions of the English gentry. The idea of the English elite continued to feed a copycat honor culture defendable to the death in the South. In the nineteenth-century South, violence was not only a solution, but a status marker.

In reality, it could be a very harsh world to live in where the profits were not always as high as expected and tragedies often occurred. Caroline Merrick remembered a very early childhood that was fraught with such tragedy. At an early age on a plantation in Louisiana, her mother died and her calm and self-posessed father was left to care for six children and the plantation at the same time. It is no surprise then that he sought a mother for his children as well as a mistress for his plantation.","Women served vital purposes on plantations in the South. Although they were primary caregivers to the children, they also ran the domestic aspect of the farming operation. Women were responsible for the household slaves, supervised the everyday upkeep of the plantation buildings, and were in charge of the buying and the distribution of food and clothing. Although the lives of these mistresses and then women slaves of the plantation differed greatly, they often worked together in the house, preparing food and clothing for plantation residents. This type of interaction, according to some historians, led to the possibility of gender identification across racial boundar[ies]. Women as a whole were thought to be physically and mentally inferior to men and were shielded from the crassness of public life by confinement within the domestic sphere. Therefore the slave women...could appeal to their mistress' sense of shared female experience to soften the harshness of slavery.","Although young Caroline Merrick did not wish to accept the new lady in her life as mother there was a definite need for someone to fill the plantation mistress' role in the Merrick household. Without such help, her father was surely overwhelmed and endeavored to give his family a better life.

For the county seat, Staunton, state politics became local in the August of 1816, when a statewide convention was held in the town to, according to the Columbian of New York, amend or propose amendments to the [state] constitution. The delegates came specifically to debate questions of representation in the state legislation. As more settlers crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains to settle in the Shenandoah Valley, they agitated for more representation in the House of Delegates-still dominated by lowlanders from the Eastern tidewater region."," Representatives from twenty-four of the western counties and 12 of the eastern counties came to Staunton on August 19. By the end of the convention five days later, the convention had drafted a memorial to be presented to the General Assembly. Noting that despite having less than half of the total population, the 49 counties in the southern and eastern parts of the state had a majority in the legislature, the memorial exclaimed that in a republican government the will of the government should be the law of the land and yet in a state boasting of the pure republican institutions, this first and fundamental principle of republicanism does not exist. The memorial received support from a commission formed by the state government to hear the results of the convention, and a resolution was drafted to hold another convention to rewrite the Constitution.

Dick Howard in his article for the Virginia Law Review, 'For the Common Benefit': Constitutional History in Virginia as a Casebook for the Modern Constitution-maker sees the Augusta Convention of 1816 as a part of a larger sectional conflict between the eastern and western parts of the state. Waves of migration during the eighteenth century, into Shenandoah Valley counties like Augusta, and subsequent prosperity and population boom resulted in political tension between the two parts of the state. These stresses were further exacerbated by economic slumps in the east and a general unwillingness among Tidewater residents to relinquish the power they had held in state politics since the state's creation, as reflected in the appearance of only 12 eastern counties at the Convention.

The problem was that it was not very convenient. During romantic times, the 4'1 Jesse Johnson must have had trouble even kissing his lovely new bride Nancy who stood a modest 6'2. When there were difficulties in the relationship for the Montgomery County, Kentucky pair, Jesse must have hesitated to throw his weight around as he could only muster half of his wife's 150 pounds. In 1817, it also would have been disrespectful for the young groom to criticize his mate with her decade of additional wisdom."," Such a strange couple might have faced especially difficult persecution in the South. A man of Jesse's stature would have had to face questions of his virility and his ability to defend the family's honor, which would have limited the family's social rank. As family patriarchs, men in the South were expected to lead their families and dominate their enslaved people. Some white women even felt that they could not prevent their husbands from sexual misconduct with enslaved women because men's rights in the household could not be questioned. Men like Jesse who could not live up to this domineering image would have faced embarrassment along with their families. "," As a married woman, Nancy would have been expected to prioritize her husband and children's needs while weakening her ties to female social circles of family and friends. In the 1800s, according to Steven Stowe, women in the middle and upper classes were supposed to occupy a realm of personal beauty, domestic competence, and social influence that belonged to them alone. This doctrine of separate spheres served to anchor women in female networks which supported collective work and companionship. Southern women focused on their female roles as they grew up learning domestic skills and building strong relationships other women. "," Letters and visits from courting men signaled the beginning of the end of a woman's time in a largely female social world. Following one southern woman's courtship process through her letters, Stowe noted that the social pressures on her to marry all became condensed into a paradox: she was supposed to find everlasting bliss with a stranger. Leaving behind strong female relationships to join a man's household was difficult. "," Marriage meant major social adjustments in the South. Women's status in society would now be based on a husband who they were expected to focus on as their ties with old female friends weakened.

A remaining 82 was due to them later on account. Other slaves were also rented out. W. Russell paid out a sizable 70 for Pompey's labor, while Joseph Sharry doled out a mere 10 for Flora's services. Lewis's family later sold Flora for 400 and then spent 20 on cord and other items. Debits and credits. Debits and credits. Alongside wheat and shares of bank stock, his estate bought and sold people in the account books. Lewis's family let Sally keep her child and newborn baby when they sold the three for 17. The newborn baby brought in 5 alone. On the other hand, due to her poor eyesight, Caroline's buyer and seller considered her worth nothing more than the cost of her food and clothes. To the Lewis family, Caroline was an 'investment', and her disability meant that they would receive a poor return. "," Lewis's estate guardians knew they had to pay the bills and they chose to pay off expenses with people. In 1834 and 1835, his family was able to cover their debts by hiring out or selling enslaved people to others. Black families had to suffer for the white family to maintain its comfortable way of life. To soothe their patriarchal consciences, Lewis's family made a point in his accounts to note how they kept mothers and children together when they sold them. Lewis's story was not atypical. Upon his death, guardians had probably taken control of his estate and hired out or sold enslaved people to keep his dependents in comfort. The rising popularity of hiring out enslaved people signaled an economic shift in the South. As some basic industry entered into southern communities, it became more profitable to rent out a portion of the enslaved population to work in the primitive factories that sprouted up in the mixed agricultural economy rather than keeping them on the farms. Slave labor was cheaper than free labor, so it appealed to factory owners as well. "," Some of Lewis's enslaved people might also have been eventually sold further South from Virginia. With land better suited to produce for the booming cotton market than the tobacco-oriented Upper South, the Deep South's demand for forced labor increased even as its northern neighbors' supply of unnecessary labor rose. Deep South demand meeting Upper South supply ensured a forced southern migration of enslaved people. Sophisticated slave trading firms in big southern cities like Norfolk or Richmond used urban slave markets to oblige the economy by sending down enslaved black people from further North to New Orleans and elsewhere. Slave dealers sold the vast majority of enslaved people in direct bargaining processes with potential buyers in the slave pens. Rapid sales in massive public auctions did not occur as frequently.

They could not hide the fears which agitate our bosoms, and the dangers which await us, as revealed by recent tragical deeds. Apparently the women believed that the slaves, once emancipated, would have little incentive to revolt. Further, the women were ready to take on the lost labor themselves.

While emancipation was not granted, the Women were not alone. The Annals report that there were numerous other petitions from Augusta County as well."," Although contrary to the conventional view that slavery in the South was immutable, the women's' petition probably did not fall on deaf ears in the Virginia Legislature. Historian Scot French notes that the State Legislative session of 1831 and 1832 following Nat Turner's Rebellion, became a debate over the future of slavery, the specter of black insurgency, and the possibility of solving this problem through abolition and removal of African Americans from the state. French quotes James McDowell, from Augusta's neighboring county, Rockbridge, as commenting on the large number of black victims killed in a frenzied white response to the revolt: Was it the fear of Nat Turner and his deluded and drunken handful of followers which produced or could produce such effects? Was it this that induced distant counties where the very name of Southampton was strange to arm and equip for struggle? No, sir, it was the suspicion eternally attached to the slave himself, the suspicion that a Nat Turner might be in every family.

Though shutting up the house on a Thursday morning was an unusual step, she had felt indisposed recently and so they thought nothing of it. It was not until the middle of the day, when a serving woman came to ask about dinner, that they realized something was amiss. Nancy Gray was not asleep; she was found in a closet, propped up into a sitting position by the shotgun she had used to kill herself. At her side was a buggy whip, with which she was thought to have pulled the trigger. Her husband, Mr. William M. Gray, was understandably distraught, as he had left her that morning in a seemingly cheerful state and had gone to help a neighbor who was building a new home nearby. ","The Democrat referred to the death as a mysterious suicide because she was young, lovely, but recently married, surrounded by every comfort, and apparently happy. Their only qualification was that, at times she seemed somewhat depressed and their conclusion was that at the moment of the suicide she must have been rendered temporarily insane. ","Ideas about women's mental health were extremely undeveloped at this time, and depression usually went undiagnosed. If identified at all, it was blamed on a variety of factors including idleness, exhaustion, childbearing, not being able to bear children, over-mothering, and the female wardrobe of the 19th century, among others. Though appearing among all classes, middle- and upper- class women were the most vulnerable to depression, possibly due to the relatively few outlets available for the high amount of education they received. But new wives were expected to create a stable and loving home environment for their husbands, and if depression prohibited a woman from doing so, the sense of failure could be overwhelming.","This episode is also symptomatic of the well-established patriarchal male ideas about womanhood in the antebellum South. Women were put on a pedestal, idealized as pure and innocent creatures to be taken care of and carefully worshipped. The fact that this woman was married, pretty and had every material object she desired available to her should have rendered her perfectly happy, and thus crazy to have wanted to kill herself. In Virginia, the heart of the Old South, this paternalistic idea of womanhood was particularly prevalent. Women, however, played a much larger role than the stereotype of the pampered housewife suggests. Most women were not wealthy plantation mistresses, but poor women struggling to raise a family. They had as much work as men in household chores, raising children, often helping with farm work, and all the while expected to be pure, fertile, chaste, and well-mannered. ","There is evidence that women at times felt strangled by this rigid and prescribed role created for them. The isolated nature of much of the rural South in 1856, limited a woman's access to other women, which prevented the creation of an alternative support system. Therefore, most women turned only to their husbands and children as their primary caring relationships. These relationships enforced already close ties to the home. The rise of companionate marriages in the South also helped create a system in which women held more responsibility for creating the ideal happy southern home, and more blame if they could not. Because the husband's sphere was considered to be outside the home, the task of providing a warm, welcoming family environment fell mostly upon the wife and mother in the household. There was little room for depression or mental illness in this idyllic world view and, as divorce was extremely rare and difficult to obtain (requiring a private act of the state congress) suicide could become a last resort.

Upon receiving news of the 1832 Nullification Crisis, Laura wrote to her cousin Camille explaining her opinions on the state of the Union. Smith held steadfastly to her belief in South Carolina's states rights. Although the prospect of war saddened her because her father and brothers would have to fight, she believed that it was important for South Carolina to preserve its liberty instead of conceding to the Union. South Carolina was discussing war and succession far before states like Virginia.","The Nullification Crisis was not the first time that the slavery/anti-slavery debate had threatened American political stability. In signing the Tariff Act of 1832, President Andrew Jackson pushed a previous tariff struggle that had been brewing between South Carolina and the federal government to a climax. Tariffs previously established in 1828 had been deemed by South Carolinians unconstitutional because they taxed imported goods, which were popular in the states, more heavily than those made in the North. In the view of many South Carolina planters, the North was being favored by this tariff, and the economic problems of the Carolina rice culture were being ignored. In addition, they saw themselves as unnecessarily persecuted because South Carolina was a slave state. Jackson signed a new Tariff Act in 1832 that lowered the tax somewhat; however, South Carolinians had hoped he would do away with the law all together. In November 1832, the South Carolina assembly came together in a special session to declare the tariffs null and void in South Carolina. It became a struggle of states rights versus federal rights, now known as the Nullification Crisis. ","Letters like Smith's of January 1833 also show that Southern women before the Civil War were required to be involved enough in political affairs to be able to support their husband's or father's political opinions. Their opinions were usually congruent with that of the male members of the families. Sally G. McMillen confirms that women were expected to have the same views as the men in their families in her article Women in the Old South. Interestingly, in Harry L. Watson's long description of the Nullification Crisis in his book Liberty and Power, he does not even allude to women being involved in the political front at all, because, quite frankly, they were not. Although women could discuss politics and support the opinions of their families' males, they did not have a say in politics and were not allowed to vote, showing that women were expected to fulfill the traditional female role of family caregiver. Laura addressed her father and brother in the beginning of the letter; they were absent from the home, and she wished for their return, showing how much she cared for them.

Up to this point in 1865, she had been enjoying the life of a socialite in Washington, DC, while Mr. Clay had taken on the role of Senator for the Confederacy. President Johnson had Clay arrested, alongside Jefferson Davis for allegedly conspiring in the assassination of former President Lincoln. He wrote from jail to his wife, stating, I am more confirmed by my reflections and our bitter experience that the Northern people were so hostile to the rights, interests and institutions of the Southern States, that it was just and proper for these to seek peace and security in a separate government. In response, Mrs. Clay made several attempts to visit with the President, urging him to release her husband. She seemed to share her husband's negative feelings for the Union, speaking highly of their being Southern as a means for Clay's defense. Mr. Clay was not released from jail until 1866, and he was later pardoned by Congress in 1880. Whether or not Clay was in any way involved in the plot for Lincoln's assassination is unknown. However, he proved to be a staunch Southerner who held a bitter grudge towards the North, much like much of the rest of the South by this point in time. As early as the 1830s, the South was developing an attitude that embraced sectionalism. As time went on, Southerners began more and more to see themselves as a world apart from the rest of the nation and as having their own separate interests. Both Clay and Mrs. Clay's anger towards the North and those involved in his arrest are revealing of the major division that had come to be between the North and South."],"display_date":"May 22, 1865 - April 17, 1866","search_date":"1865-11-03","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3567,"title":"An Appeal for an Organization Benefiting Freedmen\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-09-01","end_date":"1862-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It was the summer of 1862 and Elizabeth Keckley, a former slave, was walking down the streets of Washington, DC. She stopped when she came across a big festival with music and white women and men dancing together. Upon inquiry, she learned that the festival was a fundraiser for the sick and wounded white soldiers. Immediately, she contemplated the need for an organization that supported the black freedmen that were constantly entering the city. Within two weeks, Keckley had won the support of her church in forming the Contraband Relief Association. Keckley was also employed by Mrs. Abraham Lincoln, with whom she traveled to many cities and gained more support for the Association. Mrs. Lincoln and the President also made contributions to help finance the Association, and its success eventually led to Keckley serving as its President in 1863.","Elizabeth Keckley's initiative to create an organization that provided aid for and served the African American community would become very characteristic of African American leaders within the years to come. The exclusion of African Americans from city outreach programs and fundraising organizations run by white leaders continued throughout and after the Civil War.

The No. 2 train on the C&O line from Cincinnati had cars derail after losing air power to the brakes. The train picked up even more speed because there is a descent into the Staunton station. Along with the increased speed, the engineer had to maneuver the train along the curves of the rail. The engineer managed to prevent the whole train from jumping track and saved many lives. The derailed sleeper car caused the most damage by destroying the 6-inch iron columns lining the platform. As this was a night train, there were many people sleeping in this car and they suffered the most injuries. The wreck caused the death of a young girl of the Pearl of Pekin Company, a Dramatic Corps. Her body, on which there was the silver cross of the King's Daughters Organization, was taken to a local funeral home and prepared for the journey to Jackson County, Missouri. The other townspeople took the injured to two residences and the Virginia Hotel. "," This article was not the front-page headline of the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>of Augusta County. Instead, it ran as the longest column under the headline A Night Horror on the second page with mostly local events. Oddly, the news writer did not comment about the lack of a hospital. A group of local women, the King's Daughters Organization, did note this absence and started a campaign to build the first hospital in Staunton. "," This one train wreck illumines so many new themes of life in the 1890's. There is the strong danger of railroads. From 1890 to 1900, there were over 6,000 accidents involving mail-carrying trains and the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>listed train accidents and wrecks frequently. Alfred D. Chandler has explained how railroads drastically changed life in the United States. Small Staunton connected to greater America and her almost 200,000 miles of operating line in a way that horses and boats never could have. These railroad connections created opportunities for the citizens. The trains delivered mail demonstrably faster and more efficiently, and kept people who moved (increasingly because of trains) connected. There were new economic opportunities for builders, operators, and those who wanted to sell products to other cities. The grain of Staunton had a new market that enabled farmers to produce and sell more than ever. Railroads also represented the possibility of mobility. People could travel and see cities the average person twenty years before never would have and people could simply travel quicker. The girl who died originally had been a telegraph operator, another important development of the nineteenth century. The young girl imagined a greater life for herself and railroads provided the means of pursuit. She left a steady job in the Midwest and moved to New York City to become a star, as so many people continue to do so today. This one newspaper article intimated to its readers that Staunton was not just a dot on the map.

Ever since the blood of American soldiers had been shed in Texas, the call of patriotism compelled many Americans towards war.  In Edgecombe, patriotic banners and speeches had been prepared for the men who would soon be off for Mexico.  Present at the ceremony was a renowned Senator of North Carolina, Captain Louis D. Wilson.  In the name of his country, Wilson had left his Congressional duties to lead a group of Edgecombe volunteers into Mexico.  Sarah E. Howard addressed Wilson and his men on behalf of the women of Edgecombe:","Appreciating the heroism which has impelled you at the call of your country to rush to her standard... we have wrought with our hands a banner for the volunteers...  Whilst the weakness of our sex forbids us to encounter the fatigues and privations of war, it has always been deemed appropriate that women should cheer on the soldier to the field.  In this we but emulate the example of the maidens and matrons of the Revolution, that Revolution which established those political liberties and conferred those social benefits, to secure which you have volunteered.  Your fathers waged war against the haughty Britons...  You are now engaged in a contest with the perfidious Mexicans, and the flag of '76 is the flag of '46... You have enlisted under that proud banner which has been consecrated to the cause of human liberty - the glorious stars and stripes of your country - it is the precious emblem of our noble confederacy of free and independent states... Go; our hearts are with you.","Women's activism was proscribed in the arenas of war and politics.  It was not their place.  Howard's speech accepts the role of women as secondary to the masculine political issues.  Even at such a powerful event, the contributions of women were still gendered.  Like the women three generations earlier, the female patriots of Edgecombe County could only craft banners and cheers in support of the soldiers.  The references to the maidens of the Revolutionary War and the community of Edgecombe are significant because these geographical and historical communities were what bound women in their place in the South.  As Jean E. Friedman notes in <em>The Enclosed Garden</em>, Southern women maintained their kinship networks during times of war, and these communities inhibited women from developing independent women's associations.  In Edgecombe, the meaningful communities for women were social, national and geographical, not organizations of gender."],"display_date":"January 18, 1846","search_date":"1846-01-18","locations":[{"id":9431,"lat":35.868028512,"lng":-77.6521883059,"zoom":9,"place":"EDGECOMBE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3589,"title":"The Real Horrors of the Trail\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-01","end_date":"1842-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The River  of Lies was a body of water that some Seminoles lived near when the soldiers came to gather the Indians for removal. The river is located near today's Jupiter, Florida and acquired its name from an assumed thought that the fighting was over between the Indians and white settlers.","Soldiers came, gathered, and removed the Indians from their homes by the river. Some Indians escaped the soldiers' clutches and ran to warn the others. After being rounded up and made to walk toward the west, the Indians were put on boats headed in the same direction. After traveling on the boats, the Indians had to walk again. It was during the walk along the Trail of Tears that the Indians knew the treaties for removal were never to be just or fair like President Jackson claimed they would be. Along the trail, many would die from lack of nourishment, dehydration, and diseases, but those were not the true horrors on the trail.","Betty Mae's great-great-grandmother, Mary Tustenuggee Tiger a Seminole from the Snake Clan, told her the true horrors of the trail. Mary and her three daughters were four of the captives at the River of Lies. Mary and her eldest daughter were raped and used for the soldiers' pleasure along the arduous journey west. The eldest daughter was raped so much that she could barely walk, and her mom had to carry her. Other young women were raped on the trail as well. The soldiers had no remorse for their actions. They were like wild beasts who laughed and kicked the Indian women around while raping them and joked about it in front of others.","Innocent lives were taken by soldiers as well. Mary recalled to Betty Mae how they were driven like cows on the trail. Mary told Betty that when older people got sick or too tired to walk, they would fall and be whipped until they got up. If they did not get up and continue walking, the soldiers would shoot them. Mary even described how soldiers would throw babies in to a creek or pond to drown or hit them against a tree if the babies cried too much from hunger. Everyone was in danger of dying because a soldier would kill them for not complying with orders or wanting to rest. They were not able to ride in the wagons, not even the most elderly or sick; resting did not exist on the trail.","The stories that Betty Mae retold in her diary from Mary's story are truly nightmares. Most people think that malnutrition, dehydration, and fatigue were the worst conditions on the trail, but those conditions were nothing compared to the rapes and murders that took place. Betty Mae wanted to help her great-great grandmother tell her story so that the whole truth could be revealed about the Trail of Tears. In addition, the story symbolized how those who survived these harsh conditions not only triumphed against the brutality of the government, but also kept their clans and clan's culture and history alive.

Miss Baldwin reported that the school enrollment was at capacity and there was even a wait-list. There were many delicate pupils whose parents sent them to Staunton because of the healthful climate and atmosphere. The school's students hailed from 23 states. Miss Baldwin even noted that there were no deaths that year. She also believed that the school had succeeded in teaching the pupils practical skills for life and a deeper sense of their personal responsibility to God. The school gave awards for many different subjects, including Latin, French, German, Faithful Practice on Piano, and English composition. Seven young women received diplomas for Music and Book-keeping."," <em>The Staunton Spectator</em>, the Augusta County weekly newspaper, ran the article as the lead local article. The paper reported the programme for each day's celebration and all participants' names. For the concert section, the names were given in a standard formal formula of Misses M Bingham, C Woodard, A Wine.... For the awards section, there was a less formal tone. The professors and instructors had titles, but the paper did not list the young women's names with Miss and some were in their common form, such as Annie instead of Anne and Lizzie instead of Elizabeth. "," Some young women attended Augusta Female Seminary for health reasons, but there were women attending because they had families who believed Catharine Beecher's principle that women needed a practical education to be successful mothers and wives and, eventually, she believed, have a profession. For the expanding middle class created by industrialization and urbanization in America, there began a trend to send young women to schools because the importance of women's work grew. According to Janet James, the question of to what extent women should be educated was entertained by everyone and in magazines, novels, plays and books. Three young women received diplomas in Music, but four young women received diplomas in Book-keeping, an economically and domestically practical education. Baldwin had been a pupil at the school and her tenure as principal led to the name change to Mary Baldwin College, also reflecting the more public role of women as leaders in education in the second half of the nineteenth century and fulfilling Beecher's desire.

That much was certain as they traveled to Washington D.C. from their rural home with Margaret's sister on Christmas Eve, 1877. What wasn't quite so certain was where in the city they could go to hold the ceremony. When they came upon a group of reporters waiting outside City Hall they anxiously asked how, where, and how fast they could be wed. Luckily, the reporters were just the people to ask.  ","Some of the reporters got them through the door of City Hall and to the Marshal's apartment, while others joined forces with some bailiffs to locate a marriage license and someone to officiate the ceremony. It took hardly any time at all before the two were wed in the Criminal Courtroom by none other then Reverend Byron Sunderland himself, who had come running to perform the marriage. This was the very first marriage in the Criminal Courtroom, which was usually the site of proceedings of a very different nature. That a marriage between two black youths could occur in an unconventional location with the help of all kinds of residents of the city of Washington was symbolic of the progress that the nation was trying to make toward equality for all men. ","However, this example of a spur-of-the-moment public wedding between two young, black individuals is more of an anomaly concerning how the idea of citizenship for freed black Americans actually materialized in real life. As David Herbert Donald points out, despite the fact that racial equality had largely been legislated by the 1870s, not everyone was as accommodating as the folks in Washington were that day.  In many parts of the South, there was no one to enforce the kind of treatment the law demanded. Washington D.C. stands out, at least in this example, as a more progressive part of the South, more in touch with the ideals for which the nation's legislators were striving. The Republicans who were in office had passed many laws requiring equal treatment in public spaces for black and white alike; in the case of this marriage in the courtroom, this idea was taken a step further, and the reporters were thrilled to be catching the first marriage in a criminal court room, a marriage of two black people no less. The significance and symbolism of this event is supported by the appearance of Rev. Byron Sunderland, a prominent black clergyman who had advised President Lincoln in the struggle for the emancipation of American slaves."],"display_date":"December 24, 1877","search_date":"1877-12-24","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3601,"title":"Frederick Douglass Addresses the New American Party\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-02-20","end_date":"1884-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The American Prohibition Convention of 1884 was held in Lincoln Hall and kicked off on the evening of February 20th.  Several prominent politicians, bureaucrats, religious leaders and thought leaders of the time were present to help usher the American Party into the upcoming election season. Mr. E.D. Bailey, who had just been appointed to the committee responsible for nominating a President and Vice President of the United States, spoke first and set the tone for the evening by highlighting a few key themes of critical importance to the American Party:  the party's firm foundation in Jesus Christ's vision of Democracy, the growing need for temperance and prohibition, the threat of Freemasonry on the nation, and the highly objectionable way in which Republicans seemed to appeal to the black community simply to win votes before elections.  ","With the mood perfectly set for his address, Mr. Frederick Douglass took the stage to present his speech on civil rights. We have got rid of slavery. It is gone, gone, gone, never to return. But its long black shadow stretches across our entire continent...You ask sometimes when this negro question will cease...It will cease when we have one country, one citizenship, one liberty, one equality for all people...  He then spoke to the issue of colonization, heatedly denouncing it as a unthinkable solution to the problem of racial inequality. He asserted that black people wanted to take part in the freedom and progress that was so unique to the United States, a nation that they were as much a part of as white men. In fact, he elaborated humorously, many whites and blacks may be closer in relation than they might think given the history of interracial relationships in America He even indicated to his largely male audience that, in general, men could learn something from the more compassionate and respectful attitudes of women, who he had known to show the kind of sensitivity and care necessary to bridging the gaps between the white and black races. Every last one of his words was met with applause, laughter, admission, understanding, and approbation by all those in the hall, white and black alike. ","Retrospectively, this speech which occurred in 1884 came at a hugely significant time in the history of race relations in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States had ruled the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to be unconstitutional less than six months before it was presented at the convention of the American Party. By 1885, as historian Valeria W. Weaver explains, the 'Jim Crow' South was really taking shape, severely impeding if not stopping in its tracks, the push toward the equality between whites and blacks that was the foundation of Douglass' mission."],"display_date":"February 20, 1884","search_date":"1884-02-20","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3607,"title":"Spring of 1888 in the Diary of Miss Jennie Barker\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-03-31","end_date":"1888-03-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Miss Jennie Barker made note of each day of her life in the year 1888 by writing inside a diary given to her as a gift by her cousins on New Year's Day of that year. On March 31st, Jennie wrote, she and her friend Clara took a trip to the market in Washington, D.C. where they lived.  After marveling at the flowers and other wares, they decided to attend a nearby women's rights meeting. Jennie was not very impressed, despite being entertained by the goings on. She couldn't understand how women's lives and the state of things would be improved if women were given the right to vote. Not really very bothered, she and Clara finished their day with a trip to the dentist and dinner with family and friends.  ","Despite her nonchalance about the idea of women's suffrage, as viewed in this moment in her life, Jennie was an extremely self-empowered young woman. Her dedication to living a life full of education, religion, and social activities and events of all kinds is evident throughout her diary. As an upper-middle class young woman in Washington D.C., Jennie made a point to stay current on fashion, read novels such as '<em>Silas Marner'</em> or '<em>The Last of the Mohicans</em>' regularly, study and teach lessons for Sunday School, attend church and Christian Legion meetings, and do her domestic duties all at the same time.         ","Jennie's disinterest in the women's suffrage movement may then seem peculiar. However, Jennie was a Southerner, and the South was emerging from the Reconstruction Era in 1888. As the historian Louise M. Young explains, there was bitter resentment engendered in the South by the Reconstruction policies: a resentment that hardened into an emotional block against enfranchising women that was never resolved. Jennie enjoyed her life tremendously, from what she wrote in her diary, and enfranchisement wasn't going to add anything to her life that she felt she needed. In fact, the South felt that all the effort that had put forth in enfranchising black Americans during Reconstruction had created far more harm than good. Jennie was not alone in her ambivalence toward suffrage; many Southerners, in fact, <em>actively</em> targeted the suffragist groups for stirring up more controversy in a nation that was still recovering from the last."],"display_date":"March 31, 1888","search_date":"1888-03-31","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3611,"title":"Snuff Dipping and Mint Juleps\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-07-13","end_date":"1838-07-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Women must be ladies first, opined The Raleigh Register.  In the event of tea this afternoon, there was a young woman partaking in activities that had attained epidemic proportions in the Raleigh city area: which is the disgusting, and vulgar act of snuff dipping.  An activity that had previously been specific to males in the community, appeared to have caught on with women once thought of as respectable ladies. This material was injurious and dangerous for women to even be experimenting with because from the words of professionals in the medical field and those of authority women were often made absolutely drunk by the substance.","Ladies were using the snuff with casual attitudes and little regard for their health and images in the public eye.  This was an utter injustice to their beauty and civility, which would not help them in attracting pursuers in the least.  Men expected women to be fragile creations, who changed the wilderness of earth into a garden and brought civility and manners to the household.  A significant problem with women allowing themselves to become addicted to such disturbing drugs was their probability of taking other intoxicants like loathsome Mint Juleps that would soon follow.  It was common knowledge that constant use of any powerful stimulant will be seen to create a desire for other and stronger stimulants.  The practice of snuffing was one that belonged to men because it was far too unbecoming and dangerous for naive women.  Women sought chivalrous treatment and privilege from the gentlemen of society, but it was appalling for them to behave as barbarians, and no man of distinguished stature would be tolerant of such nonsense. ","Womanhood in the Old South entailed the idea of women presenting themselves as good wives with domestic and common sense, in order to be pleasing both physically and in their mannerisms to potential suitors.  For women to participate in vulgar and unattractive activities refutes historian Mark Smith's description of the ingrained nature of Southern females to express a certain amount of piety and conservative lifestyles, and he claims that Southern men often found their unappealing behaviors sinful with implications of their lack of faith or respect for God.  These were considered pioneering times in the socialization of women.  They were encouraged to conform to the male dominant ideology, and live as servants to male opinions. The divisions between the most simplistic social activities that were deemed acceptable in roles for males versus females became larger issues because women were dependent on either fathers or husbands for financial stability thus forcing them to behave under strict male standards of behavior."],"display_date":"July 13, 1838","search_date":"1838-07-13","locations":[{"id":9841,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3638,"title":"A Plot is Uncovered\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-01-29","end_date":"1820-01-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 29, 1820, M. W. deBree wrote a letter to her father to tell him some distressing news. Her letter detailed a very melancholy circumstance that very nearly occurred on a ship bound from Norfolk, Virginia to New Orleans, Louisiana. Thirty slaves who were passengers on the ship had form'd a plot...to murder all the passengers and crew except two sailors who [were] to steer them to St. Domingo. Luckily, one of the slaves leaked the information to the servant of one of the passengers who informed her master of the plot. To take precautions against the possible uprising, the slaves were put in irons for the remainder of the voyage. This story must have had an alarming effect on Ms. deBree, since her letter contains nothing really other than its recounting."," Why would this incident cause Ms. deBree to be so alarmed? Denmark Vessy's slave insurrection plot in Charleston, South Carolina would not be uncovered for another two years. Furthermore, Nat Turner's rebellion was nearly eleven years later. However, the fact remained that white Southerners lived in fear of a slave rebellion as long as slavery existed. The brutality of an institution like slavery would certainly only breed a rebellion just as brutal. This was the white Southern nightmare. To Ms. deBree, this story was a close call, a near realization of the nightmare. "," An interesting point drawn from the letter was the slaves' intention to sail to St. Domingo following a successful takeover of the vessel. St. Domingo, or modern day Haiti, was a sort of utopia in the minds of American slaves. In 1804, a violent slave revolt in the small Caribbean country had resulted in the creation of an independent black nation. To white Americans, the successful slave revolt in St. Domingo represented the realization of the nightmare and the example of what may happen if slaveholders refused to remain diligent."],"display_date":"January 29, 1820","search_date":"1820-01-29","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3641,"title":"The Female Orphan Society of Norfolk, Virginia Receives a Generous Donation","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-01-01","end_date":"1817-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Eighteen Sixteen was an eventful year for the Female Orphan Society of Norfolk, Virginia. The number of girls under the care of the Society was increased to twenty and a smallpox scare in the city required a visit from Society Physician Dr. Alex Whitehead for a round of vaccinations for all the girls. However, certainly the biggest event of the year happened in July when the Society received a letter from a generous citizen of the city. The letter was from the Executor of the will of Captain John Maxwell informing the Society that 2,500 had been bequeathed to them for the purpose of establishing an Asylum for Female Orphans. Additionally, Captain Maxwell's Executor had already purchased a lot on Brigg's Point for the new structure."," The 1816 annual report of the Female Orphan Society shows their elation at receiving such a large donation. The report states that they would desire... to proclaim our gratitude to our deceased benefactor & to God, the inspirer of all good, for this generous gift which promises to perpetuate our institution as a lasting honor & blessing to the community. Their happiness is well understood when one considers the average yearly earnings of a small-time farmer during the era was well under one thousand dollars. Simply put, 2,500 was a lot of money."," The Female Orphan Society was not a fledgling organization. It was founded in 1804 by Norfolk women in order to provide a temporary home, education and training for indigent white girls, orphans or otherwise. In order to stay afloat, the organization relied on the generosity of private individuals, churches, relief agencies, and finally clubs or other organizations to provide food, clothing, education for the wards, and wages for Society employees. The fact that after twelve years the organization had not yet acquired their own building shows the difficulty of financing a charitable organization such as the Society. In fact, at the time the Society received the donation, they were just deciding that they had sufficient funds to attempt to look for a lot for the construction of their own building. Such a large donation allowed the Society to build a larger building than perhaps they had hoped, enabling them to expand the breadth of their charitable work. Orphan Societies such as the Female Orphan Society of Norfolk factored greatly in the lives of America's poor children from the early nineteenth century until the 1920s. The Society of Norfolk was typical of these early institutions in that it was established to help female children and dealt mostly with children who had one or more parents living. These institutions served to help a family through tough times by providing for a child until the parent was able to do so themselves. The Norfolk Society was also indicative of Orphan Societies at the beginning of the nineteenth century in that it was entirely funded by private donations and managed by specific religious organizations. "," Orphan Societies began to be established in response to changes in the United States as a whole. During the early nineteenth century, American cities experienced massive growth due to European immigration. Cities grew by leaps and bounds and the population of urban poor grew with them. Additionally, the growth of wage labor often left many of these poor families unable to care for their children after a tragedy like the loss of a parent. Finally, improved transportation facilitated the easier spread of diseases like cholera, which led to a spike in the establishment of orphanages after an epidemic in the 1830s. By the Civil War, Orphan Societies had become very common across the United States and were thought of as being the best way to manage the upbringing and education of poor children outside of their own homes."],"display_date":"January 1, 1816 - January 1, 1817","search_date":"1816-07-02","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3647,"title":"The Portsmouth Fire of 1821\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-03-21","end_date":"1821-03-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At around 2:45 a.m. on the morning of Wed., March 21, 1821, a fire broke out in the kitchen of a vacant tenement on the corner of Main and Market Streets in Portsmouth, Virginia. The <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> of Friday, March 23 reported that owing to the violence of the wind, which was blowing at the time a perfect gale from S. S. W., and the combustible nature of the buildings, the fire spread with uncontrollable rapidity to the market house and adjacent houses. After the fire had burned out, it was discovered that 30 to 40 homes and tenements had been totally destroyed by the blaze. This loss constituted a large portion of the small city."," Louisa Emmerson, a resident of Portsmouth at the time, included in her memoirs a description of the destruction. She wrote that most of the east side of Crawford Street was destroyed as well as portions of Queen and Water Streets. Ms. Emmerson surmised that the reason the west side of Crawford Street was spared was due to its width of one hundred feet, while the flames were able to leap across narrower streets such as Queen which had a width of only thirty feet. In addition to the destroyed buildings mentioned in the Herald, Ms. Emmerson wrote that the fire was also able to destroy three ships moored at the Portsmouth docks."," Both Emmerson and the Herald lauded the performance of the Norfolk fire companies and the U.S. Navy fire company for their quick response to the scene of the inferno. The timely response of the firefighters served to check the extension of the inferno and prevented the fire from spreading to the opposite sides of Market and Main Streets, thus saving the citizens of the city from any further damage. Finally, the Herald article speculated that the fire may have been the work of an arsonist, considering that the building in which it originated was uninhabited and the fact that only a few days prior an attempt had been made by some dark-plotting villain to fire the town in another direction by means of a bundle of matches and other combustibles wrapped around an iron spike the sharp point of which was driven into the weather-boarding of a small frame house-the fire was just communicating to the shingles of the roof when it was providentially discovered and extinguished."," In the days before electricity and oil or gas heat, fire was a constant household danger. A soot-filled chimney was a dangerous fire hazard, not to mention the open flames of oil lamps and candles. Additionally, all houses of the time were often built almost completely out of wood or with wooden interiors and brick outer shells. Quite simply, a person's house was a veritable tinderbox waiting to be consumed in a raging inferno. Not surprisingly, newspapers of the day, like the <em>Herald</em>, contained advertisements for so-called fire-proof brick dwellings, like the two-story Fire-proof brick tenement listed for sale in the November 10, 1819 edition. However fire-proof buildings were not the only fire-related advancements in the early nineteenth century. The fire insurance industry also sprang up in the wake of the rapid urbanization and industrialization that characterized the period."," It is interesting to note the influence that fire companies had in controlling the Portsmouth blaze and preventing its further spread. Like the population and economy of the United States, the number of municipal fire departments grew in the early nineteenth century. With the addition of new technologies and better equipment, these fire companies began to increase the effectiveness with which they fought fires. Inventors began to make careers out of designing all sorts of fire equipment from hoses, ladders, and clothing to pumps and engines that could propel water distances of 180 feet. The early nineteenth century also saw the birth of a nationwide fire department tradition that has been maintained to this day: the fireman's parade. A parade was a way for the citizens to honor the fire departments who had done so much for their community as well as a way for the department to show off their equipment and manpower. In an era where structure fires had the potential to level entire cities, a good fire company was invaluable to the community."],"display_date":"March 21, 1821","search_date":"1821-03-21","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3648,"title":"Settling the Debts of Robert Riddick\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-12-13","end_date":"1827-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 13, 1819, Joseph Prentis took over as the Executor of the will of the late Robert M. Riddick of Nansemond County due to the death of the named executor, Thomas Swepson. Mr. Riddick's will called for the disposal of his estate for the payment of his debts. However, Riddick stipulated that in order to raise the deficiency [the Executor was] fully authorized and requested to mortgage the lands and to hire out the slaves for the purpose. For the next eight years, Mr. Prentis hired out Riddick's slaves to neighboring farmers in order to pay off the debts of the deceased. At the time of his death, Robert Riddick owned eighteen slaves. This number, while not huge, was quite substantial and suggested a sizable agricultural operation. Although, when one looks at Mr. Prentis' description of the slaves and the value he placed on each, one can see that perhaps the number alone can be a bit misleading. ","Of the eighteen slaves Mr. Prentis listed in his account book on December 31, 1819, only six were adult males. Furthermore, of those six only two were considered valued over 300 and one of those, Tom Bray valued at 350, was well past his prime at forty-eight years of age. However, Armistead was valued at 500 because he was only eighteen years of age and presumably had a whole lifetime of labor in front of him. The only other male slave close to the value of Tom Bray and Armistead was a man named Jacob, described by Prentis as a small and weakly fellow forty two years old. The other three men were worthless or close to it. Dempsey, valued at 100, was approaching at fifty-five years old. The remaining two, Mingo and Jimmy, both were appraised at 0. Mingo was around seventy years old and very diseased having lost one eye and nearly blind in the other while Jimmy was about sixty years of age and listed as very decrepit. The twelve other slaves that constituted Robert Riddick's property were all adult females and their small children. Of these there were three adult women appraised at 300 or higher. These three were all between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-nine years old, prime childbearing ages."," Further reading into the account book of Mr. Prentis reveals that he was able to hire out Mr. Riddick's slaves to pay off the late man's debts, as directed in the will. Naturally, the amount received for each slave hired out makes sense when compared to their values listed earlier. In the year 1820, old Jimmy was hired out for only five dollars. The small and weak Jacob fetched 32.50 while fifty-five year-old Dempsey earned thirty dollars. Although much younger than Tom Bray, Armistead was hired out for 34 while Tom was hired for 55. Though one cannot be sure, this was probably due to the fact that the older Tom had some skill that was in demand by his temporary master."," The story of Robert Riddick, his slaves, and the posthumous management of his estate was a common one in the slave-holding South. Southern slaveholders, while wealthy in land and human property, did not have a lot of capital at their disposal and frequently purchased on credit which often plunged them into debt. The death of a slaveholder required that those debts be settled, and often that was accomplished through the hiring out of slaves to raise the money necessary to pay the creditors. This process was time-consuming but it allowed the late slaveholder's family to retain ownership of the slaves that a quick settlement of the estate (i.e. the auction of the slaves) would not accomplish. The amount of time it took to pay off the debts of a deceased slaveholder through the hiring of his slave property could vary greatly depending upon the size of his debts and the sex, age, and physical condition of his slaves. For example, the job of settling Riddick's debts may have taken less time if half of his slaves had been young, healthy males like Armistead. Richard Randolph a Prince Edward County slaveholder discussed in Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, owned a great number of slaves that were to be manumitted upon his death. However, his wife kept them in bondage for a further ten years until the debts could be settled. The fact that slaveholders were willing to wait years to pay off debts through slave-hiring speaks to the value of slave property in the antebellum South. Southerners would rather wait than loose their property forever in a quick sale."],"display_date":"December 13, 1819 - December 31, 1827","search_date":"1823-12-22","locations":[{"id":14070,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3649,"title":"A Shocking Scene\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-08-12","end_date":"1820-08-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The passengers of the steamship <em>Virginia</em> witnessed a shocking scene on the afternoon of August 12, 1820. In fact, the scene was so unnerving and immoral that one passenger decided to write a letter to the <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> to express his disgust. The episode began when the steamship happened upon a small boat while traveling up the river near Fort Norfolk. Hearing cries in the wind, the passengers spotted a small boat with a sail set, and a little boy, apparently not more than nine years old, holding the sheet and managing the helm as well he could. When the steamship motored closer to the sailboat, it could be seen that besides the child at the helm, there were two grown persons inside, both apparently lifeless. The one a negro man, laying across one of the seats forward, the other a white person further aft, concealed from view by the sail except one leg which was entirely bare and hanging over the gunwale. Quickly a rescue boat was sent out by the Virginia to find that the two people were not dead but stone drunk, and the person lying with one exposed leg hanging over the side was in fact the white mother of the little boy. The two adults had ingested a bit too much alcohol and had simply passed out in the boat, the black man having given the young boy the helm. There was no real problem until the boat got out into the middle of the river where the wind picked up and the vessel became too much for the little boy to handle. Luckily the Virginia happened to be passing by just in time to save the passengers of the sailboat from a watery grave."," The person who wrote the letter to the Herald describing the event, signed only as 'Q. Z.', expressed his disgust at the scene, saying that it was not proper for a man to be so thoroughly intoxicated. However, the thought of the woman drunk and laid out in so lewd a position was loathsome and shocking. The writer of the letter continued on to comment upon the horrible vice of drunkenness which caused the woman to put not only her life in danger, but also that of her young innocent son."," Though the letter can be read as scathing indictment of the consumption of alcohol, the antebellum South certainly did not have a substantial temperance movement. On the contrary, the temperance movement in the South prior to the Civil War was rather weak, perhaps because of its Northern counterpart's links with abolitionism. Furthermore, as this episode helps illustrate, drinking and drunkenness was not confined only to white males, although they did drink more frequently than did slaves or white females. While Mr. or Mrs. 'Q. Z.' may very well have advocated for the prohibition of alcohol, he or she was certainly not representative of the population at large and probably spoke out due to strong personal religious convictions."," Adding to the shocking nature of the scene of drunkenness was the fact that the white woman was in the company of a black man while splayed out in an indecent position. Interracial activities between white and black men in the antebellum South were often frowned upon, but such relations between black men and white women were outright condemned. The United States at the time was an extremely racist nation and blacks were thought of as being not only inferior to whites but actually subhuman. Additionally, white women were seen as venerable to the perceived hyper-sexuality of black males and were to be protected from their advances at all times. The fact that the white woman in the boat had exposed private parts of her body to the black man, or perhaps even the possibility that she may have been in a sexual relationship with the man crossed the bounds of decency in antebellum America. Q. Z. and the rest of the passengers of the Virginia certainly had ample reason to be alarmed."],"display_date":"August 12, 1820","search_date":"1820-08-12","locations":[{"id":14404,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3658,"title":"Deadbeat Renter\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-12-14","end_date":"1836-11-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For over two years, Elizabeth Rainey patiently awaited payment from John Tucker, who was renting her Brunswick County, Virginia plantation.

In one of her correspondences to Tucker, Rainey wrote that her eldest son, who at the age of twenty-two and was then the rightful owner of the plantation that Tucker was leasing, had returned from fighting the Indians and, if he wished, he could pursue dealing with him to arrange rent payment. Apparently, Tucker did not respond favorably, because a later letter from Ms. Rainey, requests that he send full payment for his delinquent rent in two checks, one made out to her and the other made out to her eldest son, William. ","In the nineteenth century, women were seldom left in charge of such large financial obligations such as the rent of a plantation and slaves.

Though Ms. Rainey's son, William, was the heir of the property which Tucker was renting, his absence while at war against the Native Americans left his mother in charge of all financial obligations. This was indeed a rare instance because during this period white women did not own property. It was even more extraordinary that Ms. Rainey was left in charge of renting this property out, along with all of the financial implications of being a landlord.

While 38 churches in attendance wanted to sustain denominational schools already in place, Reverend N. Baldwin, representing Abingdon, Virginia had a different suggestion. Baldwin's address began by accusing Europeans of being destroyers of Christian values. He argued that the European population and the laziness of southern gentlemen had transformed the South into a land of anti-Christian and anti-republican values. He argued that the only source of protection against the destruction of values and morality is a sound Christian education. Baldwin suggested that the association plant a school house and church on every hill and in every valley. ","According to Baldwin, not only education, but the education of women in particular was important. He said, Educate the mothers, train them up to their mission, and their sons will become intelligent and virtuous. He noted that there were 962,878 free white persons, who could not read nor write. He argued that the key to solving problems with males and their values was female education. By educating females, gentlemen would need to educate themselves in order to impress the women. Educating women set higher standards for men, thereby limiting troublesome male behavior. He shouted, Educate your daughters and the young men will seek and education to qualify themselves for their society...Wherever the Bible has been brought to bear on mankind, it has had an elevating effect on the moral character and social rank of women. The gospel has a peculiar elevating influence on the social and domestic state of woman. This Baptist institution hoped to use its efforts in faith to benefit the social good by having a well-behaved, educated population.","The arguments put forth by Baldwin reflected a larger sentiment at work in Baptist society. At about the same time Baldwin delivered his remarks from the pulpit, A.W. Richardson, a reverend from Alabama, echoed Baldwin: Educate the girls...and the boys in order to render themselves respectable in their eyes, will find means to educate themselves. Resulting from these Baptist opinions that women's education was essential, Baptists put their plan into action to develop schools, including the Brownsville Baptist Female College in western Tennessee. Female colleges created environments secluded from interruptions by boys, as women had no correspondence with gentlemen. The Baptists pitched the idea as a way to let daughters learn marketable skills such as teaching or bookkeeping before womanhood. The main theme underlying female education, however, was to keep young men from misbehaving.","Seeing such southern belles of high class, southern gentlemen would have to educate themselves and learn value, morality, and religion in order to even have a chance with educated women. Educating women in the antebellum South reflected larger Baptist values to cleanse the state of immorality and sectionalism.

He carefully described the faculty, which included a minister, and the courses of study, ranging from reading and writing to arithmetic and geography. He pleaded with the audience to understand the importance of female education in Southern society. Women were expected to be good mothers, and he wanted to make each woman be a nobly-nursing wife because that is her great mission upon earth. Without proper education, he lamented, women were susceptible to corruption. Education provided the solution to maintaining a proper Southern culture. Without good mothers, he argued, future generations of children would not be raised properly. It was incumbent upon everyone to plan for the future; each one had a moral obligation. So, let your prayers unite with ours in behalf of this institution-so useful to women-so necessary to mankind-so honorable to its liberal founders. ","To maintain Southern Cultural identity, males wanted to keep women in the homes and raise the families. However, there were women who protested this simple mindset, like Louisa McCord, as cited by the historian Michael O'Brien. Women like this provided reasons to create a college like this in order to teach women how to be 'proper'. She wrote an essay in 1852 called the Enfranchisement of Women. She advocated women's rights and wrote that women were out of place, unappreciated, having their talents and powers not only hidden under a bushel, but absolutely thrown away, while she becomes either the slave or the toy of men. As was the case with this college, women learned to read and write in order to be good wives, not for their own edification. Because some women, such as McCord, protested their treatment, the need to indoctrinate women to be subservient to their husbands became necessary. For this reason, educating women in Southern culture was very important.

The paper gave no description of the desired monument, but gave bountiful detail of the great deeds and history of John Lewis and his family.  Lewis came from Ireland, and, according to tradition, brought red clover to the continent.  The Indians attributed this red color to the blood that the Lewis family spilled from the Indians they frequently fought.  The article expounded Lewis's heroism, durability, and courage.  Lewis had a simple tombstone that proclaimed him a true patriot, especially for producing five sons who fought in the Revolutionary War.  The proposed monument, according to the article, would serve as his resting place in Gypsy Hill Park.  The article concentrated on Lewis, but also provided many details of his father's and grandfather's roles in Europe.  Because Lewis had such a large family, the paper suggested that surviving direct descendants would gather for the ceremonies.  ","    <em>The Washington Post </em>ran this article with the subheading of The Romance of a Virginian, surely catching the eye of the readers.  This piece is filled with history, romance, war, and action.  A reader wanting a trip into the past or out of the city and into the country could find it in this article.  A reader also wanting to know of heroes before the Civil War would find this article less taxing. The fact that the paper does not describe the monument at all suggests that the monument is either very unattractive or boring, or that there were no plans yet for it. ","    After the United States had settled down to a degree from the Civil War, commemorative statutes and memorials building occurred. Kirk Savage has noted an that during the nineteenth century, people increasingly built commemorative monuments to preserve and possibly redefine memories and the past.  He argues that people felt the need to control the past and memories, and thus built monuments to portray what they believed and felt, even if the perceptions were not fully truthful.  The Staunton people wanted the correct and proper portrayal of the story for the founding of their city.  Though John Lewis had died long before, he had lived his life fighting for what he had believed and had descendants who fought for their rights.  Lewis was the type of hero that Augusta County wanted.  Having died long before the Civil War meant the County did not have to deal with the pain of the Civil War and task of properly honoring a man who fell in a war that defeated the South.  There was no problem of strong emotional ties or recent wounds.  Anyone in the North or the South could be proud of this man because they had no need to tie him to the present.  Building a monument to John Lewis and not one of the many Augusta County soldiers who died gave the County a past they could all respect and upon which they could agree. There would be no debate on whether Lewis was a Democrat or Republican, secessionist or Unionist.  John Lewis was a man for America and that was all the County needed.

Marylanders linked this romantic image of jousting with their image of the Old South, and through jousting, they renewed their southern identity. Many Maryland knights chose names like the Knight of the Lost Cause, the Knight of the Sunny South, and the Knight in Grey to show their sympathy for the plight of the southern states.

The division of slave families was also a regular occurrence when an owner died and passed his or her slaves down to their heirs or designated slaves to be sold in order to pay off debts.

According to the local newspaper, <em>The Spectator</em>, upon arrival at the excursion's destination \"[t]he day was pleasantly spent in amusements and games of different kinds-ten pins, croquet, dancing, &c.\"  Such activity was a relatively common feature of the temperance movement in the American South after the Civil War.  The main goal of this movement was to eliminate, or at least reduce, alcohol consumption among the populace.  According to historian Thomas Pegram, the movement was filled largely with women who often engaged in public, grassroots activities to spread their message.  Lacking the right to vote and often appealing to the idea that they were the moral authority on the domestic scene, such women saw public action as an important way to express their ideals.","      Other broad trends in the post-Civil War South contributed to increased emphasis on temperance.

Such ads for girl's academies were not uncommon in the 1830s, for over the span of the early 1800s there was a growing trend for families to send their daughters to one of these schools if they could afford it. The popularity of these academies is best explained by the belief in the early 1800s that a good education was instrumental in preparing an upper class woman for her role in society and at home. Among the courses offered in the ad were \"French and English Languages, Sacred and Profane History, Ancient and Modern Geography, Mythology, and all the various types of Fancy and Ornamental Needlework.\" Such fields of study were common among these academies, although there were variances from school to school. The inclusion of needle work in the curriculum, however, is a bit uncommon, for although it was an important skill for most women in the antebellum period it was only taught in about thirty-percent of academies. In addition, courses in music and dance were offered in the ad but at an extra cost. This highlighted a common trend in the academy movement. While these fields were thought to be an important part of creating a lady, they lost value with a newer emphasis on more academic courses which had previously been for males only. Christie Farnham, in her <em>Educating the Southern Belle</em>, argues that this change occurred because of the changing ideas of the capacities of women. Because women were now thought to be just as capable as men they too could receive the same benefits of a liberal arts education as men did. And this was the main point of a woman's education, to make her a better person for her role in society. Thus, the knowledge gained in schooling was important in creating what was thought to be a proper lady."," In addition to the knowledge gained, a proper education was pivotal in creating a charming and sophisticated lady. And this highlighted an important role of a woman's education, as a sign of class distinction. One of the most prominent ways in which the upper-class distinguished itself from lower classes was with the refinement and knowledge gained from these institutions. It reinforced the idea that they were better than the people in these other groups by virtue of their knowledge and ability to interact in proper society. Such an ideal is played upon in the ad as when it states, \"Advantage will be taken of every opportunity to cultivate their minds, and qualify them for refined and polite society.\" Thus, in many respects a young ladies education was a defining symbol of her class status. Also, an education became a sign of class rank simply because of its immense cost. Tuitions were usually around 200 annually but could range much higher,  the ad's tuition is listed at the exorbitant price of 500, and this did not include other expenses such as clothing, transportation, extra classes, and so on. A woman's education was an expensive investment that could only be provided by those with high incomes. Therefore, women of high social status attended these academies in large numbers for it had become an integral part of their class rank and social status to do so.

For one, the blaze destroyed an ancestral home of considerable value that had been passed down continuously over several generations. Also, as her letter clearly expresses, the burning of her house shook Harriet Huger emotionally, a fact she expresses to her aunt in the vain hope that her family \"be exempt from domestic calamity.\" Even so, Harriet and the rest of the Huger family were quite fortunate, for they rebuilt their plantation home within one year of the blaze due to the vast agricultural wealth held in the family coffers.","While the Huger family was quite privileged, both in their affluence and personal safety, the opportunities they enjoyed following their house fire were certainly not available to all Southern families. All the same, Harriet Lucas Huger's letter is quite valuable, for it not only describes a variety of problems families faced in the antebellum South, but also a vivid account of how families of the planter society handled those disasters on a day-to-day basis."],"display_date":"March 17, 1821","search_date":"1821-03-17","locations":[{"id":11652,"lat":33.8522812111,"lng":-80.2797613977,"zoom":8,"place":"SUMTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3940,"title":"Schoolteacher Sees Importance of Religion in Education\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-10-27","end_date":"1874-10-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["      An Augusta County, Virginia schoolteacher named Mary Susan Gregory recognized the importance of using her devotion to God to show her students how to live their lives properly.  In a diary entry dated October 1874, she noted, \"as teachers we should set an example worthy of imitation, (for there is a fearful responsibility resting upon us,) and there is no better way of doing it than by showing reverence for God's word and seeking his guidance.\"  Being religious herself, Gregory desired to imbue her pupils with an appreciation for having a relationship with God.  Lynn Lyerly, a historian who has studied women and religion in the South, discusses how many women in the late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century South sought to engage in mission work outside of home and the church.  Numerous organizations of Protestant women sought not only to witness the Gospel to the public, but also to perform acts of kindness and charity for the less fortunate.","      According to historian Charles Wilson, Southern religion has always been heavily influenced by the Calvinists' negative attitude toward human nature.  For this reason, churches in the South tend to emphasize the need for a conversion through God's grace and a subsequent life of morality.  Wilson's assertions help explain Lyerly's description of many Southern women as motivated to evangelize and perform mission work outside their traditional spheres of influence.  Gregory seems to have been one of these women, seeing as she used her position as a teacher to spread the word of God in hopes of positively influencing the lives of her students.  In her own words, \"for the past two mornings our principal has opened the school by reading the Scriptures and prayer.  I am decidedly in favor of it-it will make a lasting impression upon the minds of the children.\"  Gregory's support of prayer and Bible-reading in school suggests a belief that children who are taught in a religious environment are likely to live more proper lives.

Even in the latter part of the century, values firmly rooted in the pre-Civil War plantation culture remained prevalent. Mrs. Weisiger described her mother's virtues with special reverence as a woman whose life encountered many changes throughout the war and reconstruction years and yet still maintained her dignity as a Southern lady.  She declared her mother \"was as near right as any human could have been.\" Women who were born after the reconstruction era learned feminine ideals from their mothers, who passed on what it meant to be a lady.","    The \"southern lady\" idealized  femininity by subscribing to traits such as \"sweetness, beauty, gentleness, and ease...while remaining feminine, submissive, and sweet to the man who was her husband...\" This occurred while caring for all domestic functions of the household, which included providing clothing, preparing food, providing moral and religious guidance and to administering to the sick. Although slavery instituted household demands on a pre-war plantation wife that were very different from that of a post-war southern wife, women were still expected to fill the same role within the family with or without the duties of managing a contingent of household slaves. Slavery provided southern white women an opportunity to embody certain leisurely ideals from a public view.

Beginning in 1872, when Victoria Woodhull published in <em>Woodhull and Clafin's Weekly</em> an account of the affair between the famed pastor, Beecher, and his parishioner, Elizabeth Tilton, the scandal captivated the public. The details of the affair and its aftermath were complicated and convoluted. At first, Beecher chose to ignore Woodhull's initial accusation, which seemed to be a logical strategy as she was notorious for creating scandal. As time went on though, and adultery accusations accumulated, events escalated and Beecher was forced to take the defensive. Elizabeth Tilton's husband, Theodore, filed suit against his former friend, Beecher, in 1875. Elizabeth Tilton presented contradictory evidence before, during and after the trial stating at different times that Beecher was innocent or that he was guilty.  Due to inconclusive evidence, contradictory accounts presented in the case, and an indecisive jury, Beecher was exonerated. Because of their involvement in the trial, Elizabeth and Theodore Tilton, who by the end of the case were no longer married, among others were excommunicated from Beecher's church. ","As a case study of public discourse in reference to the trial, the newspaper, <em>The Atlanta Constitution,</em> handled the events within the scope of a nation with a shifting structure and societal values.  In fact, the case was so etched in rhetoric indicative of  the changing era that even as late as 1895 an <em>Atlanta Constitution</em> article tried to make sense of what happened by stating that Elizabeth Tilton was hypnotized, which was why she acted in such contradictory ways. According to historian, Altina Waller, the case excited public discourse to such an extent because it was a representation of the power struggle and breakdown of traditional structure in the post- Civil War society. Beecher and Tilton entered the trial as anomalies to traditional structure. Beecher was a prominent liberal Christian and both he and Tilton were involved in the promotion of women's rights and other radical reform movements. Yet in the trial, Beecher tried to present himself as more moderate than Tilton so as to have an attractive case to more people which shows that even Beecher acknowledged that people may not have been ready for some of his progressive ideas.  Despite this, the progressives still supported Beecher and the traditionalists took up the cause, not necessarily for Tilton but against Beecher. The conflict of the trial turned into one between progressives and traditionalists and became a symbol of people's attempt to understand and adapt to social changes.  By the end of the trial, neither man was fully exonerated in the eyes of the public. The trial became emblematic of the vices of the struggle between progressives and traditionalists.","Through various articles, the <em>Constitution </em>supported Waller's view and highlighted the impact of the case on public discourse in that it often explains the volatile nature of discussion of the case and also served as bank of impassioned rhetoric. For example, in the article \"Fighting About Beecher Trial,\" the <em>Constitution</em> stated that people discussed the trial and became so heated in their arguments that certain bars had to ban the discussion of the Beecher trial to prevent violence. The <em>Constitution </em>also emphasized the misdemeanors of all involved in the trial. The majority of the articles did not approve of either Beecher or Tilton's actions and illustrated them as adulterous and evil. Beecher, in particular, was made to be a villain in the paper since he was supposed to have been a pious man, yet was accused of adultery and manipulation. Through the disapproval of the actions of Beecher and Tilton in the trial, the <em>Constitution </em>discredited new social systems and upheld more traditional values.

Over two hundred listeners gathered for a picnic at the local Fisher's Hill one July morning in 1888.  The event was relaxed with picnic food, a speech, and a Woodstock Cornet Band for entertainment.  Yet it focused on an issue of substantial importance: temperance.  As the local <em>Strasburg Weekly Dots</em> paper reported, the theme of the picnic was \"Liquor Traffic is a Crime\" and Virginians gathered in their common belief that alcohol was unnecessary and unjust.  ","The idea of temperance that the people of Shenandoah County promoted was not isolated to their area. Beginning around the 1830s, many Southerners, especially women, started to worry about the negative aspects of alcohol consumption.  One of the most important temperance organizations was the Women's Christian Temperance Union, created in 1874.  Other local temperance efforts, such as this picnic, occurred throughout the nineteenth century.  ","Religious and racial tensions plagued many temperance efforts. Most of the temperance women were evangelical Protestants who often criticized the Irish Catholics and Germans frequently associated with alcohol consumption and production.  Discord also existed between blacks and whites, as some white women claimed that black men were especially a danger with alcohol.  Although these apprehensions existed, for the most part the temperance movement was successful in incorporating women of various \"socio-economic, racial, religious, and national identities.\" Many women used the Bible to justify temperance; they claimed that it was God's plan for women to help the men and \"most commonly likened women...to Christ's apostles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dots</em> does not mention the demographic or religious background of the picnic's guests having had any effect; in fact, it says there \"was no disorder.\" This furthers the idea that locals were unified by a common aspiration. ","Although temperance is traditionally associated with women against alcohol consumption, at the time, it was just as important in promoting white women's overall equality.  For example, the WCTU helped educate women \"to take on public personas because the nineteenth century offered [them] limited formal education in rhetoric.\"  Often, people saw the strive for equality as radical.  Thus, as historian Carol Mattingly writes, \"newspaper reporting focused largely on issues of gender rather than on the subject of temperance\" which she says \"reflects a general discomfort with women's changing roles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dot</em>s, on the other hand, presents an article focused on the issue of temperance as opposed to gender.  This is likely because the focus of their gathering was \"not yet Congress, Legislature, Judge, Jury, Church or state;...but the Rum Traffic, was the prisoner at the bar.\" Long-term changes for women, such as the Nineteenth Amendment, would not occur for some time. Still, the nineteenth-century temperance movement fueled the steps towards gender equality.  Events such as the Shenandoah County Temperance Picnic, although small, represented a larger movement that took place throughout the South."],"display_date":"June 28, 1888","search_date":"1888-06-28","locations":[{"id":14271,"lat":38.8584536791,"lng":-78.5704125087,"zoom":9,"place":"SHENANDOAH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3965,"title":"Education by Gender\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-03-01","end_date":"1856-03-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Charleston Mercury</em> ran an advertisement in March 1856 for the creation of a \"Preparatory Military School\" in Yorkville, South Carolina.

The basic courseload for the school had arithmetic, history, geography, and grammar, while the advanced lessons included surveying, mythology, French, and, interestingly enough, brawling. The military instruction encompassed the command of squad and company as well. Ironically, the school seemed well prepared to deliver its students into the \"Military Institutions of the state,\" even though the administrators certainly had no way of knowing that a bloody and brutal war would be nearly over by the time the school was scheduled to open.","Though the advertisement specified ages for its pupils - between twelve and eighteen - there was no gender requirement. It is obvious that the students intended for this sort of education were male, since females were not allowed to fight in the army. Although the majority of Southern students - and therefore Southern schools - were male, there also existed a rather large number of female educational institutions. These schools were very rarely co-ed; young men and women were taught separately and, for much of the nineteenth century, different subjects. Women learned the French style of education, which focused primarily on needlework, the French language, and other ladylike occupations, but as times changed, both men and women at higher educational levels pushed for the same training for young women as was already in place for young men. Though military prep schools certainly remained an exception, women began to learn arithmetic, geography, grammar, and other liberal arts topics, instead of the French topics. Even if men were still the main focus of Southern educational systems, the instruction of women was not far behind. Indeed, Southerners who could afford an education were denied nothing based simply on gender.

General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia surrendered to the Union and effectively destroyed any chance of her beloved Confederacy succeeding in its war effort and becoming a separate and distinct nation. For Emma, the only highlight of the month appeared in the assassination of President Lincoln: \"After all the heaviness and gloom of yesterday this blow to our enemies comes like a gleam of light.\" A common, unfortunate theme throughout her April diary entries was the rationing of food and a severe lack of funds available for more than the basic necessities. Though wearing homespun versus store-bought clothing items was a minor disturbance compared to the lack of food, her accustomed wealthy way of life was ruined. LeConte tried to keep some of her former lifestyle of leisure by trading French lessons for German coaching with a family friend, but as she realized that her usual \"Old South\" lifestyle was gone forever, her desperation set in.","The Confederate surrender would be the start of only harder times for South Carolinians like the LeConte family as well as other Southerners. Lee's formal surrender at Appomattox brought down the Confederacy in one written swoop. Economic times were already tough in the South, as most white men had mobilized with the Confederate armies and were unable to keep a steady eye on their farms at home; meanwhile, slaves voluntarily freed themselves from bondage without their masters' watch. Most women were powerless to run family businesses. The combination of these situations dropped the South into destitution even before the Civil War ended. Unpaid debts between Southerners and annihilated commercial centers such as Charleston and Columbia added further to the South's woes.

Though her concern for her father's ill health was quite natural, it was quite surprising to learn of her distaste for such a grand and important Southern city such as Charleston and her accompanying lack of \"any desire to visit town.\" Her large amount of leisure time, however, exposes Mrs. Huger's status as an elite white Southern woman.

As plummeting cotton prices forced the South into economic destitution, many women did not have the option of maintaining their work-free Southern womanhood and survived solely because they helped their husbands in the fields. Labor would have been considered absolutely improper for elite women before the war. Not only were the former Southern belles working in the fields, but Southern women were also responsible for the upkeep of the family home - this time without the help of slaves.

Although the portrait did not reveal anything about Stella Haas except her hometown, the image implied much about Southern life after 1877. Reconstruction brought many changes to those who lived below the Mason-Dixon line and the influence of Northern culture and ideals was quite apparent in this portrait of Ms. Haas. ","    Stella's photo was taken a few years after Reconstruction and there was obvious Northern influence in what she chose to wear. On the day of her sitting, Stella was dressed in a tailored pin-stripe jacket with a slim fitting floor-length skirt. This outfit, almost the opposite of what Southern women wore in the antebellum South, reflected how the North influenced life after the Civil War. Ms. Haas was not dressed in a hoop skirt with excessive amounts of lace and embellishment, typical of most Southern women in the antebellum South. Rather, her outfit was more demure and humble, and though the photograph was taken in black and white, her ensemble did not appear to be very colorful.","    Southern women were expected to be pure, graceful, and delicate, while these social standards of Southern femininity may have continued into the late nineteenth century, Stella Haas represented very few of them. Her face was expressionless, but this was more reflected in her modest and harsh visage.  Although these characteristics suggest that Stella was not of affluent means, this was probably not the case. Photography was a developing medium in the late nineteenth century and not many people could afford to spend money on the material activity except for middle class and relatively wealthy. Fashion often characterized a culture and the elite South prior to 1877 was defined by an emphasis on extravagance and adornment, especially in peoples' dress.

In January 1884, Mrs. James Bennett argued in Kentucky's legislature that women should receive the vote in presidential elections. She provided several arguments, including the fact that men of poor morals and low status in society were able to vote whilst a \"noble Christian women\" was not. In addition, she cited the Thirteenth Amendment and emphasized that a state could not make or enforce any law that shall abridge the privileges or immunities of \"citizens of the United states,\" which was defined as persons born or naturalized in the United States. However, her main argument was a religious one; she claimed that God wanted women to vote and thus argued that men who opposed suffrage and women who accepted their disenfranchisement were disobeying God.","Mrs. James Bennett cited an argument by Herbert Spencer, an English philosopher, who argued that happiness can be achieved only by the exercise of one's faculties. According to Bennett, God wills everyone's happiness, which means exercising one's faculties. Subsequently, as women have the faculty to vote, it follows that God thus wills that they vote. After this Bennett drew on passages from the Bible to show that it does not oppose female suffrage, as was commonly thought. She argued that the passage, where wives are told to \"submit themselves unto their own husbands, as unto the Lord; for the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is head of the church\", supports the submission of wives to their husbands but it does not justify men ruling over them. God gave the world to both men and women, even if women are weaker and more dependent on men. Bennett also described the important role many women played in the Bible and the spread of Christianity. This all shows the equality of men and women before God and supported Bennett's view that God wills female suffrage.","As Bennett herself acknowledged, she was not the first to argue for female suffrage but was part of an ever growing movement that had begun decades earlier. Bennett explained that she only became convinced of the need for female suffrage after she heard Susan B. Antony talk in Richmond. Susan B. Antony was an important leader in the suffrage movement, she founded the National Woman's Suffrage Association with Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1869 and later served as its president. The movement for suffrage was national, but Bennett described how she had little support in Kentucky. Kentucky was the first state to give school suffrage to women, but according to Madeline McDowell it lagged behind many states in other areas. For example, in 1888, four years after Bennett's speech, Kentucky was \"the only state that did not permit a married woman to make a will and a wife's wages might be collected by her husband.\"","Not only was the suffrage movement slow to develop in Kentucky, but also the South as a whole lagged behind the North. The suffrage movement started in 1848 at the Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention, but it spread to the South much later. Elna Green accounts for the slow adoption of suffrage in the South by the fact that \"southern women trailed a generation behind their northeastern sisters in the critical experiences that produced support for woman suffrage.\" The critical experiences she cited were the result of industrialization, which occurred at a slower pace in the South.","Despite little support in Kentucky, Bennett claimed that men could not ignore women's demands for suffrage for much longer. In fact, women were only granted suffrage in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, 36 years after Mrs. Bennett's speech. However, the suffrage movement had been successful in Kentucky, as it was only one of four states in the South that ratified the amendment."],"display_date":"January 1, 1884 - January 30, 1884","search_date":"1884-01-15","locations":[{"id":4828,"lat":38.2391019422,"lng":-84.877038419,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3979,"title":"Caught on Crosshatch: A Lynching in Anderson, South Carolina","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-06-08","end_date":"1865-06-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    From 1865 to 1867, Emmala Reed, a young woman living in Anderson,  South Carolina, kept a personal journal detailing daily life during one of the most volatile periods of Southern history, early Reconstruction.

Reed's journal entry certainly proves this, for she observed the frightening picture of \"an innocent, peaceable negro all thought, taken from his frightened wife, taken out, his house searched, and (then) he was shot and left lying in the street the next morning.\" All this occurred due to the vengeance of a lynch mob operating in the town of Anderson, yet according to a traumatized Reed, \"no [citizen] knows who perpetrated the dark deed - nor for what reason - all excitement.\" Such occurrences of racism were not only common during early Reconstruction, but would also continue to appear for quite some time in South Carolina and across the South, proving that many whites in the region remained \"strongly committed to white supremacy.\"","     Reconstruction in South Carolina and in the rest of the former Confederacy was meant to turn the tides of racism and inequality that had been entrenched in the region for nearly two hundred years. In the long run, this racism would die out. Nevertheless, early Reconstruction strayed far from its purpose, a tolerance and freedom meant to apply to <em>two</em> races for the first time. More accurately, early Reconstruction efforts led to a southern culture of racial despair and hostility, one considered by Emmala Reed to be \"a horrible, disorganized state of society.\""],"display_date":"June 8, 1865","search_date":"1865-06-08","locations":[{"id":11429,"lat":34.519117434,"lng":-82.637883414,"zoom":9,"place":"ANDERSON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3991,"title":"Emergence of the New Women in the Reconstruction South\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-01-01","end_date":"1870-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["    \"Susan B.

However, the piece did not merely convey her knack for leadership.  It went on to mention her amazing skills as a speaker: \"she is angular and rigid, but sharp, trenchant, incisive; cutting through to the heart of whatever topic she touches.\"  Then again, Ms. Anthony was not the only spokeswomen for the movement.

Many Southern women argued that if black men, who were considered to be illiterate and ignorant about social issues, could vote, then educated and intelligent women should be able to counterbalance that vote.  However, the men of the South did not agree with southern women.  They believed that women were not suited for politics, as it was seen as unfeminine.  Nevertheless, southern women continued to work towards the vote through reform efforts and conventions - the first being the Women's Rights Convention in South   Carolina in 1870.  Simultaneously, other organizations, like the Women's Christian Temperance Union, provided support for the suffragist movement.  ","    As communication between the suffragist groups throughout the South improved, they turned their efforts to the rampant problems of the South such as alcoholism, child labor and poor working conditions.  Women not only fought for these laws, but they battled to cast a vote for these laws as well.  After all, this was their culture as well and they wanted to be involved in the political discussions and decisions that would directly affect them.  Their drive and determination reflected the idea of breaking through their narrow sphere to establish independence.  They were not going to stay silent and subject themselves to male rule any more.

She had an entry for each day during these two years in which she talked about such things as her clothing, visits made by family and friends, the weather, and illnesses.  Included in her diary were brief mentions of her slaves, who had been recently hired out to other plantation owners at the beginning of her 1858 diary.  As she talked about the hiring-out of her slaves she stated, \"I am so worried about the servants, do hope they will get comfortable homes and do well.\"  A concern for the well being of her slaves was evident in her diary as she explained her worries and wishes for the comfort of her former servants.  Her tone was genuine and exemplified how a slave-holding woman of the South could truly care for her servants, and that her concern was not completely related to the productivity and efficiency of her workers.  Furthermore, when talking about another one of her black workers, Charles, and his sale, she said she, \"...witnessed to Charles's bill of sale.  I am sorry for him, but he has brought it on himself by his obstinate conduct.\" Despite apparent disorderly conduct, she did not exhibit disrespect for this slave. ","Southern women's perspectives were often not the forefront of the Southern mindset during this time period.  Although much literature focused on the male political turmoil of the slave South, many women of this time exhibited much softer emotions toward their slaves.  In her book, Within the Plantation Household, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese argues that southern slaveholding women were not unlike their male counterparts and commanded dominance over their slaves.  She also stated that southern white women even went as far as to defend slavery as an integral party of society.  Genovese's argument presents a contradiction to the attitude of Fannie Page Hume. Although Genovese wrote of the dominance of southern women over their slaves, Hume may portray an internal conflict that many of these women struggled with.  The sense of dominance may have been a faÇade as a method to retain white supremacy, while in reality many women experienced the same empathies of Fannie Page Hume toward their slaves.

Paying more attention to the Army Appropriation bill, funding for public building, and the Railroad Attorney's Bill, the article hardly focused on women's perpetual disenfranchisement. While one senator presented the petition and stated his favor for suffrage because it would make \"Washington the best illustration of the republican idea of self-government,\" another discarded the resolution asserting, \"He would not degrade woman by giving her the right of suffrage.\" Following this short exchange of ideas, the Senate voted on the measure, defeating it 34 to 16. The <em>Virginian </em>delivered the result of the vote, gave no commentary on the issue, and immediately resumed discussion of the public buildings' appropriation."," In 1887, Southern men still retained the idea that it was their duty to protect women's virtue, one of the most significant aspects of the prevailing honor culture. Men saw politics as too intense for ladies to concern themselves with, for it often embodied corruption and uncensored dialogue. Women were the ethical compass in Southern households, thus many men thought involvement in politics would not only taint their image, but their moral fiber as well. Furthermore, as Horace Bushnell points out, men commonly held the belief that women were incapable of making sound decisions when voting because they went \"more by feeling than men, they feel every thing more intensely, and with more liabilities to excess.\" ","It was also still common for many families to ascribe to traditional gender roles of the antebellum period. Nicholas Bromell's book, <em>By the Sweat of the Brow</em>, also notes that men were usually the primary providers while women occupied their own \"sphere,\" remaining in the home to be the family's religious authority and caretaker. Thus, at the time there was no place for women in politics because the defining characteristic of their \"sphere\" was that it made a clear distinction between \"home and world.\" The cult of domesticity continued to have a heavy influence on Southern life in the 1880s, therefore delaying women's right to vote. "," The <em>Virginian Weekly & Carolinian's </em>apathetic attitude towards women's suffrage was synonymous with the majority of Southern male ideas on the issue. Things like internal improvements and government funding were much higher priorities at the time. Men were not ready to conflate the gender spheres and include women in self-government because they saw them unfit to do its bidding. The voting booth was a male arena; women were the spectators.

Minor estimated the total losses in Virginia at \"little short of 400 million\" noting that enrollment at the University plummeted during the war, making it barely profitable for him to teach the few remaining students.

In this work she analyzes the affects of the Civil War on women in the South and discusses her own experiences as a daughter this post-Civil War society. Kearney desired to be well educated and to pursue a life beyond the domestic sphere of women. She stated that women in the South had assumed responsibility while the men were at war yet when the men returned, women were expected to return to the female domain. For Kearney, remaining in this womanly sphere was not acceptable. In 1889, she was given her chance for public work when her father encouraged her to listen to a speech given by the President of the WCTU, Frances Willard. After this, Kearney accepted a position in the WCTU which became, for her, an outlet to the public sphere and prepared her to later serve in the women's suffrage movement.            ","According to historian Louise M. Young, this experience in the WCTU was not exclusive to Kearney. Women's promotion of temperance was seen as acceptable public work for them because temperance fell into the womanly sphere of \"protecting the home.\" This allowed women in public work to become more acceptable and thus gave women the courage and ability to work for more radical causes such as women's suffrage.  So, women took the training hat they received in the WCTU and applied it to the suffrage movement. Temperance also opened other avenues for suffrage in that supporters of temperance wanted to give women the vote so that they would have political power to enforce temperance. For the South, this was important because Southern women had not participated in the abolition movement in the North which had prepared women for the first wave of the women's suffrage movement. Thus, in the South the WCTU served to prepare women for the women's suffrage movement as the abolition movement had in the North."],"display_date":"April 1, 1889 - August 18, 1920","search_date":"1904-12-09","locations":[{"id":7161,"lat":32.6346973664,"lng":-90.0338114186,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4093,"title":"Women&#39;s Benevolent Societies\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-09-14","end_date":"1831-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 14, 1831, members of the Female Assistance Society of New York met to discuss preparations for their charitable work for the upcoming winter.  Eighteen years previously, the organization had been founded by wives of high status New York men who wished to do more than simply be an ordinary housewife.  The main focus of this non profit organization was to provide as much assistance as possible to the poor and homeless people living on the streets of New York City.  It was to be made clear to the rest of society that these women were not focusing on their own charity work out of selfishness; their simple goal was to aid the poor, sick, widowed, and homeless, and provide these people with a fraction of the sense of security they themselves felt.  At this particular meeting, the officers discussed how they should be preparing for the approaching winter in regards to helping the homeless.  The previous winter had been terrible, and the members of the organization wanted to ensure that they would have the capabilities to provide assistance to more people than they had in earlier years.","The Female Assistance Society of New York was not the first formal organization of women.  Primarily in New York and Boston, females of prominent Protestant households had been working in organized groups to assist the less fortunate for decades.  During their early years, the procedural aspects of these societies were managed solely by women, but in order to reach their goals, male counterparts were called in for financial management purposes.  Some groups were more successful than others, and this depended largely on the demographic of the group they were attempting to assist.  The New York Society for the Relief of Poor Widows wit Small Children campaigned successfully for funds, while the Boston Female Moral Reform Society faced more trouble finding financial support, as the most prominent members of society were reluctant to donate to a charity for \"unrespectable\" women.  ","By 1850, the most prevalent female organization was the Ladies Benevolent Society, which had many of the same goals as the Female Assistance Society.  Founded by the wives of prominent Protestant men of the time, this society provided aid and a foundation of Christian beliefs to those less fortunate, particularly widows and orphans.  The creation of such societies that were managed entirely by women were the early foundations of the women's rights movement that dominated a large part in the history of the early twentieth century.  Although these women were not seeking independence from their husbands or any rights of their own, the way in which they organized entire societies on their own accord with little or no help from the men in their lives shows how women were able to take initiative to accomplish what they wanted on their own.

It also shows the development in rhetoric in the South and how discourse concerning women's suffrage evolved throughout the nineteenth century to discuss the movement more objectively. The more objective tone, which indicates change in dealing with women's suffrage and journalistic style, allowed a vehicle for women to be able to express their ideas without excessive critique from the journals that served as public sources of information. This objectivity began with the discussion of women's suffrage in order to keep a white majority in the voting arena. While the Atlanta Constitution did not completely accept women's suffrage, the discussion of it as a solution to curb the African American vote is at least an effort to entertain its possibilities. In 1890, the Constitution ran an article which discussed the debate in Mississippi over women's suffrage as a solution to secure a white majority. Mississippi politicians, according to the Constitution, were in agreement property and education requirements would ensure that less African American would vote and that the women who then were allowed to vote would be educated and would then eliminate the votes of the African American. The concern that Mississippi had though, was that women would not be interested enough in voting rights to actually use them. The Constitution sympathized with Mississippi's problem, but did not support the idea of women receiving the vote. Still, this article shows that people in the South were willing to entertain the idea of women's suffrage. ","            This was not exclusive to Mississippi as many states began to consider women's suffrage so as to keep a white majority of voters. When Southern women took up the suffrage cause, many argued for suffrage in order to keep the white majority within suffrage. These women also wanted to establish suffrage through state amendments rather than national amendments and thus they made suffrage seem more acceptable in the South since they advocated it within the established social structure. Because of this and because of the debates that suffrage as a solution to African American suffrage began, more people started considering women's suffrage as a possibility and women were able to use this as a vehicle to further the cause.

Embury on December 10, 1831. Embury spoke at the anniversary ceremony for the Brooklyn Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies. She pointed out that although schooling was becoming more prevalent across the country, female education and its reputation was still lagging behind the education that males were receiving. Embury emphasized that intellectual women were \"enough to convince any unprejudiced mind that heaven has conferred upon woman, no less than upon man, the gifts of talent and genius.\" She proclaimed that men and women were equally capable and that increasing the education of women was of utmost importance. Embury declared, \"A good education includes the culture of the heart as well as the mind.\" Individuals should be well-rounded, capable, intelligent citizens. Therefore, early childhood education was extremely important. Since mothers generally did most of the nurturing, Embury said, the education of women was extremely beneficial for society. ","Embury was not the only person to promote education for women in the United States. Female seminaries began to develop between 1820 and 1850. By 1850, there were 6,085 academies and seminaries in America. A large percentage of these were co-educational or open exclusively to women. Schools continued to open and expand their curriculums. Many educational reformers believed that such schools would not only provide women with a large knowledge base, but also \"prepared [them] for their important duties as virtuous wives.\" They felt that women would be better prepared to nurture their children and \"uplift the moral character of their sons and husbands\" if they were well-educated. Embury's speech outlined the benefits of the education of women, informing her readers of its necessity and pointing out that even \"the character of our illustrious [George] Washington was formed by his mother.\" "],"display_date":"December 10, 1831","search_date":"1831-12-10","locations":[{"id":8867,"lat":40.6450686304,"lng":-73.9495584018,"zoom":11,"place":"KINGS, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":6,"school_id":2}},{"id":4114,"title":"Manners and Conduct in America during the 1850&#39;s\n","course_id":3,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-11-01","end_date":"1857-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["    In November of 1857, G.

Sweet notes, \"Women should be distinguished less for their musical talents and parlor charm than for their 'elevated course of convention' and 'well digested opinions, habits of thinking and observation, good judgement, and well disciplined temper.\" Holbrook's article identifies one of the central topics for both men and women in a crucial period of time in Antebellum America.

Writing about a lecture given at the school, the student author complained about the generalization the lecturer made concerning people who spend time in the country.  She defended herself and other women in their love for nature by comparing the green country to the dirty city in vivid descriptions, and by using short examples of people who like or dislike the country.  For instance, she wrote that any woman who would rather walk on a \"dusty sidewalk\" than through the \"green fields,\" could have the city and lie \"unwept\" in a tomb because the \"right kind of a woman always loves the country.\"","During the last half of the nineteenth century, many women worked in textile mills in large cities and many had moved from their rural homes to do so.  Part of the resistance that emerged to working in mills was that women felt separated from nature.  Lucy Larcom was a Lowell mill operative who in later years, coincidentally, taught at Wheaton and founded the Rushlight.  Larcom, like her fellow workers, often put plants on the mill's windowsills in order to feel connected to nature and to God and to disguise the smells of machinery.  \"The sweet air of the woodland which lingered about [the roses] would scent our thoughts all day,\" wrote Larcom in a memoir.  Indeed, many female authors chose to be nature's advocates.  They wrote essays about their \"natural right\" to further their intellect and created other essays and poems about nature.  Cecil Frances Alexander described in her poem titled \"All things bright and beauteous\" the many natural things God had created.  Hence, many women felt that experiencing nature was a way to be close to God.  In the Rushlight article, the author compared the country to the man-made city.

She said that it was good to have women learn their domestic duties, but it was not enough.  A woman must learn morals and have mental capacity in order to interact with other people, and mothers who teach their daughters, teach the opposite because they have not learned morals and social mentality themselves.  Hale was against frivolous things, like coming out parties to increase the quality of young women's education.  In her speech, she stressed that mothers are the best teachers, though, and that they should oversee their daughters' education.  Women were encouraged to get an education in order to provide for their families, if needs arose.  She also thought that there was no danger in having women learn something because it would not change their love for their husbands.  Hale's ideas influenced the founding of schools for women, like Mount Holyoke and Wheaton Female Seminary.","    In the 1830's the old tradition of families was getting unpopular with young women.  Their parents were concerned that because their daughters were not getting married that they would have to provide for their daughters.  Most of these families were poor farming families as it was.  These families had to plan what they must do to get these young women prepared to fend for themselves.  Some of these young women had to get an education to help provide for their family.  Mount Holyoke and Wheaton advertised for these middle class families who had low income.  Domestic learning was also important to these two schools.  Mount Holyoke had a \"Domestic Plan,\" under which students did their own chores, like washing, cleaning, and cooking, and Wheaton had weekly inspections of students' dorms.  Domestic learning was not the most important thing to these colleges.  They had courses like drawing, music, arithmetic and philosophy, classes that were unheard of in traditional women's education.

She also described the tension in the city of Corinth, Mississippi where people were on edge and fearful of \"Yankee raids\" following some previous, unmentioned event. Although the unmentioned event happened some weeks before, the residents of Corinth continued to be on the defensive. ","    The issue of life on the home front is one of great importance when attempting to understand and fully grasp the type of impact that the Civil War had on both the Northern and Southern regions of the United States.

For many Southern women especially, who suddenly became responsible for managing farms and plantations on their own while living with battles being fought in their backyards, their experiences on the home front deeply influenced their opinions of the national conflict. Perhaps such events would have caused women like Narcissa Barksdale and Alice Janney to rally around the Confederate troops and encourage them to fight harder against the invading Union forces, but then again these same events could have just as easily spurned a desire to simply stop the fighting and bring the troops home.

The young woman was surrounded by \"tokens of wealth\" but she wished for something different. While her mother's spirit looked down over her she wanted more than just to enjoy the festivities of life and have a good husband and marriage. \"She had seemed to be happy, and had been envied by her friends: it was only in the quiet hours, when she was alone, that she cried out for more that she could gain in her present life.\" The young woman was unsatisfied and felt a sense of rebellion grow within her.

American society expected women to fill the roles of wives and mothers during this time, however many women asked themselves whether this was what they truly wanted to do with their lives.

However, for young women of the mid to late nineteenth century female seminaries provided a place for women to expand their horizons as Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz explains in her book, Alma Mater. \"By 1859, sixty Mount Holyoke graduates had entered foreign missionary work\" is one example of the opportunities seminary women had just out of school. Overall, \"Students created their own standards of success in this world\" which sometimes liberated them and sometimes kept them feeling trapped by social norms.

By the end of 1841 Washingtonians claimed that over 200,000 had signed their pledge, and by 1842 they had recruited over one million people. The Washingtonian Temperance Society took a new approach to curing intemperance.

For many, clothing choice reflected how a woman was viewed by her society. In early American Christian towns men wanted their wives and daughters to be seen as virtuous and plain in their dress. Due to this perspective about fashion women would choose conservative and simple styles to fit into what their society wanted. According to Springs, a woman was allowed to dress in any manner she wished so long as it did not offend her husband and the society she was in. Springs continued to say, \"Fashions, which characterize a gay and worldly circle, a Christian woman will avoid.\" A Christian woman in the 1800's had to make sure that her hem was just right, her colors were just so and her hair was in place, all while not being vain. ","Women in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries had a wide variety of standards set upon them. Much of how society viewed women in the time depended on a woman's social class and religion. Religion was a major factor for how women dressed and were perceived. Christian women were expected to maintain a clean and orderly appearance.  Under these strict Christian guidelines, women in this time had to sacrifice their education and knowledge simply to be the perfect domesticated woman. Along with the ideal of staying constantly presentable, women could not allow themselves to be attracted to the vanities that modern fashions had to offer, such as the bright \"worldly\" colors that Dr. Springs mentioned. They had to hold up the ideals of their religion and still fit into the world of quality clothing and attire. Dresses that were simple in fabric and color were the only acceptable garments to wear. Women who thought bloomers were decent garments were taught by prominent males that bloomers were garments which promoted \"that wild spirit of socialism.\"  While some upper class women were wearing jewels and riches, Christian women were not to indulge in such ornament."],"display_date":"April 1825","search_date":"1825-04-15","locations":[{"id":6206,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":6,"school_id":2}},{"id":4148,"title":"Recognizing the Importance of Female Education\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-12-10","end_date":"1831-12-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"Let me not be misunderstood, when I thus earnestly insist upon the necessity of female education,\" insisted Emma C.

Embury argued that a proper education would finally help women gain the recognition that they felt they were worthy of receiving. ","With the growing interest in female education, many of those advocating for it were apprehensive of how the men would respond. For years women were not treated with the same equality as men; they were seen as the weaker sex thus female education was not seen as a necessity. Editor Sarah Josepha Hale voiced her belief that the only reason the intelligence of men seemed superior to that of women was because women were only involved in duties as a housewife, and men had more chances to acquire greater knowledge. Slowly, after much debate, the views on the education of females began to shift. Eventually a women's education was seen as being necessary in order for them to properly carry out their obligations as both a mother and wife. They believed that if a woman did not obtain appropriate knowledge, how could she impart proper wisdom upon her children?

She further maintained that it was more advantageous to observe events and their outcomes from a distance, in the country, before experiencing them first hand than \"to have lived in the very whirl of constantly occurring events\" (in the city).  The author also explained there was no greater teacher than nature.  In the country, one had the benefit of observing the harmony and lessons of nature.","     Women's seminaries used more than books to educate their students.  The idea of using the natural environment as a tool for education was stemmed from the work of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, the father of modern educational theory, and his assistant, Joseph Neef.

According to historian Gerald Lee Gutek, these men thought that \"natural instincts and interests should control, close contact with nature should furnish the occasion and means of education.\"  Where the school was located was equally important.  Schools like Mount Holyoke, Wellesley, and Wheaton, were located in ideal areas where students could study under the trees, learn about the stars through their observatories, and look at the beautiful landscape of the seminary.  Though city schools were supposed to provide cultural and social opportunities, students at Radcliff were unable to take advantage of the Cambridge society.

A small number disguised themselves as men and snuck onto the battlefield, others became nurses, and still more stayed at home to sew uniforms and pack provisions.  From the start of the war in 1861, magazines such as <em>Harper's Weekly</em> encouraged women to sacrifice their resources, time, and families for their nation.  After kissing their husbands and sons farewell, women set up domestic labor groups to fulfill their patriotic duties and show courage even while far removed from the battlefield.  This courage demanded that women suffer emotional wounds sometimes considered more harmful than the physical wounds suffered by the men they loved.","            As the war progressed, resources in the South grew slim and women became impatient.  As more sons and husbands died, women began to question their role in society without a man - should they devote themselves wholeheartedly to the war or fight for their own freedom?  The elite women's dresses grew dingy while the lower classes struggled to find bread and coffee for each night's meal.  Over time sewing groups turned into political discussions, and the boldest women began writing letters to government officials and army officers beseeching them to bring the men home.  Others wrote poems and prayers published in magazines, trying to impress the magnitude of their suffering.  Letters to their husbands begged them to come home to protect their families.  Southern women feared God was no longer on their side.  As they debated whether it might be easier on the battlefield than at home, they tried to find the balance between gentleness and valor required of them.  Despite all of the doubt, they must have hidden their uncertainty well because men like William Gilmore Simms believed that women held the South together and credited them for winning the war even though the South lost."],"display_date":1867,"search_date":"1867-07-02","locations":[{"id":8926,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4267,"title":"Kate Stone Praises Booth for His Daring Attempt\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-28","end_date":"1865-04-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 28, 1865 Kate Stone recorded her thoughts about the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.

Surratt in her praises for \"daring\" an attack on the Secretary of State William H. Seward, a well know abolitionist. Later she discovered it was Louis Powell, friend to Booth, who had attempted to take the life of Seward. Later in the entry, Kate commented she hoped the two \"avengers\" would escape to the South. She releases a torrent of anguish on Lincoln's memory by adding, \"It is a terrible tragedy, but what is war but one long tragedy? What torrents of blood Lincoln has caused to flow, and how Seward has aided him in his bloody work.\" Kate wrote about the \"gloom\" that descended on her town, when news of Robert E. Lee and his army had been captured. She concludes her entry by stating that depression has taken everyone and she fears for her and her family's welfare if the slaves are freed.  "," Kate Stone's uncertainties were very legitimate feelings to most Southerners when they discovered Lee's surrender. The war to Southerners was fought for tax equality and defending state rights. Abraham Lincoln appeared as a tyrant to many Confederates when he revoked the right of <em>habeas corpus</em>. In doing this, many Confederate sympathizers and informants were arrested without their constitutional rights to a trial. This incited fierce patriotism and nationalism within the South, as Confederates sought to define Kate Stone's \"terrible tragedy.\" To commemorate feelings of patriotism, military leaders, such as Robert E. Lee or the Confederate soldier were viewed as people of honor, which reflected Southern virtues of courage, honor and integrity on the home front. ","These honorable sentiments were observed as essential qualities in Kate's South.  It was these values that idolized the memory of the South before the war and created a superior opinion of the southern home front. The idea of protecting the \"grace and gentility\" of home life in the Confederate states was reinforced with the news of Lee's surrender and the emancipation of the slaves. The home front became the next battle ground for the conservation of southern values. These thoughts would create much of the tension between the white South and the North as plans for Reconstruction took place. Kate Stone's journal entry provides a look into the Southerners' identity as Confederate defeat became a reality. Kate represents the insecurity of the Confederates as they experienced a period of mourning and remembrance at the end of the Civil War. Kate Stone's reflection of Lincoln's death, Lee's surrender and the emancipation of slaves was her way of trying to reason with news from the battle front.

Furman delivered a speech for opening convocation on the anniversary of Johnson Female Seminary in August of 1850.  He addressed the crowd of students with the words, \"women's sphere lies within the limits of private life. Home is the true scene of her influence.\"  He stressed the meaning of women as mothers, mistresses, advisors, physicians, judges, and educators.  James Furman advised the women of the college to take full advantage of their education at the seminary in order to become better mothers for the future generation. He also, mentioned his fears of women in the public sphere of a man's world.  He believed women did not belong in places like an autonomy class or the rough atmosphere of poll boxes around voting time.  Religion was applied generously to the advice he gave women on their duties. He challenged women to use the Bible as, \"the true Lady's Book,\" to maintain virtue and honesty, instead of finding merit in aesthetic assets, like beauty and the comforts of luxury.  James encouraged the students to \"cultivate habits of neatness and order,\" so that it would better the skill sets they would require for God's design.  He finished his speech by reminding the young woman of the seminary to use the influence of a woman to demonstrate the goodness of God and to set Christian examples for their future husbands. ","        James C. Furman's address to the students of Johnson Female Seminary indicated the view of women in the mid-nineteenth century as a companion to men and a devoted mother.  J.M.C. Breaker, another minister in the neighboring county of Greenville agreed, when he addressed the domesticity of the home and the role of women as \"angels of mercy\" in his speech for the Greenville Baptist Female College in 1858. Christianity provided the foundations of this concept as the secular world became a place for men to leave the home and pursue occupations separate from home life.  Women were to carry the ideology of goodness, purity, and the humanity of men, by their behavior in private and public life.  ","      When Furman mentions the Bible as a \"lady's book\" he is associating God's word to a lady's journal.  Popular in the day, women's magazines were used to demonstrate correct manners, give advice on child rearing, and to guide women through their daily chores as caretaker and submissive companions.  Lady's journals, like <em>Godey's Lady Book</em> provided women with stories of romance and duty, much like the bible would provide the spiritual guidance women needed.  Rev. Furman implies that even though beauty and dress is important, the basic values of goodness are better.","      In the speech, Furman states that he would be shocked to discover a woman in a classroom or in any realm of public life.  A year earlier, in 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman in the United States to graduate from medical school.  By August in 1850, several revolutionary women had taken steps to improve education and missionary work.  Public opinion circulating during this time deemed the pursuit of a career by a woman was an act of aggression. Intellectual training was ill suited for the poor, frail mental and physical design of a woman.  ","      Even though, the aim of altering women's education toward better intellectual standards was slowly evolving in the United States, the students of Johnson Female Seminary were being groomed for the life of a plantaintion mistress.   James C. Furman's speech is an example of the nineteenth century values that restricted women's right toward higher means of learning.  Action came though, in the next ten years women's colleges and seminaries would instruct female students as teachers.

The work also coincided with an outline for a female educational institution near Columbia, South Carolina.  Marks' goal was to create a school that prepared women for their role in society as wives and mothers, whose duty it was to educate their children on values and morals.  ","In his report, Marks conveys his own ideas about the place of women in society, and he believed that place was at the head of the household.  In order for women to reach their potential in these roles, Marks stressed the importance of cultivation of the mind through education.  He believed that parents were the source of morality and virtue for their children, and in order to raise children with upstanding morals, it was important to educate young women through virtuous instruction.  Marks pointed out that, as a mother, \"How many principles of right and wrong to inculcate and point out; how many maxims of wisdom to exemplify; how many prejudices to remove; how many obscurities and apparent contradictions, to unravel and explain; how much infantine cunning, sophistry, and casuistry to detect; and how necessary is it, in all these, that her own actions should illustrate the principles which she advances.\"  Marks saw education as necessary to instill in women virtue and piety, so that in turn, women could educate their own families on the same ideas.  Women were educated, not for their own benefit, but for the purpose of raising more virtuous children who would become admirable citizens in society.  ","Margaret Nash notes that in the 1820s, literature began to split the world into two different spheres - one for males, and one for females.  The female worldview became known as the \"cult of domesticity,\" meaning that the literature assigned women to the roles of the home, and also associated values of piety and morality with them.  Women of that time had only limited occupational opportunities, but, faced with unstable economic conditions, women had to prepare themselves to provide for a family on their own.  In response, women began seeking education that not only provided them with the knowledge of how to run a home, but also afforded them the necessary knowledge to find and keep a job.  Excluded from most colleges and universities, women turned to educational institutions such as seminaries, academies, and high schools.  These schools provided women with an education very similar to the education men received at the college level, and gave them an opportunity to obtain jobs, provide for themselves, and not be completely reliant on men to provide for their needs.

Godey's enormously successful <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> set the standard for the American magazine and monthlie publishers throughout the mid 19th century.  His ingenious marketing techniques as noted by historian John Tebbel set the standard for magazines by 1850.  The market appeal of <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> contributed to the rising realization that women were a marketable audience and Louis Godey's brainchild spurned the rise of a wave of impersonators such as <em>Peterson's Ladies</em> and <em>Ladies' Wreath</em>.  The magazines greatest contribution was to the evolution of fashion and its careful documentation of the latest styles.  As a result of increased subscriptions, the transformation of the monthlie to the magazine took place in order to sell more copies and increase profit; Godey's Lady's Book was one of the last to convert into a true magazine as Louis Godey preferred his original creation to the new low quality productions.  The method of payment for contributors was also unique to Godey's enterprise at first; Godey would not pay undistinguished writers for their contributions as his magazine would likely launch an unknown into fame.  Godey would then pay well known authors such as Nathaniel Willis a hefty paycheck to write regular entries that readers came to expect.  Another cost cutting revolution that Godey exploited was the use of advertisements which served two purposes; the initial being that he had a subsidized product, and his readers had a seemingly \"larger\" magazine to read.  As one of the first magazines to use advertisements, Godey risked making his publishment appear to be cheap; but by not lowering the price it made the magazine keep its' glamorous appeal.  The <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> employed the same strategy as well for several years prior to the Civil War.","                Not only did the structure of the modern magazine gain inspiration from Godey but so too did the content matter.  The most important subject piece that historian look to now for insight into the period are the hand tinted fashion plates that accompanied each issue of the magazine.  Carefully detailed and researched, these plates were to provide an image to the reader of how she should look in the latest fashionable dress.  Godey claimed in 1850 that he had 150 women working out of their homes to paint by hand these fashion plates, and the color was often left to the artists' decision.  This played off well for Godey by explaining that then readers should compare each others' fashion plates and decide then what color would be best for the clothing.  By comparing the fashion plates over the years, the evolution of women's dress can be traced throughout the 18th century from <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em>.  Additionally the fashion plates became more expansive through the decades, indicating more interest in fashion due to cheaper and more readily available clothing to buy.  ","The subjects contained in Godey's Lady's Book were also revolutionary in its inclusion of fiction in the form of short stories.  Authors such as Edgar Allen Poe got early starts in their early careers by writing short pieces for Godey's Lady's Book and reached a large audience.  Louis Godey realized as well that a magazine was not just a literary journal and as such should provide the reader a diverse array of subject material.  As a result women across the country were provided the latest monthly updates on music, dance, politics, and art; each copy complete with engravings, paintings, and eventually photos.  The use of artwork and pictures to compliment the literature was a transformative concept that became the norm for magazines by 1850.  Such techniques caused Godey's Lady's Book to become so successful that Godey copyrighted the magazine in 1845 in an attempt to prevent duplications.  ","                The Civil War marked the decline of the magazine market for several years simply due to the loss of consumers; the South made up the majority of Godey's customers.  By the time of Godey's death in 1878, his namesake was nearly in the same condition.  Even copying other magazines \"ten cent\" strategy in 1893 worked to no avail and the magazine finally ceased to exist in 1898.  <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> impact on the magazine industry helped to transform pleasure reading in 19th century America by establishing the standard format for magazines."],"display_date":"January 1, 1830 - January 30, 1898","search_date":"1864-01-16","locations":[{"id":11227,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4311,"title":"Boston&#39;s Predicament: Women in the City\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-08-18","end_date":"1889-08-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["According to the Boston Daily Globe of August 18, 1889, \"Too Good to Lose Are Boston's Surplus Women.\" This article pertains to a matter of utmost importance, the eligible bachelors of the Wild West heroically discovering a solution for the \"marriageable femininity\" and the \"confoundly delicate matter\" of the over 80,000 surplus of women in Massachusetts. Belle Eyre even reports that these men are so \"self-sacrificing that they would solve the problem by marrying the whole 80,000.\" Belle Eyre also graciously published a letter, in the form of a poem, from ten dressmakers sending their solitude to the gentlemen of Tacoma Washington for the \"lovely life in that far-off part of this great and glorious land,\" and promising to \"Olympia there, ere summer does close,\" all with the post script \"We are all white women.\" ","Perhaps, though, the real heart of the matter comes towards the end of Belle Eyre's investigation when Gov. Andrew of Oregon expressed his views on the matter. Should women be \"driven to the competition of the market force with men, or where men are left unsolaced by the presence of women, society is alike weakened and demoralized.\" Hence, should men continue to desire their place at the head of the households, they should take immediate action to curb this surplus of women, should these women get out of hand and act rashly, such as trying to secure their right to vote, or other such nonsense. Hon. M. M Cunniff says though he doubts there actually is any danger of a surplus of women in Massachusetts, he should be glad for there to be double their present number. In fact, he adds, he would willingly give women \"greater opportunities than they have now,\" but he doubts this is what they actually wants; he sees their personal missions as producing \"men, not measures.\" ","Sarah Deutsch, in her book Women in the City: Gender, Space and Power in Boston, 1870-1940, finds women's roles in Boston in the late 19th century to be quite different than Belle Eyre's account. She discovers that Boston women, in fact, were not merely passive women, looking for domestic roles and adventure out west as mothers and wives, but active women who deeply cared about staking a claim in their male-dominated city. These women insisted upon creating an urban space that could meet their needs as individuals, in a society, which historically, denied these interests. Through her accounts of women through all socioeconomic stratifications, Deutsch expresses how these women formed female associations, overcame ethnic and racial diversity, expanded all conventional boundaries, advocated for playgrounds and settlement houses, and crossed all gender boundaries to create their own city in the spirit of \"urban femininity.\" Deutsch's study of Boston, M.A. throughout this pivotal time period, displays a character of the Boston women who, unlike Belle Eyre's account in the Boston Globe, chose to invest their faith and determination within their city, to create a modern city that could, in deed, meet the needs of a gender whose opportunity for equality and respect had finally come.

It depicted four officers leading a miner through a large crowd of women.  In the picture some women held clubs that were raised in threatening positions, while the rest had faces that were contorted with rage.  Joseph Becker sketched this scene in Buchtel, a mining town in Hocking County, Ohio during the Hocking Valley Miners' Strike of 1884. Miners, women and men, from forty-eight mines in Hocking Valley arranged the strike in order to dispute high living costs and decreased wages.  The miners had hoped to expand their rights as a worker by means of peaceful demonstrations with the organized political support of the Knights of Labor.  Nine months later, the striking miners were unable to come to an agreed compromise with the mine operators and returned to the mines. "," The women of the Hocking Valley miners were a familiar image, which grabbed the publics' attention toward the miners' plight during the 1880s. Their struggle for economic balance and the stability of their employment could only be recognized, because of the image of working class mothers and wives engaged in a united front.  Hocking Valley Miners were not only assisted by the image of their fellow workers in <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>, but became connected through the family oriented association of the Knights of Labor.  This association was a national working class group that tried to end \"industrial capitalism\" by incorporating new ways to oppose unjust industrial policies.  The Knights of Labor was the first organized labor group to successfully attempted to change basic working conditions for all workers despite race , gender, position, age, and regardless of their experience. This large union would eventually assist the Hocking Valley mining families through two strikes during the 1880s. "," One of the biggest issues during these strikes was the rivalry of appearing levels in working class. Miners had been hired as individual groups, led by a selected manager. Most of the time family members would form a \"family system of production\". The necessity of many hands versus the few, children and women were part of the company.  This unit method allowed miners to work at an individual pace, but work was limited by the price of coal per ton. With the advancement of technology and the change in safety, job description changed the way workers were viewed as employees.  The emergence of the change between manual labor and skilled labor created a strained working force in the mines.  Wages and restrictions limited workers by age, gender, and skill sets, rather than the longevity of their employment. Job description was not a common term until the Knights of Labor and other Mining groups created the unity of workers.  No longer would miners receive the benefit of selected associates, but an organized layer of employees, based on their skills or experience. "," The sketch of the miners' women in Hocking Valley is an image that fueled the miners' progress toward the creation of a company that would unite under the protection of the United Mine Workers of America in 1890.  The image relays the importance of the labor union to the worker as standardizing the work force.  The uniqueness of the Hocking Valley Miner's Strike is that the workers' struggle was a family action.  Women were used by the newspapers to express the unfair working conditions and the poor pay of the Hocking miners.  Due to the efforts of the mining families in Hocking Valley and publicized notice in newspapers, miners succeeded in obtaining stable wages and equal opportunities, but the creation of the mining unions created a clear definition in skilled workers, manual laborers, and family working units."],"display_date":"October 25, 1884","search_date":"1884-10-25","locations":[{"id":10289,"lat":39.4969744596,"lng":-82.4791535659,"zoom":10,"place":"HOCKING, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4327,"title":"Women in 1888: Tariff Reformers and the Democratic Stronghold\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-07-31","end_date":"1888-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Mill Bill, with the support of women and the Democratic Party, hoped to reduce the tariff on wool, while simultaneously allowing for workers in the clothing industry to gain a better standard of living. According to the New York Times in July of 1888, there was \"a vast army of men and women and a few children in New York engaged in making clothes.\" Historically, the clothes industry had undergone many tariff protections. For instance, all the parts of a woman's dress or a man's suit were \"protected\" by astronomical tariffs: on such items as \"raw wool, the cotton yarn, the print cloth, the thread, the buttons, linings, trimmings and woolen cloth.\" The article, \"Clothes Makers and the Tariff,\" argued for the Mill Bill, a bill that would allow for laborers to enjoy higher wages and, consequently, a better and cheaper standard of living. This piece of legislation hoped to encourage these positive alterations by making wool \"free,\" like cotton, which already enjoyed freedom from large duties. ","    In 1888, cotton's rate of duty was approximately 40 percent, compared to the 69 percent experienced by the wool industry. The New York Times discovered that this increase in duty did not benefit the wage earners. Instead, it merely added to the profits of the companies. Meanwhile, there were large numbers of people smuggling foreign goods into the country, which only further increased the problems instilled by the current duty. The Mill Bill hoped to take positive actions to \"excel\" in the worldwide clothing manufacturing market, a foreign idea in the \"cloth making business\" in the late 19th century. Instead, countries such as England dominated in these areas because of the United States' high duties. ","    The factories, which should have been filled with the \"music of contented labor,\" were instead filled with the miserable sounds of the \"poverty-stricken.\" The introduction of the Mill Bill would allow factories to become happier places, with lower costs to the manufacturer and lower costs of materials. With the reduction of duties as proposed by this bill, the United States and New York City would be able to compete with foreign competitors, have happier employees, and extend the clothing market. ","    The sentiments expressed through both this article and the Mill Bill were supported by the women and the Democrat Party's campaign throughout 1888 and 1892. Women worked in these clothing factories in an 11:1 ratio of females to males, and shopping and consumerism had continually become a female duty. The Democratic Party and the tariff reform movement involved both working-class women and middle-class women, whose voices strove to be heard through the ballots of their husbands. The Democratic Party employed moral arguments for economic reforms as Democratic women argued that these tariffs were stealing incomes from hard-working families, and they blamed the Republicans for this insanity. Through reforms such as the tariff reform, women gained their political voice as they marched their husbands to the ballot boxes.

Soldiers usually sat in camp waiting for action as the winter months did not involve tremendous amounts of fighting. Second Lieutenant Robert Gould Shaw wrote home many times to his mother but also on Christmas Day 1861. His description of camp life and the lack of festivities for soldiers is just one example of the diluted Christmas spirit. This lack of elaborate celebration was a common experience for many Southerners such as both a soldier and his wife.","            Shaw told his mother that Christmas Eve and Day were just like any day within the last six months. There was little action and little reason to be joyous and celebrate. Other than a little snow at midnight the holiday just did not seem to be like a typical Christmas; there were no stockings hung, no songs sung, and Santa was nowhere to be seen. Shaw's account of Christmas and camp life seemed somber and relaxed. He seemed to be in good spirit and does talk of Santa cheerfully, but Shaw quickly softens this emotion with a somber observation; this remark is about the reality of war and the restrictions associated with life as a soldier. Shaw wrote, \"...I suppose no one ever had a better chance of seeing \"Santa Claus\"; but as I had my stockings on, he probably thought it not worth his while to come down to the guard-tent. I didn't see any of the guard's stockings pinned up outside their tent, and indeed it is contrary to army regulations for them to divest themselves of any part of their clothing during the twenty-four hour period.\" ","            Southern soldiers and their family life on Southern plantations also did not resemble the typical holiday atmosphere.  Although desperation and ersatz ruled the Confederacy during the Civil War, especially during holidays, a complete dissolution of the Christmas spirit did not occur. There are always exceptions; some families could afford the expensive gifts and meals while other soldiers and their families simply looked past the war-torn nation and found a brighter outlook with things that they could be thankful for. In an interview Ida Baker, commented on her recollection of Christmas during the war. She recalled the lack of luxuries, but remembered the spirit which kept themselves and their soldiers going; she said, referring to the women of the era, \"They never gave up and they never stopped making much with nothing.\" The woman always strived to keep their men happy both away during combat and at home following a tour of duty. Christmas for soldiers consisted of a lack of material 'necessities', but it most certainly did not lack its' full spirit."],"display_date":"December 25, 1861 - November 10, 1937","search_date":"1899-12-02","locations":[{"id":14210,"lat":38.6845288469,"lng":-78.1593262248,"zoom":10,"place":"RAPPAHANNOCK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4337,"title":"All She Wanted Was Elbow Room\n","course_id":3,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-07-10","end_date":"1861-07-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"All She Wanted Was Elbow Room\" was published in <em>The Rushlight, </em>a student literary magazine of Wheaton Female Seminary in Norton Massachusetts in 1861. The main characters Fannie North and Nancy South had extremely different views but the one characteristic they shared was their desire for change. The external image of two girls represented the divisive issue of slavery opinions in the north. Fannie North lived in a small cottage and longed for \"a larger and freer home\" in which to grow and be independent. Nancy South had plenty of room and the finest of all material goods, but she was always seeking more. Nancy was not content with her blessings and fortunes. Rather she chose to conquer land and impose her force on others. While \"quiet little Fannie North was [...] contenting herself faithfully living in her narrow sphere, till God should see fit to grant her more room, big Nancy South spread out broader than ever,\"  the desire for more room in which to expand herself only contributed to her selfishness. Fannie was saddened by her lack of freedom and wanted nothing more than to help herself and others enjoy free will. Her counterpart was unsympathetic and self-interested, wanting only what benefited her. The story ended with reassurance that \"Nancy's mansion is large and high, but on a sandy foundation\", her power was diminishing day by day. ","Opinions ran rampant during the Civil War which began in April of the publication year. Many northerners felt strongly that slavery was immoral and must be condemned. The portrayal of southerners as guided by financial and material gains rather than values began appearing in literature and propaganda. Carl Osthaus commented on southern deviance by saying they were all \"shiftlessness and exploitation was the rule to follow\". He believed this was why they failed to see the human side of slavery.  The <em>Rushlight</em> article articulates these images by creating Nancy South to be one-dimensional, \"elbow room to her would have been no blessing, unless obtained at somebody else's expense\".

Living the beginning of her life in New Orleans, she eventually moved with her family to northern Michigan where she first discovered her love of the theatre. By the age of eighteen she moved to New York to try her luck at being an actress and stage performer. In homage to Charlotte Cushman, her favorite performer, Harriet legally changed her name to Pauline Cushman. She later married Charles Dickinson, who was called away to fight for the Union in 1862. ","Cushman joined a theater company three months after her  husband left, that toured all across the South, spreading her name throughout the area. One evening after a performance in \"Union-controlled Louisville, Kentucky,\" Cushman was given a large sum of money to toast to Jefferson Davis. She complied, despite her love of the Union, and toasted her enemy. Cushman's theatre company, enraged with her trading allegiance for cash, fired her. Cushman was not phased, as she used her toasting opportunity to \"rub elbows\" with the Rebels. By doing so, she managed to gain their trust as a map and document transporter for the South, while secretly serving as a Union spy. ","According to the <em>Detroit Tribune</em> article <em>Miss Maj. Pauline Cushman, The Federal Scout and Spy</em> in May of 1864, Cushman's accomplishments were praised through journalist accounts of her dramatic escapes. Cushman was captured three separate times, two of which she managed to escape from. Of the second, Cushman was en route to Nashville, riding on the Hardin Pike, when two Confederate scouts grew suspicious of her and mounted her on horseback to bring back for sentencing. Quick on her feet, Cushman paid a slave ten dollars to invent a story of Union soldiers attacking to distract the Confederate scouts. When the scouts fled to check out the invading troops, Cushman escaped temporarily, only to be recaptured the following day. Her eventual capture while concealing Southern battle plans in her shoes and petticoats placed her in jail. By now, the sickly Cushman was sentenced to hanging upon notice of her recovery. Had it not been for the Union invading the Confederate town three days prior to her scheduled execution, Cushman might never have survived to pass along her stories. ","Upon her release, Cushman returned to New York to visit friends and family and to lecture those interested in her adventures.

She stated that men's genius was wasted on other scientific endeavors when they could have focused on inventions for domestic aid. She then noted that bread making was a women's science. However, this revelation was interrupted by a peddler who was trying to sell her linens. After inquiring on the size, price, color, and wear she sent the peddler away without purchasing the linens. She stated her disdain for peddlers, saying they were a waste of time. She then noticed that it was eleven and the market man had yet to arrive.

She concluded her account by stating that since they had a dinner guest, she was glad that she had prepared such a good dinner, and hoped it tasted as good as it looked.","     Historians suggest that in the nineteenth century the value of women's domestic labor had decreased. This change placed more value on a man's income than a women's domestic role. With these changes housewives learned to adapt by scavenging, shopping wisely, nursing the family, and becoming thrifty in order to stretch family income and improve economic security. However, this role was seen differently by many. With the addition of servants, such as maids and cooks, the women's role was no longer considered economically advantageous, but seen more as a pleasurable activity and a married woman's last attempts to preserve a way of life. This idea was not shared by all, as some women, like our author, saw their work as economically beneficial, as well as a source of pride.

One such story, about Union spy Pauline Cushman appeared in the <em>Valley Spirit </em>on June 8, 1864. Ms. Cushman was arrested by the Confederates, freed by the Northern troops and rewarded with the honorary title of Major in the United States army.","When the war began in 1861, Cushman resided in Cleveland, Ohio. She was, however, originally from New Orleans and of French and Spanish descent. She was an actress by profession and, as such, moved to Louisville, Kentucky where she continued to perform. In March of 1863, while performing at the Wood's Theatre, some paroled Confederate officers asked her to make a toast to the Confederacy. Because of her own loyalties to the North, she consulted with the local provost marshal who then asked her to become a spy for the Union. As such, she did offer the requested toast. She was then subjected to a mock arrest and dismissed from the theatre. She went to work, thereafter, at a theatre in Nashville where she was called to the headquarters of Confederate General Bragg. She first swore an oath to the Government of the United States of America and then proceeded to join the Cumberland Army.","Eventually, she had been caught by the Confederates and charged with being a Union spy in June 1864. In particular, she was questioned about her \"Yankee twang\" which she explained by the fact that she had been playing Yankee parts. She was threatened with hanging if the letters she had been found carrying proved her to be a spy.

A drawing of the \"new\" convent shows an elaborate building with elements of classical architecture consisting of a three story convent, orphanage and chapel. Designed by architectural firm Gurlie and Guillot, the convent was decorated with galleries, columns, and Baroque ornamentation. Facing the Mississippi river, it rivaled many of the surrounding plantation homes in both size and construction. ","Before the Ursuline nuns relocated to this new convent from their previous location in the middle of the French Quarter, they had been an important presence in the city of New Orleans for almost a century. They arrived from France in 1727 to establish a school for girls in what was then a French colony. They provided an education not only for white girls of the colony, but also for slaves, free girls of color, and Native American girls. In addition, the Ursulines ran an orphanage and a hospital. In the years immediately following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Ursuline nuns experienced several conflicts with both federal and city officials. One such conflict with the United States government concerning property ownership within the city, led the nuns to purchase property two miles outside New Orleans with the idea of moving. In 1819, the nuns experienced a different conflict: as New Orleans expanded, a closed off street going right through the convent compound had become an inconvenience to the public. In response, city officials decided to open this street to the public, despite protests from the Ursulines. This decision was what drove the nuns to sell some of their city property and to construct a new convent outside the city. The new location gave the nuns the ability to expand as well as the advantage of both being outside the jurisdiction of city officials and of being out of the way of city development.","The convent cost 83,172 to build, and the chapel was an additional 23,635, a total equivalent to about 2 million today. Emily Clark argues that by spending this much money to build an extravagant convent, the Ursuline nuns were making a statement as self-governing Catholic women in a Protestant country that valued a woman's submission to the authority of a husband. In an ironic repetition of the city's attempt to encroach on the nun's interests in favor of development, the 1824 convent was demolished in 1912 to make way for the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal linking the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain. At this time, the Ursuline nuns again moved their convent and their school, both of which are still in operation."],"display_date":"March 25, 1823 - September 1, 1824","search_date":"1823-12-12","locations":[{"id":5595,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4421,"title":"The Perfect Wife\n","course_id":17,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-04-01","end_date":"1837-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"A knowledge of domestic duties is beyond price to a woman.

According to the author, a good wife considered her work her department, and did it when it needed to be done, without consideration about when there was a convenient time for her.  The author also made clear that girls should start helping out when they were nine or ten years old, by washing cups and putting them away, dusting, and cleaning silver.  By age twelve, the author suggested girls should start superintending the house and cooking.  The best way to learn these chores, the author explained, was by doing them.","     Women in the nineteenth century were judged according to four cardinal virtues - piety, purity, submissiveness, and domesticity.  Those four virtues were supposed to be what gave a woman happiness.

Historian Barbara Welter, author of the article <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">The Cult of True Womanhood,</em> explained that \"the home was supposed to be a cheerful place, so that brothers, husbands, and sons would not go elsewhere in search of a good time.

Routine tasks like making beds and cleaning their homes gave women exercise and taught them patience.  Doing housework was also considered an art.  Welter quoted one source as saying, \"There is more to be learned about pouring out tea and coffee, than most young ladies are willing to believe.\"  Women were also expected to be proficient in a wide variety of needlework and in gardening.

Spitting and yelling at soldiers from the north and refusing to even acknowledge their presence in the streets, even when the soldiers were offering the women assistance. There were many hostile feelings between the north and the south that were not healed simply with the capture of the city into Union hands.  Although New Orleans had been captured without any blood being shed, the citizens of New Orleans still felt the sting of the hardships that their fellow confederates were enduring.  ","            With the end of the war many reformations began within southern cities, specifically, the role of women within the community. In the modern city, women had a place where they could gather together and find strength and support in numbers as well as have social and political achievements without the help of men.  In rural southern areas, it was more difficult for women to bond together and make changes, mainly because of a lack of numbers and because the rural women were too busy working their land and trying to make a living.  In the city during the war, women held jobs that men left behind when they went to fight.  When male soldiers returned, women had to return to their predominately domestic lives.  Northern troops began to occupy southern cities in order to make sure that they were reconstructing, and not re-enslaving the people the north had worked so hard to free.  Because only men served as soldiers during the war, women looked for ways to display their patriotism and support for the southern states in alternative manners.  Southern women in a way had more power than northern women because they still had a cause that they felt they had to depend, even though the war was lost. ","            In April of 1862, Major General Benjamin F. Butler and his troops were in charge of the occupation of New Orleans.  Butler describes in his autobiography that the men of the city of New Orleans did not interfere with the soldiers in any way.  However, whenever women of the city would come into contact with any of these Yankee soldiers, they would shoot them hateful glances, make derisive comments, and flee the area.  In the minds of these women, they were fulfilling the patriotic duties that they were denied when they were not able to serve as soldiers.  The women were hoping that their mistreatment of these soldiers would force the soldiers to retaliate, and therefore give the city of New Orleans a solid argument for expelling them.  ","            Soldiers were hesitant to arrest the young women in the street causing the ruckus, due to they fact that they were typically high-class women and a scene would be caused.  Also, the women clearly would have almost appreciated being arrested; so they would have even more of a reason to be indignant.  Since the northern soldiers did not know how to handle this criticism coming from southern ladies, Major General Butler issued an order instructing the soldiers how to deal with situations such as these.  He instructed his men to treat the rebellious women as if they were prostitutes.   ","            After Major General Butler issued this order, the insults immediately stopped.  Although women were willing to be arrested in order to express their \"patriotism\", they were not willing to be looked upon as prostitutes, or even as someone of a lower class.

After a tumultuous marriage and divorce to a Parisian nobleman, sensationalized in various newspapers, she returned permanently to her hometown and sought to transplant the culture and sophistication she had grown accustomed to in France to New Orleans' Vieux Carre by constructing two large red brick buildings flanking Jackson Square. Their most notable characteristic was the wrought-iron balcony and gallery that adorned the front, which soon fueled the city's appetite for floral ornamentation and become synonymous with French Quarter style. The city's leaders, so appreciative of her beautification efforts, exempted her from taxes on the apartments for twenty years. The elite of New Orleans saw Baroness Pontalba's apartments as a public service to the city that elevated New Orleans cultural standing and they wished to imitate it. The adoption by the wealthy of her philosophy of fulfilling civic duty through beautification projects  partially explains the uneven distribution of cast-iron work throughout the city – as the upper class' attempted to elevate their own neighborhoods to similar architectural status as those of their European contemporaries. With the construction of these apartments the Baroness Pontalba established herself as the epicenter of New Orleans culture and society","Both the Pontalba Apartments themselves and the woman responsible for their construction have left an indelible mark on New Orleans culture and architecture. Construction on these apartments began in 1848 and was completed by 1850. It was part of the renovation efforts, led by Baroness Pontalba, to transform the Place d'Armes from a dusty common area to the more regal Jackson Square, which could be regarded by locals as being on the same caliber as its French counterparts. These galleries and balconies became an architectural signature of the leisure class who, after finding commercial success, responded to the growing urbanization and New Orleans' tropical climate by carving out these semi-public, semi-private spaces for themselves.","            New Orleans society has always loved the theater, and the Pontalba apartments became the home of prominent performers of the day while its architecture provided a stage for the city. The Baroness, as the torchbearer of New Orleans society, invited many popular performers to the city, such as Jenny Lind, and graciously allowed them to reside in her apartments for the duration of their stay, reinforcing her cultural position and bolstering the reputation of her buildings. Yet the galleries on the Pontalba apartments also doubled as a side stage for the streets below. These galleries offered the residents a chance to both perform for the city as well as view the theater of the neighborhood. The streets of New Orleans became more than mere avenues for transportation, but scenes of the everyday pageant that passed by the onlookers up in the galleries. The galleries allowed for the commonplace encounters on the streets to be staged with the casual exhibitionism that would ultimately find its most extreme expression in the Madri Gras parades, highlighting the everyday dramas of New Orleans itself. There can be no mini-dramas without an audience, and the galleries of the Pontalba apartments provided the vantage point for that audience."],"display_date":"January 1, 1848 - January 1, 1850","search_date":"1848-12-31","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4456,"title":"Citizens Appeal to the White House to put an end to Lynching\n","course_id":19,"status":"P","start_date":"5/19/18","end_date":"5/19/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On the night of Thursday, May 16, 1918 assailants killed white farmer, Hampton Smith in his home and wounded his wife in Brooks County, Georgia.  The next night a white mob lynched two black men in conjunction with Smith's murder.  By Sunday a mob lynched two tenants of Smith, husband and wife, Hayes and Mary Turner, while another black man went missing, also believed to be involved in Smith's death. An earlier argument between Hayes Turner and Smith apparently led to the attack by Turner and several other black men (1).","Two weeks later certain Georgia women were compelled to write to President Woodrow Wilson regarding the slaying of Mary Turner in particular.  Women on behalf of the Savannah Chapter of the American Red Cross and the Colored Federated Clubs of Augusta began their letter, \"Mr. President: Whereas, the Negro Womanhood of Ga. has been shocked by the lynching of Mary Tuner at Valdosta Sunday May 19, 1918, for an alleged unwise remark in reference to the lynching of her husband\" and characterized themselves, \"discouraged and crushed by a spirit of humiliation and dread.\"  They asked that Wilson utilize his power and influence to prevent similar tragedies in the future and to reprimand the members of the mob (2).  Although their letters received no direct response, Wilson published a statement in the <em>Official Bulletin</em> two months later condemning mob violence.","Racial violence was not uncommon in the early 20th century and many calls for help to put an end to lynching or to punish white aggressors went unanswered.  The women who wrote to the President during this time were living in an especially racially tense environment: the first half of the 1900s was the height of Jim Crow segregation, black disenfranchisement, and mob rule.  The country was also occupied with the war in Europe and did not take much notice to the problems at home.  According to historian Sherrilyn A. Ifill, \"in communities where lynchings occurred, fear kept blacks mostly silent and compliant\" (3).  There were blacks, however, who rejected silence by contacting the President of their country.  These letter-writers used a variety of logic to convince the President to help them-they reasoned that they were loyal citizens living in fear and expected a respectable leader like Wilson to act on their behalf (2).  Some received responses from the U.S. Attorney General claiming that there was nothing the President could do because mob violence was a state issue.  Still, many black citizens felt the urge to convince Wilson to end the reign of terror occurring around them by showing him their loyalty to the US, the incessant fear in which they lived, and the futility of taking their concerns to their local governments."],"display_date":"May 19, 1918","search_date":"1918-05-19","locations":[{"id":17737,"lat":30.6383183286,"lng":-83.3264838731,"zoom":9,"place":"Brooks, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":60,"tag":"letters"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Race and Politics of Reconciliation","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":19,"school_id":1}},{"id":4470,"title":"Class Tensions Arise in the Markets of Hester Street","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-01-01","end_date":"1898-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"The true heart of the Lower East Side beat in the street,\" and Hester Street was no exception. It served as the hub of life in the Lower East Side – teeming with women shopping, children playing and peddlers manning their pushcarts full of food. While the tenements towered high above blocking out the sky, the streets were overrun with peddlers and their pushcarts and their female clientele milling about from cart to cart, bartering and looking for the best deal. Between 1880 and 1890 over 60,000 Jews inhabited the Lower East Side, and for them, the streets served as their community center, marketplace, and playground. Everything that Jewish immigrant families needed could be found in the markets and carts on Hester Street crowding the streets: groceries, books, and even house wares. Interaction, especially for Jewish women, in the markets of Hester Street was vital to their survival in the new American culture","Immigrant women in New York's lower East Side lived a decidedly different life than the progressive reforming women. The staunch lines drawn public and private space did not apply to everyday immigrant realities. The cult of domesticity promoted the virtues of women managing their private sphere docile passivity, By contrast, Jewish immigrant women of the Lower East Side readily and actively engaged in public life and the market economy. Some even operated their own pushcarts and stalls. The streets of the Lower East Side were more than mere thoroughfares and marketplaces a place for women to congregate, forge social networks, and exert their influence.","The active place that Jewish immigrant women held in public market life was at odds with the established American bourgeois ideals concerning women's roles and propriety. It was not uncommon for Jewish women to work in the markets, peddle goods, while also managing the fiscal affairs for the family. They were accustomed to these breadwinning roles from the old country. But though Hester Street closely resembled European street markets, the moral reformers did not approve. Instead, they saw the poverty of the Lower East Side as a sign of a moral failure on the part of the Jewish mothers. The reformers sought a regeneration of the immigrant population through the adoption of the reformer's own Protestant work ethic. Female social workers at the time, like those of Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago, did not see Jewish women's role in the market place as a way for these women to exercise their authority and autonomy. Rather they saw it as an example of idleness and chaos. They disapproved of women's participation in street life. The tension between the dueling views of a woman's place –connecting with the other immigrant women in the street versus acting solely as the queen of the household came to a head not in the first generation immigrant, but rather their daughters.

Oakes Smith, Abby Kelly Foster, and Lucretia Mott. The journalist observed that some of the women were \"giggly\" and \"snap at any man who proceeds to open his mouth about an issue.\" The self-promoting speakers encouraged the audience to \"cultivate their powers\" and to \"lift their voices;\" only then would they earn equal rights with men and gain suffrage. Advocates of themselves, the women fought for the right to a fair chance to prove their political and economic abilities. Abby Kelly Foster stated at the convention that \"no woman should marry who was not able to provide for her husband and family.\""," The first Women's Rights Convention was held in Seneca Falls, New York, in 1848. Elizabeth Cady Stanton presided over the convention, where the Declaration of Sentiments came into existence.

Progressive reformers believed that high infant mortality was linked to adulterated and infectious milk, a concern that remained even after New York passed regulation laws. On March 25, 1913, the Committee of Women's Organizations of the New York Milk Committee held a meeting to educate mothers living in the tenements of the Lower East Side on the importance of \"pure\" milk and of clean living areas. Dr. Lee W. Thomas, a member of the New York Milk Committee, encouraged the mothers to get milk from New York Health Department milk stations, to keep clean homes, and to influence their husbands to vote for the passage of pure milk bills, which were introduced to the New York Legislature by the Milk Committee. After Dr. Thomas spoke to the mothers, films were shown to illustrate the dangers of impure milk.","During the mid-nineteenth century, most of New York's milk supply came from \"swill\" milk stables attached to breweries and distilleries in the city. The cows in these stables ate the leftover grains from the fermentation process in the brewery or distillery. Unfortunately, the milk produced from these stables was very low quality and often full of bacteria. Even milk brought to the city from the country was often adulterated with water and carrying bacteria. In 1842, social reformer Robert Hartley published his <em>Essay on Milk</em>, which both praised milk as the \"perfect food\" and argued the importance of pure milk in New York City. Though New York City began to pass milk regulations in 1856, milk continued to be a concern for social reformers as a potential carrier of germs and diseases. Milk reform was part of a larger reform movement to regulate food, drink, and drugs, a movement that eventually resulted in the Federal Food and Drug Act of 1906, which made it illegal to adulterate or mislabel food or drugs. This put the power of information and choice in the hands of consumers, most of whom were women. Thus, even after this law was passed, social reformers felt impelled to guide tenement mothers in the importance of choosing good quality milk and keeping a clean home.","One of the means used by Progressive reformers, eager to use new technology, to preach cleanliness was moving pictures. Though this is an early instance of moving pictures being used as health propaganda, it is not the first. Three years before this meeting, Thomas Edison made a series of health propaganda films for the Tuberculosis Association. Whether or not the New York Milk Committee was aware of Edison's use of film, they obviously recognized the \"universal appeal\" of film and its potential as an educational device."],"display_date":"March 24, 1913","search_date":"1913-03-24","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":68,"tag":"Progressive Reformers"},{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":72,"tag":"Food Regulation"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4640,"title":"Sexist Laws: Are Prostituion Laws Sexist?","course_id":22,"status":"P","start_date":"8/30/74","end_date":"8/30/74","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1974, the city of Birmingham, Alabama prostitution ordinance survived the first challenge in court.

Her greatest achievement came when she supplied Confederate General Pierre G.T. Beauregard with information concerning Union movements before the first major encounter of the Civil War. Her information helped secure the Confederate victory at the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861. Confederate President Jefferson Davis later acknowledged Greenhow for her loyal service.","     Union authorities apprehended Greenhow during the first year of the war.

Five months later, Greenhow was released with the stipulation that she be exiled to the South. Once released, Greenhow boarded a blockade runner to Europe, where she continually tried to raise support for the Confederacy in both London and Paris. In 1864, Greenhow left her daughter in a convent and decided to return to America. Her ship, the <em>Condor</em>, sailed for North Carolina but ran aground trying to escape a Union gunboat patrolling the blockade. On September 30, Greenhow boarded a lifeboat, hoping to reach shore.

The goal was to help others, specifically women, appreciate their business skills and embark in professional careers. Though many women were reluctant of this new initiative to help motivate women into entering the business world, for many, the exhibit worked as a reminder that they can succeed. During this time there was major controversy surrounding the issue of women taking on professional roles outside of the home. On the other hand, many exhibitors believed that this was only the beginning to a great balance between the social and domestic power of women.  By entering the business sphere, women were becoming more thrifty housekeepers, enhancing their role as mother’s and wives. The idea that women <em>can</em> fulfill her duties within the home, while still maintaining her experiences in business, proved to society that women could actually “do it all.”","In the book, <em>Learning to Stand and Speak</em>, by Mary Kelley, she focuses on the “big picture” between the relationship of women and education. The piece reflects on womens entrance into education and their external influences in achieving teaching careers. Though this might have been seen as a positive shift towards gender equality, in reality, women were still given many limitations; their futures were pre-destined even upon entering college. The women seminaries considered that education would be for the women’s own good, preparing them as intellectuals. While this was a step forward in women’s rights, this was only useful for the intellectual advancement of <em>white </em>women during that era. <em>African American</em> women were not participating in the usage of such educational resources. Rather, they were excluded for reasons of not “belonging” to a certain class or race. The seminaries were structured from the curriculum males followed, though it did not serve justice for the women. The all women seminaries began to take shape during the early 1980’s, when more classes were being offered within the science and language field (specifically Latin).","When thinking about the role of female educational institutions during these times, women were asking questions such as, <em>what subjects will the seminaries cover? What are the career objectives for the women who attend such institutions?</em> Rather than expanding the career opportunities for women, these seminaries, though preparing women for civil society, created barriers between women and the professional world. As the first reading suggested, exhibits such as the one created by the League of Business and Professional Women, encouraged women to follow the business path. Meanwhile, the seminaries were not providing such opportunities for all women. The real question lies whether <em>all</em> women, regardless of race or class-status, were receiving a <em>fair</em> education.

She wondered how women were considered for government positions and how it affected the ideals of marriage. Thoughful questioned for example, a woman named Elizabeth Bartlett. Since she ran for office for the Register of Deeds, Bartlett created her own independence through the public sector. With this individualism, would it be necessary to get married? And if so, where would her position lie, within her own power or her husband’s? Would she not be able to get married because of the laws that prohibit women from enforcing laws? Miss Thoughtful had many questions concerning the current image of a republican women and how they were allowed to be represented in the public sphere.","During the 1800’s, the question as to where women belonged in society was difficult to answer. Women had the rights to dower, ensuring the wife some kind of income if the husband dies. However, females had no full power over land and important belongings which created a disempowerment for them publically. Schloesser discusses women’s position in society in her novel <em>The Fair Sex</em>. The fact that women could receive administrative power over land but not fully own it, further questions what happened when women became candidates for occupations containing legal power. Since women were represented through their husbands, women such as Elizabeth Bartlett, created a “potential” dependent that questioned women’s positions. The divide between single women’s rights and married women allowed confusion between the public and private spheres. Single women, like Bartlett created an opening for women in society that other women, such as Thoughtful were unaware of.","With Susan Thoughtful’s questions about women’s place in society, she introduced how the candidacy of Miss Bartlett in the Register of Deeds raised the question concerning women’s power. Thoughtful brought up how one position could raise women into power in the Senate, the Supreme Court and other important places in government. Since the difference in male and female education was thinning out by the mid 1800’s, the question where these intellectual women were to be placed in society became crucial. Life in the public and private sector needed adjusting, and Susan Thoughful had the readers of <em>The Euterpeiad </em>become aware."],"display_date":"March 2, 1822","search_date":"1822-03-02","locations":[{"id":6206,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":41,"school_id":2}},{"id":4831,"title":"Modesty versus Fashion: Nineteenth Century American Women’s Dress","course_id":41,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-01","end_date":"1836-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In an 1836 lifestyle manual for women, entitled <em>The Young Lady’s Friend</em>, John Farrar outlined the expectations for an American Christian women’s behavior in a particular chapter entitled <em>Dress a Test of Character</em>. In this chapter he discussed the appropriateness and significance of a nineteenth century women’s dress in relation to how she was viewed by society. According to Farrar, “Christian principles prevailed…and the more truly will dress be an indication of [a woman’s] character.” Early Republican society was based upon religious and moral duty and it was imperative for a domestic woman to “cover [her] body” unlike “the clumsy and inconvenient garments of the savage, [that] are attributed to his ignorance of the domestic arts.” The proper way to clothe oneself was seen as a symbol of civility, but a thin line existed between clothing for the sake of “covering the body” and clothing as fashion that was perceived as less appropriate. Farrar looked down upon the idea that clothing should not merely be a modest covering for the body and this was illustrated in an excerpt from the chapter: “What can be said in excuse for the civilized man when…the wavy lines of a female form are disguised under a stiff circle of whalebone.” Farrar referred to a popular trend in Parisian dress known as the hoop-skirt, which was seen as provocative and vain because it modified the female body shape, and therefore removed the nineteenth century Christian woman’s virtuosity.","According to Barbara Welter’s <em>The Cult of True Womanhood</em>, an early nineteenth century, Christian woman’s gender identity was prescribed to her by the males of society. Within this gender prescription a woman was expected to consider “religion and piety [as] the core of [her] virtue, the source of her strength”. This point is supported in Farrar’s manual when he explained that a domestic, pious woman should take pride in her appearance by covering her body appropriately. A religious woman could not be considered a virtuous member of society if she indulged in vanities, these being material goods and the modification of the appearance through dress.","Nineteenth century women were expected to withhold moral standards by sporting the conventional style of a long simple frock, by making sure no skin from her ankles to her neck was exposed, and by presenting herself in a tidy and presentable manner by doing her hair up. These conventions of dress were expected of a virtuous Christian woman because the way she dressed reflected her religious ideals. Although many wealthy women dressed with “pink ribbons on their bonnets and blue shawls on their shoulders, while their hands display yellow gloves and green bags,” the devout and modest Christian woman was required to fulfill her simple principles of dress without indulging in the vanities of ornamentation and embellishment."],"display_date":1836,"search_date":"1836-07-01","locations":[{"id":6207,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"},{"id":430,"tag":"clothing"},{"id":431,"tag":"dress"},{"id":432,"tag":"virtue"},{"id":433,"tag":"good wife"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":41,"school_id":2}},{"id":4864,"title":"Birth Control","course_id":31,"status":"P","start_date":"8/18/68","end_date":"8/18/68","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the <em>Fayetteville Observer</em> on Sunday August 18, 1968, the paper noted that a Russian man came up to a Westerner and asked him for some birth control pills for his wife.  Normally, a man would ask for whisky or chewing gum, but this time it was different, and the request took the Westerner by surprise.  The reason he asked for birth control pills was because there was a housing shortage in Russia and many couples had to avoid pregnancy.  “In addition to a lack of birth control pills, Soviet couples say they face a shortage of such other means as intrauterine devices, and experience problems with chemical preparations including on which causes a painful burning sensation,” the paper noted.","Historian Elaine Tyler May has addressed the importance of birth control and family planning to the United States during the Cold War.  “Throughout the 1950s,” she noted, “proponents of contraception continued to promote it as a means of controlling fertility abroad and spacing children at home.” In 1968, Russians had some sort of contraception, though they were not always safe.  Birth control was a wide-spread movement, but there were not enough pills for all Russians.  “Because of these problems a Muscovite says, most women use the rhythm method. If that doesn’t work, they get an abortion,” reported the <em>Fayetteville Observer</em>.","Abortion had never been an issue that is taken lightly, even now in the twenty-first century. May stated, “advocates of family planning endorsed contraception, but drew the line at abortion.  Unlike contraceptives, which were promoted as a means of strengthening the family, abortion was considered a threat to sexual morality and family life.  While contraception was the reward for the virtuous, abortion was the punishment for the immoral.”","The baby boom was a big part of American life; in the 1950s people had children to be happy.  May stated, “a major study conducted in 1957 found that most Americans believed that parenthood was the route to happiness.  Childlessness was considered deviant, selfish, and pitiable.”  If Americans thought of having children as the route to happiness, then the Russian’s should have felt the same way, even though they had a housing shortage.  The baby boom contradicted many social views on the birth control issue and family planning.  Other countries were not as fortunate as the United States during the 1950s, making birth control and family planning the only smart option for other countries. May stated, “the war gave rise to the first direct connections between the American birth control movement and population control abroad.”  Russians had many children, and were not considered “deviant or selfish” for choosing birth control, because they were just not economically equipped to house many children.  Birth control would be the best method for family planning during the Cold War for Russians.","In conclusion, Russians had a hard time controlling pregnancy because of a shortage of birth control contraceptives.  The housing shortage made it even harder; families often had to share apartments.  If they used the rhythm method and failed, they were looked at as a bad person if they got an abortion.  If everyone could have been on some type of birth control pill or have safer contraception then Russians would not have experienced the housing shortage and family planning would have been a success."],"display_date":"August 18, 1968","search_date":"1968-08-18","locations":[{"id":33963,"lat":35.0485350444,"lng":-78.8273232021,"zoom":9,"place":"Cumberland, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":481,"tag":"birth control"},{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"African-American History from 1863 to the Present","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":31,"school_id":9}},{"id":4960,"title":"Boston Suffragists Celebrate Their Efforts","course_id":27,"status":"P","start_date":"9/22/20","end_date":"9/22/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 22, 1920, the women of Boston took to the streets for a “victory parade” to celebrate the “happy ending to a ‘long fight and a good fight’.” Four hundred strong, they wore dark clothing and hats; with the exception of 37 women, who were dressed in white clothing, wore blue streamers and carried the name of each state that had passed the Suffrage Amendment. Seven automobiles carried guests of honor, officials of state suffrage associations, and prominent suffragists who led the parade of women. By 1920, American women had finally succeeded in their long and hard fight. Beginning in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York at the Women’s Rights Convention, suffragists engaged in a seventy-two year long struggle; finally concluding their efforts with the ratification of the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment in 1920. With the passing of this amendment, the United States became the twenty-seventh nation to grant women the right to vote.","Suffragist leaders worked at creating associations, holding conventions, and organizing movements to dispute the laws that granted only men the right to vote. The suffrage movement appealed to a broad population including mothers, workers, professionals, and reformers. In the early years of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, women who were part of the first generation of educated professional women joined the movement to push for full citizenship of women. Women from all over the United States worked hard to achieve their right to vote. Massachusetts suffragists created their own organization called the Massachusetts Women Suffrage Association, which after 50 years of activity and the ratification of the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment became the Massachusetts League of Women Voters. ","The parade ended at Faneuil Hall where more than 1,000 noisy, enthusiastic, and happy people were crowded into the hall awaiting speeches that were given by the leaders of suffragist associations. These women spoke to the crowd about their victorious efforts and the positive effects that their achievements would have in the future. Mrs. Maud Wood Park explained her experiences in Washington as she watched Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby, sign the suffrage proclamation. She also challenged the audience that each and every Massachusetts women must not act upon their right to vote and also must cast their votes intelligently. Park made it clear that a long and hard fight had been battle in order for women to achieve suffrage and that those women must exercise their right to vote because their votes had the weight to make a difference.","Sadly, shortly after the ratification of the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment, women’s solidarity and feminist organizations began to crumble. The early 20<sup>th</sup> century marked a time where both external and internal influences within the women’s movement affected its actions. The exploitation by the media of women’s sexuality and the votes cast by women at the polls were factors that led to the decline of the women’s movement. Women did not vote for females who ran for office, and therefore this caused a decline in the power that women had the chance to hold. Females were so insistent on becoming a part of the male world of sex, professionalism, and politics that they became distracted.","The fight for women’s suffrage was a continuing struggle, consuming vast amounts of time and effort of the women who took part. Massachusetts suffragists celebrated their efforts by way of a parade through the streets of Boston, making it known to the public that their extensive efforts had finally paid off. The parade was a an event that showed that the public came to accept the newly applied laws that granted women full citizenship and the same rights that men had. The Massachusetts suffragists who participated in the parade made it visible to the citizens of Boston that they had successfully completed a battle that had been in progress for over seventy years. The parade signified the ending of the efforts of the women’s movement, which was too bad because sadly the feminist organizations collapsed due to lack of support after the ratification of the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment."],"display_date":"September 22, 1920","search_date":"1920-09-22","locations":[{"id":21126,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":10,"place":"Suffolk, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":170,"tag":"suffrage"},{"id":591,"tag":"Laws"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History: New York, New York","school":"Stonehill College","course_id":27,"school_id":22}},{"id":4963,"title":"An Influx of Irish Immigrant: Young Women arrive in New York","course_id":27,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-01-01","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The woman from Ireland looked around the chaos on Ellis Island visibly upset, as the immigration officials accused her of giving them the wrong name of the person picking her up.  Migrations to the United States “did not always occur without problems or disruptions and occasionally the colleen arrived with no one to greet her.”[1]  On April 30, 1897, The New York Times published an article that focused on the influx of immigrants from Ireland.  The ultimate goal of these immigrants was to find work that paid a decent salary and offered better opportunities than the jobs available back home.","While the workers at Ellis Island extolled the “promise of better times in this country”, numerous Irish women faced fear and confusion upon arrival.  When it came to immigration, a great deal of the chaos was due to the miscommunication or misinformation exchanged between individuals.  “Immigrants frequently failed to find one another because they constantly changed residencies, expecially if they were poor, and because Irish women continued using their maiden names after marriage.”[2]  In the 1897 newspaper article, a woman named Cassidy was looking for a lady named Maggie Molloy, but was told that her name was not on the list.  Maggie Molloy’s name was in fact on the list, however due to the miscommunication, Cassidy was very upset.[3]  Events like this were not uncommon, and this is what caused much of the confusion on Ellis Island.","The Irish invaded America by the thousands from the late 1800’s into the early 1900’s. Much of the incentive to leave Ireland was due to the unfavorable living conditions in the Irish countryside According to the Irish who remained in Ireland, many of the women were frustrated by the male dominated agricultural society and had left their homes in hopes of finding luck in the United States.  These oversea journeys were life threatening, but foreigners were willing to take a chance.  To the immigrants, anything was better than what they were leaving back home.[4]","A portion of the women immigrating to the United States via Ellis Island had their voyages paid for by other relatives already living in America; however, it was not uncommon for the father to emigrate first, earn money, and then send it back home to pay for his other family member’s voyages or for a family to emigrate as a group or for single members to travel alone.","These girls faced many difficulties in America, due to the fact that they were uprooted from their homes in Ireland.  Previously, these Irish women were accustomed to working around the house and caring for others, but life in America was going to be much different.  Once the young women arrived, they needed to begin to search for work immediately.  Coming from an area where most people were agriculturalists, their transition to an area in the heart of New York City was drastically different from their familiar surroundings.","Of all the different groups of immigrants, Irish women were of the greatest amount.  This difference was due to the “emergence of the modern Irish family structure”  With the newly evolving land and family forms that were coming about, there was a decrease in the number of children emigrating.  Between the years of 1852 to 1921 the median age for female immigrants was 21.2 years old.  This age was “younger than the median age of marriage”, and therefore explains the reason why so many of the immigrants got married upon arriving in America.[5]","“Emigration was the end of peasant live in Europe; it was also the beginning of life in America”.[6]  Ireland depended on their crops for survival, and therefore life was miserable at home for many of the Irish families.  Providing for everyone became difficult, and as a result many Irish left their familiar hometowns to start a new life in America.  The decision to come to America marked a huge milestone in an individual’s life, because they were leaving their native land and putting their lives at risk. Assimilating to life in America was not going to be easy, and immigrants needed to be taught about the way of life in America."," ","[1] Diner, Professor Hasia R.. \"The Search for Bread: Patterns of Female Migration.\" In <em>Erin's Daughters in America: Irish Immigrant Women in the Nineteenth Century (The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science)</em>.

Emerging in the early 1900s, it expressed women's opinions about social, economic, and political aspects of life in the rural New England town of Beverly Massachusetts. The women writers of the newspaper, <em>The Beverly Beacon</em>, expressed the fears they had for their children, gender inequality and the political, social and economic concerns of everyday women. They urged their readers to \"wake up and be more alive\"[i] to the needs of their communities, and encouraged other women to get more involved in public life.","   The early 1900s witnessed new voices in the cry for women's rights. Publications like the Beacon, made the public aware of women's political voice, a voice previously muted by male dominant media. However, while the <em>Beacon's</em> articles address issues important to their readers, they walk the fine line between acknowledging women's equality and campaigning for political change. For example, the editors claim that there is no need for a political section in their newspaper because they \"are neither Republican, Democratic, nor Progressive;in fact we care very little about politics and the chief aim of women is to get things done. It is not party nor principle nor platform but performance that counts in the forum of the home.\"[ii] However, the editors did include articles about the fight for women's suffrage and the need for advancement in political society. As one article noted: \"There is no good reason why women should not\"[iii] vote as an American citizen born with the same unalienable rights as a man. The Declaration of Independence of the American nation proclaims that all men are created equal, and \"if the term men is used figuratively, meaning the human family as comprising both men and women, then our present form of government is in flat contradiction of that time honored document.\"[iv] With its common vision of equality for women, <em>The Beverly Beacon </em>and similar publications helped create awareness of women's problems and concerns while advocating for women's voting rights. As one scholar noted, papers like the <em>Beacon</em> were a \"chance to help women see their own problems, help bring out the things that are true in the traditions that have bound them; help show up the things that are false.\"[v] The publication of <em>The Beverly Beacon</em> initiated the rise of women's voice in the New England area by creating an impenetrable bond between mothers, sisters, daughters, and friends. The publishers of <em>The Beverly Beacon</em> will be remembered as activists whose voices were carried across the nation, as the messages issued by women artists and writers \"appealed to universal principles of humanity and foresaw a new social era accompanying women's participation in politics.\"[vi]","[i] <em>The needs of the girls of Beverly, </em>Mary E.

The traditional commencement ceremony and distribution of diplomas was held in the college’s Presbyterian Church. Within the hour before the ceremony began the Church was filled to maximum capacity. The audience present at the ceremony, who witnessed the historical moment, consisted of family members and friends of members of the graduates, faculty members, residents of the city of Geneva, and the guest speakers. Historian Wendell Tripp notes a significant factor pertaining to the attendance on this day was the abundance of women present. One of these women, Miss Margaret Delancey, revealed the details she observed during the ceremony in a letter to her sister-in-law Josephine M. Delancey dated January 29, 1849. When Blackwell was called upon to receive her diploma, Delancey said she appeared both humbled and embarrassed by the enthusiastic applause of all present. In the Commencement speech given by Dr. Charles A. Lee, Delancey wrote that “he alluded in a dignified manner to the fact that one of the present class was female, complimented the sex generally and Miss. B in particular and told us that she was fully qualified to practise as a physician and that the degree was fully merited.” The reactions of the ordinary people who were present to witness such an extraordinary event, demonstrates the intrigue and interest that surrounded Blackwell, a woman, being the recipient of such recognition.","The ultimate historical significance of the Elizabeth Blackwell’s graduation from Geneva Medical College reflects the changing ideologies surrounding woman in the middle of the nineteenth- century specifically in the state of New York.

The young women who donned these sophisticated ornaments made great strides, not only on pen and paper, but in history.           ","As a female student in Greenville just after Reconstruction, it was a time of recovery and rebirth and there was a decided need for innovative change.  Improvements in general, but markedly in education, were occurring throughout the south and The Female College of Furman University was no exception.  Elected president of the school in 1878, Alexander Sloan Townes saw this need and acted on it.  He suggested to one of his faculty members, Mary Judson, to start a literary society for the young women.","A dedicated and disciplined teacher in the classroom and caring friend without, Judson eagerly accepted the task and in September of 1878 she called a meeting of all students who boarded at the school, initially asking them to write essays to be read aloud to their peers.  Students who boarded were obligated to join the society, but in its first year almost all of the students became members.  The women’s essay topics were indicative of their high level of intellect.  The society grew in popularity and size, meeting every two weeks to debate current topics and to present a few of the students’ readings, among other things.  All of the school’s faculty members were present at meetings, and at every meeting the <em>College Mirror</em>, the society’s newspaper, was read.  The paper included humorous tidbits and gossip, but updates and submissions of a more serious nature were also to be found.  For instance, the girls shared their dislike of the option to graduate early, insisting that there were many things that a girl would miss having only completed two years of higher level education.  Also, Mary Judson herself submitted works every now and then, at one time calling for a change of the school’s name.  She asserted that “female” was inhibiting and incorrect and that something like the “Greenville College for Young Women” would be more appropriate.  To add to its accomplishments, the society also began a college library.  It is no wonder women took pride in their association with the organization and displayed their gold pins proudly. ","The Judson Literary Society pin symbolized an active participation in a group that was challenging the limits, aware of improvements in female education and opportunity and ready and willing to utilize these, beginning at Furman, but ready to go out into the world and call women everywhere to do the same thing.  This seemingly small start is one of many that led to the development of women’s agency and voice in today’s world."],"display_date":1884,"search_date":"1884-07-01","locations":[{"id":11537,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENVILLE, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":289,"tag":"Art/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5010,"title":"Women Soldiers in the Civil War","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-03-29","end_date":"1863-03-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Union and Confederate uniforms were symbols of purpose and bravery for the soldiers who wore them, but for some they were merely a disguise. Over 4 million people fought in the Civil War, whether recruited or serving as volunteers. Among those who served were approximately 400 women disguised under male aliases. Among these 400 documented women was Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, a member of the 153rd Regiment. The entire collection of Wakeman's letters sent home while on duty survived and offers one of the best representations of war time experiences for women.","Wakeman's letter was littered with concern over money. She declared that she received $13 per month and would help pay her father's debts. There were several motivations for women to join the war efforts of the time. Some enlisted because they truly wanted to serve their country, some to stay with their husbands, some for liberation and purpose, and others for monetary reasons. It is obvious that Rosetta Wakeman's primary motivation was financial security.","In one of Wakeman's letters, she expressed her delight in receiving a letter from her family in return: \"I receive a letter from you today. I was much pleased with it.\" This delight was not solely a result of being homesick, but was also an expression of relief. It was not uncommon for families to completely dismiss daughters who dressed like men and took on such unconventional roles. The fact that Wakeman's family maintained communication with her is unexpected and; therefore, much appreciated.","In the beginning of her letter, Wakeman told her family she was \"contented\" and did not \"fear the rebel bullets.\" By the time she sent this letter, she has added at the bottom, \"When you think of me think where I am. It would make your hair stand out to be where I have been. How would you like to be in the front rank and have the rear rank load and fire their guns over you shoulder?\" This portrays the fact that women were right in the middle of battle, enduring not only the same physical challenges as men, but were also struggling with the conflict every soldier is faced with between bravery and fearful reality.","Rosetta Wakeman was not well educated, as is reflected in her grammar throughout the letters. This is not surprising considering the majority of women soldiers were poor and believed that war conditions could not be any worse than the bleak, dangerous environment of factory work they were used to. Her erratic grammar; however, does not hinder the letter's content. Letters during the Civil War, unlike current wartime mail, was uncensored so Wakeman touched on everything from her faith, her family issues, her identity, war efforts, and conditions of soldiers. Wakeman's letters (some signed under her alias, some using her real name) were therefore incredibly candid and offer an accurate account of female experiences as male soldiers in disguise."],"display_date":"March 29, 1863","search_date":"1863-03-29","locations":[{"id":13797,"lat":38.8383886986,"lng":-77.2747207757,"zoom":9,"place":"FAIRFAX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5011,"title":"“On the Home Front”: Civilian Reaction to Northern Occupation during the American Civil War","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-05-30","end_date":"1861-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As Northern forces began to push into Southern territory, they were forced to occupy many Southern residences and forage for resources and materials from Southern fields.

patterns were then sent from New York City for ten to thirty cents each.   The magazine was delivered all over the country, directly from the nation’s fashion capital, New York City.  The 1875 spring and summer edition of the magazine pictured items such as demitrain skirts, overskirts, basques, polonaises, bonnets, and aprons.  The fashions showed women what was “in” and what to wear, what was “useful, practical, and reliable information.”  All styles were elegant, meant for high society women; women pictured were standing, acting prim and proper.  The magazine illustrated the fact that appearing well-dressed was very important to people in the nineteenth century; many were willing to have inferior homes and diets to wear symbols of supposed status and success in society.  The creation of fashion styles demonstrated the more general change in America to a consumer culture and market society.","Even as early as the 1830s in America, \"the lady of fashion had arrived.\"  As women moved from the fields to the home, attire accommodated to the new expectations of the female gender.  Many women had acquired a new aversion to working and managing household affairs, creating terrible wives, as this was the expectation of women at this time.  All of the styles and suggested materials were heavy, even though the styles were for the spring and summer; this revealed that fashion was to make a statement, not to be comfortable or practical.  The specific magazine was sold in Greenville, South Carolina residents, and while the fashions may have made sense for New York City, they may not have been as applicable to Southern or rural women.  The magazine did not show the distinct differences between city and country that were very apparent in the nineteenth century, only picturing the styles of the nation's fashion capital.  Also, fashion styles for girls even under the age of ten were elegant and unreasonable, if more jaunty than the women’s styles.  The magazine illustrated that women had a new role in society:  to be seen and not to work or be on the same intellectual or political level as men.  In nineteenth century society, women were to be, “the graces of purity, gentleness, kindness, modesty, constancy, sincerity, resignation, and of a meek and quiet spirit are your bright ornaments.”  American women's fashion also depicted the wider changes in nineteenth century society from the ideal of republican simplicity to aristocratic decadence."],"display_date":1875,"search_date":"1875-07-02","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5046,"title":"Marriage in Margaret Fuller's \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\"","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-01","end_date":"1845-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the nineteenth century, one female author stood out as a voice for women during a time when many were not acknowledged.  Margaret Fuller wrote “Woman in the Nineteenth Century” and spoke with a voice for every woman who lived during the nineteenth century.  In particular, Fuller had an especially critical view toward marriage.  She explained that the idea of marriage “has been inculcated on women for centuries, that men not only have stronger passions than they, but of a sort that it would be shameful for them to share of even understand”.  She further explains that woman are expected to tell their husbands everything on their mind, and when they begin to show signs of “coldness or withdrawal” the wife is then labeled “wicked”.","The role of women gained increased attention during the nineteenth century, especially in women’s movements throughout the country.  As described by Carole Shammas in “A history of household government in American,” the U.S. was “the site of the first full-fledged uprising of female dependents…There were a few like Margaret Fuller, the Boston intellectual, who would maintain that if they wanted, “women should be sea captains!” but the primary objectives of the first feminists were not equal opportunities in the job market or in the political arena.” Shammas explained that the reason for their outrage was for others to acknowledge “the empowerment of women in households”.  During the nineteenth century, women desired to be seen as influential members of society instead of the “housewife” label with the expectations to constantly serve their husband.","Fuller asserted her confidence in understanding women and marriage when she explained that the married woman viewed men as “wild beasts” but actually view them all the same.  The unwed women were often told by the married women that if they were in their position and married to a man, “they would not expect continence or self-government from them”.  Women’s expectations were high for marriage, but in reality they received little in return, expected to run the household, and were taken advantage of."," "," "],"display_date":1845,"search_date":"1845-07-02","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5054,"title":"America's First Fashion Magazine","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-11-02","end_date":"1867-11-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The issues discussed in the first issue of Harper’s Bazar are not different from concerns of twenty-first century women.

However, the biggest difference between  attire of the nineteenth century and the twenty-first century did not lie on the outside. The major differences were what the women wore underneath their dresses.

The cover exemplifies that everyone needs an outlet to get away. Even if people are going through difficult times, such as war, they want something else to focus their attention on.

The magazine took on the daunting task and discussed marriage in its first issue on November 2, 1867. The first issue contained several articles that discussed various concerns of nineteenth century women. But, its most controversial article was entitled, “Expensive Matrimony.” The piece was one of the firsts of its time because during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, most newspapers and magazines did not discuss matrimony.","The author contradicted the idea that the reason for the decrease in marriage is women and their bad spending habits. She said it was wrong to blame women for the decrease in marriage rates because there was no statistical data to support the idea. She believed that men, in fact had worse spending habits than women did. The author stated that although women did tend to spend on clothing, men spent on larger, pricier items. She also stated that when it came down to it, men were greedier than women and men would put money before family. Men were more business oriented and would choose their careers and money over anything else. She said that since men usually focused more on their careers than family, they were more to blame for the decrease in marriage than women.","She also explains that not all women had bad spending habits.

This is shown by Arthur Singleton’s letter from Washington DC in 1816, where he makes the comment that “I bless myself, that this country is not subject to Gynæcocracy; that, by our Salique law, no woman is eligible to our presidency.” This functions as an assertment of the “traditional” belief that women are not eligible to have the same rights, dignities, and so on as men.","Yet Singleton’s defense of his statement sounds more like providing excuses rather than a justification for his belief, and he provides said excuses in a number of ways. First, he looks to the Bible – which says that “the women should look to the man for counsel,” and to a few historical examples which may not be enough to prove or disprove his point – he just says that there have been few great queens, but he never directly denies that there have been great queens in the past. Further, the majority of his attempted justifications for his statement involve masked assertions – such as the idea that “legislation... is too weighty for the sensitive fibres of the female mind.” or that “woman should rule, not indeed in civil jurisdiction, which would unsphere her, but in her vast natural province.” As such, Singleton conveys the social beliefs of the time, which rest upon not fact but prejudice.","Yet these beliefs were not limited to Washington DC; they existed throughout society, and to a great magnitude. As Kathryn S. Hahn explains, not only were women seen as incompetent, they were seen as foreign, saying “Women were used to hiding aspects of their lives that made them uniquely feminine. They hid such things as pregnancy, because it was different from men, and men were the norm in society. If they did not hide the differences they were... considered insane.” This passage gives the effect of such prejudice as carried out by society especially during the 1800’s – that the idea that femininity was foreign and associated with incompetence in “male roles” was apparent throughout society. As such, women were constantly discriminated against both directly and indirectly, with horrible consequences resulting from society’s mindset."],"display_date":"February 5, 1800 - October 5, 1816","search_date":"1808-06-06","locations":[{"id":15677,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":787,"tag":"Urban Life"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":788,"tag":"Sexism"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5113,"title":"Women's Rights Activist Experiences Effects of the Communication Revolution","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-01-01","end_date":"1872-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the first of three visits to America in the fall of 1872,  Emily Faithfull, an Englishwoman and women's rights activist described the problematic state of affairs that existed in the American government. During her stay, she closely followed the news articles published in the <em>The New York Daily</em>, <em>The Boston Herald,</em> and <em>The Chicago Tribune, </em>which all related stories of corrupt government officials and the perversion of justice that threatened America's democratic values. Emily Faithfull expressed specific concern over the abuse of justice that pervaded the courts, and in particular, the juries which she believed were placing its citizens' freedoms at risk. In the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> she read of the unqualified men that sat in the juries;men who were either too illiterate to properly \"weigh evidence\" or too apathetic to uphold the proceedings of a just trial. Other men, she learned, \"sympathize\" with the criminal class and withheld the execution of justice (that defines American values).<br /><br /> In her writings, Faithfull asserted that anyone who read the newspapers on a regular basis understood the amount of effort required to improve the situation. Accordingly, she related that in response to such news, \"some young men of the best families have awakened to a sense of their individual responsibility with regard to public matters and have organized a club with the view of encouraging an active participation in political movements.\" Outraged and troubled, Faithfull emotionally warned of the consequences of inaction that allowed those conditions to exist. She continued by urging those who \"love America\" and care for their \"nation's well-being\" to take on proactive measures to keep unscrupulous juries out of the courtroom in order to protect their democracy.","Her description and strong opinions regarding the daily events in American life reflected the effects of the widespread dissemination of information (telegraphs, publication of newspapers, magazines, pamphlets and books), which swept America in the 19th century. Historian Robert Brown regards the effects of the new found  public awareness as the \"communication revolution\" and credits the dramatic changes to technological advancements in transportation and commercialism. The communication revolution, he explains, profoundly impacted every area of society including politics, journalism, education, social movements and commerce. An informed public was now in a position to more actively participate in politics, assemble with others of similar views, voice their opinion, as well as petition and protest. Like Emily Faithfull and the men she describes, having the news at one's fingertips not only empowered aristocrats, farmers, women and slaves but also transformed much of society's outlook and behavior.

She found no discontent in the way they behaved, in the way they dressed, or in the way they spoke. They were intelligent, graceful, and motherly. All of the women busied themselves in womanly accomplishments, such as organizing charity groups, kindergartens and clubs.","Bertha also noted many female attendees in her lectures about kindergarten in New York.

The \"feminization of teaching\" had just begun to evolve around the time of her visit (1862);the majority of teaching positions in America, from the colonial period to the middle of the 19th century, were occupied by young, white men. She noted, that \"thanks to tradition and prejudice\" female teachers continued to be underpaid. In her writing, she detailed the salaries of male and female teachers who underwent the same training and exams, performed the same tasks, and devoted as much energy and devotion as male teachers, but received less compensation. At that time, the average salary for women teachers in Vermont ranged from eight dollars per month (with board) to $750 a year, while men received around twenty dollars a month to $1600 a year. Faithfull also argued that while women also bore additional responsibilities of taking care of the home and child rearing, they fulfilled expectations that demanded they \"work with alacrity, give up [their] time, be well posted in every subject, dress like ladies, and accept a salary which a French cook would scorn.\" She also refuted the commonly held opinion that married individuals received a higher salary by pointing out that men always received a larger salary regardless of their marital status. While men often had access to greater educational opportunities, the unfortunate reality was that many equally deserving and competent women were widows with families to support. Even the public, she argued, was well aware of this fact and admitted their preference for female teachers due to \"the score of their cheapness, as well as on the ground of their general efficiency.\"<br /><br /> Reknowned for her work as a women's welfare activist, Faithfull's brief descriptions reflected the difficult struggle of equality for women, specifically the obstacles they experienced as teachers. Though legislation did eventually grant greater rights to women, the wage gap between men and women working in the same fields remained. Authors Pulliam and Patten explain that until the advent of \"common schools\"  in the 1830's (similar to modern day public schools), men dominated the field of education and usually used education as a starting point to move other areas of work, such as ministry and law. Prior to this, women predominantly taught basic lessons (alphabet, numbers, Bible studies) in \"dame schools\" run in their own homes for meager wages. Despite the low wages, however, women still longed for the opportunity to impart their knowledge, as it provided them independence and a sense of fulfillment. Initially, schools were reluctant to employ women as teachers, but with the efforts of reformers and activists like Emily Faithfull, who helped to broaden opportunities for women, monumental strides were made in education as well as other fields of work."],"display_date":1862,"search_date":"1862-07-02","locations":[{"id":13558,"lat":44.2738078175,"lng":-72.6171283227,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Vermont"}],"tags":[{"id":802,"tag":"Public School"},{"id":801,"tag":"Teachers"},{"id":576,"tag":"Equal Rights"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":450,"tag":"Powerful Women in History"},{"id":421,"tag":"Women's roles"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5387,"title":"A Brief History of Women in Collegiate Sports","course_id":81,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-01-01","end_date":"12/31/02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the early days of American women in education, there was very little room for distraction. However, little by little, collegiate women began branching out from their studies to join social groups, enjoy other skills, and venture into the world of physical fitness. Despite some aspects of women’s athletics being present since the foundation of some schools, both faculty and administration of early American colleges feared the effects of competition and aimed at still shedding women in a positive light through collegiate athletics. It has been made clear by Chris Hartman’s <em>Health and Fun Shall Walk Hand in Hand</em> that there was no lack of interest in sports on behalf of the female students, just hesitation from the administration to implement women’s collegiate athletics. Only in recent years have women’s athletics been able to take on an identity completely its own away from physical education and intramural sports. That identity has growth into something big and all its own in today’s world.","In the early days of women on campus, it became evident that women were “frailer both physically and mentally than their male counterparts.” The growing number of women who were leaving home and taking on a world all their own at school is a direct cause for some sort of women’s health plan. When women began being officially accepted to the University of Wisconsin in 1863, plans were made to give female students a place “in the South Building, where ladies will be trained in Lewis’ new system of gymnastics”. Twelve years later in 1874, female Wisconsin University students took initiative for their health and lobbied for the right to use the men’s gym on campus. Permission was granted for two 60-minute sessions per week. A small start, but one that would get the ball rolling in just a matter of time.","Throughout the 1870s, small adjustments were made to the physical fitness programs at American schools and by the 1880s, women were allowed to exercise in a relaxed setting. At the University of Wisconsin alone, female students were allowed to play tennis, croquet, and ride bicycles at their leisure. This is making leaps and bounds over what they could do just a matter of years prior. Around the same time, in 1881, Marion Talbot and Ellen Richards for the American Association of University Women to further higher education to other women and find wider opportunities to use their training. Three years later, the American Association of University Women admits eight colleges to be charter members. Among them are Vassar, Wellesley, Cornell, and the University of Wisconsin, which led the charge for the women’s health and athletics movement. Soon after, the first research study that surveyed women’s health and physical education received feedback from 1,290 members and institutes that “contrary to prior statements made by a prominent Boston physician, higher education does not adversely affect the health of women college graduates.","Towards the very end of the 1800s, women’s interest in physical activities increased with the number of desirable activities they were allowed to participate in. By 1892, most top end colleges had seasonal activities such as sleigh riding, skiing, and boating, as well as newly founded clubs dedicated strictly to women’s athletics such as tennis club, coed cycling, or gymnastics exhibitions.","In a photo taken in 1899 of the Wheaton College Women’s Basketball club, one can clearly see the pre-development in the game of women’s basketball. Played mostly on grass at this time, hoops only consisted of rigid netting on a tall pole. The backboard, introduced to basketball in 1891, had not yet been presented to the game of women’s basketball. Not only was equipment underdeveloped for modern play, but uniforms consisted of black dresses, tights, and large bows around the neckline. These women can be seen as the first pioneers for women’s athletics and would become a spark for change to come.","As the 1900s began, so did a new outlook on women’s health. The activities began to shift from gymnastics and callisthenic drills towards organized games and sports. The University of Wisconsin was the first to answer this call for organized stimulation with the introduction of basketball and the installation of the Women’s Athletic Association in 1902. The Women’s Athletic Association served to promote and sponsor women’s athletics and physical activity across the country and would make strong changes through collegiate athletics for the benefit of women for years to come."],"display_date":"1877 - 1902","search_date":"1889-12-31","locations":[{"id":15049,"lat":43.9430490955,"lng":-90.6124788709,"zoom":9,"place":"MONROE, Wisconsin"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":994,"tag":"College Sports"},{"id":1216,"tag":"college life"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":81,"school_id":2}},{"id":5288,"title":"<p>Birth of Eugenics – Death of Compassion&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /&gt;</p>","course_id":73,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/24","end_date":"10/19/27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 19, 1927, Carrie Buck struggled against the orderlies taking her to the operating room. She wondered how she came to this point in her life. She had been given to a foster family, then raped and impregnated by a family friend. Authorities took away her daughter, Vivian, when Carrie was institutionalized to hide the foster family’s shame. Carrie became Virginia’s first test case in a groundbreaking Supreme Court case on the sterilization of institutionalized individuals. However, Carrie lost the case and was forced by the court to follow through with the dehumanizing sterilization process.","The wishes of the Supreme Court had been carried out according to <em>Buck v. Bell (1924)</em>. Involuntary sterilization was to be the answer to all social ills by breeding out all of “the undesirable traits” in humanity. Harry H. Laughlin wrote the Model Eugenical Sterilization Law that began the wave of mandatory sterilization for individuals in institutions. The main scope of the law was to prevent the “socially inadequate classes” of people from procreating thereby tainting the American people. According to Laughlin, these groups included “insane, epileptic, diseased, blind, deaf, deformed, and dependent (including orphans, ne’er-do-wells, the homeless, tramps and paupers).”","Laughlin did not come to the <em>Buck v. Bell </em>trial, nor did he ever meet Carrie Buck, although he did testify in writing that the Virginia Colony’s director, Albert Priddy, correctly assessed Carrie and her family as members of “the shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of anti-social whites of the South.” Authorities regularly assessed individuals in the south as “non-producing and shiftless persons, living on public and private charity.”","When the Supreme Court supported <em>Buck v. Bell</em> in an 8-1 vote, Laughlin celebrated because this led the way for more sterilization laws to be passed and his work at the Eugenics Records Office in Cold Harbor could continue supported by the Supreme Court. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stated in his opinion that “three generations of imbeciles is enough,” speaking of Carrie’s mother, Carrie, and her daughter. Vivian was declared an imbecile at age six months because she did not follow a coin with her eyes in front of a camera. The Supreme Court’s decision took away the rights of the people deemed unworthy by society to choose to be sterilized or not. <em>Laughlin emphasized that the endorsement of state authority to perform compulsory operations without regard for the consent of the patient or his family was an \"outstanding feature\" of the </em><em>Buck</em><em> decision.</em>","The south was the area most affected by the sterilization laws. Laughlin’s law supported the idea that segregation was not only a necessity, but also required to maintain the purity of the American people. Whereas many Northern states put sterilizations laws into effect much earlier than southern states, like Virginia and South Carolina, only California surpassed the south in the number of compulsory sterilizations. The relevant sections of the sterilization law only came off the books in 1974 in the state of Virginia. In 2002, Virginia State Governor Mark Warner made an official apology to the Buck family and “the survivors of involuntary sterilization.”"],"display_date":"January 1, 1924 - October 19, 1927","search_date":"1925-11-24","locations":[{"id":20511,"lat":37.4182087686,"lng":-79.1519048441,"zoom":12,"place":"Lynchburg City, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}},{"id":5293,"title":"Teaching in the Unknown","course_id":73,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-05-15","end_date":"1867-05-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Emily Bliss and Mary Ames had never taught before, and they were about to venture into the heart of the Reconstruction south and teach the newly freed slave children. They were two women from the North with no teaching experience at all. Intrigued by Emily Bliss, Ames decided to follow her to Boston and enroll as teacher to work for the Freedmen's Bureau in 1865.","They were not supported by their families and upon their arrival in Charleston were shuffled from place to place. They met Mr. Pilsbury, who was one of the education leaders in the town, and a discouraged and exhausted Emily Bliss desperately asked him for sympathy, and if he happened to have a wife who would feel for them and bring them comfort. Ms. Pilsbury took them in, and they found themselves in one of the nicest mansions in Charleston. They were asked to stay and teach there, but shocked Mr. Redpath, who was the leader of the Freedmen’s Bureau who extended the invitation, when they declined and said they would rather teach the freed slaves who had been sent to Estido Island on Sherman’s March following the war.","The Blacks were very welcoming to the two newcomers, and they soon found out that the officers and the teachers were the only white people on the island, along with the 10,000 newly freed slaves.\tOn their first day of school, May 15, 1865, they had only 9 boys and 6 girls. Only two of the children knew their letters, and none knew how to read. They next day, however, there were 28 students present, and of the new students, 2 of them could read. The children were not in good shape and did not have nice clothes, according to Bliss, “the poor creatures (having) lived so long in a filthy condition that they don’t know what it’s like to be clean”. Once June hit, it got so hot that the 2 women were advised to leave as soon as they could, for it was hazardous to their health. They stayed however, committed to their cause, and by June they had 101 students. It was hard for them to keep order however, and they had immense trouble keeping the older students in line. School ended on June 30, and on July 2 they were told that the soldiers received orders to leave the island, allowing the freed slaves to do so as well. It was troublesome to Ames, because it was the soldiers she received her rations and supplies from. By July 12 many of the soldiers and freedmen were leaving the island, however Ames was determined to stay and keep teaching those who had no one to teach them. Ames stayed on the island, and moved to a house in order to continue her teaching. She stayed for a little over a year until she no longer received any support at all from the Freedmen’s Bureau, but continued to be very successful in her teaching of the freed slave children."],"display_date":"May 15, 1865 - May 15, 1867","search_date":"1866-05-15","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":1056,"tag":"Teaching"},{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"},{"id":1119,"tag":"Freedmen's Bureau"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}},{"id":5295,"title":"Sexual Violence and the Memphis Riot","course_id":73,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-05-01","end_date":"1866-05-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["From May 1, 1866 to May 3, 1866 violence reigned on the streets of Memphis, Tennessee. At the end of what is today known as the Memphis Riot, forty six African Americans and two White men lay dead. All four of the African American schools were burned as well as over one hundred private residences. Moreover, at least five women testified to having been raped. These women possessed the fortitude and the courage to appear before a congressional committee and recount the heinous acts committed against them.","            Lucy Smith, a young African American girl, only seventeen at the time, was staying with Frances Smith, an old crippled woman when the riots began. Between one and two o’clock in the morning both women awoke to a loud banging at the door. Frances grabbed her crutches and headed for the door. When she opened it she saw “seven men, two of whom were policemen.” She identified them as policemen “by their stars” and noted that they were “all Irishmen.” Upon entering the shack, for that is all it was, the men demanded that they be made supper. Lucy and Frances prepared their meal and waited for the men to leave. However, Lucy and Frances’ nightmare had just begun. The seven men finished their meal and demanded “some woman to sleep with.”         Frances replied that they “were not that sort of women” and indicated that the men should leave. The men refused and one of them struck Frances across the face and began to choke her. Lucy attempted to flee out the open window but the offender caught and treated her similarly. What followed, in the words of Frances Smith, was this: “All seven of the men violated us two. Four of them had to do with me, and the rest with Lucy.”","            As disturbing as the attack was, it is interesting to note that the men did not act out in immediate violence. They asked for a meal first and then stated that they “wanted some woman to sleep with,” as though the women were prostitutes and nothing more. Hannah Rosen, a professor as the University of Michigan, argues that due to the prevailing thoughts and attitudes at the time, most white men considered African American women as unable to resist and subject to white male authority. In other words, “the assailants acted as if…the world had not been fundamentally altered with emancipation” and that these women were still slaves, with no choice in the matter. Rosen also indicates that this pattern of thought was fostered by the press constantly depicting African American women as “lewd” and “loose.” This gave many the impression that African American women enjoyed, or at least easily consented to casual or illicit sex.","            Regardless of the reason, these criminals grossly mistreated Lucy and Frances. Both women gave testimony at a congressional investigation, and even still the malefactors were not charged. This was true not only of this incident, but also of the riot in general. Not a single man was ever arrested or charged for their part in the violence. Instead many of the officers involved, the ones who perpetrated the violence, were compensated for their injuries “sustained in an effort to suppress the riot.”"],"display_date":"May 1, 1866 - May 3, 1866","search_date":"1866-05-02","locations":[{"id":12369,"lat":35.182488505,"lng":-89.8964012565,"zoom":9,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":1057,"tag":"Memphis Riot"},{"id":1058,"tag":"Sexual Violence"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}},{"id":5306,"title":"Women in Baseball","course_id":73,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/43","end_date":"12/31/54","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Women in Baseball","            “There’s no crying in baseball.”  These famous words were spoken by Tom Hanks in the movie <em>A League of Their Own.</em>  In 1992, Director Penny Marshall brought the true story of women in baseball to movie theatres across the world.   At a time when America was at the forefront of brutal World War II, the future of Major League baseball was unknown.  The idea of using women instead of men on the baseball diamond was the key to saving the game as we know it.","            In 1943, the United States found themselves in the middle of World War II, after an attack on Pearl Harbor.  Most of the minor league baseball teams disbanded due to lack of players.  Major league players volunteered to enlist; including players Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, and Stan Musial.  President Franklin D.

Wrigley, to step in and do something to keep the game going until the boys came home from the war.","            A group of dedicated Midwestern businessmen, and the financial backing of Mr. Wrigley, began the All-American Girls Softball League in the spring of 1943.

Despite a long-standing precedent of neutrality in the face of foreign conflict, the United States steeled itself for the possibility of war. On February 26, 1917, the <em>New York Times</em> ran an article entitled \"Suffragist Pledge Aid to the Nation\" covering the National American Woman Suffrage Association’s pledge to aid in the war effort if the U.S. became involved in the conflict overseas. The Suffrage Association had met the day before in Washington, D.C. and had drafted a letter to President Woodrow Wilson promising the services of two million suffragists.","The <em>New York Times</em> cited the contents of the letter, which expressed the suffragists’ belief that \"the settlement of international difficulties by bloodshed is unworthy of the twentieth century\" [1]. However, despite their opposition to the war, the suffragists would remain loyal to the U.S. government and fulfill their civic duty to support the soldiers and the war effort. In anticipation that the U.S. might enter the war, the Suffrage Association planned to form a committee of representatives from each suffragist organization to ready them for war work, such as collecting rations and medical supplies. Additionally, the <em>Times</em> reported that a new bureau would coordinate the placement of women in the positions left empty by men shipped out to fight.","The suffragists’ letter to President Wilson made clear that they had \"no intention of laying aside [their] constructive, forward work\" to obtain voting rights for the female citizens of the United States [1]. At the same time the suffragists were pledging their loyalty to the nation, they were also planning a demonstration at the White House the following Sunday. According to the <em>Times</em> article, women from all over the country would rally together in support of a constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote. At the same meeting that produced the letter to President Wilson, the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage raised $12,500 in support of the demonstration outside of his offices. Later the same week, the Woman’s Party and the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage would be merged following another convention in Washington, D.C.","The <em>New York Times</em> article highlights some of the paradoxes of the time period in which it was published. Women were told to be prepared to fill men’s positions on the home front while the men were fighting overseas, and yet were not accorded the same rights as those men. They were encouraged to be loyal to the U.S. government, but had no say in choosing that government. During this time period, women were expected to be patriotic and functional, but not political or radical. Opponents to women’s suffrage frequently made comparisons between the suffragist movement and socialism, implying that the two were irretrievably intertwined. However, during World War One, suffragists rationed food, volunteered for the Red Cross, and worked in factories that produced munitions [2]. Their continued loyalty and patriotism deflated arguments that voting rights for women opened the doorway for radical socialist pacifism.","Ironically, suffragist actions to support the war effort fulfilled the female Red Cross volunteer ideal presented in pro-war propaganda. Organizations such as the National American Woman’s Suffrage Association featured in the <em>New York Times</em> article tried to prove women’s \"fitness for suffrage and equal citizenship rights by loyally supporting the government’s military preparedness and war policies\" [3]. Through the patriotic efforts of suffragists during World War I, American citizens came to accept that women were entitled to equal voting rights. Their ability to step in and keep the country functioning while a large portion of the male population fought valiantly overseas proved that suffragists were loyal to the United States of America and sought to be further enabled to participate in the country’s government."," ","[1] \"Suffragists Pledge Aid to the Nation.

The women of this Committee delivered valuable lectures about food conservation and also gave their time to help with the Red Cross. Although the Red Cross work was very helpful to the sailors during this time, women during the war also volunteered at home by overseeing playgrounds, parks and other various charities [3]. Clarke also goes on to describe that these women did their patriotic duty by nearly solving the problems of food conservation and food production during the time of the war.","Although there are many triumphs discussed in American Women and the World War, women also faced several injustices. While women were able to enlist in the US Navy during World War I, they had to settle for typically “female” work. This work would include nursing and telephone operating. The women were also denied an auxiliary corps, as per the War Department. Along with the war ending also concluded any hopes of women enlisting in the US Army [5].","While women during World War I faced many ups and downs, one can say that their efforts were eventually recognized. Popular belief holds that women were recognized because they had truly proved themselves during the war [6]. Undoubtedly, the women’s war efforts also helped lead to their gaining the right to vote in 1920 with the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment.","In conclusion, Ida Clarke successfully achieved her goal in proving the heroism and patriotism of American women in American Women and the World War. Women finally were given the chance to prove themselves as the everyday heroes that they were, at home and during the war. By doing so, they continued their legacy of equal rights and eventually gained the right to vote."," "," ","<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> Ida Clyde Gallagher Clarke, <em>American Women and the World War</em> (New York: D.

L. Spalding shed light on the harsh conditions women endured in order to regain aspects of their individuality within the Church.  As the authors state, “all religions thus far have taught the headship and superiority of man, the inferiority and subordination of woman” (389).  To break away from this religious standpoint, women engaged themselves in acts of reform not only for themselves as females but also for the enslaved during the abolitionist movement.  It was through the abolition of slavery, protection of children and the poor, as well as  free government that brought about change and the welfare of women.  This progress was associated within the Christian religion due to the involvement of women in the Church.  This involvement and influence of women lead to the acknowledgement of females as leaders and fully capable, equal citizens.  The article makes a point to state that, “God is neither male nor female, as in Christ there is neither male nor female” (409).  The focus on men in Christianity allowed for advocates for women’s rights to take an offensive tone and mistake certain teachings for what they truly were.  These feministic ways, as discussed above, were a prelude to what was to come for the future of women’s rights and Christianity.  Women gained their rights not only within the church but slowly and surely through everyday life struggles.  To get to that point, however, women had to become more religious, more moral, and more intelligent than men.  Finally, to conclude with a quote from J. L. Spalding, “to be persuasive, woman must be amiable; and to be strong, she must speak from a loving heart, and not from a sour mind” (409)."],"display_date":"May 1885","search_date":"1885-05-16","locations":[{"id":11232,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":514,"tag":"Christianity"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":81,"school_id":2}},{"id":5368,"title":"American Women’s Social Status in 1800’s","course_id":80,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-01-01","end_date":"1883-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Emily Faithfull, an English women right’s activist and writer, discovered an interesting phenomenon during her trips to the United States in 1872 and 1882. Many middle class and upper class women she met were leading a harsh life after losing their fathers or husbands. In two cases, the daughter of a navy Commander and the wife of a General of the United States Army were not able to make a living after the death of their father and husband, respectively. These two cases were only the tip of the iceberg: many upper and middle class women also suffered when their kinsmen dead, lost the ability to work or became unemployed. Even though most of them were willing to take up jobs to improve their living conditions; unfortunately, they did not have the ability to do so. Faithfull discovered that this was due to the “short-sighted policy” in many American families that females did not need to work as they would be married have no necessity to do so (Faithfull, p.281, 282). This illustrated that in the early history of the United States, women were mostly being nurtured in a “green house” and being considered as dependents of the male family members.","The above story reflected the passive role of women in early American society. At that time, women were expected to stay home and take care of the family and housework instead of taking up jobs. According to Faithfull, in 1836 there were only seven occupations opened to women. Although some women had a chance to take up jobs, they had to face low pay. In Vermont, the average salaries of male teachers was 20 dollars a month and 1600 dollars a year. But female teachers only received 8 dollars per month and 750 dollars per year because of tradition and prejudice.

Written in 1859, the literary piece begins by expressing the unsettled feeling that women encounter during the process of growing older. The fear of growing old is attached to the stigma of being old and unmarried, or becoming an “old maid.” Grout explains the uncomfortable nature of attending social gatherings and being sold and marketed in a sense by one’s own mother. “Doting mamas” play a role in encouraging anxiety about the process of finding a husband amongst young women. Grout stresses the need for young women to reemphasize virtues rather than the superficial traits that men find appealing. She interrogates the notion that marriage should be a woman’s highest aspiration and quotes a girl who proclaims that she has “wed art,” in order to support her point that women can be fulfilled by more than marriage. Florence Nightingale, a woman who devoted her life to the service of others, is also cited as evidence of Grout’s point. The piece finishes with a call for women to value their precious school years, and to not dismiss the joys that such an experience can bring.","Concurrently with the shifting focus away from marriage and onto school, chapter seven “Husbands and Wives” from Karen Lystra’s Searching the Heart: Women, Men, and Romantic Love in Nineteenth-Century America, discusses the new role that love had begun to play in nineteenth century marriage and courtship. This chapter expounds on Grout’s essay explaining that for the first time, during this period, marriage was conceived in terms of love and personal choice, along with the traditional set of sex specific duties that married people were meant to fulfill. The excitement of courtship played an important role in determining the future of a relationship. Although it was acknowledged that this initial feeling often fades, it was thought to lead to deeper and more fulfilling companionship during a marriage. One woman is quoted in the chapter regarding the benefits of being married or not being married and echoing Grout’s essay saying: “not that I would advise you to throw yourself away, for the sake of getting married,” continuing on to explain that there is enjoyment after the excitement wears off (196). Nineteenth century Americans feared a loveless marriage, not confusing companionship with affection.  A lack of love did not play into the reason behind divorce though. Instead, an inability to perform culturally prescribed duties caused a marriage to end during this period, often forcing women to bear the brunt of the blame for the split. The new emphasis on love rather than just money and status during this century explains why women such as E.M Grout could afford to say that men should be evaluated for their, “acts of love, or deeds of mercy.” The new trend in female education and the importance of love in a relationship both affected the changing institution of marriage in the nineteenth century."],"display_date":1859,"search_date":"1859-07-02","locations":[{"id":6121,"lat":41.5286517402,"lng":-71.0500153769,"zoom":9,"place":"BRISTOL, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":405,"tag":"Marriage"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":81,"school_id":2}},{"id":5377,"title":"Angelina Grimke and Her Secular Language of Rights","course_id":81,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-10-02","end_date":"1837-10-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1837, Angelina Grimke authored a series of letters to Catharine Beecher on the topic of the cultural roles of women as they relate to their social, economic, and political rights. One was reprinted in <em>Women's Rights Emerges within the Antislavery Movement, 1830-1870</em> by Kathryn Sklar. In the letter retitled by Sklar as, “<em>Human Rights Not Founded on Sex,</em>” Grimke argues that humans have rights because they are moral beings:","“the rights of all men, from the king to the slave, are built upon their moral nature: and as all men have this moral nature, so all men have essentially the same rights” (Grimke, Human Rights Not Founded on Sex).","In a very formal sense, Grimke used a secular argument to articulate a point about the what rights are and a necessity to respect them. Her persuasion proved to be effective and her methods involving secular justifications for equality of rights contrasted with other religious justifications for and against slavery and women's rights. Her points differed because they did not involve an appeal to her audience's religious sentiments, they involved an appeal to their reason. By appealing to reason, Grimke presented a new language of rights as they related to women and slaves, to the political climate of the mid 1800s.","The new kind of appeal that Grimke proposed was one that provided a stronger case for an immediate end to slavery, rather than gradually phasing it out. Gerda Lerner discusses the contrast between these two arguments in The Grimke Sisters and the Struggle Against Race Prejudice:","“If the Negro was entitled to equality on the grounds of his humanity, it followed that equality was his right, not a privilege to be granted at the slaveholder's pleasure” (Lerner, The Grimke Sisters and the Struggle Against Race Prejudice).","Lerner points out that if one granted Grimke the explicitly moral point she made in “<em>Human Rights Not Founded on Sex,</em>” then it followed that a gradual phasing out of slavery is morally wrong in a sense similar to why not ending it all was wrong. Grimke's point being presented on secular grounds was essential to her point having the amount of salience necessary to illustrate the way in which those calling for a gradual phasing out of slavery posited an internally incoherent message: they acknowledged slavery was morally wrong, but also suggested that it also be allowed to continue until a point that was convenient for a slaveholder. They were concerned with morality only insofar as slaveholders were not inconvenienced. The secular nature of Grimke's point had more salience because the Bible was used to argue both for ending slavery immediately, and to let it continue (Lerner, The Grimke Sisters and the Struggle Against Race Prejudice). Likewise, how one viewed the rights of women depended on how one interpreted the Bible. Grimke's secular language of rights were justificatorily minimal: they presented an account of rights of slaves and women that could accommodate the values of more than one point of view. The sense in which rights were to be respected on Grimke's account extended beyond what any religious account of morality could have provided. Religious justifications of rights only had normative force if the audience to which they were presented already believed the interpretation was correct. Grimke's language of rights contrasted with this because she reasoned through the status of the rights of slaves and women, meaning that her point was conceptual, rather than interpretive.","Grimke's justification for the equal rights of slaves and women was one that could have had normative force regardless of an individual's opinions. It was different because it appealed to reason rather than emotion. Consequently, her speeches and the arguments made in them reshaped the dialogue concerning the moral status of women in slaves in the mid-1800s."],"display_date":"October 2, 1837","search_date":"1837-10-02","locations":[{"id":6216,"lat":42.3509402419,"lng":-71.9042530938,"zoom":8,"place":"WORCESTER, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":1199,"tag":"Angelina Grimke"},{"id":1198,"tag":"Secularism"},{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":81,"school_id":2}},{"id":5382,"title":"Women in Education During the 19th Century","course_id":81,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-06-01","end_date":"1878-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“From my own personal knowledge of the school, I cordially commend it, as one of the very best female schools within my knowledge, in the Southern states”. This is just one of many testimonials taken from an advertising pamphlet from the Virginia Female Institute, published in June 1878. During the 19<sup>th</sup> century, women were finding new ways to exert freedom and attempt to obtain power. One of the ways they found a voice was through education. Upon the creation of female schools, often called female seminaries or institutes, women finally had access to education. There are many similar pamphlets from female institutes and seminary schools located in various parts of the country, primarily the South. The goals of such pamphlets were to advertise the school and ideals it put in value. Most were descriptive of what a “female institute” involves. The documents outline everything at the school, describing the location, buildings, courses of study, and costs. However it goes beyond just mere descriptions. The testimonials from female students that studied at the school, in this case the Virginia Institute, had the goal of clearly expressing the morals and meaning behind the school. Many of the women thank the school for changing their lives, along with a few religion based comments, which seems to be a strong part of The Virginia Institute’s dynamic. Although the document’s goal was to advertise the school, it also was selling the ideal female role that was prevalent at this time. It portrays that women can have the best of both worlds: education, while still upholding womanly traditions. Women are allowed this “gift” of education, while still being told to maintain the expectancies of society while receiving this gift.","Historian Mary Kelley illustrates this interesting dynamic between women and education during the period of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that many were encountering in such institutes like this one in Virginia. Women began to be afforded opportunities that never would have occurred before. Kelley points out that education proved to be a powerful tool for women, with some choosing to use their new knowledge to partake in social action, such as the anti-slavery movement. Education could be seen as a training tool for such ventures. However, adding education to their lives did not suddenly change everything and make them equal citizens in society. Women experienced two spheres during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, with education being promoted, yet they often were encouraged to still remain silent and continue their duties in the home. Some spoke out, such as Catherine Beecher agreeing that women’s role in the home gives them power. This left women with conflicting messages at the time; one message prompting women to become educated, while the other prompted women to keep their new found knowledge to themselves in the home or use it only in the profession of teaching."," "],"display_date":"June 1878","search_date":"1878-06-15","locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":81,"school_id":2}},{"id":5383,"title":"Women In The Education Arena","course_id":81,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-11-09","end_date":"1838-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On November 9<sup>th</sup>, 1837, Mrs. Pamela Burr wrote a letter to Mary Lyon, a leader of the women’s rights leader and educator, urging her to consider her two daughters for admission to Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts.

By 1860, there were approximately 100 colleges that offered education to women. After the Civil War, the women’s colleges of the Northeast, especially the “Seven Sister” schools (Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Wellesley, Vassar, and Radcliffe,) set out to demonstrate that women were just as capable of achieving advanced education as men.

In January of 1832, Loring was part of the founding of the New England Anti-­-Slavery Society in the African Baptist church in Boston. He became a colleague of William Lloyd Garrison, whom Loring did not always agree with. In particular was their disagreement over the goal of the New England Anti-­Slavery Society; in which Loring was opposed to Garrison’s concept of “immediate and unconditional emancipation,\" although Loring soon came to agree with the idea. Loring worked with many other abolitionists in his time including Caroline Weston, to whom he had much correspondence with. Caroline Weston was sister to Maria Weston Chapman, who was a prominent abolitionist in the 1800’s. Caroline was one of the abolitionist women who formed the Boston Female Anti--Slavery Society. Loring continued as a prominent figure and lawyer throughout the abolitionist movement; joining the Boston Vigilance Committee and housing fugitive slaves.","In the correspondence between Ellis Gray Loring and Caroline Weston, is the letter that concerns to a 13 year-­-old slave boy named Martin. Loring explains that the boy spent time in school in Boston before being sent to Hopedale Community to live with a Mr. G. Sowald (an Englishman). It appears Loring is concerned that the time that Martin spent in Boston was “injurious” towards him (and Hopedale Community) because the members of the community believe that Martin now sets a wrong example for the children, being a bad influence. Although Loring appears to disagree somewhat, explaining that Martin is intelligent, docile, generous, and good-­-tempered, and he believes that Martin will make a good seaman’s apprentice. He believes that Martin will soon be out of control and that will be not only painful but also mortifying for Loring. The letter is finished by saying that Martin needs a place with “firm will” and a “firm arm” if needed. The letter is addressed to “Dear friend Caroline” and is signed “with the truest resign and respect, yrs., Ellis Gray Loring.” The letter shows the mutual respect between the two abolitionist, Weston and Loring as well as their concern for the welfare of a teenage slave boy, Martin.

Hull-House’s mission of being a place where immigrants came to learn soon required it to offer classes to meet the immigrant’s needs.  Services came to include classes, such as, English language, cooking, and American government. A public kitchen, nursery and playground were other amenities offered to the residents of Hull-House.  The residents, who paid rent and contributed to the services, took the lead on many Hull-House projects that led to social reforms.

She would have taken advanced courses like history, botany, moral and intellectual philosophy, evidences of Christianity, chemistry, logic and rhetoric. Mary recieved a seemingly progressive gender-equal education. This 'progressive education,' however, was less about producing intellectuals and more about creating successful mothers. As the South Carolina Baptist Convention concluded in their decision to start the school, women were their sons’ first and perhaps most important teachers. Through the early instruction by their mothers, young boys gained their moral compasses, their religious convictions and their veneration for honor. The education of women, therefore, was not thought of as an end in itself; it was meant to be the beginning of a cycle that would improve the education and character of future male generations. Though the mission of gender-equal education was forward-thinking for the times, the reasoning behind it was typical of the mid-nineteenth century.","The college’s 1857 catalog also indicates the school's consonance with prevailing notions of gender and intellectual station. Though the distribution of faculty members, four men to four women, seems to indicate a certain amount of gender equality, an examination of the subjects taught by each reveals an intellectual inequality. The four men each taught advanced subjects like science, ancient languages and philosophy and all worked in the collegiate department. The women, likely young and unmarried or widowed (as societal norms usually prevented married women from teaching) inhabited lower academic roles. Only one of the four taught in the collegiate department and then only penmanship and vocal music. The rest were associated with the primary and academic departments as teachers or assistants.

Once in Ohio, they sought refuge at a former slave’s home.","The fugitives’ owners arrived the next day searching for the runaways in order to take them back to Kentucky.  Because of The Fugitive Slave Act passed in 1850, they were able to obtain a warrant and the assistance of the local United States Marshal.  The act stated that it was the duty of marshals and deputy marshals to carry out the warrants.  <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> detailed the events that unfolded at the house where Garner and her family were hiding: shots were fired, a deputy marshal was injured, and the door was breached.  Upon entry into the house, they discovered the dead child.  <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> described the scene by saying, “a deed of horror had been consummated, for weltering in its blood, the throat being cut ear to ear and the head almost severed from the body, upon the floor lay one of the children of the younger couple, a girl three years old.”  Garner proceeded to hit the dead child with a shovel before being restrained.  At the time, it was unclear who had killed the child; <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> stated, “The fearful act lies between one or the other of the miserable parents, perhaps both, but doubtless, the truth will be brought out by the coroner to-day.”","Indeed, the truth was “brought out.”  Julius Yanuck, a historian, discusses the story in a journal article almost a century later.  When Garner discovered that they were about to be captured, she devised a desperate plan that would save her children from returning to slavery – escape through death.  Quickly she grabbed a knife and seized her three-year-old daughter.  Using the knife, she gashed open her daughter’s throat.  She then turned to her other children, but was stopped before she could manage to do more than mildly injure them.","Much agitation grew out of the escape and murder.  <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> summed up the article and captured the sense of tension by saying, “Abolitionists regard the parents of the murdered child as a hero and heroine, teeming with lofty and holy emotions, who, Virginiuslike would rather imbue their hands in the blood of their offspring than allow them to wear the shackles of slavery, while others look upon them as brutal and unnatural murderers.”  Whether selfish or selfless, the acts of Garner were not quickly forgotten."],"display_date":"January 27, 1856 - January 28, 1856","search_date":"1856-01-27","locations":[{"id":10239,"lat":39.1954617755,"lng":-84.5426360039,"zoom":10,"place":"HAMILTON, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5580,"title":"Slave Sarah Frances Shaw Graves Recalls an Unjust Whipping","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-01-01","end_date":"1860-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","Sarah Frances Shaw Graves was born a slave in Missouri. She was interviewed in her later years as a part of the slave narratives taken when she was free. One story she related was of a Sunday when she attended a wedding for her master’s kinfolks. The bride walked into the church and someone kicked dust onto the bride’s dress, but it was not Graves. She, however, got blamed for it and the master’s wife whipped her. In reality, she believed that the master’s daughter, Puss, kicked the dust onto the bride’s dress. Nevertheless, she endured, “the worst whippin’ I ever got. The worst whippin’ in my whole life an’ I still got the marks on my body.” When they all got home, the master meant to whip her again. Graves remembered, “…I got mad, an’ told him it was a lie, an’ if Puss said I kicked dust on the white folks she was a DAMNED LYIN’ DEVIL.”[sic] He believed her and whipped Puss for lying to him. She commented that she never cursed because she is a good Methodist woman, but she did that day to save herself another whipping.  She talks throughout the interview about her masters whipping her for things she did wrong and things she did not deserve to be whipped for. She even says at one point that her mama’s master, “…whipped his slaves for pastime.”","As described in <em>Roll Jordan, Roll: The World the Slaves Made</em>, slaves were sometimes killed due to excessive whipping. Whipping was a way to break or correct slaves, but abolitionists described this action as inhumane. Slaveholders believed that whippings were better than capital punishment. Their defense was that, “civilized countries like Germany permitted young mine workers-mere boys- to be whipped.” They did not believe that whipping was a crime, and that if it was a crime, it was only minor one.","To find this information about Sarah Frances Shaw Graves and other former slaves, the Works Progress Administration (WPA), conducted interviews with former slaves. The interview was done in person at her home in Skidmore, Missouri. The WPA conducted their series, Born in Slavery: Slave Narratives from the Federal Writers’ Project.

a pressing need for medical services, Sally Tompkins established a hospital after the First Battle of Bull Run that became the best hospital during the Civil War.  Running the hospital was not always easy; Tompkins faced pressure from many people to close down the hospital.  In June of 1864, Dr. Carrington, an inspector of hospitals for the South, filed an order to have the Robertson Hospital closed.  Fed some misinformation, Carrington was under the impression that Tompkins was admitting too many soldiers into her hospital.  In a letter dated June 9, 1864, Tompkins replied, “Dr. Garnett’s endorsement on the morning report of June 5<sup>th</sup> ‘that this Hospital, limited to 19 patients, numbered 44’ was written under a misapprehension of the facts.”  Tompkins was not one to be pushed around.  She was a knowledgeable woman with a strong record to prove it.  Later in the letter, Tompkins states, “I think the register of this Hospital will show as great success in its management of the sick and wounded as any other.  Since the 1<sup>st</sup> of last June, we have had 337 patients and but 8 deaths.  Many of them sent to us were (by the statement of Dr. Garnett made to myself) the worse cases.”  Tompkins understood the vital role her hospital played in the war and did not want to see it closed.","Even as a child, Tompkins tended to those who were ill.  She had a helping heart and desired to put it to good use.  As infirmaries quickly filled after the battle, an intense need for more hospitals arose.  Tompkins knew she could provide a solution, so she asked her friend Judge Robertson if she could use his house to provide medical care to wounded soldiers.  He agreed, and Tompkins readily set to work preparing the building and recruiting staff members.  The first patient was admitted to Robertson Hospital on August 1, 1861.","The hospital was first threatened on September 5, 1861, when the Confederate government ordered that all private hospitals be shut down because some soldiers were faking illness to escape military duty.  Not willing to go down without a fight, Tomkins went to President Davis to ask him to allow her hospital to remain open.  She showed him her carefully kept records to prove her hospital was better than many of the others.  Impressed with her abilities, President Davis appointed her to the position of Captain on September 9, 1861.  This would enable her to keep her hospital open and receive military supplies from the Confederate government.","Her defense of the hospital paid off.  A total of 1,333 patients were treated there, only seventy-three of which died.  This was due in large part to Tompkins’s dedication to cleanliness and strict order.  In a journal article written for <em>America’s Civil War</em>, George Hagerman claimed, “Wounded soldiers coming to Richmond begged to be admitted to her hospital.”  Tompkins was a well respected woman and served an important role as a Captain for the Confederate States of America."],"display_date":"June 9, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-09","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO,

most unique of which was this stained-glass window designed in her honor.  This window portrays her in an almost saint-like manner, put here on earth to do God’s will.  The Angel of Mercy behind her

spiritual needs as well.","Sally Tompkins was born on November 9, 1833 in Mathews County, Virginia.  Even as a child, Tompkins dedicated her time to helping care for others.  A strong family history of military service led her to lend her talents during the Civil War.  On July 31, 1861, Tompkins opened Robertson Hospital in Richmond, Virginia.  In order to keep the hospital running and secure government funding, Jefferson Davis appointed Tompkins Captain of a Confederate cavalry unit.  In an article written for a website, Ron Maggiano stated, “Carrying her Bible and medicine bag, she spent endless hours comforting and healing those in her care.”  Captain Tompkins dedicated her life to the Lord and her time and money to the hospital.  Hagerman wrote, “She never drew any salary for her

There are moments throughout the narrative as a whole where feelings of loneliness or helplessness shine through although she never expresses her opinion because it would be uncharacteristic for a slave to do so.","Bethany Veney was one the slaves in Virginia who never had to endure being sold at the market and worry about being separated from her children by distance. Although Bethany was eventually separated from her children, she managed to reunite with them later on in her life when she became free slave. According to Johnson in <em>Soul by Soul</em>, slaves at the market would often share gossip with one another, but Bethany only had contact with the other slaves she worked with. She did not have to deal with being examined by potential buyers or fear being sold in public. Bethany was sold twice in her life, once after her first master died and the second time she asked to be sold alongside her daughter because she did not like her master, whom she described as harsh and cruel. It was a rare occurrence for slaves to arrange their own sale, but Bethany was unlike most slaves.","When Bethany was finally freed from being a slave she moved about the Northeast at her leisure, often spending time in Worcester, Massachusetts where she would eventually buy a house and settle down. Bethany was also eventually reunited with her children and grandchildren and regularly went down to the South to visit them during the year.

Saving up her earnings to pay for her schooling had been difficult, but her dream of one day being able to teach fellow former slaves to read and write so that they could become better Christians helped her bide her time to ensure that day could come."," ","Slavery in the United States could not be boiled down to a universal experience. The varying degrees of cruelty exhibited by owners created a spectrum of suffering on which the lives of slaves fell. Kate Drumgoold had the good fortune of growing up in the years just before the Civil War broke out in the home of an exceptionally caring owner. She was one of thirteen children, but she was frequently separated from her mother and siblings and the family underwent long periods of time without contact. Drumgoold had no choice in being parted from her family during her younger years, but she would not allow this powerlessness to define her life later down the line. Attending church was an integral part of Drumgoold’s relationship with her ‘white mother,’ as she referred to the wife of her owner, and the education she received there endowed her with a sense of personal empowerment. Upon reaching adulthood, though Drumgoold was technically free, she still depended on the employment of the same families who would have owned her just years earlier. Despite this, Drumgoold disregarded official assignments concerning the location of her work, choosing instead to remain loyal to the families she liked better, the women she felt needed her, and ultimately, herself. She asserted power in a situtation where she seemed to have none."," ","It is true that Drumgoold was already a free woman when she shaped her circumstances, but that does not mean her ancestors were unable to create a sense of agency for themselves. Walter Johnson’s <em>Soul by Soul</em> delves into the mindset and behaviors of all parties involved in the New Orleans slave market—traders, owners, and the slaves themselves. Johnson informs the reader of the ability the slaves in pens had to potentially influence their sales through networks of communication, personal observations, and mastering the art of answering questions. The availability of this opportunity varied and some individuals were more adept at taking advantage of it than others, but what is important is that it did in fact exist."," ","Kate Drumgoold lived in Virginia in a domestic setting, not in New Orleans as a field hand, and she was never put up for auction, but she and the individuals discussed by Johnson exhibited similar skills in manipulation for personal benefit. Those who remained enslaved were only able to control their lives so much, but Drumgoold used the freedom afforded her by time to pay it forward, working to put herself through school so that she in turn could educate other former slaves, continuing the tradition of self-improvement against the odds."," "],"display_date":1870,"search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":13742,"lat":37.3864763379,"lng":-77.5769179581,"zoom":9,"place":"CHESTERFIELD, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5644,"title":"The Commodity of Self: A Tale from the Narrative of Elleanor Eldridge","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1794-03-01","end_date":"1799-03-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1815, at the very young age of ten, the heroine of our narrative, Elleanor Eldridge, lost her mother.

Born in Rhode Island, she was the daughter of a free African-American Man and a female descendent from the Narrahganset tribe. The death of Elleanor’s mother acted as a catalyst that began Elleanor’s life of “self-government and spirited action”(2). Being born into freedom, she was granted many advantages that others of her race still did not possess. However advantageous the circumstances of her birth were, it still did not negate the inferiority of her position within society. It cannot be forgotten that Elleanor was still an African-American girl living in a highly racialized society. She was also the oldest child of the single-parent household with several siblings that needed to be taken care of. While Elleanor was not a slave in the general sense of the word, she was still a slave to the society she was born into. The death of her mother caused Elleanor to sell herself back into a institutionalized version of slavery, where Elleanor was a commodity to the people she served.","Upon the tragic death of her mother, Elleanor packed all of her belongings into a small leather rucksack, kissed each of her brothers and sisters, said goodbye to her father, and set out on a long, dirt road to seek work at the home of her mother’s former employer, the Bakers. The Bakers were an affluent Rhode Island family, who had been very fond of Elleanor's mother. Elleanor, possessing much of her mother's beauty, skill, and charms, was the natural choice for her replacement. Yet, before agreeing to the generous terms of employment that the Baker family had offered her, the ambitious ten-year-old proceeded to bargain the terms of her employment. Through this, Elleanor had placed herself in the “space between person and thing”(1). She was no longer in complete possession of of her own circumstances, and by extension was guilty of selling herself as a commodity, which could be bargained for. However, Elleanor had taken control of the situation through making her own choice of employer. She felt satisfied with the choice she had made for the Bakers maintained a level of respect for Elleanor and possessed the uncommon view of their servants as “belonging to the same great family of man”(2). Elleanor was aware that not all masters shared the same ideals as the Bakers did. Most employers maintained the practice of treating their servants as objects, instead of “accountable beings--as persons indeed, capable of independent thought, feeling, and action--susceptible alike of pleasure and pain, they are considered as the mere appendages of luxury”(2). Through choosing her own employer, power over Elleanor changed hands in Elleanor's favor.","As many faithful years with the Baker Family passed by, Elleanor continued to affect the conditions of her servitude on her own terms. After a year’s work, Elleanor requested that her weekly wages be raised to two cents. From a very young age, Elleanor learned the value of her services and herself as a commodity. From there, she set higher standards for the type of employer she was interested in working for. She was able to have control over her employment circumstances, which was a rarity for her time. She may have had to place herself back into a system she had been lucky to escape at birth, but Elleanor was able to regain control of her own personhood and avocation. She used her circumstances to carve out a place for herself within society as an individual blessed with the freedoms and liberties granted to her."," "],"display_date":"March 1794 - March 1799","search_date":"1796-09-14","locations":[{"id":15349,"lat":41.7585954468,"lng":-71.3839450728,"zoom":7,"place":"Kent, Rhode Island"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":270,"tag":"Freedom"},{"id":468,"tag":"employment"},{"id":1604,"tag":"Female"},{"id":1605,"tag":"Freed Slave"},{"id":1606,"tag":"Liberty"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5645,"title":"The Power of Family Bonds in a Teenage Slave Girl's Story","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-01-01","end_date":"1866-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Mattie J. Jackson wrote her story down after she has achieved her freedom in her late teenage years and published the booklet in 1866 in Lawrence, MA in order to raise money for her education. She had a restless childhood with many ups and downs due to constant changes of location with and without her family members. Actually it is more her family’s story, which she tells it in a very personal but not exaggerated emotional tone, which is maybe even more touching.","Her story shows how important and shaping family bonding was for slaves although it was so difficult to maintain it. Even a constantly changing family provided some sort of communal life as Johnson describes it in his book <em>Soul by Soul</em> and therefore a refugee for all the members. Her mother’s first two husbands were able to escape slavery while she always had to stay only helping them to achieve freedom, nevertheless, she was able to go on and adapt to the new situations in order to protect her children.","Mattie profited various times from the spirit and courage of her mother Ellen Turner. Once she was heavily punished for no reason and their owner did not stop to hit the girl. So Ellen interfered and did not leave her daughter although he threatened to punish her as well. The combined strength of the two granted them some agency as “he was aware [her] mother could usually defend herself against one man, and both of [them] would overpower him.” This was not a helpless family that accepted to be harassed by their owners instead they stood together and tried to make the best of their condition namely bonding in resistance.","Although Ellen tried everything to keep her family together, she and her children eventually became victims of the “chattel principle” which implies that “any slave’s identity might be disrupted as easily as a price could be set and a piece of paper passed from one hand to another.”Relentlessly Ellen and her daughters have been sold separately even though she made a contract with her owner that she would not escape if he promised not to sell her children. However, the slaveholder broke his promise simply because it served his interest seeing only his property and commodity in them, which he could trade as it pleased him. So Ellen and her three children became objects in the trader’s yard serving the mercantilist purpose of bringing back money to the pockets of their owner. At least Ellen managed in having been sold together with her little son leaving one bond unbroken.","Apart from each other they eventually achieved their freedom and mother and son were able to find Mattie in Indianapolis. The strength of the ever-constant bond of affection between them is obvious in Mattie’s phrasing of the event: “I was overjoyed with my personal freedom, but the joy at my mother’s escape was greater than anything I had ever known”. Only a short time later Ellen’s second husband and father of Mattie’s half brother was able to contact the family and invited the children to live with him in Lawrence, MA, which again proves the lingering effect of family bonding among slaves even after many years of separation. This action of an unrelated man Mattie used to know in her childhood was a communal act of affection, which gave her the opportunity to receive an education in New England and live the rest of her life in peaceful freedom."],"display_date":"1846 - 1866","search_date":"1856-07-01","locations":[{"id":7916,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1619,"tag":"family"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5674,"title":"Management in the Home - Scientific Reasoning for Domestic Pursuits","course_id":98,"status":"P","start_date":"9/8/54","end_date":"9/8/54","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dr. Elaine Knowles Weaver of Ohio State University urges women to “analyze their tasks” in this article posted in the New York Time, 1954. The book cited by Dr. Weaver is “Management in the Home”, a joint effort by three female university professors that seeks to apply scientific, deductive reasoning to everyday household tasks. For the women of this book, logical reasoning is not just preferred but necessary for the average American housewife, who can use the skills taught to scientists and economists to better serve their husbands, children, and general family welfare. Whether it be tracking the course of children’s future college aspirations or careful analysis of new purchases to the home, women can better and more efficiently provide for their families.","Part of the use of skilled reasoning in even everyday chores like dishwashing, explains the author, is the mental stimulus provided which might make the dull, boring necessities of life go by quicker. This article speaks to the overall attitude of the 1950s. Though easy to misrepresent as complacent, accepting of male activity and female stagnation and the division of public and private spheres, the reality is much more complicated. For all that women’s place in domesticity is reinforced by such books as “Management in the Home”, they also represent a certain contradiction. Jessamyn Neuhous writes in the Journal of Women’s History that women in the 1950s were aware of the boredom and emotional stress created by their isolated environments.","Topics specifically focused on women were redirected to fit gender norms, but works still existed which actively acknowledged women’s intelligence and need for intellectual pursuits. Women could think like scientists, but it was only acceptable for such thoughts to be directed toward ‘womanly’ subjects. A woman’s place was in the home, but plentiful literature exists showing women expressing their dissatisfaction with such lives without quite transgressing the social boundaries – letters directed toward’s womens magazines and housewife-heroines of women’s science fiction are two examples of such, while the careful complaints addressed in this 1953 New York Times article are another."],"display_date":"September 8, 1954","search_date":"1954-09-08","locations":[{"id":30880,"lat":39.96955852,"lng":-83.0093502958,"zoom":9,"place":"Franklin, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision: 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":98,"school_id":5}},{"id":5678,"title":"<strong>From Front Porch to North Portico</strong>","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/20","end_date":"11/30/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Even though most historians today view Warren G. Harding as one of the worst U.S. presidents, he was a very modern and innovative thinker even before becoming president.  His presidential campaign in 1920 is a prime example of this.  What historically has been called his “front porch” campaign captured the imagination of the public.  It was the first campaign to be heavily covered by the press, receive widespread newsreel coverage and use the power of Hollywood and Broadway stars.      Movie Stars, conservative businessmen and common folks traveled to Marion, Ohio for photo opportunities with Harding and his wife.  Big name public figures such as Al Jolson, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Douglas Fairbanks, Harvey Firestone and Mary Pickford were among the many celebrities to travel to his home from across the country.","Considered handsome and very photogenic, the campaign drew upon Harding’s popularity with the women and more than a few Republicans thought with his looks and his charm would attract enough women voters to win the election.  However, it was Harding’s support for women’s suffrage in the Senate that actually made him extremely popular with women.  The ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in August 1920 brought huge crowds of women to Marion, Ohio to hear Harding.  This would be the first election in which women voted.","Having won the Republican Party nomination on his wholesomeness, common folk attitude and good looks, Harding’s campaign was seen as having a distinguished presidential profile.  The Republican Party platform condemned the Wilson administration for its handling of World War I and opposed the League of Nations.  Sensing the nation’s fatigue, Harding used the slogan “A Return to Normalcy” throughout his front-porch campaign. Given that “return to normalcy” is a Harding cliché made-up by him when he should have used the word normality, this “return to normalcy” phrase is still used today by many in the political world. Deciding that he liked the sound of the word, he made “Return to Normalcy” a recurring theme in his campaign.  Harding promised to return the nation to more normal times – i.e., renewed isolationism in reaction to World War I, a resurgence of nativism and a turning away from government activism of the reform era.","On election night November 2, 1920, which by the way was Harding’s 55<sup>th</sup> birthday, the first commercial radio broadcast coverage of election returns was heard.  Radio broadcasts and commercials ushered in a new style of campaigning and reached a wider audience – radio had become a new political medium. Harding won the presidential election in a massive landslide victory and became the twenty-ninth president of the United States. It is interesting to note that he carried the state of Tennessee – the first time a formerly Confederate state voted Republican since Reconstruction ended.  Even though Harding followed one of the most visionary of all our Presidents, Woodrow Wilson, it is important to note that Harding also brought revolutionary ideas and invoked his era’s technological expertise to use on the campaign trail.  While Harding’s presidency will always be remembered for the first election in which women voted, his presidency helped bring calm and serenity to our nation in a tumultuous time."],"display_date":"June - November 1920","search_date":"1920-08-31","locations":[{"id":20723,"lat":40.5872658903,"lng":-83.1608707945,"zoom":10,"place":"Marion, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5717,"title":"The Role of Women in Nazi Germany","course_id":110,"status":"P","start_date":"9/1/41","end_date":"9/30/41","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Role of Women in Nazi Germany","Nazis are often thought of as men, but many women contributed to the Nazi nation in Germany according to this newsletter in <em>Nachrichtendienst der Reichsfrauenführung Sonderdien</em>.

Gerlach’s article stated it was un-German to use products to change hair color or to change one's looks with cosmetics.

In Mobile, Alabama, the Commission distributed a pamphlet using the fear of Hitler as motivation to work, asserting that as long women helped “build ships, more ships to transport our men, tanks, planes and munitions” Hitler wouldn’t “come to our shores.”  It also noted that housing at that time would not permit any new migration of workers to take the Mobile jobs which was why women were so badly needed.  At the time of its printing in 1942, this pamphlet urged that 6 million more women were needed from the 4 million already “employed in America’s war industries.”","It is more than obvious that in America during World War Two, women came when they were called.  As Karen Anderson pointed out, by the wartime peak in 1944, 19 million were employed, an increase of almost fifty percent since March 1940.  Also between these four years, the number of women employed in manufacturing jobs increased 141 percent while domestic service employees decreased by about 20 percent.  Women formally working as waitresses, maids, and saleswomen dominated jobs as welders, riveters, taxicab drivers and so on.","However patriotic it seemed for women to contribute, Anderson went on to reveal war work was not glamorous or enlightening as suggested in pamphlets and it had a disrupting influence on gender roles.  Once women entered the “men’s world”, they encountered more problems than they expected.  Since most women had never worked before, training for dangerous jobs such as welding was imperative.  Few courses were offered as part of in-plant training.  This meant that about four to eight hours in classes were added to an already forty-eight hour long work week.  Training centers were frequently located in residential areas rather than close to the plants, adding to another problem experienced throughout the war boom, transportation.  Serious transportation problems rose with wartime shortages that extended the amount of time women were away from home.  Being away from home so much left women distraught in trying to properly care for their children and catch up on housework.  American policy makers were not helpful in easing women’s duel burden during the Second World War. Thus the high rates of absenteeism among female workers revealed the most compelling evidence of calamity created by war times.","With the problems that evolved it is obvious that women were apt to put their lives on hold for the greater good of the country.  With propaganda urging them to consider if they could “be of greater service” at “home or in a war plant” how could they turn their backs in such critical times of need?"],"display_date":1942,"search_date":"1942-07-02","locations":[{"id":26301,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"Mobile, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}},{"id":5752,"title":"Women and Aviation","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/43","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","It was the year1930 and a new form of travel was taking over: aviation.

[1]","Many of the girls that had grown up with planes flying over their homes decided to enlist in the army as pilots. People were not content with the idea of female pilots; they believed that a woman’s place was at home with the children. Because of this thought, the military was against having women enlist as aviators. The military branches that involved combat rejected women. The aviation branch said no to women pilots until 1942. As war broke out the american government was in need of more able-bodied people and thus allowed women (and other minorities) to enlist into the army.[2]","Jackie Cochran first brought the idea of WASP- Women Aviation Service Pilots- to Eleanor Roosevelt the first lady at the time.  Though the idea was at first rejected ,Cochran was eventually called back and asked to lead the division.Cochran was chosen to lead the devision because of her exceptional skills as an aviator.At first the military was skeptical, but as they began to see women fulfilling expectations they became more accepting of there new roles.

there were huge negative transformations in American politics, economics, and social and cultural systems (Ford 2004, 664), including escalating inequality and increasing marginalized groups within society (665).  American women, being one of the marginalized groups, decided to renounce their stance in national and international politics by exercising their rights gained from the Women’s Suffrage Movement of the 1920’s (Hensley 2006, 150).  With their newly acquired rights, women demonstrated their commitment to peace and equality by forming feminist groups.  According to Melissa Hensley, these organizations conducted rallies and petitions, presented public demonstrations, and gave speeches in regards to the withdrawal of militarism worldwide (147).  Peace activities even filtered through universities and colleges, promoting ideas on campus through student strikes, and national and regional meetings (152).","Having said that, worldwide military disarmament became a main objective for feminists, as it was believed that pacifism would bring an end to war (Hill, Porter, Thomas 1933, 16).  Because during this time men were perceived as being incapable of achieving peace due to their “aggressiveness” and desire for “power and dominion”, women of the 1930’s jumped at the opportunity to organize peace, as they were seen as being well-suited for the cause; they were assumed to be “caretakers of life” and responsible for the preservation and wellbeing of earth (Hensley 146-147).  Thus, it is no wonder then, that students attending Mount Holyoke College wrote that letter to the Editor of the <em>New York Times</em> promoting international disarmament at the Geneva Disarmament Conference of 1932.  Women were taking prominent positions in national and international military politics, and the students attending Mount Holyoke College are just a few of the many women living in postwar America who were greatly influenced by, and participated in various feminist movements in hopes of achieving peace to end war."],"display_date":"February 6, 1933","search_date":"1933-02-06","locations":[{"id":23165,"lat":42.3436165724,"lng":-72.6413336945,"zoom":9,"place":"Hampshire, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":1783,"tag":"Peace"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":117,"school_id":28}},{"id":5762,"title":"Bessie Coleman, The first African American Female Aviator","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/11","end_date":"12/31/26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Bessie Coleman looked at her twelve siblings and mother picking cotton in the hot Texas sun and thought, \"If we're going to better ourselves, we've got to get above these cotton fields.” She diverted her eyes from the field and looked up at the sky, finding her solution, aviation.

These remarkable women were a constant reminder that although she was a minority her dream could be achieved. Even though she was discriminated because of her race, librarians were so surprised that an African American girl was requesting the books they let her read them. The stories contained in each book served as constant fuel for her dream to one-day fly like the Baranoss Raymonde de la Roche and Harriet Quimby. [2]","Bessie Coleman knew she would not have the opportunity to learn how to fly a plane in America because of the sexism and racism. When she approached American flying schools she would constantly get the door slammed in her face, but she did not let this keep her from perusing her dream. She found that Europe had no restrains for aviation through her research, and after a year of saving her money from waitressing, and learning French, Bessie Coleman left America to seek an aviation title in France.[3]","Bessie received her aviation license from the Federation Aeronautique Interenationale and upon her return to America she became known as the first black women aviator. She often performed in aviation shows where she executed complicated aerial tricks that earned her a reputation as a daredevil in the sky. [4]","Bessie Coleman is an inspiration to women all over the world. She was told that she couldn’t fly because of her race and gender, but she ignored this, not stopping until she was a certified aviator."," "," "," "," "," ","[1]Julianne Malveaux, ”Black Issues in Higher Education”, Matthews & Associates, Vol. 16 (2000): 34","[2] Ron Edwards, “Aviation History”, Cowles Enthusiast Mediam, No 2 (1998). 3","[3] <em>Encyclopedia Britannica Online</em>, s. v. \"Bessie Coleman,\" accessed November 11, 2013.","[4] Laurel Graeber, “ Finding the Path To Freedom”, New York Times, Weekend FINE ARTS LEISURE, Feb 13, 1998."," "],"display_date":"1911 - 1926","search_date":"1918-12-31","locations":[{"id":16047,"lat":34.9649271052,"lng":-101.357407374,"zoom":9,"place":"Armstrong, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":1769,"tag":"Aviation"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":5790,"title":"Women, Automobiles, and Advertisements.","course_id":114,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/20","end_date":"12/31/29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","“Motoring can ruin the finest skin,” the Pond’s advertisement boasts. Beauty products and motor vehicles may not seem to go hand in hand, but the ever changing cultural landscape of the 1920s saw many companies addressing the needs of the new age woman. In 1920 Pond’s published their advertisement in the <em>New York American Sun </em>newspaper; the product was a vanishing cream that, the company promised, could protect from sunburn and pore clogging dust. It also offered a cold cream which could help cleanse the skin after “a long motor trip.” This advertisement clipping highlights the trend of women who enjoyed “motoring.”","When automobiles were first created, many saw them as a luxury. By the early, 1920s the moving assembly line gave way to true mass production, which, in turn, created lower prices for automobiles. Vehicles were no longer seen as luxuries or toys for vehicle enthusiasts. Although vehicle registrations increased from 8.1 million in 1920 to 23 million in the late 1920s, motoring was still considered a manly sport. Motor cars were seen as a piece of masculinity that was both difficult and dirty to drive. Yet, many women sought driving as an act of independence and ignored naysayers who believed that women were incapable of learning how to operate a vehicle.","Famous women like Edith Wharton, Gertrude Stein, and Rose Wilder Lane publicized their use of the vehicle, inspiring housewives all over the country to do the same. The Suffragette Movement also pushed women to gain independence from their husbands and fathers. Women who lived in urban areas where roads were paved and petrol stations were readily available began owning and driving vehicles. In the country, wives of farmers used the automobile as a way to shop in nearby towns, run errands, take care of farm business, and visit with friends.","The push for the woman’s suffrage amendment and World War I made women a primary consumer. During the war many women became the sole providers in their households, when their men returned many continued their lives in the workforce which created disposable income. With the new trend of female drivers and workers many companies found new ways to market to them. Despite women no longer being seen as simply housewives, advertisers still kept up the “housewife” image. Ads did not promote women’s political and economic status, but focused on their social status instead. There were two ideas behind marketing campaigns centered on automobiles in the 1920s: (1) women were only concerned with the aesthetic quality of the vehicle they drove and (2) they were concerned with their appearance while driving.","Advertisers were not above pushing the image that women placed a higher importance on their personal style and appearance than other aspects of life. It was believed that women spent time choosing gowns, hats and shoes that complimented her driving habits and did not pay much attention to the mechanics of motoring. Pond’s understood that while many women enjoyed their newfound independence they did not stop subscribing to “Victorian” social mores, which instructed women to remain classy, elegant and fashionable at all times. If their skin was damaged by the sun, dust and wind it would ruin their flawless image. A woman who used Pond’s beauty products would be able to have the best of both worlds; freedom and youthful beauty."],"display_date":"1920 - 1929","search_date":"1924-12-31","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1544,"tag":"automobile"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":730,"tag":"Advertising"},{"id":1833,"tag":"Pond's Extract Co."}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":6067,"title":"Southern, Sassy, and Strong","course_id":122,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-06-05","end_date":"1865-04-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Midnight train rides, cleaning wounds and changing dressing was not the job for a proper Southern woman.

Marion Sims started his day with his routine house-to-house calls in Montgomery, Alabama. Dr. Sims was a well-established and distinguished practitioner of medicine who came to Alabama from South Carolina to establish his own medical practice; he was also best known for his accomplishments in Women’s health and for the establishment of the first Women’s Hospital in the state of Alabama. While on his routine house call, he was notified by a friend that Mrs. Merrill, who was the wife of a prominent farmer, was terribly ill. Upon his arrival, Dr. J. Marion Sims described the situation at hand. ““She was in bed, complaining of great pain in her back, and a sense of tenesmus in both the bladder and rectum, the bearing down making her condition miserable”. Dr. Sims had to act fast on the female patient. Dr. Sims remembered two things while this emergency took place. First he remembered how much he “hated investigating the organs of the female pelvis”, and he also remembered his professor Dr. Prioleau of the Charleston Medical College, who said, “Gentlemen, if any of you are ever called to a case of sudden version of the uterus backward, you must place the patient on the knees and elbows-in a genu-pectoral position- and then introduce one finger into the rectum and another into the vagina, and push up, and pull down”. After executing protocol, Dr. Sims knew ultimately he had to get the uterus in position by using this method prescribed above. Mrs. Merrill was screaming from the top of her lungs as Dr. Sims still hand deep in her vagina pushed his hand toward the lady’s uterus wall and turned his hand upward and downward pushing with all his might until he could no longer feel her uterus or her womb. Mrs. Merrill enduring all of this pain suddenly said “Why, doctor, I am relived.” Just then as Mrs. Merrill was about to lie down on her back, she let out an explosion. Mrs. Merrill was speechless and bashful, but Dr. Sims knew this escape of gas was not from the bowel, but from the vagina. Dr. Sims had a revelation. He thought if the pressure in the vagina could be released in a certain way by the positioning of the body and other methods, he may have an explanation for a possible cure for vesico-vaginal fistula.","Vesico-vaginal fistula is an abnormal fistulous tract extending between the bladder and the vagina that allows the continuous involuntary discharge of urine into the vaginal vault. This abnormality is caused by complications in child births or other extreme causes. This female abnormality was very common and Dr. Sims was the leading doctor who experimented, tested, and always tried to seek a solution for this occurrence. His main subjects or guinea pigs were often on African American women. His leading test subject was a slave by the name of Betsy who suffered from this complication. Once the complication was solved for the first time on Mrs. Merrill, Dr. Sims immediately went to his test subject Betsy and performed an operation to heal her infirmities. Throughout the years Dr. J. Marion Sims overcame many medical feats and saved a countless number of women through his expertise, but he is sometimes viewed as a bad guy. According to Dr. L. L. Wall who wrote in The Journal of Medical Ethics, we see that there are some who defend his surgical practice. “Modern critics have discounted the enormous suffering experienced by fistula victims, have ignored the controversies that surrounded the introduction of anesthesia into surgical practice in the middle of the 19th century, and have consistently misrepresented the historical record in their attacks on Sims.” Dr. Wall acknowledges that Dr. Sims used enslaved African Americans as his guinea pigs, but it was not because they were vulnerable, it was due to the incredible suffering they endured on a constant basis. Dr. Sims was the only physician who had an alternative to their pains."],"display_date":"January 10, 1836","search_date":"1836-01-10","locations":[{"id":298,"lat":32.2469172256,"lng":-86.1720796894,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":463,"tag":"African American Women"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":220,"tag":"alabama"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":2192,"tag":"Montgomery, Alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6077,"title":"<strong>ABC launches <em>American Bandstand</em> to a National Audience</strong>","course_id":123,"status":"P","start_date":"8/5/57","end_date":"8/5/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 5, 1957, groups of Philadelphia teenagers met up at the WFIL studio on Market Street to partake in the popular dance show phenomenon, <em>American Bandstand</em>. The show, hosted by Dick Clark, debuted nationally on August 5 as a product of the American Broadcast Company (ABC). In J.P. Shanley’s <em>New York Times</em> review of <em>American Bandstand</em>’s premiere from August 6, 1957, he stated that “Viewers who are beyond voting age are not likely to derive much pleasure from ‘American Bandstand’ the disk jockey show that began yesterday.” Shanley gave clear reasons why older viewers would dislike the show. He explained what the “attractive group of youngsters” wore: “pretty gowns” for the girls and for the boys, “there were no motorcycle jackets and hardly a sideburn in the crowd.”  He criticized the dancing on the show and Dick Clark’s hosting. Shanley was not impressed by <em>American Bandstand</em> and called it “almost identical to that of a show that has been conducted in here over Channel 9” as a warning to adults in the area to stay away. The <em>Times</em> portrayed <em>American Bandstand</em> as a mediocre show entirely directed at a teenage audience.","By bringing<em> Bandstand</em> to a national network and advertising show-themed products to more viewers, Dick Clark became a popular television figure in the already forming teenage consumer culture of the 1950s. One of the leading historians of <em>American Bandstand</em>, Matthew Delmont, in his book, <em>The Nicest Kids in Town,</em> claimed, “<em>American Bandstand’s</em> daily images encouraged teenagers to imagine themselves as a part of a national audience enjoying the same music and dances at the same time.” Delmont also explained: “by representing the show’s teenagers consuming all of these products, <em>American Bandstand</em> constructed a national youth culture centered on simultaneous consumption” that imitated the larger consumer culture of America in 1957.","When asked by author Michael Shore about <em>Bandstand</em> going national, one of the regular dancers from the show, Justine Carrelli, responded, “That first network show had to be the first, last, and only time I can recall ever seeing Dick Clark acting the least bit nervous.” It was one of the only days when Dick Clark and show producer Tony Mammarella had to hand over control of <em>Bandstand</em> to network producers. The show lost much of its local flavor when ABC producers changed the interior design to a generic, national backdrop by adding a United States map and discarded local high school pennants. Delmont said, “When ABC decided to take <em>Bandstand</em> national in 1957, dozens of local markets had or would soon start their own teen dance shows.” It was those changes ABC made when debuting nationally that caused teenagers to tune into <em>American Bandstand</em> instead of their local programs. Even though the show displeased critics like Shanley, ABC guaranteed that <em>Bandstand</em> became a facet of American popular culture until the show finished in 1989 because it created a mainstream teenage culture in the United States and popularized television shows created for a specific youth audience."],"display_date":"August 5, 1957","search_date":"1957-08-05","locations":[{"id":30458,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":2197,"tag":"Television"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":123,"school_id":3}},{"id":6169,"title":"Women's Roles in Mid-Nineteenth Century Massachusetts","course_id":136,"status":"P","start_date":"1843-07-25","end_date":"1843-08-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the sweltering months of late summer, Laban Morey Wheaton, a cotton textile manufacturer and entrepreneur of one of the wealthiest and most respected families in the area, was recording the transactions he made with the “quiet, relatively prosperous community” of Norton, Massachusetts. One member of this community with who he made several transactions was Mary A. Wrigley. At the end of July Mary Wrigley purchased a spool of thread at eight cents from him, and a couple of weeks later she borrowed fifteen dollars cash in order to go to Boston. These transactions are quite significant due to her position as a woman in mid- nineteenth century New England. The fact that her name appeared in these transactions could mean she was a single woman or a widow, but either way Mary Wrigley clearly had a great deal of financial independence.","According to common law, adult single woman had a significant amount of power to own property and make financial transactions during the mid nineteenth century. But once they were married, women effectively lost their legal identity. The fact that Wrigley bought a spool of thread speaks to a distinctively feminine purchase, and may help conclude that she was a well off woman who had the leisure time to use thread to make items for her friends and family. The nineteenth century placed duties such as shopping for provisions to make clothes as not an economic function, but an emotional and social one which would have been influenced by the distinct choice of spool she would have made with her unique knowledge of the personalities and style of those she would be making something for. Her borrowing of the rather larger sum of fifteen dollars to travel into Boston also shows that this was a relatively prosperous, independent woman who had extra means and extra time. The nineteenth century roles prescribed to middle and upper class women in New England listed childcare as the primary responsibility, so Wrigley’s ability to take time off may mean she was an independent woman with no family of her own and deceased parents (since otherwise a father would most likely still control her finances) or she was an older widow whose children no longer needed taking care of."],"display_date":"July 25, 1843 - August 9, 1843","search_date":"1843-08-01","locations":[{"id":6120,"lat":41.5286517402,"lng":-71.0500153769,"zoom":9,"place":"BRISTOL, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":686,"tag":"Wheaton"},{"id":685,"tag":"accounting records"},{"id":684,"tag":"mid-nineteenth century"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":228,"tag":"Roles of Women"},{"id":1263,"tag":"financial"}],"course":{"name":"Junior Colloquium: Historical Methods","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":136,"school_id":2}},{"id":6283,"title":"The Great Depression and Household Management Columns","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"10/1/29","end_date":"1/31/36","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Following the stock market crash of October and the resulting American economic collapse, Maryland families were left haphazardly arrayed on a financial spectrum starting with “making do” and ending with scrounging. Wives and mothers often managed the day to day expenditures within families and those in the newly reduced middle class adapted and reframed the economic decisions that they made. Women living in towns and cities dealt with their new money problems and simultaneously struggled with the stigma attached to talking about financial problems and the need to keep up appearances. Since personal help and advice on how to save money remained somewhat taboo, women found help in the Women’s sections and household maintenance columns in local newspapers. Through these columns women managed to build a wide reaching but anonymous support network.","These columns ran before the depression but after the economic crash they too adapted and reflected the economic needs of women during the Great Depression. The women’s section of newspapers usually covered roughly two pages and offered a myriad of advice and help to women trying to cut costs. The Daily Mail of Hagerstown, Maryland, ran a weekly Food Market Advice column for women. Information in the column included the rise and fall of prices for local produce and meats and predicted patterns for future prices providing women with needed information for weekly shopping and encouragement to take advantage of local markets. The column also provided meal ideas and menus for the cheapest options. Other articles gave advice about meal plans and offered set prices that they believed could be followed, touting $1.50 or $2.00 plans that could feed large families. Often the advice became extremely detailed. A column titled Sister Mary's Kitchen ran in the Fredrick, Maryland, News. The writer advised women about which cuts of meat cooked the quickest so they might save money on electricity. She noted that the money saved by cooking quickly could be set aside to pay for heating bills. Some columns offered direct tips on how to discretely cut costs so that women could maintain their middle class appearance. These tips ranged from cooking advice --telling women to mix butter and margarine to stretch it farther and hide the taste-- to sewing --advising that dresses could be let down and that ribbon or rickrack could hide the old seams and creases.","Usually these columns were also conscious of the social conventions of the time period and refrained from using terms like “cheap” or “thrifty.” Economical became the standard term used to describe the advice and alert women reading it that they could find advice there. The columns that offered advice also obeyed social conventions by giving women in need of help and advice the anonymity needed to ask.

Advertisers and propaganda agencies created fictional characters such as Rosie the Riveter to inspire women. Advertisements calling on women to support the war effort were widely published and distributed. All of these mechanisms encouraged women to enter the work force. Women answered the call. While women's wartime industrial work is well-known, less well known is the fact that women also engaged in homefront agricultural work by joining the Women’s Land Army.","The goal of the Women’s Land Army was to fill the roles men had left behind on farms while they were away fighting.

a warm June day in the year 1966, 28 frustrated women went to Washington D.C. to attend the third National Conference of Commissions.[1]  The topic for this conference was the status of women in the United States.  While some believed that women became equal in America the moment that they gained the vote, others, these 28 women specifically, believed that the U.S. still had a long way to go to gain equality between the sexes.  Yet upon attending the conference they felt that not enough of the issues were being dealt with or even discussed.  Issues like that of equal opportunities for employment for both sexes.[2]  These 28 intelligent and educated women experienced first-hand the discrimination and limitations that came with being a woman in the job market during that time.[3]  Even though, governmental departments such as the Women’s Bureau may have been putting out reports of female contentment in the private sphere, or the home, these women said different.[4]  Soon after the conference these 28 women founded the National Organization for Women, an American Feminist Advocacy group.","These 28 women after leaving the conference threw their anger at the lack of progress for women into creating an activist feminist organization whose goal was to attempt to tip the scales in the favor of women everywhere in America.[5]  They wanted to challenge a system that would have much preferred women remain in their supposedly traditional roles in the home.[6]  Also to give a voice to the issues that women cared about and effected them directly, on a political and national scale.  With the help of Betty Friedman, the author of <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>, these women formed a feminist civil rights group.  Friedman also came up with the idea to name the group “NOW” or the National Organization for Women.[7]  Books like Friedman’s <em>Feminine Mystique </em>helped to create a consciousness in the United States which led to more discontentment with the status of women in the country.[8]  This consciousness along with many other factors contributed to the women’s movement in that time and eventually the creation of the National Organization for Women.","Later as NOW grew to include chapters all across the United States they felt the need to share their origin story.  So pamphlets were distributed, recounting the narrative of the founding of the organization to the newly formed chapters all over the country.  This most likely give the new chapters a sense of connection to the group on its national level.  Rather than just each individual chapter creating its own ideology and goals, NOW wanted all the chapters to understand the importance of the ideas that the organization was founded upon and the goal of helping women to gain their

them from the school and see what a vacuum there would be” claimed Esthena Randolph of the groups and clubs formed and carried out by women at Augustana prior to and through the 1920s. In fact, the “Berean Bible Class, the Edward Everett Debating Club, the Oriole Chorus, and the Augustana Women’s Club owe[d] their existence entirely to women.” During the 1920s, often known as the progressive era, women in education were beginning to make big moves for themselves and stand out in academia. These major changes were happening very fast as Randolph rightly noted that it had not been many years that women had been “tolerated” at Augustana because in the beginning, only men had attended the college.","After the first woman was admitted to Augustana in 1883, women’s presence continually went up and the Rockety-I newspaper took note of this change and asked her to write an article about their progress. Proudly, Randolph explained how far women in education had come from the days of 1886 where women were not allowed to “recite” in the classrooms until they took a stand and were “welcomed with awed admiration” as their voices were finally heard in the classroom. Being able to form clubs and participate in class changed what college meant to women at this time.","Coming of age as woman in this era had often been defined by marriage, but these women were breaking that barrier and they knew it. Claudia Goldin studied three different cohorts of female students in her working paper entitled “The Meaning of College in the Lives of American Women: The Past One-Hundred Years.” Included within one of these cohorts were women who attended college and graduated between 1900 to 1920. She examined the choices of these college women and discovered that they were marrying at lower rates because “college permitted women to be more discerning in their choice of lifestyle and husband” and many women furthered their education and got jobs as teachers. Important to Randolph’s account of college women is Goldin’s findings that men did not necessarily “like” educated women because of their choice between family and career. Randolph used a more positive position, elevating the women at Augustana, because men were recognizing their feats instead of scorning them. In turn, Randolph’s article was also a tribute to the men of Augustana and the institution as a whole."],"display_date":1921,"search_date":"1921-07-02","locations":[{"id":20952,"lat":41.4673534696,"lng":-90.5674122327,"zoom":9,"place":"Rock Island, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":780,"tag":"college"},{"id":2651,"tag":"Clubs"},{"id":2652,"tag":"Equality of Sexes"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6338,"title":"The Role Education Played in Suffrage","course_id":144,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-01","end_date":"12/31/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There she was, standing before Augustana College’s class of 1915 as Valedictorian. Margaret Olmsted gave a speech at commencement on the importance on what it meant to receive a liberal education. Olmsted made the claim that a liberal arts education gave recipients a “broader view and keener insight”[1] to the world. An education such as that comes with a greater reasonability claimed Olmsted; someone that has received a liberal arts education must work to make the world a better place.[2]","At the end of the nineteenth-century and beginning of the twentieth-century women increasingly enrolled into higher education. With the influx in college attendance, women became exposed to worldly views that had been previously less available to them. With the knowledge they were gaining from college, women started to act on that knowledge, which included fighting for more rights such as suffrage.  Part of the movement occurred after the Civil War; due to the role nurses played in the war, nurses started to want more training, more education, and more responsibilities. From 1870 to 1880, white, middle class women enrolled in higher education went from 11,000 to 40,000. Women started to put their progressive education to good use.[3] Education was the catalyst that empowered many women to become involved in movements such as the suffrage movement.","As Olmsted said to her classmates as they were about to graduate, those “who understand things better and know more about the remedies for existing conditions, are more to blame if we do not endeavor to make things right.”[4] Calling to action all that received a higher education, Olmsted wanted her classmates to go forth, making the world’s wrongs into rights. Though Olmsted did not highlight which problems she was speaking of, there is little chance that Olmsted and her classmates had not heard of Alice Paul. Two years prior to the commencement speech, in 1913, college educated Alice Paul led one of the  largest parades of the time through Washington, DC.[5]  Instead of greeting soon to be President Wilson, crowds gather in support of Paul’s suffrage parade which marked the beginning of a campaign that would eventually led to the passage of the 19<sup>th</sup> amendment.[6] Two people and one group that all with college education, fighting for a better tomorrow. Paul and the nurses were clearly working for the passage of women’s suffrage. Olmsted was making broader claims for her class to get involved in bettering the world, showing how college education was a catalyst for social issue involvement.","It is clear that as more and more women began to receive higher education, women became increasingly involved in social issues. Many women had different reasons for becoming involved in the suffrage movement. One reason can easily be that as women became educated, especially with a liberal arts education like Olmsted received from Augustana College, they become more aware of social inconsistences and were equipped with the knowledge to solve those issues."," ","[1] Margaret Olmsted, “A Liberal Education,” <em>Augustana Observer: Commencement 1915 May 1915</em>, Vol. XIII.

Chi Omega Gamma was founded by Helen Sheveland, Dorothy Youngberg, Lois Oline, Lorraine Ossain, Clarice Swanson, Lillian Wilson and Mildred Anderson. These women saw the need for another social organization on Augustana College’s campus. They felt Augustana needed more “spirit.”  Little did these women know, spirit would be very helpful in just a few short years.","In order to make any organization successful there need to be rules and expectations for the members to follow. The seven women, along with two pledges, set rules and regulations as well as the goals they wanted their organization to achieve. First they started with a monthly meeting.  To run these meetings, and the sorority effectively, they made four primary positions: President, Vice President, Historian, and Treasurer.","During the Great Depression many college aged woman were financially affected by the stock market crash in the late 1920s. Samuel Haig Jameson found that one of the biggest issues for college women in the early 1930s was money. The women felt pressure from their parents to conserve money, which only added stress to the already hectic college life.","While the Chi Omega Gamma sorority had been growing for over five years, its members were not above the economic crisis happening during this time. The group vowed, back in 1925, to hold no more than two social events per year. Next, they decided on system to pay for these events, and made mandatory monthly fees, or dues; each woman was required to pay her share in order to be active in the sorority.  Without this money, the sorority would not hold these social events, and, as a result, would lose the opportunity to recruit new members.","During this economic hardship, the women of Chi Omega Gamma found solace in their sisterhood and banded together to move the sorority forward."],"display_date":"1925 - 1933","search_date":"1929-07-02","locations":[{"id":20952,"lat":41.4673534696,"lng":-90.5674122327,"zoom":9,"place":"Rock Island, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":2654,"tag":"Sorority"},{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1946,"tag":"Higher Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6343,"title":"Winsome Womanhood: Christianity as a Progressive Influence on Women’s Identity and Values During the Early 20th Century","course_id":144,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"12/31/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“O Lord and Master of us all,","Whate’er our name or sign,","We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,","We test our lives by Thine.”"," ","Winsome Womanhood, a book written by Margaret Sangster, provided young women of the early 20th century with a connection to God as well as a purpose/identity within the Christian faith. It was Sangster’s belief that all women, regardless of age, could benefit from the teachings of the Bible and understand the meaning of what it means to be a true Christian woman. Living during a time when religion was not at the forefront of what structured society, women such as Sangster were adamant about keeping the ideals of Christianity close and informing women about how the message of God can be used to empower them as individuals at every stage in their life.","The book is broken into sections directed at women of different ages and from different walks of life. A young woman of fifteen, not yet a woman and no longer a girl, would look to this book and find guidance. During this time of transition from childhood to adulthood, the only true source of wisdom cannot come from mothers or teachers alone, but from God, and young women at this stage in life were encouraged to take time for themselves and read the Bible or pray to seek the answers they needed in order to grow into well-rounded women - women of faith. “A room of her very own, a tastefully appointed and comfortably furnished as possible, should be every young girl’s retreat. Here she may enjoy the half hours for devotion which tend to the soul’s growth . . . In this, her den, her nook, her bower, her special fancies may be indulged, and her individuality find fit expression”(Sangster, 25). Winsome Womanhood was not only, then, a guide for women to find faith and keep it, but also a guide for women to find liberation and individuality through their faith as Christian women, as opposed to feeling trapped by it.","She also speaks to working women or, “The Girl in Business.” It was not uncommon for a working woman of the early 1900’s to feel diminished in her role when compared to a working man - making less money, earning less respect - but Sangster’s view on the role of working women was not so. “Many young women belittle their employment by going to it in the spirit of martyrs who pty themselves . . . Self-pity is a badge of weakness, and work done for money alone is never noble work” (Sangster, 67). It was Sangster’s belief that women should take pride in their work, as women of honor and duty within the Christian faith, and not take pride solely in their wages. This assertion was not uncommon among Christian [Protestant] society at this time, as many women and men affiliated with Protestant denominations were involved in social activism and issues such as fair wages and voting rights for women around this time, as pointed out by Lori Ginzberg in her discussion of the “benevolent” work of women. Ginzberg states that, during this era of progression, “tensions about paying wages, centralizing corporate functions, relating benevolence to government, and using funds solely for administrative purposes all came into the open” (Ginzberg, 161). Sangster’s ideas, then, in regards to Christianity as a positive influence in women’s lives could also be interpreted as viewing religion as a force for equality and empowerment during this progressive age.","Overall, the message Margaret Sangster seems to be sending with Winsome Womanhood is that women of all stages in life, all positions, all classes, could be empowered and liberated through the study and adherence to Christian ideals and faith, and that God’s word should not be ignored, even as the world progresses."," "],"display_date":"1890 - 1910","search_date":"1900-07-02","locations":[{"id":2962,"lat":41.4673534696,"lng":-90.5674122327,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCK ISLAND, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":2642,"tag":"Augustana College"},{"id":1269,"tag":"Social Morality"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":1205,"tag":"Women's History"},{"id":228,"tag":"Roles of Women"},{"id":849,"tag":"Progressive Era"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":514,"tag":"Christianity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6352,"title":"<strong>Ada James sure showed them!</strong> The ratification the 19th amendment in Wisconsin.","course_id":141,"status":"P","start_date":"11/1/19","end_date":"11/1/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Ada James was a key figure in the women's suffrage movement in Wisconsin.  She and her family played an instrumental part in Wisconsin's ratification of the 19th amendment.  In one of Ada's diary entry's she stated, \"it is unjust to hold mothers responsible for the morals of their children while denying them a voice on municipal conditions making up their environment.\"  Tis quote shows Ada's desire for change and a logical reasoning for a long overdue ratification of the 19th amendment.  It also demonstrates her values which stem from her mother a longtime Wisconsin suffragist and her father a strong supporter of the movement.","Ada's father was in fact the reason Wisconsin narrowly beat their rivals to the south Illinois, in the honor of being the first to ratify the 19th amendment.  David James, Ada's father personally raced to Washington to deliver the ratification papers.  As the article in the <em>Milwaukee Journal </em>from November 2, 1919 so strikingly states, Ada James a descendant of a suffrage family \"showed\" Illinois women that Wisconsin was the first to ratify the 19th amendment.  Noted for her outspoken nature, a key to her success in the ratification, Ada publically claimed Wisconsin's honor and denounced Illinois' false claim as the first to ratify the 19th amendment.","There is a lot of debate over this fact, partly to do with the happening that Illinois was also sending a messenger to Washington to ratify at the same time.  However, there was a problem with the wording of the Illinois bill and they were turned away.  Mr. James entered the state department with the Wisconsin ratification papers in hand as the Illinois messenger was leaving.","Ada \"showed\" them, Illinois, in her public speech held at a victory ceremony held at the Milwaukee Athletic Club.  The applause roared as Ada dispersed any doubt in Wisconsin's rightful title of the first state to ratify the suffrage amendment.  Ada sought equality for women, her impact on the Wisconsin Women's Suffrage Organizations in which she was a leading member of, and her dedication and challenge of leadership changed the course of Wisconsin's women's suffrage movement forever."," "," "," "],"display_date":"November 1, 1919","search_date":"1919-11-01","locations":[{"id":16292,"lat":43.0070321924,"lng":-87.9667286742,"zoom":10,"place":"Milwaukee, Wisconsin"}],"tags":[{"id":2206,"tag":"Wisconsin"},{"id":1710,"tag":"Voting Rights"},{"id":2673,"tag":"Ada James"},{"id":2674,"tag":"19th amendment"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2675,"tag":"Ratify"},{"id":1323,"tag":"rivalry"},{"id":840,"tag":"Illinois"},{"id":2712,"tag":"Milwaukee Athletic Club"},{"id":2713,"tag":"Milwaukee Journal"}],"course":{"name":"Intro to Digital History","school":"University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee","course_id":141,"school_id":68}},{"id":6426,"title":"Women: Citizenship or Idol Worship in the 19th Century","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-10-26","end_date":"1871-10-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["An article from The Idaho World entitled, \"Will A Lady Ever Be President?\" pondered the possibility of a female presidency in 1871, a year before the upcoming election of 1872. The tone in which the author wrote is misogynistic, but also fairly common thought. The author begins by saying, \"Will a lady ever be President? We hope so, if she is pretty.\" Beauty is a central theme in this article, and it is assumed to be the cornerstone quality that makes a good female President. The author goes on to make the assumption that if a woman were to be President, it would open many chances for promiscuous behavior, in the good favor of her inferiors. \"The Presidentess\" would also be a fashion icon, and \"inaugurate an era of love and elegance\" to the political sphere. The author then assembles a picture of the future of politics, where a \"plump, comely\" candidate runs against a \"lean, lank, scrawny\" candidate. The public would be so invested in the excitement of this event that they would parade awful banners around, \"Full Bosoms Forever,\" \"Pretty Ankles are the Nation’s Bulwarks,\" \"To Arms, ye Brave, When they are Fair and Dimpled,\" and “Give the Kissing Candidate a Chance” among the lot. The author assures the readers that this future would be a good time, and that they should hope that they are alive to see it. The article ends in a positive view of women in politics at face value, but the meaning that lies underneath may not be so liberating, especially for the thousands of suffragettes reading it in 1871."," ","The fact of the matter is that women existed in a funny area within society, mostly white women, where they were held to a high standard of respect but were not considered equal and were not given the same rights as men. They were to appear ladylike and to exhibit class and sophistication amongst company. The “New South Lady,” according to David Blight’s <em>Race and Reunion</em>, was the “agent by which the whole South could transcend the legacies of defeat and Reconstruction” (273). This image of a perfectly proper and wholesome woman was meant to steer the country towards morally better paths. The United Daughters of the Confederacy was a group assembled to exemplify just this. The UDC strived to be “guardians of piety, education, and culture” and lead “public activist lives” (273). Women were expected to stay within the confines of their designated roles as wives and mothers, achieving perfection in positive qualities such as doting, peacemaking, respectable, and sensible.","Politics was considered too brutish for the dainty ladies of the states. Many women were not particularly upset by this construct, such as Janet Rudolph, who claimed that it was not fair that women had to give up everything, but were still not able to reach the equal status of their male counterparts. “Do you call this chivalry to women? Is it placing them on that lofty pedestal our opponents so delight to talk of?” Though she recognized this imbalance, she claimed, “I am not a suffragist, but it is just such injustice that will cause the women of Virginia to become suffragists” (279)."," ","The idea of a woman within the political sphere caused backlash from those who could not separate politics from the dirty, rough-and-tumble men that were involved. Or, at least it seemed that way. In order to combine the two worlds, one would have to sacrifice part of its identity. If a lady were President, the Presidency would have to revolve around female-centered activities (e.g. fashion, kissing); likewise, if a lady were to be President, the lady would have to act like a President—i.e. to act like a man. Thus, it was quite comical to some folks to imagine a female President. Though it has yet to happen today, this country has come a long way in securing a place for women in politics—even so far as to allow them to run against men in the Presidential campaigns.

According to the news report, “Main, the husband of the child, entered a complaint against Ellis, and Justice Davis caused him to be arrested.”","The meaning of marriage in America during the 19<sup>th </sup>century was mainly connected with expectations of calmness, quietness, and having the feeling of being settled.

The traditional way of marriage at the time was the future husband asked permission, or the blessing, from the future bride’s parents. Although marriage in the late teens was not uncommon, marriage in the middle teens, ages sixteen and seventeen, could marry if their parents signed the marriage license application. The marriage laws of 1861 until 1873 in Nevada, however, required males to be eighteen years of age and females at least sixteen years of age provided they had the consent of their respective fathers, and if their fathers were not living, then they must receive the consent of their mothers. In Main’s case, consent was not given and the child was only thirteen years of age.

Feeblemindedness, alcoholism, and incest, among other deplorable traits, were of no shortage in the generations Danielson studied.","As feeblemindedness was commonly associated with promiscuity, criminality, and social dependency, it was the field worker’s duty to show how corrupt families were harming their communities. Through personal interviews with her research subjects, their relatives, town officials, and reliable neighbors, Danielson composed brief yet detailed biographies of many descendants belonging to three large, intertwining family trees.","According to writer Amy Bix, Danielson was one of two hundred and fifty-eight students trained by the Eugenics Record Office (ERO) between 1910 and 1924. Because their politeness and charm more easily persuaded conversation with the strangers they interviewed, eighty-five percent of these students were women. In 1912, Danielson published a memoir with Charles B. Davenport, director of the ERO, which included well over a hundred of the often crude and deeply personal stories surrounding the degenerate hill folk. These stories displayed Danielson’s inquisitive skill and the extensive work load taken on by field workers. ","In one description, for example, she wrote, “Her father was a drunkard who wandered into a backwoods town twelve or fifteen miles from a rail-road and wanted to get rid of his baby girl. He succeeded in trading her for a dog.” According to Danielson, when this baby grew into an adult, she lived with her husband and two kids in a repulsive one-room shack in the woods. The woman could not remember how many children she had, but she did know that ten were taken by the government on grounds of neglect.","In a somewhat similar instance, Danielson reported on a separate family: “Her uncombed hair, heavy fleshy face and protruding lower lip made her look more like an animal than a woman. She could not tell how many children she had nor where many of them were.” Danielson later learned that while the woman’s husband was serving a nine-year prison sentence for incest with his own daughter, at least three of their children were deemed neglected and taken by the government.","Demonstrating the severity of this town’s degeneracy problem, Danielson found that the families she studied had cost the local government over half a million dollars in just sixty years. She concluded, “The comparative cost of segregating one feebleminded couple and that of maintaining their offspring shows, in the instance at hand, that the latter policy has been three times more expensive.” As the eugenics movement was aimed toward improving the American race by minimizing the number of degenerate babies born, eugenicists like Danielson knew full well that segregation would not be a strong enough force.

By having the pertinent need of a labor force in almost all fields, women completed the task that drafted men were not able to do so. So as new opportunities were presented to them, women began to obtain more rights than any other previous generation had experienced; being able to manage farms and businesses for the first time. This however was not limited to domestic affairs as women also were heavily involved in espionage, the nursing of soldiers, the raising of capital via the ladies’ and soldier’s aid societies, the U.S sanitary commission, (a private agency in the North that played a critical role in the Union’s victory) and battlefield; a considerable amount of women partook in cross-dressing to enlist themselves. With these outstanding accomplishments, women were forever advanced in society as founder of the Red Cross Barton claimed that had the continuous peace prevailed, the advancement of women’s rights would have remained stagnant in society for at least fifty years. With that the American Civil War inspired individuals to contemplate, and re-think their previously held notions of what a woman was capable of performing as many leaders emerged such as Harriet Tubman and Susie King Taylor.","Delivered passionately by feminist Civil Rights activist in 1894, Josiah Benton Jr. spoke eloquently of the societal advancement the Civil War presented women. By speaking in simple terms, using statistics and emotional appeal the speech was monumentally successful in that it informed the public of the accomplishments of women and the needed continued advancement towards equality. Reminding individuals that men had to evacuate shops, offices, businesses, and banks by the literal thousands only to be run efficiently by women,  the competency of women was once more re-established, and spoken of. Many deeming women unfit to perform the same task as men, all notions of superiority where disproven when even members in the National and State department had their jobs temporarily preformed by women with success. This demonstrated to all that women could maintain order, exceed in domestic and external affairs, regulate capita, and compete with men. Regarding African American women, many were not able to exhibit the same advancements as other women-even those that were also impoverished. So while many were able to learn how to read and write, and at times even pass on that knowledge, it their advancement pales in comparison to the continued adversity they continued to face. Unfortunately many continued to be viewed as hindrances in both the Union and Confederacy.","Louisa May Alcott wrote extensively about her experiences as a nurse during the American Civil War. Nurses typically being what most individuals think of when they image women during the tremulous war, it is undoubtedly due to the large amount of volunteers both the Union and Confederacy received from women. Being motivated to make their presence valuable, many wholeheartedly cared deeply for their patients as they treated gruesome wounds. May Alcott claiming that the nurses had “ a motherly affection for all,” while the women cooked, cleaned, bathed, and wrote for the soldiers, it challenged the notion that women could not multitask well; performing difficult surgeries all the while being responsible for their mental health and emotional well-being.","Submissiveness and domesticity was arguably most challenged when women began to cross-dress and enlist in the military. First seen in July 1863 when Union soldiers found a dead female body disguised as a confederate private in a mass grave. Shocked, as many did not believe women were capable of deceiving men, and fighting, it was originally thought by all that women who cross-dressed were anomalies. Historians now know that this is not the case as a conservative estimate shows now that between four-hundred to seven hundred fifty women disguised themseleves. Scholars now agree that women who fought on the battlefield did so with the same motivations that men had, with the exception of a few who did so in order to obtain freedom from domestic submissiveness, and to be with their loved one. With the Victorian notions of modesty, it made it fairly easy for women to disguise themselves as men as many were given ill-fitting clothing that hid their body shape, were encouraged to sleep with clothed, shower separately, and use the lavatory separately. All of these factors helped women contribute to the war effort as it made it easy for them to enter the battlefield.","Overall the American Civil War allowed women to gain wondrous advancements in civil rights as they were allowed to engage in many domestic and foreign affairs that previously would have not been accessible to them. So while they fought bravely on the battlefield, engaged in dangerous surgery, managed businesses, farms, and taught and learnt literature, the minds of women were significantly expanded. This led many to be inspired to re-think women’s role in society. So with the lives of American women “being shaped by a set of ideas that historians refer to as the cult of womanhood” American cultural notions of femininity were forever changed as the introduction of a new set of ideas inspired those to re-think the capabilities of women. The importance of their role cannot be overstated."," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"April 12, 1861 - July 1, 1894","search_date":"1877-11-20","locations":[{"id":52839,"lat":37.09024,"lng":-95.712891,"zoom":8,"place":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6688,"title":"Womans role in teh Civil War","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-01","end_date":"0000-00-00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","During the Civil War, a woman’s place was in the home, tending to the children, tidying up the house, and cooking dinner for their husbands.

In fact, many women actually fought in the Civil War. While many were either nurses, formed clubs and raised money for the troops, knitted blankets and scarfs, planted and canned vegetables for the troops or, some actually fought side-by-side the men in war. Almost 20,000 women worked directly with the Union Army and quite frankly, helped them win the war."," ","            Women played a very significant part in the Civil War. They fought on both sides, The Union and The Confederacy. But, more so for The North.  The women soldiers would often not attract too much attention to themselves and stay secluded.  Many women dressed up as men and fooled the people giving the physical exams.

For centuries, the role of a women has been set out, and most women followed. Although there were exceptions, this is the way life was. During the civil war, starting in 1861, women started to express the urge to be more than the mold that was set out. With this, much criticism followed.","            Although typical roles of women are indeed important, such as raising children, supporting husbands, and maintaining the household, there is so much more to be explored. Many women to possess a more nurturing nature, than some men lack, therefore implying that these are simply women’s roles, but as history will show, women are just as capable as males in many fields. During the civil war, since so many men were away fighting in both the Confederate and Union, women were left to assume the responsibilities of the male that was away. Women had to find a way to provide both financial and emotional support for family, and friends left at home. During this era, women realized, and boldly expressed that they were capable to do the same thing as their male counterparts.","            In a lithograph, <em>“The Age of Brass/ or The Triumphs of Women’s Rights</em>” drawn in 1869 expresses the reactions and criticisms of the progressions of women’s rights. The photo depicts women voting for the “The Celebrated Man.”. Women are shown with exaggerated features that usually are expressed by men such as dresses that resemble suites, women smoking pipes, and the only male in the lithograph is holding a baby, showing confusion, and obviously is in shock of the environment that he is in.","            The depiction of this lithograph shows the negative perception of the progression of women. During the civil war era; it was common belief that if women were given the right to vote, women would attempt to change every facet of society. If women were given the right to assume roles that were predominately influenced by men, their would be no need for the men. While women were expected to stay within their roles, they were still appreciated. Thousands of women aided men in the battlefield of both the confederate and the union side. According to an article by Brooks."," ","            As history, will prove, women will indeed gain rights and will become productive, and influential members of society.

Charles Collingwood of CBS guided the hour-long tour. Jackie represented a new, relaxed style of modernity and femininity. She demonstrated impressive knowledge of history by speaking about what events past presidents held in each room. In the Green Room Jackie noted, “this used to be the dining room, and here Jefferson gave his famous dinners and introduced such exotic foods as macaroni, waffles and ice cream to the United States.” Kennedy’s eye for beauty and desire for prestige established the myth and glamour that would define the era of the Kennedys. While many perceived Jackie as a flawless beauty and easygoing mother and wife, she struggled with her public appearance and confidence.","The Kennedys represented the image of a cultural revolution in the1960s. The modern <em>Mad Man</em> television series centers on this image with the new hopes, fears and the eventual decline of the American dream. The article <em>Don, Betty and Jackie Kennedy On Mad Men and Periodization,</em> discusses the symbolism behind the Jackie Kennedy White House Tour in the 1960s. The central characters in <em>Mad Men </em>noted that Jackie seemed nervous, even when she saw Jack at the end. The message behind the show addresses the story of image control. The images and reality observed was well groomed to a specific persona as opposed to the reality of the hardships the family faced. The flaws and secrets of the family are hidden behind the well-tailored clothes, bright smiles and good looks.","In historian James Giglio’s book <em>The Presidency of John F. Kennedy</em>, he accounted for the image the Kennedys had, compared to the reality behind the scenes. John Kennedy was one of the most image-conscious presidents and centered the media on his attractive children, glamorous wife and his livelihood as a family man. The Kennedy lifestyle hardly resembled the Camelot that Jackie portrayed after the assassination.","Behind the handsome façade, Kennedy suffered from failing health, aggressive behavior towards others and being unfaithful to his family. Jackie was well aware of her husband’s problems. Her frustration may have been taken out on her shopping sprees for designer clothes, jewelry, antiques and artwork. Jackie unwillingly assumed the political obligations as first lady. Once President Kennedy twisted Jackie’s arm behind her back and marched her over to female reporters so that would portray the right family image. Jackie often had unpredictable mood swings and would cancel engagements due to illness, only to be reported to be water-skiing at Hyannis Port.","Jackie was a major asset to the image of the Kennedy presidency. In the White House tour Jackie acted as the perfect mother and wife, but her tense posture and controlled voice showed otherwise. Jackie’s seemingly flawless beauty was an image created to shield the ubiquitous flaws in the Kennedy family private life.

She created the image of a successful woman; rather than the stereotypical dependent and obedient women in the early 1960s. Most importantly, Jackie Kennedy served as a role model for women.","On February 14, 1962 Jacqueline Kennedy conducted a TV tour of the newly restored White House. Not only did she single handedly start the restoration, overseeing everything from wallpaper in the Monroe Room to china in the State Dining Room, she also presented the renovated rooms of the White House with knowledge and poise, intermittently providing historical context. The hour-long CBS special symbolized something greater than just presenting artifacts of American history to its viewers, it communicated that Jackie Kennedy was more than just Jack Kennedy’s wife. Through White House restoration, Jackie publicized her movement away from dependence and toward initiative and progress. Whether she intended directly or not, Jackie Kennedy provided women with a newfound inspiration for change; change that was well overdue.","President Kennedy was introduced at the tail end of the tour, and for once, it is to support the First Lady in her endeavors, rather than the reverse. “Being educated, having some knowledge your husband didn’t have, was glamorous, even enviable” according to Media Studies Scholar Susan Douglas. It was refreshing, revolutionary and important to young women in the United States at that time to see that a woman, not only a man, could do something great, something “magnificent” as R. M. Frisby states in a letter to the First Lady. Her voice, as Historian Gil Troy states, is “thin” with an “upper-class accent.” Her hair was done perfectly and her wardrobe, as always, superb. Not only was her appearance untouchable, but her knowledge as well. She articulated “beautifully sculpted grammatical sentences” and “compelling facts” throughout the televised special, creating an intimacy between the viewers and herself.","Troy recounts “reporters hailed the First Lady for transcending the typical polarities of gender and marriage.” Jacqueline Kennedy established a new interpretation of societal roles, one that spoke directly to females.

In <em>Amazing Heroes #191</em>, released in June 1991, science fiction, fantasy, and horror writer, Adam-Troy Castro, wrote a review of a series of sex comics. This publication problematizes the majority of these comics for their lack of substance and oversexualization of women. Many of the comics are completely degrading and have no clear story line. Though many of them are written to sell and earn a profit, they are incredibly distasteful and offensive to many.","In <em>Comic Book Nation</em>: <em>The Transformation of Youth Culture in America, </em>Bradford W. Wright explains, “The comic book industry suffered some shock in the mid-1990s… The biggest problem is the transformation of American culture itself” (Wright 283-84). As the United States modernized, television, video, computer games, etc. were popular and “comic books simply could not match.” This suggests that the contemporary world seemed to outgrow comics. There were so many different avenues that consumers could enjoy, rather than just reading a comic.","Leading up to this collapse of the industry, was a time of complete oversexualization of females in comics. At this point, the Comics Code Authority lost power and the industry focused on writing for more mature audiences. Brigham Young University’s Kyra Nelson writes, “The ‘90s was a particularly notable decade in comics for impossible body proportions with very few clothes to hide them…These women were so impossibly proportioned that, had they been real, they would have tipped over if they had tried to stand up” (Nelson 4). These images caused consumers to have an incorrect image of what women really look like. In this tough time for comics, writers utilized the oversexualization of women as a selling point for their comics in order to keep the industry alive.","      Females also had a complete lack of power in relation to their male counterparts in comics. In a journal on Feminist Criminology, Tammy S. Garland, Kathryn A. Branch, and Mackenzie Grimes discuss stories of rape in comic books. They write how, “This oversexualization of comic characters coupled with the sexual violence perpetrated against them reifies rape myths as they are ‘cultural artifacts that contribute to the cultural construction of hegemonic masculinities’… As a result, the path to justice is determined by a patriarchal system that determines ‘who’ may be the hero and what type of person maybe the victim” (Garland, Branch, & Grimes 6). This indicates that having females constantly playing victims rather than heroes reflects the patriarchal society in which we live. It glorifies males as powerful and dominant, while females are perceived as weak without control.","      In Castro’s article, in <em>Amazing Heroes #191,</em> he discusses a comic, <em>Revelry in Hell,</em> by Ron Wilber in which females are portrayed as victims to their male counterparts. He writes, “This is a book where women are chained, whipped until they’re raw, threatened with branding irons, and pictured both before and after having their eyes poked out, all for supposedly erotic effect” (Castro 89). A description like this causes one’s stomach to turn. The fact that someone decided to write a comic for male pleasure that is completely violent towards women is problematic in itself. It is completely distasteful, and again portrays females as the victim, while males are dominant. This indirectly suggests that extreme violence towards a woman for sexual pleasure is okay. However, in reality it is harmful and objectifies females.","In the 1990s, there was a comic book crisis along with an extreme rise in violence and sex in the media. With this, female characters were completely oversexualized and objectified. Sex was used as a means of gaining profit in the industry and females had little to no power over their male counterparts. This was a very dangerous time in society because women were perceived as lesser and weaker than males. Despite this, it is absolutely crucial to criticize these comics and their portrayal of women so that one can have a greater understanding of the social injustices that are hidden within all types of media during this time."],"display_date":"June 1, 1991 - January 1, 1995","search_date":"1993-03-16","locations":[{"id":53145,"lat":47.7827941,"lng":-120.9263262,"zoom":4,"place":"Seattle, WA"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":364,"tag":"sex"},{"id":244,"tag":"Violence"},{"id":3582,"tag":"Hypersexualization"},{"id":3583,"tag":"Victim"},{"id":3584,"tag":"Power"}],"course":{"name":"ENG 492H Honors Seminar in English","school":"Rollins College","course_id":185,"school_id":5}},{"id":6828,"title":"Boston female abolitionists call upon women to join their cause","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-07-13","end_date":"1836-07-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Maria Chapman and Melanie Ammidon from the Boston Anti-Slavery Female Society wrote an address about their abolitionist society outlining why their support for abolition and how they planned to petition. They believed that all people are immortal souls created by God, and that no one, therefore, should live under the cruel system of slavery. The address argued that women are very influential in society and are the key in urging men to cease protecting immoral systems and to preserve everyone’s God-given rights. Chapman and Ammidon wrote the goals of women are, “to labor to increase the knowledge and the love of God.” The goals of the society included garnering support from women to condemn slavery and push for men, particularly those from DC, to help abolish slavery. The address warned that if the United States did not abolish slavery then “God punishes wicked systems,” so society needed to change for their safety.","The Boston Anti-Slavery Female Society was founded in 1834 by twelve women with the aid of abolitionist Reverend Amos Phelps. The group’s methods were initially ineffective at promoting abolitionism. The society had few meetings and confined itself to going to sermons of abolitionist preachers. In the book <em>Strained Sisterhood</em>, Debra Hansen writes the society admitted that their campaign did not gain much attention. Maria Chapman later emerged as the figurehead of the society by her own fervent opposition to slavery and support of women’s rights. She pushed for new initiatives to be pursued by the society. Historian Jean Yellin comments on Chapman by stating, “Chapman constituted the bazaar as a means of moral transformation, consciously winning the hearts of New England for abolition.” The society established sewing circles, and funded projects such as the Boston Christmas Fair and the Samaritan Asylum, which helped to strengthen public awareness for abolition. The society started to break apart by 1839, as male abolitionists claimed the society was not an anti-slavery movement, but a disguised women’s movement. Reverend Amos Phelps, who originally helped form the society, thought the group diverged into a women’s movement once they started to argue for the importance of women in society. Reverend Joseph Tracy of the American Colonization Society shared this view. Prominent ministers claimed the members of the society “behave[ed] in a manner unbecoming to their sex.” Some of these reverends believed that if feminism was promoted that it would be a slippery slope that would lead to the support of anarchy, infidelity, and atheism.

The Brown Berets are a paramilitary group that advocated for Chicano rights during the Chicano Movement in the 1960s and 1970s- a time of political unrest throughout the United States due to the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement. Despite many Chicana members filling crucial roles within the Brown Berets, they went largely unrecognized for the support they provided to the organization because of their gender.","The letter clearly conveys the women’s frustration. The offenses include, “a great exclusion on behalf of the male segment,” and that they had “been treated as nothings.”[1] This sentiment was not exclusive to one age group, area, or level within the organization. Women in the Brown Berets fulfilled positions at every level of the organization, but they were often expected to fulfil subordinate roles like making food or having sex with members in the male-centric organization. They filled more common roles like “fundraising, answering phone calls, writing letters, pasting up and writing for the newspaper, and running the Free Clinic,”[2] which were essential to the organization. Even Gloria Arellanes, the Minister of Finance and Correspondence of the Brown Berets, a person within the top level of leadership, experienced this sexism.","Additionally, (and perhaps the strongest statement from the letter) they felt that within the Brown Beret organization, “men have oppressed [them] more than the pig system has,”[3] and that this atmosphere within the organization was not going to change. From outside the organization, “women were also harassed and arrested for their participation.”[4] Regardless of their contributions to the organization and risk, they weren’t acknowledged for their efforts because of their gender because of the machismo attitude within the organization. As a result, the letter was the official resignation of not only Gloria Arellanes but also all Brown Beret women. They had left to form their own organization.","The Brown Berets became a large group throughout the American Southwest and had many members, both male and female. Without the contribution of women at all levels, the Brown Berets would not have been able to function as effectively as they did for the brief period they were active during the mid-20<sup>th</sup> Century. Because of their efforts as an organization, they helped students receive better education in Los Angeles through a series of walkouts, protested police brutality against Mexican Americans, and provided health care to underserved communities, a feat that would not have been possible without their support network. Because of their gender, they did not receive the same credit as their male counterparts for the work, which is still largely unrecognized today."],"display_date":"February 25, 1970","search_date":"1970-02-25","locations":[{"id":53209,"lat":37.429903695878,"lng":-122.18019688942,"zoom":10,"place":"Palo Alto, California"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":3689,"tag":"Chicano/a"},{"id":3690,"tag":"Brown Berets"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":186,"school_id":69}},{"id":6886,"title":"A Women's War","course_id":190,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/17","end_date":"11/30/17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Residents of Carmel, New York, woke up on Friday, November 30, 1917, to a letter to the editor on the <em>Putnam County Courier’s</em> front page from an advocate for woman’s suffrage, Mrs. C.A Hopkins. In her comment, Hopkins explained that men should be recognized for their valor during The Great War, but also argued that women should be appreciated as well. Hopkins wrote, “I feel sure that the women who have so faithfully and efficiently labored for the Red Cross, for the Liberty Loan, and for the YMCA fund, may also be depended upon to further the recognition of a subject already long delayed.” This subject was women’s right to vote. New York state was at the epicenter of the women’s suffrage movement throughout 1916 and 1917. Suffragettes hoped to win the support of “the most economically and politically influential state in the nation.”","World War One created many difficulties for the suffrage movement. Suffragettes were split between those who supported that war and those who did not. On April 3, 1917, President Wilson announced his war aims to Congress. He declared that the United States must enter the war because “the world must be made safe for democracy.” This claim from Wilson stirred controversy amongst suffragettes, who believed America first had to first fix its democracy at home by allowing women to vote. In his book, <em>Winning the Vote</em>, the historian Robert Cooney, Jr. details how the suffragist Doris Stevens argued, “We must not let our voices be drowned by war, trumpets or canons.” Steven and others who did not support the war worried that the war would bring the suffrage movement to a halt. Many women abandoned their suffrage for war work, such as laboring in munition factories, selling war bonds, raising money for war relief, and providing aid at the front for fallen soldiers with the Red Cross.","Activists such as Mrs. C.A Hopkins supported the war and argued for women’s rights. Suffragettes took part in patriotic rallies all over New York State. In the book <em>Women Will Vote, </em>Goodier and Pastorello explain, “By the summer of 1916, most cities held preparedness and patriotic rallies. The fifty thousand marchers who participated in the parade included suffragists; suffragists participated in similar events in Albany, Rochester, New York, and elsewhere.” New York suffrage leaders wanted to bring back attention to their primary goal: reviving their suffrage campaign by emphasizing women’s contributions to the war. Suffragettes spoke at every possible venue, including training camps for soldiers. They printed and distributed leaflets, posters, and newspaper articles asserting that more than a million New York Women demanded that voters pass the suffrage referendum on November 6, 1917.","Acts of leadership like Mrs. C.A. Hopkins and acts of courage like the women who participated in the war helped women in New York gain suffrage on November 6, 1917. It was the stepping stone that would eventually lead women to gain suffrage across the nation. This movement did not only require women from big cities to be heard but local ones as well, such as New York’s local town of Carmel in Putnam County."],"display_date":"June 1, 1917 - November 30, 1917","search_date":"1917-08-31","locations":[{"id":53211,"lat":41.197785310004,"lng":-75.38473046875,"zoom":6,"place":"Putnam County, New York"},{"id":53212,"lat":41.197785310004,"lng":-75.38473046875,"zoom":6,"place":"New York State"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":2692,"tag":"The Great War"},{"id":2477,"tag":"world war one"},{"id":2647,"tag":"Women's Suffrage"},{"id":3698,"tag":"Suffragette"},{"id":617,"tag":"Feminism"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"SUNY New Paltz","course_id":190,"school_id":102}},{"id":6887,"title":"Wartime, Women, and Sexual Constructs","course_id":190,"status":"P","start_date":"11/9/18","end_date":"11/9/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["       On November 9, 1918, the social reformer, Dr. Eleanor Bertine spoke at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York about “sex morals.” An article about her speech, titled “Social Morality and the War,” was published in the campus newspaper, <em>The Vassar Miscellany News, </em>on November 14, 1918. In her speech, Dr. Bertine argued that laws on sex were unjust toward women and that therefore, ‘the single moral standard’ should be followed as a regulation. The single standard pushed for men to abide by the same rules they expected women to abide by: abstaining from sexual relations before marriage and remaining loyal to their husbands afterward. As a whole, women wanted to hold men accountable for their own role in engaging in sexual behaviors. The “double moral standard” excused male indiscretions, but not female.","       During the Progressive Era, male and female reformers began to devise regulations to control and ultimately destroy commercialized prostitution. At the beginning of World War I, male reformers formulated new regulations on prostitution through licenses, special courts, and laws that disciplined women. Female reformers like Bertine, however, pointed out the issue with prostitution was the conduct of men, and therefore pushed for a single standard of sexual behaviors. These female reformers felt that the double standard divided women into bad and good, while condoning the behavior of men using women for their own sexual benefit.","       The problem with the double moral standard, Bertine said, was that people assumed it was “caused by actual physical differences of sex, by the mistaken ideals of boys, too often imparted by women, and by the lesser necessity for responsibility in a man.” Under the double standard, women were expected to remain pure, while men were encouraged to explore their sexuality before and while being married. The Historian John C. Burnham notes that young men at this time rarely were loyal to their fiancés or wives, and even doctors commonly believed that abstinence was harmful to a man’s health. Dr. Bertine’s talk shows the inequality of expected social-sexual behaviors between men and women. Circumstances and regulations against women, created under the double standard, showcase a global epidemic of blaming and punishing women, and the hypocrisy that goes along with it, for actions that men were obviously a part of as well.    "],"display_date":"November 9, 1918","search_date":"1918-11-09","locations":[{"id":53213,"lat":41.696413124963,"lng":-73.918141494751,"zoom":13,"place":"124 Raymond Ave, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604"}],"tags":[{"id":83,"tag":"Prostitution"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":1111,"tag":"World War I"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"SUNY New Paltz","course_id":190,"school_id":102}},{"id":6891,"title":"Fighting the War from the Kitchen","course_id":190,"status":"P","start_date":"1/2/18","end_date":"1/2/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At the start of the year 1918, women in Chatham, New York were beginning to feel the pressures of World War I in their homes. On January 2, 1918, the Chatham Courier featured “Hints for Housekeepers,” an article that called for women to start using “fireless cookers” to make their meals. These cookers could either be bought or made with instructions provided by the government. According to the article, “One woman made one of these cookers out of an old trunk and some hay which served her purpose very well and saved her many a dollar.” To use these cookers, the food to be cooked had to first be heated to the boiling point separately, either on a stove or by some other method. Then, once at the boiling point, the food could be moved to the cooker, where it would remain until it was finished cooking. The article quoted a woman who used a fireless cooker to boil her ham overnight, and she stated,  “In the morning it was always perfectly done...” Thus, “...it is possible for every household in the United States to save much time, fuel and nervous energy...” by using the cookers in their daily meal preparation. This practice would save women time that, according to the article, they could then “...spend in Red Cross work, or knitting or in some one of the various branches of war relief.”","Many changes on the home front during the war, including values the United States Food Administration’s propaganda promoted for women at home, began to create a new role for women in society. The United States Food Administration was a government agency created in 1917 in response to the United States’ entrance into World War I. In the same year, President Woodrow Wilson placed Herbert Hoover in charge of the new administration. Hoover and his administration oversaw the management of food on the home front, and in order to do so created propaganda to influence women. Although the government did not implement rationing during the war, the United States Food Administration encouraged women to conserve as much as they could for the war effort. In her analysis of propaganda during the war, author Celia Malone Kingsbury wrote of the importance that this appeal placed on the war in homes and kitchens, drawing it into the domain of women. The emphasis on conserving for the war effort could be one reason that women were willing to create their own “fireless cookers”  out of inexpensive or repurposed materials to prepare their meals. According to the article, these cookers were useful because “Saving of labor is almost as important if not quite so, as the saving of money at this time….” The emphasis placed on the importance of women’s work at home gave them a role in the war, where their work on the home front was just as important as that of the men fighting in battles on the war front."],"display_date":"January 2, 1918","search_date":"1918-01-02","locations":[{"id":53214,"lat":42.363165365115,"lng":-73.553494054511,"zoom":8,"place":"Chatham, New York, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":1246,"tag":"Propaganda"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":3701,"tag":"home front"},{"id":1111,"tag":"World War I"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"SUNY New Paltz","course_id":190,"school_id":102}},{"id":6890,"title":"Women and the 21st Amendment","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"12/18/17","end_date":"12/5/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Women and Prohibition","It is not a new discovery that women have played a significant role in changing the face of America. For example, women pushed desperately to pass the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment (1933) repealing the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment (1919); prohibition. While previous women desperately fought to create the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment, none of them truly sought through the possible consequences its implementation could entail. Hence, a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was sought not long after.","            The initial plan women created, the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment, was in attempt to “take back the home”. What I mean by this is that women believed that alcohol was the cause for their husbands being drawn away from the home all day, only to come home late and do very awful things to her.[1] In addition to this, women who were suffering from drunken husbands teamed up with the groups of religious people such as the National Women’s Christian Temperance Union, and males who could vote.[2] With strong effort they were able to successfully pass the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment. Over the years following, some women continued to celebrate while others began to see a change in light.","            The reason for this is as follows. While alcohol became illegal to sell, it did not prevent people from getting their hands on it and consuming it anyways. Another thing women noticed after the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment was that bars were no longer regulated. This meant they could stay open however late they please and let whom ever they want in. This allowed for the creation of “speak easies” which were basically the old bars but were now being used primarily for illegal actions such as selling black market alcohol. Some other things came from this as well.[3] These included an increase of prostitution, increase in youth drinking, increase in political/government corruption, increase in death, and also did not put an end to most husband’s violent actions.","            Because of these consequences, it was time for action, and action came in the form of a group of strong-willed women. For example, The WONPR, Women’s Organization for National Prohibition Reform, was a women’s organization in support of the soon to be 21<sup>st</sup> amendment. Importantly to note, this organization did not want to segregate political parties or previous movement organizations. Due to this, WONPR claimed over 1.2 million members at the beginning of 1933. One thing this organization campaigned on was “the repeal of the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment is not defeat”.[4] This was in attempt to show 18<sup>th</sup> amendment prohibition supporters that their actions were in good means, and that it is not a loss but rather a creation for a better, safer way.","Another organization of powerful women who played a role in the creation of the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was the Women’s Organization for Prohibition Reform. For example, Ione Nicoll, secretary of WOPR, saw the destruction of the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment and began to look for ways to repeal it. Nicoll frequently brought up that instead of eradicating the evils people faced, prohibition made it worse.[5] To further show her reasonings for why women “should vote wet”, Nicoll explained a study done in 1925 by the Women’s National Republican Club. This study concluded that out of the vast variety of women they surveyed, ninety percent voted to get rid of or make changes to the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment. Not only did she use facts to back up her reasonings for a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment, she also tried to get female Prohibitionists on her side like the WONPR did.","Though some of the Prohibition supporters were scarred by experiences, others began to see a new light that shined on the creation of a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment. Overtime these groups of women were able to gain mass support and became successful at repealing prohibition. With one of the campaign tactics being creating alliances, women in the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment were able to get the government, as well as others, on their side. Once this occurred, rapid changes began and the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was created."," "," ","Reference List:","Nicoll, Ione. \"Should Women Vote Wet?\" <em>The North American Review</em> 229, no. 5 (1930): 561-65. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org.schreiner.idm.oclc.org/stable/25113543.\">http://www.jstor.org.schreiner.idm.oclc.org/stable/25113543.</a>","Rose, Kenneth D. 1996.

She wrote about her experiences in letters home, one of which was published in the Vassar school newspaper, The Miscellany. Waterhouse had graduated in 1914 and was recruited by the Vassar Canteen Unit in 1918. In her letter, she was proud to explain what she was doing to aid the American army in France. She discusses how important volunteers were and how their help was so desperately needed. She describes the excitement she feels living in France: “We get back and forth in army trucks or army machines and that is the time when you get the biggest thrill- for of course we are the only women who can ride in army trucks and cars- we are part of A. E. F.!” Irma emphasized the honor she felt serving her country. She urged other women at Vassar to join the A.E.F.","Women were desperately needed to fill jobs in France. The book, The Hello Girls by Elizabeth Cobbs discusses the push for women’s involvement in the communication sector. Many women were recruited to become switchboard operators but, there were also  many other positions that needed to be filled from nurses to secretaries. Irma Waterhouse was one of those women. She worked in the kitchens of a Red Cross station in France and served soldiers. This position was revolutionary for a woman like Irma. Because of her wealth and access to education she had the time to volunteer and follow a patriotic calling of helping the military. These opportunities were not afforded to lower class women, who did not have the means to take off from work and leave their responsibilities at home. Irma’s education aided her in work; at some points during her service she worked as a secretary. She was the only person out of five secretaries to speak French, so she often translated between the American and French secretaries.","Irma Waterhouse and the Vassar Canteen Unit tell a unique story about social roles of women during the war. The role of women was changing at this time, as new positions overseas and at home opened to women. For the first time, women were not only encouraged to enter the war effort, but also they were drastically needed.  These women volunteers came from upper-class families with educated backgrounds, but in France they worked service jobs usually held by the lower class. Waterhouse’s achievements did not end here. During World War II she once again worked with the Red Cross informing families across New York city that their sons and husbands had been killed in the war. In her adult life, Waterhouse taught classes to uneducated women about how to lead discussions, a move towards liberating women. She was also a successful author of short stories, received an M.A. in social working at fifty-one and became the head psychiatric social worker at Adelphi University. World War One opened up a variety of opportunities for women, especially upper-class women. After the war, many educated and experienced women who had proved themselves in the face of conflict."," "],"display_date":"1914 - 1919","search_date":"1916-12-31","locations":[{"id":53219,"lat":41.639967351896,"lng":-74.423852426949,"zoom":9,"place":"Poughkeepsie, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":1111,"tag":"World War I"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":3706,"tag":"Vassar"},{"id":3707,"tag":"AEF"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"SUNY New Paltz","course_id":190,"school_id":102}}]}
