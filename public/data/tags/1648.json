The book cited by Dr. Weaver is “Management in the Home”, a joint effort by three female university professors that seeks to apply scientific, deductive reasoning to everyday household tasks. For the women of this book, logical reasoning is not just preferred but necessary for the average American housewife, who can use the skills taught to scientists and economists to better serve their husbands, children, and general family welfare. Whether it be tracking the course of children’s future college aspirations or careful analysis of new purchases to the home, women can better and more efficiently provide for their families.","Part of the use of skilled reasoning in even everyday chores like dishwashing, explains the author, is the mental stimulus provided which might make the dull, boring necessities of life go by quicker. This article speaks to the overall attitude of the 1950s. Though easy to misrepresent as complacent, accepting of male activity and female stagnation and the division of public and private spheres, the reality is much more complicated. For all that women’s place in domesticity is reinforced by such books as “Management in the Home”, they also represent a certain contradiction. Jessamyn Neuhous writes in the Journal of Women’s History that women in the 1950s were aware of the boredom and emotional stress created by their isolated environments.","Topics specifically focused on women were redirected to fit gender norms, but works still existed which actively acknowledged women’s intelligence and need for intellectual pursuits. Women could think like scientists, but it was only acceptable for such thoughts to be directed toward ‘womanly’ subjects. A woman’s place was in the home, but plentiful literature exists showing women expressing their dissatisfaction with such lives without quite transgressing the social boundaries – letters directed toward’s womens magazines and housewife-heroines of women’s science fiction are two examples of such, while the careful complaints addressed in this 1953 New York Times article are another."],"display_date":"September 8, 1954","search_date":"1954-09-08","locations":[{"id":30880,"lat":39.96955852,"lng":-83.0093502958,"zoom":9,"place":"Franklin, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision: 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":98,"school_id":5}},{"id":6011,"title":"Salvation in Industry","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/56","end_date":"12/31/56","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The negative perception of industry is a fairly recent concept and for many years in places like Detroit industry was a marker of innovation, economic mobility, and increased employment. A 1956 study conducted by the Detroit City Plans Commission presents a crucial comprehensive collection of facts and statistics about the current state of industry and its projected growth. In the section entitled “Community and Corridor Data,” city planners offer their definition of a community and clarify the distinctions between a “community corridor” and an “industrial corridor.” In their definitions they contend with the City’s Master Plan which states that no heavy industry can be in close proximity to community corridors. While the report is objective in most of its findings it presents the disadvantages to the City Master Plan in a much more enumerated and in-depth manner than the advantages of separating industry from residential. The study concludes in this area that it will be difficult for industry to exist outside of industry corridors. This alludes to another theme within the report, which is the lack of space for real heavy industry in the city. According to many of the graphs and conclusions in the report current industry provided much of the economic stability the city has and it is logical that an increase would be beneficial for everyone.","The report speaks to a long-term problem in Detroit, highlighted by urban researcher June Manning Thomas, namely the city’s tendency to “assemble land for industrial sites.” Urban development in the twentieth century reflected the city's interest in increasing industry within community spaces as a means of increasing economic prosperity. The result is a city eager to put industry next to homes, as the city could “buy existing houses and land, prepare sites, and resell them cheaply to industrial firms.” This postwar mentality of increasing industry and jobs had major repercussions for city residents who were forced to live side-by-side with heavily polluting industries, which the city has never fully addressed."],"display_date":1956,"search_date":"1956-07-01","locations":[{"id":28980,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"},{"id":2007,"tag":"Detroit Industry"},{"id":58,"tag":"Industry"},{"id":2055,"tag":"Heavy Industry"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6572,"title":"The KKK 1950s Tallahasse Florida","course_id":167,"status":"P","start_date":"6/10/52","end_date":"6/10/52","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","“The group asked him to outlaw the Ku Klux Klan, but while repeating his longstanding opposition to the organization, the Governor said it did not appear constitutionally possible to abolish it.” On January 10, 1952 <em>The New York Times</em> reported that Governor Warren of Tallahassee, Florida announced that he was increasing the reward for the finding and conviction of the murderers of the Moores’ family, a Negro family. According to the article, the Moores were found dead in their household after a bomb went off under their bed. As described in the <em>New Georgia Encyclopedia</em>, the Ku Klux Klan, also known as the KKK, was a powerful group of whites who were aiming to end all lives of blacks. Although most of their acts were violent under the Constitution’s 14th amendment, they felt they were contributing what was right as citizens. With the help of law enforcement and political parties, the Klansmen were able to release their resentment of Negroes throughout Florida and the rest of the south.","The Ku Klux Klan was a dominant hate group in the south, who aimed to suppress the rights of black people and establish a reign of white supremacy. The Klan not only refuted the rights and existence of blacks, but also those of foreigners, Jews, and whites who supported blacks. During the 1950s, the Klan was evocative in its aversion to the growing Civil Rights Movement. During this time, the Civil Rights Movement was well known for helping blacks obtain equal rights and succeeding in life just as their white counterparts.  Cases such as Brown vs. Board of Education, in which the Supreme Court declared state laws to end segregation in schools, fueled the Klan to partake in shootings, bombings, and lynchings all across the south. To support the ruling of the Supreme Court, Congress passed their first civil rights legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1957. This act ensured all Americans were permitted the right to vote, fueling the Klansmen’s resistance even more.","David Chalmers’s book <em>Backfire: How the Ku Klux Klan helped the Civil Rights Movement </em>affirms the help the Klan received during this time. It discusses how Truman, who was perceived as an advocate supporter of racism, along with members in the Democratic and Republican Party, as well as corrupt police officers, all played a part in allowing the Ku Klux Klan to commit and get away with thousands of deaths of blacks. This includes the blacks’ most influential leaders, such as Mr. Moore. The White Knights are known today as the most violent group of the Ku Klux Klan’s history. The Klan was sought as a great hindrance in American equality. The destruction they produced caused rifts in Florida’s government as well in states all over the south. The Klan denounced the message of the Civil Rights that minority groups spent years trying to promote, and instead attempted to further its ideals of white supremacy.","Eisenhower and the FBI finally cracked down on the Ku Klux Klan and its deformation acts. Although this could have been done sooner and would have saved the lives of many innocent victims, it nonetheless was a step in the right direction for America. According to Nathaniel Hoguet’s work “Rates and Correlates of Understanding Deaths among Americans,” a lot of the Klan’s killings were unreported. However, the KKK accounted for at least 3,000 lynchings of blacks and possibly thousands of more from bombings and shootings. Even though a lot of the Klan was dismantled, the Klan still continued to thrive in the later decades."],"display_date":"June 10, 1952","search_date":"1952-06-10","locations":[{"id":52953,"lat":30.4382559,"lng":-84.2807329,"zoom":7,"place":"tallahasee florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"},{"id":151,"tag":"Ku Klux Klan"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}},{"id":6585,"title":"Washington Shores: The Community that Saved Negro-Owned housing in Central Florida","course_id":167,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/47","end_date":"12/31/49","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1949, the Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce presented the details on the upcoming housing development, Washington Shores. Many citizens from all throughout the state came to visit and inspect the new developments progress. This community was unlike any other housing development of this time since all the houses were going to be “owned and peopled by Negro citizens.”  The Washington Shores community was going to be one of the first developments in the nation to start “setting a pattern… for meeting the housing shortages of minority groups, especially Negros.” ","The concept for a Negro-owned community was created in 1947 when John Graham, a tile manufacturer in Central Florida, was faced with the task of finding housing for a Negro employee of his. Appalled when finding that White landowners were charging outrageous rental fees in African American areas of Orlando, Graham gained aid from the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, and the city government to help ease “congested quarters of the Orlando Negro section” by establishing a non-profit organization to fund the housing development. Segregation of white and black housing communities in this era was a major issue, often “during the 1950s urban expansion…discriminated forced blacks into small, disconnected communities and to travel longer distances for goods and services than did whites.” Thus, the idea of a Negro-owned community close to the hustle and bustle of Orlando was met with excitement.","The development of the Washington Shores community “presents a remarkable case study of civic cooperation.” Throughout Orlando, citizens and businesses contributed to the development of the housing. The Orlando legislature expanded the city limits in order to ensure that the community would have adequate fire and police protection, as well as necessary utilities, such as sewer, electricity, and paved streets. And a Negro real estate firm was given the job of handling the sales of all housing. The aid of the city came with the assurance that this community would not soon become a “slum.","The cost of buying a home in Washington Shores ranged from, five hundred dollars for a normal lot to one thousand for one on the lake shore, with a down payment of $125. Most homes in this community were planned for a five or six-bedroom layout. This low pricing of a home in the 1950s was unheard of, but for many African American families, this was a struggle. Yet, the cities cooperation with the development of Washington Shores aided many African Americans planning on moving to this community, the First National Bank of Orlando gave financial aid to those purchasing homes in the community. ","The Washington Shores community of Central Florida was met and enjoyed with wide appeal. The attractive new development gave African Americans the chance to live life in stable and prosperous new housing.

that is, after all, the decade in which students organized in masses never before seen to protest for social and political change.  Scholars point to several factors that influenced the period of apathy in the 50s.  In his book, <em>Student Politics in America</em>, Philip Altbach cites the political climate of the time and the start of the Cold War as main causes for a decline in political activism on campus.  He explains, “At a time when students were literally afraid to sign petitions even on non-political local issues, it is not surprising that Socialist or radical groups should find their memberships dwindling.” In his study into students’ value patterns in the 1950s, Dean Hoges found that students were heavily inclined toward conservative and Christian values and were disinclined to get involved in politics.  Overall, researchers conclude that the few student movements that did take place were generally over broad social and educational policies and were non-violent in nature.","The students’ reaction to the Wagner Affair, then, was both typical and atypical of the time.  The walkout staged by the students was non-violent, but the subject of their protests was one directly related to the college, rather than a broader issue.  The division this caused between students and faculty and high-level administrators was one never before experienced at Rollins.  The issue was eventually resolved with the dismissal of President Wagner, but not without leaving its mark on the school and the town of Winter Park.  It exposed the underlying political influences and conservative attitudes within the higher education system.  Wagner governed in a domineering style, using showmanship and charisma, much like prominent political figures of the time, and students were willing to follow his lead until he crossed a certain line.  It showed that student unrest was real, even if it was stifled by the prevailing attitudes of the decade and it demonstrated the use of peaceful protest techniques that would be utilized in the Civil Rights movement.  More than anything, though, the Wagner Affair provided a glimpse of what was to come in the 60s."],"display_date":"February 1, 1951 - May 31, 1951","search_date":"1951-04-01","locations":[{"id":52897,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Winter Park, FL"}],"tags":[{"id":3131,"tag":"student activism"},{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"},{"id":2954,"tag":"College Students"},{"id":3123,"tag":"Paul Wagner"},{"id":438,"tag":"Rollins College"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}},{"id":6739,"title":"The Beginning of a New Frontier","course_id":175,"status":"P","start_date":"7/15/60","end_date":"7/15/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 15, 1960, a crowd of over 80,000 people congregated at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in California, all of them had one thing in common, to hear the words of the newly selected Democratic Presidential Nominee, John F. Kennedy. Before the Kennedy campaign, the United States had entered the early stages of the Cold War, Fidel Castro installed a communist regime ninety miles off the coast of Florida, and the Southern States strongly resisted desegregating schools. Kennedy, a young senator from Massachusetts, was viewed as somebody who offered optimism in the midst of this tumultuous and tension-filled era. As Sara Mehltretter stated in her oratory dissertation, “Kennedy announced the start of a new era in American politics, one in which Americans could look forward with optimism and confidence despite all these challenges.” A future where the possibilities were limitless and citizens had faith in the unknown rather than fear.","As Kennedy took the podium that day, he delivered a speech that is remembered throughout history as the “New Frontier.” The “New Frontier” resembled that of memorable Presidential platforms such as President Theodore Roosevelt's \"Square Deal,\" President Franklin D. Roosevelt's \"New Deal,\" and President Harry S. Truman's \"Fair Deal.\" Kennedy painted the image of a new, progressive America that offered,  “a new generation of leadership--new men to cope with new problems and new opportunities.” It was a government that understood the plight of the common people and was there to benefit all citizens, instead of some. In addition to this, Kennedy spoke of a “New Frontier,” an American frontier that was not “won” or “solved” like Professor Frederick Jackson Turner wrote in his Frontier Thesis. Instead, it was a frontier that has yet to be discovered, let alone explored. This frontier Kennedy spoke of was the “uncharted areas of science and space, unsolved problems of peace and war, unconquered pockets of ignorance and prejudice, and the unanswered questions of poverty and surplus.” It was these areas of the frontier that had yet to be analyzed and then conquered.","Kennedy branded the “New Frontier” not as a list of what the government was going to do for the American people, but rather a set of challenges for the American people. Through the “New Frontier,” Kennedy called for the expansion of the United States foreign aid by promoting the United Nations and providing assistance to newly independent countries. The Peace Corps, Food for Peace, and the Alliance for Progress were also created as a result of the “New Frontier” to further help countries in need. On the domestic front, the “New Frontier” called for a society where the civil and economic liberties of all citizens were not only visible, but also upheld. A society where elderly citizens had access to medical care, technological advancements were used to enhance working conditions and an end to racial discrimination. Kennedy wanted a society where every citizen, regardless of background or race, was able to have the unalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness the founding fathers proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence."],"display_date":"July 15, 1960","search_date":"1960-07-15","locations":[{"id":53088,"lat":34.0140526,"lng":-118.2878754,"zoom":16,"place":"Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Los Angel"}],"tags":[{"id":3422,"tag":"Los Angeles"},{"id":3421,"tag":"DNC"},{"id":3420,"tag":"Food for Peace"},{"id":3418,"tag":"Peace Corp"},{"id":3417,"tag":"Space Race"},{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"},{"id":2855,"tag":"New Frontier"},{"id":2703,"tag":"John F.

She was put on the stand by the prosecution because she and her husband, Julius, were charged with espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union. The trial lasted a month. The Rosenbergs refused an offer of life imprisonment if they pled guilty. As a result, they were executed by electric chair in 1953. It was during the height of McCarthyism that the guilt of Ethel and her husband would come into question as they had been widely believed to have been framed.[2] It is understandable that the guilt of a couple like the Rosenburgs, an all-American family with two children and acted like a regular American family by all accounts, would have been called into question during the Second Red Scare in the 1950s and 1960s because no one in America would want to think that during a time of intense fear and paranoia like the Cold War that an all-around all American couple would go against the nation they were citizens of in order to support the Soviet Union and follow the beliefs of the, at the time, communist Russia because all that did was make everyone extra paranoid about secret communists being everywhere secretly watching what the American people.","According to the FBI’s Vault on Ethel Rosenburg, during the trial, her attorney would ask the jurors in his opening statement, “to not condemn her merely because David Greenglass was a confessed conspirator. He stated that she had protested her innocence from the beginning and that she was dragged into the case by the machinations of the Greenglasses, who wished to lighten their burdens.”[3] Mr. Greenglass, in his testimony against Ethel and Julius, would state, “Ethel told Ruth [wife of David Greenglass] that David was working on the atom bomb project at Los Alamos, and they wanted him to give information concerning the bomb. Ruth told the Rosenbergs that she didn’t think it was a good idea and declined to convey their requests to David. Ethel and Julius then told Ruth that she should at least tell David about it and see if he would help. Julius pointed out that Russia was an ally and deserved the information, and that Russia was not getting all the information that was due her.”[3] Whether or not Ethel Rosenburg was actively participating in acts of espionage for the Soviet Union concerning the atom bomb is difficult to prove as she was not at all cooperative with the FBI during the investigation or the courts during trial."],"display_date":"August 11, 1950 - June 19, 1953","search_date":"1952-01-14","locations":[{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":2,"place":"New York City"},{"id":53217,"lat":35.8800364,"lng":-106.3031138,"zoom":2,"place":"Los Alamos New Mexico"}],"tags":[{"id":3705,"tag":"The Cold War"},{"id":3704,"tag":"Ethel Rosenberg"},{"id":1205,"tag":"Women's History"},{"id":3703,"tag":"Cold War America"},{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":186,"school_id":69}}]}
