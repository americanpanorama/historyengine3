As made official through the Volstead Act and The Eighteenth Amendment, “The manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.” [1] Americans in the South and Midwest, as well as the Ku Klux Klan, and the Women’s Christian Temperance Union had gained Congressional support in ratifying the legislation resulting in the ban of alcoholic beverages in order to hope to improve the behavior, purity of Americans, as well as improving their work ethic. However, this wholesomeness was not achieved as the rise of crime, gangs, smuggling, and more alcoholism among the youth were introduced and flourished in America, especially urban areas.","                When Prohibition was introduced in the Roaring Twenties, America was already experiencing a cultural shift supported by the Progressives and the overall revolutionary ideas Americans were being introduced to. This supports the idea that Prohibition was a social experiment which was not carefully thought out. America had made an early attempt at controlling national alcoholism by trying to limit alcohol sales on individuals including the amount purchased, the distributor, and the frequency of consumption. However, it is significant to note that under the control of Neal Dow, Maine became the first state to introduce temperance and before Congress’ official ban on alcohol thirty-three of the forty- eight states already had prohibition laws. The United States’ national action regarding alcohol was seen as a global example, as noted by Earnest H. Cherrington, the General Secretary of the World League Against Alcoholism in this book <em>American Prohibition</em>, “If American Prohibition should fail, such failure would undoubtedly tend to discourage the anti-alcoholic forces in other parts of the world and to delay the final solution of the world-wide problem.” [2]","                As Cherrington noted, alcoholism and the social experiment of Prohibition not only affected Americans, but had a global impact as well. Upon prohibiting the sale of alcohol in America, those who were still wishing to consume alcohol turned to foreign markets for their supply. As stated by New York congressmen, Fiorello La Guardia, this had a large impact on economics and finances in America at the time, “At least $1,000,000,000 a year is lost to the National Government and the several states and counties in excise taxes.”[3] Because Americans were obtaining their alcohol from foreign or illegal sources, such as bootleggers, there was a great loss in revenue during a time when America could definitely use any financial help.","                These shady means of obtaining alcohol were a direct negative consequence of Prohibition as Americans saw the rise of organized crime, developed an underground culture with places such as speakeasies, and were introduced to a new lawlessness and irresponsibility unseen before the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment. As a visitor to America in 1920, Count Felix von Luckner observed this saying, “A large part of the population has become accustomed to disregard and violate the law without thinking. My observations have convinced me that many fewer would drink were it not illegal.”[4] David Kyvig, a modern day historian, drew from accounts such as Count Felix von Luckner’s to understand the development of the new industry, “The behavior of those who sought to profit by meeting the demand for alcoholic beverages created an indelible image of lawlessness. National prohibition provided a potentially very profitable opportunity for persons willing to take certain risks.”[5] As noted many Americans were disobeying the law because enforcement was so weak and often took part in corruption and indulgence themselves.","                Prohibition, which is either viewed as a Noble Cause or a Social Experiment had both domestic and global impacts and was known for its radical impacts and consequences. In an attempt to control American’s wild drunkenness, Prohibition actually worsened the situation as more crime, lawlessness, and misbehaving occurred.  The failures of Prohibition were both nationally and globally recognized and eventually the ban was repealed by the Twenty-First Amendment."," "," ","[1] <em>The 18<sup>th</sup> Amendment.</em> 30 November 2009 http://www.albany.edu/~wm731882/18th_amendment_final.html"," ","[2]Cherrington, Earnest H. <em>American Prohibition. </em>Westerville, Ohio: World League Against Alcoholism, 1926.","[3] Fiorello La Guardia. <em>Prohibition. </em>1926","[4] Count von Luckner, Felix. <em>Seeteufel erobert Amerika; </em>in Handlin, Oscar<em>.

According to the sheriff, every bottle confiscated when drunken men were held in the station was now at the bottom of the river. This now-public knowledge was met with unrest, and an apparent intention to fish out every last bottle from the river.","Since the story was published in the Sunday morning paper, and this news had only broken Saturday night, what became of this communal anxiety is unknown. What contributes most to this story is the author's speculation about the response. The author embraces the lamenting tone, cursing that the \"liquid joy\" was wasted at the bottom of a river with only the unappreciative fish, and that every fishing tackle must make an effort to do its duty and bring back Delray's \"beloved\" from the River Rouge. An important takeaway from the article is not only the strong devotion to their alcohol, squandered by the good sheriff, but the relationship between the river and the community. It is a waste receptacle, that at this point is at least presumed to contain some fish. This article is a first look at the relationship of a community to a river that 60 years later will catch on fire.","At the turn of the century, Delray was a rapidly growing community on the banks of the river in southwestern Detroit. Armenians, Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles flooded into the town, creating a ethnically diverse area. At the same time industry was beginning to flourish. Detroit United Railway cars would stop in Delray to carry men to the growing industries to work. In the evenings, men would make their way to River Street, a growing business area. One issue of the time was alcohol consumption and concerns over alcoholism in the community. Heavy drinking was common in the growing immigrant communities, and this is reflected in the tone of the story."],"display_date":"May 1909","search_date":"1909-05-16","locations":[{"id":50025,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":518,"tag":"Alcoholism"},{"id":1910,"tag":"River Rouge"},{"id":87,"tag":"Environment"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6294,"title":"<strong>Temperance: The Next Step in Post Civil War Era Social Reform</strong>","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-03-19","end_date":"1870-03-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gerrit Smith, a politician and abolitionist from New York, called for more social reform in the United States.  Smith, also a financial supporter of the <em>Fredrick Douglass’ Paper,</em> urged for reform that focused on curbing the use and distribution of alcohol after the Civil War.  In a public letter to Hon. Henry Wilson, Smith attacked Wilson for his lack of commitment to the temperance cause.  Smith noted, “For years, you were earnestly engaged in the work of voting slavery to death.  Hence you connected yourself with an independent anti-slavery political party, and eloquently summoned your fellow citizens to do likewise.”  Smith went on to ask, “Why is it that you are not now at work to get the dramshop voted out of existence?”  This excerpt implies that Wilson urged people to go to the polls and vote for the end of slavery, however, when it comes to the idea of temperance, Wilson did not advocate following the voter’s will.","Although it is the duty of every citizen to cast their opinion at the polls, after the abolishing of slavery, Wilson was not committed in urging others to vote.  Smith specifically challenges him out on this.  Smith also points out that southern churches had a great impact on their parishes in regards to voting.  He states that churches in the South refused to state that the idea of slavery was immoral, but insisted it was a necessary evil and a political labor.  Likewise, he believed the churches deny and fail to acknowledge the negative use of alcohol.  Thus the churches failed to persuade people to vote a temperance agenda, and in effect, do not change any social policies.  Since most churches are primarily conservative in thinking and by basing the laws on the idea of the Church, not a single social aspect will change.  Smith recognized and respected Wilson’s acknowledgement of temperance as the next step in the acts of social reform, but he called Wilson to be more deliberate in his support.  Instead of simply implying the idea of temperance, Smith asks Wilson to reach out in the church and call people to the polls to vote down alcohol.","Alcoholism in the 1800s was of great concern after the abolishing of slavery.  Many argued this next social reform was much needed.  After the war, the suicide rate of active duty military personnel nearly doubled.  Alcoholism was one of the main causes of suicide.  Soldiers coped with their experiences in the war with the use of alcohol.  However, this also increases the rate of suicide.  Thus, leading to more support to the temperance movement."],"display_date":"March 19, 1870","search_date":"1870-03-19","locations":[{"id":8896,"lat":42.9128684277,"lng":-75.6697351039,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":192,"tag":"Gerrit Smith"},{"id":2107,"tag":"Social Reform"},{"id":518,"tag":"Alcoholism"},{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}}]}
