The <em>Essex</em> had sailed from Nantucket a year ago, scouring two oceans for the whale oil that drove the island’s economy.  On November 20, 1820, the ship was 2000 miles west of South America, over 1200 miles from the nearest island. That day, an eighty-ton sperm whale escaped the pursuing whale boats, attacked the Essex itself, and disappeared into the ocean. The ship, though it remained afloat, was rendered useless, forcing its crew into the small boats. In the weeks ahead, sharks and storms pursued them, threatening to destroy their fragile vessels.","Two months later, adrift amidst the world’s largest ocean, their bodies weak with starvation and dehydration, they cannibalized the dead. “I have,” wrote survivor Owen Chase, “no words to paint the anguish of our souls in this dreadful dilemma. “ Captured in that moment were the desperation and turmoil of an entire cultural perspective. Chase himself related the decision to the deepest questions of religion—their own mortality, the loss of humanity, and the struggle between spirituality and physical necessity. Ethical standards broke down; with no food and no hope of rescue, they drew lots and executed and ate one of their fellow survivors. By the time the last survivors were rescued on February 23, 1821, they had been at sea ninety-six days and been pushed beyond the limits of human endurance. Twelve of the twenty crewmembers had died, six of whom had been cannibalized to sustain the others. Still, in spite of everything, the men returned to their lives in Nantucket, and one by one they returned to the sea.","Embedded in this ordeal were the conflicts of the era’s social and intellectual change. For centuries, whale ship captains had relied on experience and word-of-mouth for knowledge of the oceans they sailed. With the order and rationalization of the nineteenth century emerged entire books devoted to the world’s islands and currents. One such work, Nathaniel Bowditch’s <em>Navigator</em>, revealed the survivors to be only 1200 miles from the Marquesas. The islands, however, were reportedly inhabited by cannibals; though the accounts were unverified, Nantucket conservatism prevailed, and the survivors turned instead for South America. In doing so, in forsaking the rationality of new century for the traditions of old one, they unknowingly condemned eight of their number to death."," "],"display_date":"November 20, 1820 - February 23, 1821","search_date":"1821-01-06","locations":[{"id":6179,"lat":41.2885110748,"lng":-70.2488925622,"zoom":11,"place":"NANTUCKET, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":659,"tag":"whaling"},{"id":660,"tag":"Nantucket"},{"id":661,"tag":"cannibalism"},{"id":662,"tag":"Essex"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5175,"title":"Beale Recounts the Whaling Industry","course_id":58,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-01-01","end_date":"1839-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The whale industry was a vital part of the American economy in the 19th century. Many able-bodied men risked their lives to bring back the precious oil tied up in the blubber and head case of the enormous beasts of the sea. Thomas Beale, a surgeon aboard a whaling vessel, spent many years observing the whaling industry first hand. He took care to document the anatomy and behavior of the whales themselves in addition to giving accounts of incidents during their hunts."," ","One such incident, the capture of a sperm whale one August morning, is documented in Beale’s 1839 book, <em>The Natural History of the Sperm Whale. </em>Four whaling ships had chanced to meet in the same area on this calm morning and every man aboard each ship was on the sharp lookout for whales. Beale’s ship soon spotted one of the creatures and quickly lowered their boats. At the same moment, the three other ships saw the whale too and all the respective ships started to give chase. A boat from Beale’s ship and a rival boat were neck-and-neck and both threw their harpoons at the same time. Beale comments that if both had stuck, it would have been troublesome to figure out to whom the whale belonged. Unfortunately, neither of the harpoons caught. The whale dove and, when he resurfaced, charged straight at one of Beale’s other boats, at which point one man was finally able to hit him. Although disappointed they weren’t the ones to get the whale, the rival boats helped to reel in the whale for Beale’s crew and a fatal blow was finally struck."," ","One might think that, in such a vast ocean, whaling vessels would hardly ever meet up with each other. And even if they did, the chances of three meeting at the same time are hard to comprehend, let alone four at the same time. Robert C. Ellickson, in his paper “A Hypothesis of Wealth-Maximizing Norms – Evidence from the Whaling Industry”, gives an account of the social and legal measures which whaling ships were expected to follow and adhere to while at sea in the business of whaling. If not for strict laws and regulations regarding the capture of whales and allocating them to certain individuals, the whaling industry would have been a chaotic source of economy, riddled with cheating, stealing, and fighting over captured whales. The fact that whalers as a group set down whaling laws showed that America could have “informal social networks [that were] capable of creating rules that establish[ed] property rights”. The whalers did not need a centralized legal system to keep peace amongst themselves and, for over a century, disputes were often settled at sea “without the reassurance from American courts”."],"display_date":1839,"search_date":"1839-07-02","locations":[{"id":52564,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":659,"tag":"whaling"},{"id":881,"tag":"whaling industry"}],"course":{"name":"Literary Theory and Writing","school":"St. Norbert College","course_id":58,"school_id":44}}]}
