For unknown reasons a number of white men grabbed him and led him just a few feet outside of his home. They tied the terrified man's hands behind his back, went into his home, and began robbing him of his money, many types of clothing, a gun, and his horse. After coming out with everything, leaving Browning with nothing but the clothes on his back, they shot him through the head simultaneously with several different guns and pistols. According to Freedman's Bureau agent W.H. Johnson, \"after committing such horrible acts of violence they proceed to the church, and busted down the doors.\" To their surprise, inside was an assemblage of freedmen who bravely protected their church and scared the white men away.  Johnson implored the government to help the freedmen, pleading, \"they go to their church, enter the enclosure, fasten their gates and remain very quiet, interrupting no one, not wishing to interfere with any one, provided they are left unharmed\"","  Reconstruction in the South is still characterized as a time of strict white repression and violence as whites tried to reckon with the freedom of slaves within their communities. Especially in the Deep South, where many parishes had large African American populations, whites coutinely committed acts of violence against freed slaves. African Americans were safe neither in their own homes nor the houses of the Lord. Even the legal system often failed to protect former slaves. Writing a letter had a whole different meaning depending on the color of the hand it came from. W.H. Johnson's letter pled for the unheard voice of the freed slave. Historian Carl H. Moneyhon has explored the post-war dominance of Texas society by whites who ruled their state by violating the human and civil rights of African-American Texans. He argued that Reconstruction offered Texans an opportunity for a society free of race-consciousness, which it rejected, and that the costs of that rejection continue."," After the Civil War, the South suffered from both economic hardship and drastic social change. For centuries, the South had relied on slaves to harvest crops on plantations. When the slaves were free it caused some owners to lose a lot of money. When this happened, six former Confederate soldiers started a hate group called the Ku Klux Klan.  Their random acts of violence led the nation into a swarm of unnecessary and enduring violence such as the 1998 murder of James Byrd, an African American who was dragged for three miles behind a pick-up truck by three white men down a narrow, winding asphalt road. As journalist Dina Temple-Raston detailed in her study of Byrd's murder, the legacies of post-Civil War racial violence continue to haunt present-day Texas."],"display_date":"August 26, 1868","search_date":"1868-08-26","locations":[{"id":13029,"lat":32.8096032441,"lng":-94.3088738744,"zoom":10,"place":"MARION, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":91,"tag":"Murder"},{"id":92,"tag":"Freed Slaves"},{"id":94,"tag":"Hate Crimes"}],"course":{"name":"American Civilizations to 1877","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":20,"school_id":9}},{"id":4585,"title":"The accomplishment of a free Black","course_id":21,"status":"P","start_date":"1798-01-01","end_date":"1798-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Venture Smith, given black's social status in America, knew that his freedom was a privilege and not a right. Venture Smith was always trying to help the African American population, especially buy purchasing other slave's freedom. The first slaves venture smith purchased were his two sons, Solomon and Cuff, which cost him four hundred dollars. Venture Smith made his money by working on the land he had purchased in Long Island, And by selling watermelon. Since Venture Smith was free and owned property, he was able to accomplish more than the average free black person.","Once Venture Smith was able to purchase his whole family, he began to buy as many African Americans as possible. Although he had a kind heart by purchasing slaves, he still expected the African Americans to work for him. Many of the slaves that were purchased did not seem to respect venture Smith because usually within a year they would run away. Venture Smith had an extraordinary life, first being born in Guinea, then becoming a slave, then becoming free, and finally owning other black people. One of the reasons's why people view venture smith as a kind hearted man is because he would still take African Americans word, especially when they told him they would not run away. One African American who worked for venture was named Mingo. Mingo was paid and allowed to stay at Venture smith's house, so that Mingo knew Venture Smith on a personal level. Yet, when Mingo was lent eight dollars from him, Mingo tried took advantage of his boss, by running away with the money. It seemed as if every time that hospitality was given by venture smith to an African American, Venture Smith was taken advantage of. The hardships of plantations created scenarios where slaves had little trust for their masters, and as a result Venture Smith was taken advantage of.

Responding to this problem, the government established The Freedmen’s Bureau. Launched on March 3, 1865, the Bureau provided relief to freed slaves, including giving out clothing, food, and medicine. The Bureau also confiscated land in some of the former confederate states to give them a new start. The differing opponents and sympathizers depicted their views through post-civil war years, most descriptively and creativity through cartoons and drawings.","Geography defined their positions. The northerners accepted the abolition of slavery with open arms. They had a vision that Blacks would be socially regarded with respect. However, proponents realized that state and federal laws needed amending to provide this new life. Freedmen offices in each of the former states eventually hired 550 agents to better the lives of the freed slaves.","However many, mainly southerners, saw the new system as a type of welfare, where freedmen received money, land, food, and clothing without having to do anything in return. In an 1866 political cartoon, a freed slave was depicted as last, cheating the system. The cartoon degraded the African American depicted in the picture, declaring the Freedmen’s Bureau as an “agency to keep the Negro in idle at the expense of the white man.” The white man preformed all the work, while a barefooted African American asked himself “What is de use for me to work as lang as dey make des appropriations?” Critical and defaming prints and cartoons contributed to the end of the Freedmen’s Bureau in 1866."],"display_date":"March 3, 1865 - March 3, 1866","search_date":"1865-09-01","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1119,"tag":"Freedmen's Bureau"},{"id":92,"tag":"Freed Slaves"},{"id":1114,"tag":"Political Cartoons"},{"id":1115,"tag":"Freedmen"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}},{"id":5646,"title":"The Power of the Bible","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-01","end_date":"1849-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","Walking all alone through the dirt roads of Vermont on a bitterly cold winter day, Aaron found himself astonished. Aaron's astonishment had nothing to do with the journey itself; it was far removed from the runaway slave advertisements he had grown accustomed to seeing on the sidewalks of Ohio claiming his name, from the days in which he had to hide whenever there were newcomers in town, from the unforgiving days, the hunger, and the refusal of many white families to let him sleep in their homes. Instead, he was astonished by the supremacy of God: “ … I had froze all my toes and feet; with good shoes and stockings on too… And when I come to realize what the Lord has brought me through, I am really astonished; he has kept my unworthy body from freezing to death, and from starving to death” (Aaron 1849; 18). This becomes a very important moment in Aaron’s life:  the \"poor way-faring Bondman\" had found justice finally--- a true revelation--- in the bible.","Horace Greeley once said, “It is impossible to enslave, mentally or socially, a bible-reading people. The principles of the bible are the groundwork of human freedom.” <em>The Light and Truth of Slavery</em> by Aaron is a commentary that reflects this humanistic idea of the slave having control over his or her future. In the book, Aaron cannot read or write a word, but knows the bible quite well. In fact, after escaping the South, Aaron starts lecturing in churches throughout the North. Aaron touches on issues like slavery, religion, and politics. This book is not your traditional narrative, because very little is known about the narrator’s past. We know that he was born a slave in the South. We also know that the death of his parents precipitated his decision to escape.","One of the biggest themes in Aaron’s book is the slave experience. According to Aaron, slaves often face the difficult decision of running away from their masters and risking their lives. Slaves ran the risk of being caught and placed on the whipping post. On top of that, many slaves often had no food and very little clothing. In the book, Aaron describes his terrible experience during a bitterly cold winter. He says, “When I struck into the Vermont State, for one week I could scarce step a step, cause I had froze all my toes and feet; with good shoes and stockings on too. Little after that time I could pull all my toe nails out like rotten meat…” (Aaron 1849: 18). Slaves like Aaron firmly believed that that if slaves had the option of staying in the South, they would choose to stay without a doubt.","The slave experience is also portrayed in Walter Johnson’s book, <em>Soul by Soul. </em>In the book, he describes the environment of the slave market, which expanded dramatically in cities like New Orleans. African Americans faced the issue of new ownership. As a result, many of them refused to be traded. The book says, “…the slaves had come to know and trust one another, and in the market they could share their observations of the slaveholder and collectively resist them” (Johnson 1967: 16). Others decided to escape rather than accepting a possible trade. Agency was a big issue in the slave market. Slaves were not allowed to have a say when deciding on terms of the contract. Similarly, Aaron's book deals with the difficult decision of escaping slavery and risking their lives. Aaron had seen his parents die from exploitation, and he did not wanted to die like that. He escaped to the North, where he was able to sin his booktart a new life.","In his book, Aaron also talks about a big contraction. He says that most white people say that they are good Christians, and yet they are slaveholders. Aaron thinks that this is hypocrisy. According to him, slavery is a sin and the bible condemns it. Only the worst of the worst could allow such a monstrosity to occur; he states that there are close to three million slaves during the time. Good Christianity, according to Aaron, is loving one another no matter the color or race. He says that preachers in the North are the most evil; they preach one thing in the North and then go back to the South, and become slaveholders. In addition, Aaron hates it when white people say that slaves should be happy where they are, because they are worst off in Africa where “kings” make hundreds of sacrifices.","In short, <em>The Light and Truth of Slavery </em>talks aboutissues that are deeper than slavery. The commentary depicts the journey of a “way-faring bondman” looking for answers. In the book, Aaron travels around the North lecturing people, and asking important questions that everyone should ask, such as why is there slavery in the land of the free? Aaron believes that the answer lies in politics and in the church."],"display_date":1849,"search_date":"1849-07-02","locations":[{"id":6217,"lat":42.3513145465,"lng":-71.9048338794,"zoom":8,"place":"WORCESTER, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"},{"id":92,"tag":"Freed Slaves"},{"id":165,"tag":"Church"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}}]}
