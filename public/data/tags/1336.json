She states, “they probably could not have gone on if it had not been for the support of the North,” demonstrating the dire circumstances that led her to get involved in the first place. Being from the north, Sister Mary hadn’t been exposed to too much of the brutality happening in the South during these “race wars.” After watching the police assault the marchers on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March seventh, Sister Mary knew that she needed to immediately get involved and be an advocate for the demonstrators of this movement for national justice.","Just three days later Sister Mary arrived in Birmingham where she received instant hospitality and kindness from local blacks. She was there to help in hospitals, but also give African American’s an idealistic hope for the future and the equality of races that she thought was so vital. She was also a very strong supporter of the right to vote for all races and knew how many blacks were registered voters as well as how long it would take to register the eligible voters due to the tests put in place to keep blacks out of the voting systems. Amongst all of this, she still speaks with optimism for the future societies potential to be, “a community of love where people gather together as brothers.” She also states that this, “cannot be a reality until people are ready to suffer for justice.” This letter was written during the time when blacks were eager for white activists help, and when whites were discovering the need to participate and stand up against the injustice. However, this letter was written right on the cusp of a racial and historical turn.","Something Sister Mary hadn’t thought about was the possibility that even if racial justice was settled on in the courts, it might never be attained in the community or the attitudes of people. In the late 1960’s, the south was actually on the verge of a tragic failure. Historian Tom Wicker wrote, “despite these idealistic predictions of the future, King's vision of a colorblind society, liberated from the harsh realities of prejudice and discrimination, faced serious barriers after the mid-1960’s<em>.” </em> He also pointed out that the rise of Black Nationalism created rifts between Civil Rights organizations and whites that were dedicated to helping bring about interracial peace.","The black community no longer wanted a lot of help from whites, but rather a sense of independence. This fueled controversy that furthered an already existing conservative white backlash against a lot of the racial progress that had been made over the last several years. By the 1990’s hiring equality, the O.J. Simpson trials and other racial issues were being brought up which raised concern for the long-term success of the civil rights movement and racial amity in America."],"display_date":"March 1965","search_date":"1965-03-16","locations":[{"id":32444,"lat":32.3258382723,"lng":-87.106506935,"zoom":9,"place":"Dallas, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1336,"tag":"racial equality"},{"id":1071,"tag":"Civil Rights Movement"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":84,"school_id":10}},{"id":5765,"title":"Rockwell Kent and Puerto Rico","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"11/1/37","end_date":"11/30/47","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","Rockwell Kent and Puerto Rico","By: Taylor Rodriguez"," ","“All art that is worthwhile is propaganda even if it is nothing more than propaganda for the beauty of life.\"1 In fact, art is just an artist’s way of proclaiming his love of life” In the late 30’s Puerto Rico was struggling to achieve solidarity and independence after refusing to acknowledge U.S. control. This pressing issue at the time was beginning to receive more recognition and more support in the passing years from notable figures. “In this moment, many well-known U.S. intellectuals and artists, including Pearl S. Buck and Paul Robeson, raised their voices to call for an end to U.S. colonialism in Puerto Rico. One however, stood out in this effort. His name: Rockwell kent”2"," ","In November of 1937 Rockwell kent was hired by the  U.S. Treasury Department to create a mural for The Federal Post office in Washington, D.C. with a theme of mail in the tropics. “Sympathetic to agitators seeking to end U.S. dominance in Puerto Rico, Kent planted a cryptic message in a letter featured in the mural depicting mail service to Puerto Rico.”3 Kent used the mural he created to make a statement against U.S. dominance in Puerto Rico, coming out with the message “To the people of Puerto Rico, our friends, go ahead, let us change chiefs. That alone can make us equal and free.”4 Controversy surrounded the bold actions of Kents mural, particularly among the Puerto Rican people. “The message drew a storm of controversy from Puerto Rican officials and from Mr. Dimond. Some Puerto Ricans also found fault with the mural in general, one charging that the artist attempted to make his people out to be “A bunch of african bushmen.””5 Rockwell Kent’s influence on the Puerto Rican solidarity effort was both positive and negative. Kent brought both elements of large support in the political movement, but also brought bad publicity and partial racism."," "],"display_date":"November 1937 - November 1947","search_date":"1942-11-15","locations":[{"id":52656,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":1336,"tag":"racial equality"},{"id":1788,"tag":"Puerto Rico"},{"id":1789,"tag":"Rockwell Kent"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":6219,"title":"Equality in Education","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-02-01","end_date":"1890-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On February 11, 1890, The Town of Winter Park opened not one, but two schoolhouses: Knowles Public school, for whites, and Public School No.31, for blacks. Public School No. 31 had an especially good turnout, with both white and black in attendance. Mayor Robert White Jr. and Founder of Winter Park, Loring Chase, came out to celebrate this moment promoting education.  Chase boasted that “with this, as with Knowles School for white scholars, Winter Park takes formal possession of the best school building in Orange County for a colored school,” and was arguably the best colored school in the state. This dedication towards supporting education in Winter Park both parallels and contrasts with other southern states during this time period. Unlike the rest of the South, Winter Park allowed its black residents to attend school without the fear of being harmed and with the reassurance that they would be receiving a good education. Similar to the communities in other parts of the country, Winter Park began to put more emphasis into the quality of its education.","The fact that a large segment of the town gathered to support the opening of both  Public School No.31 and Knowles School emphasize the importance of education to the community. While the schools were segregated, the ability for the town to support the safety and education of its black citizens was astonishing in comparison to the rest of the south. During this period white southerners embrace racial restrictions for African Americans. These policies banned blacks from experiencing many of the benefits that whites were able to enjoy. For example, while whites were able to go to school and pursue education, racial segregation forced blacks to rely on inadequate resources in their schools. Black students were often forced to learn in broken-down schoolhouses as well as use outdated textbooks. Additionally, students in the South were often victims of lynchings, school burnings and the like. However, in Winter Park the stakes were much different; students were able to attend school with a feeling of security because the town supported both school openings equally. They were also assured that they would receive an adequate education due to Public School No.31 being considered the best of its kind in the state.","Indeed, after the Civil War Florida began to place more emphasis on the importance of education. The US was investing heavily in the importance of education in the 1890s. By 1890 over 70% of all children attended grammar school. Additionally, the amount of high schools in various states rose from 160 in 1870 to over 6,000 by the end of the century. During this time the amount of explicit and implicit expenditures in the US school system rose from $314 million to $515 million in 1880 and 1890 respectively. Winter Park was not far behind in this process. The opening of Knowles School and Public School No.31 in 1890 proves that the importance of education bled into Florida as much as other parts of the country during this historical period."," "," "],"display_date":"February 1890","search_date":"1890-02-14","locations":[{"id":1444,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2433,"tag":"southern education"},{"id":939,"tag":"Public Schools"},{"id":467,"tag":"Black Schools"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":1336,"tag":"racial equality"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6825,"title":"The Brethren Denomination Officially Forbids Slave Ownership","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-05-09","end_date":"1845-05-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In May of 1845, a committee of ordained leaders from the German Baptist Brethren (Church of the Brethren) convened in Roanoke County, Virginia to discuss the most pressing questions facing their denomination. Much of their discussion, according to the minutes of the meeting, focused on the nuances of traditional Brethren theology in terms of worldliness, alcohol use, nonresistance, feet washing, service language, and the like. Additionally, the topic of slavery appeared in their annual discourse. The elders made their position clear, saying “it would be best for a follower of Jesus Christ to have nothing at all to do with slavery.” They forbade both owning and hiring slaves. The committee also considered admitting African Americans into the church. While the decision to admit free blacks into the church was left to individual congregations, the committee made certain that if they were admitted they would be treated as equals to whites, asserting that the love of God “makes no distinction in the brotherhood” according to race.","At the time of this meeting, the slavery crisis in the United States divided religious denominations. At the start of the nineteenth century, the Second Great Awaking set a spark among Protestants in the North. According to historian James McPherson, this revival created numerous reforms and a collective conscience among New England’s Protestants. Slavery was deemed a sin and religion-based abolitionism flared up. Many Protestants in the South moved increasingly in the opposite direction, developing biblical defenses of their “peculiar institution”. As a result of these sectional divisions over slavery, in 1844 the Methodists, followed by the Baptists in 1845, and the Presbyterians in 1858, were torn into separate factions, North and South.","Although written some 157 years after the first organized Anabaptist criticism of slavery, this denomination-wide decision contrasts sharply with those of other American Protestants. The Brethren became unified. While some Brethren had individually denounced slavery, others did own slaves. The denomination also crossed sectional lines, existing both above and below the Mason-Dixon Line. According to the previous year’s meeting minutes, the elders accepted an invitation from the Roanoke, Virginia congregation. It is unclear why exactly they selected this locale, but it provided the perfect setting to discuss the question of slavery. They discussed the immorality of slavery in the home of that institution. By adopting the resolution in Virginia, there could be no question that slave state Brethren were included. In addition, to soothe possible divides, the elders selected a softer stance on the integration of free blacks. Although the elders felt all men were created equal and that it would be best for all to accept them into the church, they left it up to individual congregations and offered some mercy to those who were “weak in the faith.” By clarifying the Brethren’s stance on slavery and racial equality, this 1845 meeting placed the Brethren squarely in the court of abolitionism in the wake of national division."],"display_date":"May 9, 1845 - May 10, 1845","search_date":"1845-05-09","locations":[{"id":53156,"lat":37.2467123,"lng":-80.1205256,"zoom":6,"place":"Roanoke County, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1336,"tag":"racial equality"},{"id":3615,"tag":"Protestants/Anabaptists"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
