the Civil War, political machines exerted strong control over Lousianna politics.  Louis Wiltz, the Democrat who defeated Judge Taylor Beattie for the governorship in 1879, died in office in October of 1881.  Wiltz was a French creole of German ancestry, who experienced great success in the Lousianna business world and became vice-president of the Louisianna State National bank before being elected the first Democratic mayor of New Orleans after the Civil War.  In 1877, the Democrats installed Wiltz as leitenant governor, while the Republicans simultaneously installed Mr. C. C. Antoine, a black ex-barber in the same position under governor Packard.  However, when Hayes withdrew the federal troops in New Orleans, the government under Packard and Antoine lost power and Wiltz obtained the leitenant governorship.  He became the Louisianna Governor in 1879.  &lt;br /&gt;Wiltz's rise to the governorship demonstrates the chaos in the South that accompanied the lack of strong national power that characterized the Gilded Age of American history.  Upon Wiltz's death, Leiutenant Governor Samuel McEnery took over as governor and held office until 1888.  His time in office in considered the period of classical Bourbonism in Louisianna,' and he utilized the corrupted, fraudulent power derived from the state lottery system, dominated by Major E. A. Burke, and the Democratic political organization referred to as the Ring.'

Despite being presided over by James Monroe, John Marshall, and James Madison, he described the Convention as full of  selfish passions,' petty prejudices and heavily hampered by local interests. Rogers saw many talented men that spent much time debating but arrived at no satisfactory solution of the problems they were assembled to solve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the Convention was not a complete failure it did not accomplish all that it had set out to do, and it was not meant to last.

Randolph's prediction was but a year off. In twenty-one years the Convention of 1850 met to redraft Virginia's constitution.

Upon arrival in the city, referred to by Civil War historian James McPherson as the “communications center for abolition,” Knight and Hughes were met with hostility and resistance, rather than cooperation or even legal compliance, with the Act.","William and Ellen Craft had escaped their master’s hold two years prior, in December of 1848. Ellen, being the offspring of an African American woman and her white owner, had sufficiently light-skin as to cross the color-line, disguised as an ailing white man, after obtaining the proper attire and cutting her hair. With William posing as Ellen’s servant accompanying his master, the couple traveled on a variety of steamships and trains inconspicuously even though stopping in several slave-holding areas, such as Charleston, SC, Wilmington, NC, Fredericksburg, VA, and others before finally crossing the Mason-Dixon line into Pennsylvania.","Soon after the couple settled themselves in Boston, the Crafts became involved in the active abolitionist efforts in the city. With a firm community of members in Beacon Hill, the Crafts found themselves swept up in abolitionist lecture circuits throughout the area. Unfortunately, such activism naturally increased the risk of discovery, as they told the story of their disguised escape to fellow campaigners. Thus, when the Fugitive Slave legislation passed, the Crafts’ owner knew exactly where to find the pair.","While Section 5 of the Fugitive Slave Act required that “..all good citizens [were thereby] commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient execution of this law..” the reaction to Knights and Hughes was anything but. Theodore Parker, the chair of the Vigilance Committee, (the primary organization in Boston created to aide fugitive slaves, which had increased by 100 members since the arrival of the two slave catchers) hid Ellen in his home, placed William in a separate safe haven, and ensured that both blacks were guarded by at least one armed white. Additional members of the committee filled the town with notices depicting the “two prowling villains,” “the pursuing bloodhounds,” as they were described.","Yet the truly extreme abhorrence for the Fugitive Slave law among these Boston abolitionists was seen in the multiple arrests of Knight and Hughes. The two were arrested on October 26 around 3 p.m. by Deputy Sheriff Coburn, according to <em>The</em> <em>Farmer’s Cabinet, </em>on charges of slander against William Craft. After making bail, both men were again arrested some hours later, this time for conspiracy to kidnap the Crafts, accordingly in clear violation of the new legislation.

The consequences of this led to a President that did not deal well with the growing strife that was ripping apart the nation, and his actions let them worsen.  The southern zeal for the protection of its rights overshadowed the needs of the Union.  Governor Wise's desperate support of Buchanan reveals the rise of political parties that were just against anything that did not help southern rights, as opposed to a united party that knew exactly what it wanted.

As South Carolinian leaders gathered in Columbia, they quickly tackled the Fourteenth Amendment decision.  After an overwhelming no' vote (95 to 1) in the house, and a decidedly negative response from the senate as well, the legislature failed to ratify the amendment.  James L. Orr, then Governor of South Carolina, commented that Congress was unreasonable to require southern states to concede the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.&lt;br /&gt;The anti-ratification sentiments of Governor Orr and the legislature were echoed throughout the state, both before and after the no' vote.  Almost a month before the legislature reconvened, an impassioned letter to the editor appeared in a local South Carolina newspaper, <em>The Laurensville Herald</em>.

Others held the view that sex after marriage had procreative purpose only. However, many so-called free thinkers such as Charles Knowlton, Abner Kneeland, and Samuel Thompson recognized that Victorian ideals clashed with the reality of everyday life. Many unmarried women who found themselves pregnant used abortion as commonplace birth control practice. ","Abortion practices were not always safe. Local doctors replaced local midwives who had previously performed abortion procedures. However, little actual gynecological medical training or practice complicated the procedure. Many in new medical professional groups pushed for greater autonomy and influence of highly trained medical practitioners to replace the backward practices of quacks who advocated abortion. In Missouri and throughout the South, this growing influence created a greater movement towards white professional doctors. The effect led to the passage of the 1835 St. Louis, Missouri abortion statute, a full twenty years before many states passed similar laws. However, this law hardly stopped sex among unmarried couples or hindered adulterous relationships. Women and men circumvented the law by turning to the work of the free-thinkers, who published and distributed pamphlets on sexual and reproductive health and contraceptive methods. In the South alone, liberal literature included topics about contraceptive methods and sexual advice. This literature circulated to more than 200 agents by 1836, many of whom operated near St. Louis and along the Mississippi river. One popular example included Knowlton's Fruits of Philosophy, which made it to third edition within three years of its original publication in 1830. Popular mail-order items in Missouri-among other states nationwide-included condoms, feminine cleansing products, and abortifacients. Though free-thought groups flourished nationwide, they often kept semi-private for fear of being thought liberal and infidel in their causes. More readily available and cheaper contraceptive devices for men-a dozen condoms sold for three dollars in 1850-allowed couples to engage in sexual relationships, although secret, with fewer consequences.","Many kept their sexual freedoms covert in Missouri and the South not only because of the abortion law, but also because of the issue of interracial sexual relationships. As Nathan Stormer notes, reproductive control for early opponents represented a cacophonous...threatening assault on the status quo of gender, family and class relations. Many feared that if fear of pregnancy were removed from sexual intercourse, wives' sexual faithfulness could not be assured, legitimate children might not so easily be distinguished from illegitimate children, and bloodlines and inheritance might, in consequence, be jeopardized. Because inheritance often dictated property rights in the South, the case of illegitimate-and perhaps mulatto-children produced from an adulterous relationship made easier with birth control brought this issue to the regional and national forefront."],"display_date":1835,"search_date":"1835-07-02","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1956,"title":"The Honey War Boundary Dispute\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-12-02","end_date":"1839-12-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Colonel John C. Sullivan established the borders of pre-statehood Missouri and marked what he thought would be the northern boundary of Missouri. Unfortunately, Sullivan made a major error in his plans, which caused a discrepancy in the boundary line. This mistake made one part of the border more than four miles larger than the other. By 1833 when many people had settled in the area and were applying for Iowa statehood, this unnoticed error came to the forefront as the boundary line came into question. Missouri officials sent surveyor Joseph Brown to re-survey the Sullivan line in 1837. However, the vague description of the line's supposed origin outlined in the Missouri Constitution at the rapids of the river Des Moines, created another problem. The difference between the two survey lines was more than 2,500 acres and created a vast expanse of land that officials from both Missouri and Iowa claimed state ownership. By 1839 however, the conflict increased when Missouri sheriffs attempted tax collection in the disputed strip of land. Iowa governor Robert Lucas warned Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs that the Missouri sheriffs would not be permitted to do this, but Boggs threatened militia action to ensure the taxes were collected. Missouri once again attempted to collect taxes in December of 1839, but Iowa officials arrested the Missouri sheriff. Both Missouri and Iowa called on their local militias to gather at the disputed strip of land. In the process, soldiers destroyed several profit-turning honey trees causing further upheaval between the states. A poem published by satirist John L. Campell entitled The Honey War mirrored the popular criticism of the two governors, giving the dispute its unofficial name.","With militias poised to fire, Clark County, Missouri formed a committee to deal with the issue. On December 24, 1839, peace talks led to the adoption of resolutions...requesting the two governors to submit the boundary question to Congress and suspend military operations. Governors Boggs and Lucas remained on poor terms while the line dispute remained unsettled. The Supreme Court finally settled the dispute in 1851, which established the Sullivan line as the official northern boundary of the state of Missouri. While the boundary dispute between Missouri and Iowa resolved itself fairly quickly, other southern land disputes at the time did not. United States governmental interactions with indigenous Native American populations led to conflict over land rights, especially when they removed Cherokees from their land in Georgia in the late 1830s. Later known as the Trail of Tears, U.S. government officials claimed tribal lands to accommodate whites who journeyed into the South to claim gold rumored hidden within the Georgia hills. The United States moved Native Americans to reservations throughout the mid-nineteenth century as a commonplace practice. Native Americans had limited negotiation power with the United States and reduced their autonomy to little consequence when they tried to settle land and boundary disputes."],"display_date":"December 2, 1839 - December 24, 1839","search_date":"1839-12-13","locations":[{"id":8031,"lat":38.288627243,"lng":-94.3452200361,"zoom":9,"place":"VAN BUREN, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1961,"title":"By-law Implemented for Gun Control \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-03-25","end_date":"1824-03-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Mayor and Common Council of Annapolis declared a by-law to prevent the firing of guns within the city limits. The Mayor first informed the citizens of Annapolis on the by-law in an article published in the local paper, <em>The Maryland Gazette</em>, on March 25, 1824. The article permitted a week long period of time for news of the by-law to reach the people of Annapolis before the Common Council planned to implement it within the city limits. Under this by-law, any person found guilty of firing or discharging a gun within city limits except when performing military duty, shall be fined a sum no less than one or more than five dollars. In addition, this by-law declared that any person found guilty of carrying a gun uncovered through any of the streets, lanes or alley of this city shall be viable to a fine of one dollar."," In 1824, guns tended to be tools, luxury items, or broken relics. According to historian Jan E. Dizard, the people around Annapolis had to rely on blacksmiths to make repairs to their guns, since most areas lacked gunsmiths. Blacksmith most often had little knowledge of guns, and did not know how to make proper repairs. The overwhelming majority of guns tended to be poorly cared for, and passed from generation to generation."," The Annapolis by-law established that if any person offending against the provision of this by law shall be a slave and the owner or employer shall not elect to pay the penalty inflicted then another punishment will be in order, as long as it does not exceed thirty nine lashes or ten days imprisonment. Historian Dizard claims that in the nineteenth century, guns were mostly made of iron, and in order to prevent them from rusting they required constant attention. Thus, unless people of the Annapolis area had servants who constantly cared for their guns, they rarely brought a gun out with them. Any slaves within Annapolis city limits with possession of a fire-arm most likely had masters that put them in charge of caring for their guns. The Annapolis by-law presumably affected the relationship between slaves and their owners. With the implementation of the by-law, slave owners hesitated to entrust their slaves with care of their weapons. Slave owners feared that punishment of their slaves would have an effect on their own reputation among the people of Annapolis. No master wanted to be viewed as a man who could not keep his slaves under control. In addition, if a slave received thirty nine lashes or ten days imprisonment this slowed down the productive capacity of a slave owner's property.

The congressional seats of important mining areas are described like commodities sold to the highest bidder. The paper describes the people as disenfranchised by the power of mineral kings, and that they had no more voice in the Senate than the people of England do in their House of Lords.

In fact, election fraud became such a problem that Virginia elections were challenged no less than sixteen times between the years of 1874 and 1900. The Democratic Party even appealed to the Southern white man's fear of the newly freed, enfranchised black American by calling Republican rule Negro rule. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, however, voters were becoming more and more disillusioned by the political process, and by the 1890's, the Democratic Party, so confident in the Solid South faced huge problems of voter apathy. Voter participation was around 40 percent in some areas as the South toward the end of the nineteenth century and in some years it even fell below that.

With the decline of the economy following Grover Cleveland's election and his repealing of the Sherman Silver Purchase act, his Democratic base began to falter, and the Populist Party support of the free coinage of silver began to invade much of the Democratic Party. An article written on January 16, 1895, in Clarke County, Virginia's, Clarke Courier attacked these Democrats, who have more love for populist teachings than a wise and economic administration of public affairs. The newspaper recognized the great threat that these party dissidents posed to the security of the Party, writing that though the group is a minority, they still have the power to cause the majority to yield to its dictation. The paper holds that this new free silver coinage party will fail just as the greenbackers had decades before. "," The hard-line Democratic loyalists, that is, the Democrats loyal to Cleveland, claimed that Cleveland is the subject of ridicule and criticism due to his unshakable belief in the gold standard. They couldn't believe the idea that some of their own Party members would believe that a free silver coinage system would work; they believed that the United States was too big a place in the world to adopt such a financial policy. What the paper failed to recognize, however, was the extent of the power free-silver Democrats and of the Populist Party. Perhaps the political writers of the paper were in denial, or perhaps they genuinely didn't see it coming. However, in the election of the following year, the Democratic Party (as predicted by the article) yielded to the free silver Democrats under William Jennings Bryan, but fell to the Republican's solid gold standard in part due to the confusion that the Party's platform created in attempting to cater to hard-line Democrats, free-silver Democrats, and even Populists. This confusion and split in the Party affected even the 1894 Congressional election, where Democratic Party fell to the Republicans' 150,000 vote majority. As the split between the Democratic Party widened and the Populist Party remained a threat, the strife between the sections only worsened and the Republican victory in 1896 was virtually assured.","Date: January 16, 1895","Location: Berryville, Clarke County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Economy, Government, Law, Politics","Episode Scope: Local, Regional, National","Clarke Courier, January 16, 1895.

Palmore, an attorney in Fayette County, Tennessee, wrote a letter to one of his colleagues. Attorney Edward Brown received the letter from Palmore in Ballsville, Virginia. Palmore boasted the supremacy of the state of Tennessee to the state of Virginia. I will say nothing about the fertility of our soil and other advantages afforded here to the young and enterprising, Palmore declared. He quickly transitioned into the matter he wished to discuss: the issue of the settlement of John Robinson's estate."," C.S. Palmore acted as the administrator of Robinson's estate. He discussed primarily the placement of John Robinson's negroes. Initially Palmore left them with a woman by the name of Miss Frances. Yet as Palmore specified, Robinson did not name Miss Frances as the legatee of the estate. By legatee Palmore meant beneficiary, or the person named in a will to receive part or all of the state. In fact, in his letter to attorney Edward Brown, Palmore acted concerned only with the need for the legatees to pay Miss Frances for her trouble and expense as caretaker of Robinson's slaves. He hoped that Brown could help him find the legatees, a family he finally referred to as the Merymans. Palmore proposed that Brown act as (his) agent in the matter and if the legatees apply for their negroes if they will pay all charges and will release me in your better judgment you may let them have them or if they will sell them to you it will meet my full and harty approbation."," John Robinson?s written will provided instructions for the delegation of all his estate. C.S. Palmore struggled and sought help on only the matter of the future of Robinson?s slaves. Although the woman he referred to in his writing seemed to willingly look after Robinson?s slaves, Palmore pointed out the imposition of this to Edward Brown. Miss Frances benefited only marginally if at all from keeping Robinson's slaves. He seemed to insinuate that the cost was more than she can afford. Palmore declared to Brown that Miss Frances' account for raising George (one of Robinson's slaves) up to the first of February 1845 was 66.73 dollars. "," Slaves like George could either be an asset or a liability in the South. Robinson?s slaves became a liability to Miss Frances and she could only profit from their sale. Bobby Lovett's <em>The African-American History of Nashville, Tennessee</em>, describes a similar exchange that was had with a slave named Frank. When Frank's owner died he was left to his heirs who promptly made plans to convert this asset into cash. Whether in Tennessee, Virginia, or elsewhere in the South, inherited slaves posed a problem to both executors and beneficiaries of estates. Slaves required housing, food, and clothing. Slaves possessed too great a value to just give up, but created a cost that some inheritors could not afford to bear."],"display_date":"March 1, 1846","search_date":"1846-03-01","locations":[{"id":11986,"lat":35.1984324227,"lng":-89.4156896322,"zoom":9,"place":"FAYETTE, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2006,"title":"Townsmen Pledge to End the Sale of Liquor in Central Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-05-13","end_date":"1876-02-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dr. Baldwin Buckner, a physician from Louisa County, Virginia, was a determined and resolute man.  He held fast to his beliefs in spite of outside pressures that urged him to do otherwise.  Buckner refused to give his son, Horace, any extra funds besides those that were sufficient to cover his boarding expenses while he was teaching.  In letters that Horace wrote in 1875 and 1876, he made a desperate plea to his father to send money.  Horace asked his father, Do you mistrust me so much as not to be able to trust me at all?  Horace confessed that his gambling and drinking had contributed to his previous problems in money management but swore that he no longer engaged in either activity.  Yet, a year after Horace claimed he was abstaining from liquor, he wrote his father an additional letter.  In this letter Horace recounted his participation in a fracas, in which his hand was bitten through.Horace's description of the event was notably brief and void of detail; Horace left it up to his father to decide whether his son and the aggressor were intoxicated the night that the fracas occurred.  Buckner refused to provide Horace with funds to be used at his discretion.  Central Virginians like Buckner realized the necessity of action at all levels of society, including the family, in order to further Prohibition in Central Virginia.","Community leaders in Central Virginia other than Buckner took action in their region to enforce growing sentiments regarding the impropriety of liquor consumption, in response to the spread of Prohibition across the South in the second half of the nineteenth century.  In 1883, a group of seven men from Fluvanna County signed a petition and sent it to three fellow townsmen, in an effort to entice locals to pledge that they would help to end the sale and distribution of liquor in the county.  In the January 27, 1885 publication of Fredericksburg's local paper, the <em>Free Lance</em>, the editor posted the names of the officers along with the meeting times of several local groups of prohibitionists.  Two of these coalitions, the United Lodge Sons of Sobriety and the Stonewall Lodge Sons of Sobriety, were exclusive to men.  The other temperance groups the paper advertised had religious affiliations, such as the Grand United Order of True Reformers, Christian Star Lodge, No. 29.  The paper specified that the members of this group were colored, and the paper listed both men and women as the officers of the Order.                  ","Groups of impassioned local citizens with the same determination as Buckner joined forces in order to attack the problem at the state level by forming a larger contingency of social reformers in Virginia, according to Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hoftstra in <em>Virginia Reconsidered</em>.  In 1883, eight local chapters of the Women's Christian Temperance Union merged in order to form a version of the WCTU that serviced the entire state of Virginia.  According to The Encyclopedia of Religion in the South, the beliefs of Christians across the South concerning the accountability of the individual for his or her sins and improprieties gave impetus to the formation and activity of both the WCTU and other local prohibitionist groups.  Groups of African American Christians, like the Fredericksburg Grand United Order of True Reformers, played an integral role in the spread of Prohibition in Virginia and other southern states, as well.  ","Although there is a wealth of information regarding the success of the groups that coalesced in an effort to further Prohibition, less is known about the actions of individuals, such as Horace Buckner's father.  Yet these individuals' actions were equally essential to the success of the movement.  Because women made great strides in the Prohibition movement as a result of their activism, historians have focused mainly on women's efforts.  Thus, the correspondence between Buckner and his father is a relatively rare chronicle of the manner in which a man labored to establish abstinence in his family.  Prohibition was personal.  Although Prohibition was a political issue, it was a topic that commanded the attention of individuals, like Dr. Buckner, throughout the nation who had personally witnessed the damage and destruction that resulted from the use of alcohol."],"display_date":"May 13, 1875 - February 9, 1876","search_date":"1875-09-26","locations":[{"id":14013,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2013,"title":"Race Relations in the Late Nineteenth Century in Central Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-05-05","end_date":"1888-05-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As William Bibb read the letter, he grew anxious and apprehensive about the decision he had to make.  Bibb, a Louisa County attorney, received a letter on May 5, 1888 from R. M. Barllock in Woodburn, Virginia asking Bibb to represent him in a law suit involving a former slave.  Barllock wanted to collect money from the estate of a man who had passed away several years ago.  In his letter to Bibb, Barllock explained that the suit was in favor of a former slave, Bob Carr, who was attempting to claim the legacy that he was entitled to according to his deceased master's will.  Barllock informed Bibb that he had consulted a judge on the matter who laughed and said that Bob had forfeited his freedom nor could a master leave a servant a legacy.  The court room was one of the venues in which racial tensions tinged interactions that transpired between blacks and whites in Central Virginia during the 1880s and 1890s. As individual whites from Central Virginia stumbled upon opportunities to influence the welfare of a black person whose life or liberty was in immediate danger, they made conscious, personal decisions which either reinforced discriminatory behavior or called the contemporary dynamics of racial relations into question.  ","William Bibb's dilemma was similar to the conundrum faced by Judith Randolph, who lived in Central Virginia nearly a century earlier.  According to Melvin Ely in<em> Israel on the Appomattox,</em> Judith Randolph had to decide whether to obey the instructions in her late husband's will that indicated his desire to free all of his slaves and provide them with parcels of land.  Despite the passage of nearly 100 years and the abolition of slavery, the question over the legitimacy of blacks' claims to money or property left to them by a deceased master remained a topic of debate in Central Virginia.  Bibb faced the decision of taking the case and arguing against a black man's rights to a legacy that was clearly left to him in a will or refusing to defend Barllock.  By refusing to represent Barllock, Bibb could either make a political statement of his support for blacks' legal rights or simply maintain a comfortable distance from the issue.","During this time, people from Bibb's region, Central Virginia, behaved towards blacks in contradictory ways.  In some instances Central Virginians were tolerant and respectful of blacks' rights.  In <em>Free Lance</em>, Fredericksburg's city paper, the author of an obituary for Pat Boxley dubbed him a leading and influential colored politician and drayman of Fredericksburg.   Yet, Central Virginians of the time made discriminatory distinctions between whites and blacks.  Not only was Boxley a politician, he was a colored politician.  In fact, every time a reporter mentioned a black person in Free Lance in the 1880s, the person's name was followed by the marker colored.    ","Like the man who wanted to deny Carr his legacy, whites across Virginia expressed their sense of dominion, and superiority in regards to black people in a variety of contexts, according to Edward Ayers in <em>The Promise of the New South</em>.  These racial tensions haunted blacks on a daily basis by providing unmistakable reminders of blacks' inferior social status and their minimal claims to the civil rights that were guaranteed to white Virginians.  Questions concerning the legitimacy of blacks' rights as well as efforts by whites to deny or remove these rights were evident in a variety of contexts besides the courtroom.  As Ayers illustrates, the 1880s and 1890s marked the beginning of major segregation efforts in most southern states, including Virginia.  Ayers explains that southerners exerted great effort to pass discriminatory laws that governed the daily interactions between blacks and whites in the 1880s.  The struggle in race relations in the 1880s and 1890s resulted from whites' feelings of superiority and mastery over, as Ayers asserts, those who intentionally or accidentally stepped over some invisible and shifting line of permissible behavior."],"display_date":"May 5, 1888","search_date":"1888-05-05","locations":[{"id":14014,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2019,"title":"Lunatic Asylums in Virginia after the Civil War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-02-16","end_date":"1881-02-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1881 Mr. Johnson broke free from the Central Lunatic Asylum in Richmond, Virginia.  After discovering that Johnson had escaped, the staff of the asylum realized that they needed to act quickly.  An employee hurriedly wrote a note in order to inform the Sheriff of Louisa County of the incident before he had an opportunity to apprehend Johnson.  On February 16, 1881 the employee reported to the Sheriff, Mr. Johnson, a colored inmate from your county escaped from this asylum.  If he gives no trouble he will be allowed to remain at large. . .  The staff of the asylum did not want the Sheriff to return Mr. Johnson to the facility.  ","In Central Virginia during the late nineteenth century, judges and sheriffs decided the fate of those who the courts declared lunatics, such as Mr. Johnson. Judges customarily rendered decisions concerning a person's sanity.  On January 23, 1882 a court in Mr. Johnson's home county, Louisa, declared that William P. Anderson was a lunatic and ordered the Sheriff to transport Mr. Anderson to the lunatic asylum in Staunton, Virginia.  The judges noted in the next line of the court order that the Sheriff should instead take Mr. Anderson to the asylum in Williamsburg, Virginia.  Judges sent lunatics to one of the several nearby asylums in the state, such as the asylum in Richmond, Staunton, and Williamsburg.  Virginia asylums, such as the Central Lunatic Asylum where the Louisa judges sent Johnson, experienced problems with overcrowding in the 1880s and 1890s. Judges considered which facility could accommodate new patients when choosing where a lunatic should be sent.  ","During the latter half of the nineteenth century, an insanity judgment carried a different meaning for blacks, such as Mr. Johnson, and whites in Central Virginia.  Fredericksburg's paper,<em> Free Lance</em>, printed an article about a local colored man who was sent to the jail because the asylum in Virginia for colored lunatics was full at the time.  Thus, some asylums in Virginia were completely segregated.  Other facilities in Virginia took in both black and white patients.  Many asylums in the South segregated each ward by race, in order to prevent problems. The intermixing of black and white patients in asylums throughout Virginia and in other southern states led to racial tensions, which often escalated into verbal insults or physical assaults between inmates, according to Gerald Grob in <em>Mental Illness in American Society</em>.  Furthermore, Grob posits that white attendants often physically attacked black inmates who retaliated against their white aggressors.  To keep a colored inmate like Mr. Johnson outside of the facility would have helped to quell the racial tensions that spread throughout the asylums in Virginia and throughout the South at the time.","On account of the cruel treatment and violence against blacks that infiltrated the asylums of Virginia, Johnson had motivation to escape.  As Johnson escaped from the asylum, he also escaped the cruel and inhumane punishment reserved for lunatics in the asylums of the period. Confinement in an asylum in Virginia and throughout the South during this period was in many ways comparable to placement in the penitentiary.  The Fredericksburg judge decided to send the colored man to jail when the asylum was full, as a result of the similarities in the treatment received at asylums and prisons.  According to David Rothman, the wardens of the penitentiaries utilized brute force and cruel torture methods to impose order and command deference to authority.  The staff of the asylums also frequently utilized physical force or restraint devices on the inmates.  Superintendents of insane asylums developed procedures for the asylums that instilled a militaristic sense of order, restraint, and regularity.  Moreover, inmates had little to no contact with their families once admitted to an asylum.  The conditions in lunatic asylums throughout the South rendered inmates, like Johnson, ready to leave upon the first opportunity."],"display_date":"February 16, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-16","locations":[{"id":14014,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2023,"title":"Slave Family Gets Smuggled to John Clark&#39;s Trader&#39;s Yard\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-01","end_date":"1863-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1861, it was illegal for Missourian traders to sell slaves to slaveholders in a different state. That did not prevent Captain Tirrell from taking Mattie Jackson, her brother, and her sister away from their mother and putting them onto a boat headed to Memphis. However, before the boat left St. Louis, Union policemen stopped the boat and returned the young slaves to their master. The Union policemen took no further action. Mattie recalled, Their power was limited to the suppression of the selling of slaves that go out of the city. Then two years later, seven men, four watchmen, and three traders, forced themselves into her home and put her family into a closed carriage. This carriage took them to a dilapidated prison where they spent the night. Mattie recalled that, [the] kidnapping had been in contemplation from the time [they] were before taken and returned. The family was transferred from one train car to another, until they finally arrived in Louisville where they were held at John Clark's trader's yard. The family was sold out separately, except [her] mother and little brother, who were sold together. Mattie recalled that her mother and brother spent two weeks in the trader's yard, her sister six weeks, and herself four.","Mattie's family was enslaved in Missouri at the beginning of the Civil War. Missouri was considered a border state and ultimately remained a member of the Union. Historian Ira Berlin argues that President Lincoln promised to respect the property rights of slaveholders in border states in order to keep them in the Union. Thus, slavery remained legal in Missouri. As Mattie knew however, interstate slave trading was outlawed. Despite violating the law, Captain Tirrell smuggled Mattie and her family out of the state and sold them in Louisville. Many other slaves experienced similar incidents. Mattie noted considerable smuggling was done. Although Union soldiers protected some slaves from being sold to areas outside of Missouri, slave owners and traders who [pretended] Unionism successfully smuggled slaves out of the state. ","The Union soldiers were not the only people Captain Tirrell fooled while smuggling his slaves out of Missouri. Mattie stated that Captain Tirrell tricked and deceived her family before he forced them to the trader's yard. She recalled that Captain Tirrell's kindness, generosity, and approbation to the contemplated marriage was only a trap. Such lies and trickery were common among slave owners in the South. Historian Walter Johnson argues, Many sellers resorted to ingratiation, deceit, and coercion. Slaveholders told their slaves that they would not be traded and then sold those same slaves weeks - or even days - later.

The Republicans of Missouri, taught by a sublime religion, remember that while to err is human, to forgive is divine. The Civil War had been over for over five years, but former rebels in Missouri still could not fully participate in the state government. Members of the State Republican Committee released this address on the eve of an election to fix the political character of the state. The announcement declared it was time to propose an amendment to the state constitution, granting the right of suffrage to those lately in rebellion. The last General Assembly decided by a respectable majority that the people at large would use a direct vote to resolve the question at hand. It was in the opinion of the State Republican Committee that civil privileges should be given back to those who rebelled. On August 12, 1870, the time [had] come when without danger to the state, full forgiveness and restoration to civil rights [could] be unconditionally given to those justly disfranchised."," At the conclusion of the Civil War, Radical Republicans in Missouri wanted to limit civil liberties to those people whose principles led directly to the recognition of universal manhood and universal freedom, with no paralyzing distinction of caste or of color. In order to ensure these ideals, the state government revoked the civil liberties of those who rebelled against the Union. Not all whites welcomed the North's victory in the war. Missouri was a border state and had citizens who pledged loyalty to each side of the conflict. Historians Eric Foner and Olivia Mahoney state that many southern whites reacted to military defeat and emancipation with dismay. These whites passed black codes denying blacks the right to vote and establishing what appeared to be a system of slavery without the name. To help prevent such measures, Radical Republicans in Missouri dissolved the current state government and created new state governments where rebels were excluded from power. In protecting the new rights of African Americans, the Republican Party thought the rebels were justly disfranchised. "," Missouri was not the only state that revoked the civil liberties of those who rebelled. The national government also played an active role preventing former rebels from obstructing the integration of African Americans into southern society. According to Foner and Mahoney, Andrew Johnson's Presidential Reconstruction, offered a pardon to all Southern Whites, except Confederate leaders and wealthy planters, who took an oath of allegiance."," The time it took for rebels in Missouri to regain their right to vote and participate in the state government closely mirrored that of the rest of the country. In America's Reconstruction, Eric Foner claims that by 1870 all the former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union and that the rebels' regained their rights quickly thereafter. It took over five years, but by August 12, 1870, the State Republican Committee announced the state was ready to restore the civil rights to former supporters of the Confederacy."],"display_date":"April 12, 1870","search_date":"1870-04-12","locations":[{"id":7919,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST.

In 1837, 3,500 dollars was a lot of money. Converting the sum to real 2005 terms, it would yield almost 69,000 dollars. The Panic of 1837 rendered every penny worthless. Judge Thomas Douglas of the Florida Supreme Court had been one of the wealthy class sponsoring the flurry of charters that brought unstable banks into existence, and now their failure meant financial ruin for the entire region. Douglas had bought stock in the Southern Life Insurance and Trust Company, established on February 14, 1835 in St. Augustine. His investment seemed safe enough and he was excited about the prospects of his return; the bank could loan to planters cultivating large unused Spanish land tracts, thus multiplying his wealth, that of the bank, and the agricultural production of the frontier. The Second Seminole War broke out and brought these hopes crashing down.","Investment in Florida stopped, outside capital dried up. Potential cotton plantations became dangerous battlefields. Foreign investors in the bank wanted their money to go to work, so loans were made to firms in New York City, much of which was ultimately lost. In less than two years, all the capital of the bank was scattered to the four winds. Judge Douglas lost a great deal of his fortune and Florida entered into its darkest hour as a territory.","In his autobiography, Douglas mentions his personal monetary loss, but the mechanisms of the larger force, the Panic of 1837, were both national and local in scope, draining the wealth out of every segment of the population. On the national level, President Andrew Jackson was engaged in the Bank War against Nicholas Biddle and the Bank of the United States. Jackson denied its re-chartering and removed 10 million dollars in deposits from its vaults, distributing the money to state banks. On the state and local level, charters for banks were approved by state legislatures with little safeguard or restriction, and the inflation of credit expanded to meet the capital needs of planters on the frontier. Cotton prices dropped, contraction of credit was extreme, and, on May 10, 1837, the Bank of New York suspended specie payments. Florida banks followed suit and bank deposits, with nothing to back them up, vanished in a matter of seconds. ","The entire South sunk into a long depression. Cotton prices fell forty percent in two years, and slave prices, derived from cotton, mirrored the fall. Banks in Florida came under investigation, and anti-bank sentiment exploded as the institution was seen as an endeavor of the ruling class. Judge Douglas and his planter friends commissioned banks, ran them, gave loans to, and inflated the property value of other planters. David Levy Yulee, the most prominent politician of Territorial Florida, seized on the resentment of inherited privilege and monopolies to enact legislation and build bank restrictions into the state constitution as Florida gained statehood. Better monitoring mechanisms and regulations, reserve minimums, and higher standards for chartering were put in place to protect the citizens. Ultimately, for Florida, bank failure in 1837 delayed its admission into the Union. Development of the vast interior, of plantations, and of transportation methods, stopped. Coupled with the Second Seminole War, the period of 1835-1842 was an incredibly bleak time for every social stratum in Florida, including the planter elite."],"display_date":"May 10, 1837","search_date":"1837-05-10","locations":[{"id":1455,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST JOHNS, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2054,"title":"Battle for the Chesapeake Oysters\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-12-06","end_date":"1883-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Lieutenant Dryden was furious. The Award of 1877, which defined the boundary between Virginia and Maryland through the Chesapeake Bay, was bad enough. It ceded many of the most bountiful beds in the Pocomoke Sound to the dredgers of Virginia, but the Virginians refused to respect even those boundaries. Dryden and his fellow watermen decided to respond with force. For three weeks, his men riddled Virginia poachers with rifle fire. However, when Dryden and his men renewed their tonging, they found that only trashy-looking oysters remained. The Virginians had licked the bar with their destructive dredging practices. In revenge, Dryden and the other oystermen raided the Virginia beds. The Tangier, a Virginia police schooner, attacked them, and chased the tongers back to Smith Island. There, Dryden and the Maryland oystermen fired over 500 rounds on the Virginia police. The captain of the Tangier, A. J. Read, returned fire with his cannon. The Smith Islanders threw up barricades on the island, and dared Read to try to beach his craft. The Captain was unwilling to storm the beach, though, and the Tangier retreated back to the other side of the line.","Southern states increasingly regulated and defended their economic interests in the years after the Civil War. The War devastated the economies of many parts of the South, and these states sought to recover stability and growth through an active role in economic affairs. Maryland and Virginia fought over their boundary line through the Chesapeake Bay because each had economic interests in the Bay's valuable oyster fields. After a complex survey, the Award of 1877 settled the issue. Oystermen were notorious for not respecting the boundaries: many dredgers trawled at night in boats painted black with mud-covered sails. In response, each state created police forces to secure the boundary and the oysters. Open gunfire between the police boats and the oystermen was common throughout the 1870s and 1880s.","The police vessels also tried to limit the more destructive oyster industry practices, such as dredging. Many reports in the Baltimore Sun detail cases involving dredgers exceeding their tonnage limit without the proper license. The police forces regulated dredging because Virginians and Marylanders increasingly saw the oysters as an economic asset belonging to the state. A Marylander named Howard Hamans proposed leasing the bay bottom to dredgers instead of letting them take what they pleased. The money from this plan could be used to fund state projects like road construction. Hamans believed that dredgers squandered a precious natural resources belonging to the citizens of Maryland. After the Civil War, southern states like Maryland and Virginia tried to protect these economic interests, and even used guns to do so."],"display_date":"December 6, 1883 - December 31, 1883","search_date":"1883-12-18","locations":[{"id":6063,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"SOMERSET, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2062,"title":"The Washington Globe, addressing different views","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-10","end_date":"1837-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One article had the headline, ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN D.C., the other article, CASH FOR 400 NEGROES, the year was 1837. On January 10, 1837, the issues of slavery and abolition were weighing heavy on the minds of many Americans. The House of Representatives had accepted petitions and memorials on January 9. One of those was from Representative Adams of Massachusetts. His petition was signed by one hundred and fifty women, wives, and daughters. The women, his immediate constituents, were praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. The petition was objected to by Representative Glascock. Adams was shocked by the objection; he did not expect any hostility to his petition. It was written in respectful terms, by women, mothers, and daughters. Congress had been decided previously that petitions of this kind would be received but disposed of afterwards. Adams felt that Glascock's objection violated the decision of the House as well as his constituent's freedom of speech. Adams argued that his petition was from persons of the greatest respectability and should be treated with dignity. The two men continued to debate the issue of petitions but ultimately, this was an issue of slavery, one man trying to keep an abolition petition from being recognized and another fighting for the right to petition.

West Virginia was no exception to this. A story ran in the Martinsburg Gazette on December 11, 1866 that a young African American boy living in Chicago, Illinois was supposedly turning white. Born to two African American parents, the pigmentation in the young boy's skin was becoming increasingly lighter beginning in early childhood. Six of his twelve other siblings and his mother also suffered from the same skin discoloration. Dr. Henry J. Reynolds examined the family to try to find the cause of the loss of skin pigmentation. After examining the family, Dr. Reynolds reported that the family was in general good health and the cause of the condition was attributed to a disease known as vitiligo, which impaired the function of the nerves that provided nutrients to different parts of the body. This impairment led to the uneven distribution of pigmentation. ","This episode demonstrates the ever present strain in race relations in the South. Although the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment granted freedom to all African Americans, providing them with the same rights as their white brethren, tension still remained between the races. It was not uncommon to hear the public opinion say that African Americans were biologically inferior to the white populations. Bill Tillman, a Senator in South Carolina during this time whose political opinion illustrates many people's sentiments in the South, felt that the African American population should not be given the same rights in the political, economic or social spheres as other whites. Therefore to have an African American boy's skin color become more similar to the white population is concerning to those like Senator Bill Tillman who wanted to keep the lines between the races distinct and freedoms curtailed. "," If this African American boy had lighter skin resembling that of a white person, the townspeople of Martinsburg would not be able to differentiate him from the other white people in the town leading to a blur in race relations. The African American boy with the skin color resembling that of a white man could lead to the community identifying him as part of the white population. Socially, he could court and possibly marry a white woman of the town without the stigma of an interracial marriage. By not being labeled as an interracial relationship, the family would not be subject to the discrimination against those engaged in such a relationship. It was not uncommon during the nineteenth century for neighbors and townspeople to bring charges against those in an interracial relationship. Such charges would be brought against the couples mainly out of their defiance to comply with the public morals, and so they would be labeled as violators to the laws of the land. Some judges would rule against these couples to demonstrate the community's disgust in a relationship that crossed the color lines and would charge the couple with a misdemeanor. Therefore, in the social world, a label of interracial marriage would then cast a stigma upon the couple barring them from the normalcy of life afforded to white marriages. Not only would the couple not be labeled, but their children would be legally white, since race was determined on the mother's side. Therefore, these children would be afforded the rights and privileges granted to the white population."],"display_date":"December 11, 1886","search_date":"1886-12-11","locations":[{"id":14331,"lat":37.1249593165,"lng":-81.560657943,"zoom":9,"place":"TAZEWELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2077,"title":"Women and Temperance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"12/31/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the 1890s, <em>The Voice</em>, a leading newspaper on temperance, raised its concern on a new issue threatening the temperance movement and specifically women. It seemed that people supporting the temperance movement had overlooked another venue in which alcohol might have been ingested, which could cause harm. The newspaper warned of the use of alcohol in food preparation, specifically in the pleasant sauces and the dishes of home. It was seen as more dangerous because the use of alcohol in food preparation may not be seen as harmful. It would leave one vulnerable to the evils of alcohol in not recognizing that any ingestion of alcohol would be detrimental to his or her life. The article further delved into the relationship between women and whiskey. It claimed that women and whiskey were natural antagonists. Also, the use of any form led to the destruction of the women's home and family and so the article urged women that it was their duty to refrain from the use of whiskey to save the peace and purity of the home. Finally, the article urged the women of the home to drive out the snake of intemperance. It warned against the use of alcohol for medicinal purposes reporting that physicians claim that whiskey did more damage than the human ill itself.","This article illustrates the shift in focus for the temperance movement in the late nineteenth century. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, temperance based many of its assertions upon explicit biblical texts. The temperance movement during these times made it a religious duty resting upon divine sanctions. Many of the anti-temperance organizations and meetings resembled evangelical prayer meetings, with those that signed pledges to sobriety called converts giving testimony and signing hymns praising temperance. ","The shift in the focus of the temperance movement began as early as the 1840s with the formation of the Washingtonians and fraternal temperance organizations that did not make religion a prominent issue. Also, the formation of the Christian Women's Temperance Union in 1874 and the Anti-Saloon League in 1893 resulted in a shift in the overall structure basis of the temperance movement. These organizations had Protestant tones, but did not rely upon explicit biblical text as the reason for abstinence, but shifted more towards pragmatic reasons, demonstrated in the article above. Reference to the snake of intemperance makes an allusion perhaps to the devil, but the crux of the article against drinking focuses on more practical reasons, such as detriment to one's health. Prior organizations focused upon the moral aspects that surrounded the temperance movement, while later groups focused on legal means to achieve an alcohol free society. With this type of shift, the explicit biblical arguments did not hold much weight in support of temperance."],"display_date":"1890 - 1900","search_date":"1895-07-02","locations":[{"id":14278,"lat":36.8438879121,"lng":-81.53700883,"zoom":9,"place":"SMYTH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2079,"title":"Strange Encounter and Counterfeit Money\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-12-04","end_date":"1891-12-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 4th, 1891, F.

The sheriff also described the man as being crazy. When questioned by the Kansas sheriff the stranger, who signed the name William J., said that he was from 7 Mile Ford, which is in close proximity to Smyth County. Also, the man, William, was accused by the sheriff in Barber County to be making paper money. The sheriff of Barber County made no indication that William J. had been arrested in connection to the paper money. Leonard was notified to see if a family member or friend of William J., would come to take him back to 7 Mile Ford. ","This episode highlights another instance of counterfeiting money that occurred in the South during the 19th Century. Although the money made by William J. was not seen by the sheriff of Barber County, Kansas as a systematic counterfeit system, it brought attention to the measures taken beginning in the 1830s to detect counterfeit bank notes. Prior to the national bank system put into place after the war, the predominant system of banking was state run. Therefore there were many state issued bank notes in circulation. The issue of such state bank notes caused much paper money confusion in the 1840s and 1850s. These bank notes had similar characteristics of shape, size, color and engraved notes, but the discount rate of these species varied and were difficult to determine. Between the 1840s and 1860s there was a multitude of state banks, each issuing their own bank notes having particular denomination and design. Many times, unskilled tradesman would accept both legitimate bank notes as well as the counterfeit without knowing the difference between the two. It was not until Robert T. Bicknell of Philadelphia began publishing a bank note reporter and counterfeit detector in 1830 that merchants were able to distinguish between the legitimate and counterfeit state bank notes. These counterfeit detecting services attempted to answer the question presented to many merchants, which were, first, if the note is genuine; second, is the issuing bank still in operation; and third, at what discount rate was this note acceptable. To answer these questions the bank note reporters and counterfeit detector contained items regarding locations of banks, the usual bank note list and a list of counterfeit and altered notes. However, the bank note reporter was no longer published by 1866, when a tax was issued on bank notes, leading to the abolishment of the use of such state issued notes. ","Perhaps William J., being described as crazy was trying to pass off the state money issued prior to the civil war while he was in Kansas, and was unaware that the use of that type of money was no longer valid. But even if William J., had tried to use this counterfeit money during the state banking system of the mid-19th Century, there were many safeguards to identify the illegitimate money in the form of bank note reporters and counterfeit detectors."],"display_date":"December 4, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-04","locations":[{"id":14278,"lat":36.8438879121,"lng":-81.53700883,"zoom":9,"place":"SMYTH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2080,"title":"Brother&#39;s Murder\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-01-03","end_date":"1897-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was Christmas Eve in 1896. Two African American brothers, James Grubb and Bud Grubb were making preparations for the holidays in Wytheville, Virginia. The two brothers had been heavily drinking while they were in town. Bud was described as being full up when they eventually returned home. Upon their arrival to their home, Bud began physically abusing his sister at which point James tried to intervene. Bud then attacked James with a razor, James then reacted by shooting his brother in the chest, delivering a fatal wound. James then fled the scene and managed to evade police apprehension. Almost a year and a half later, James Grubb surrendered himself to police for the murder of his brother, Bud Grubb. His bail was set at 500 dollars. His trial was set for later that month, but the outcome was unknown. ","A year prior to the conclusion of this criminal case, the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, which enacted the separate but equal rule for the civil rights of African Americans. In response to this doctrine, the court system attempted to prevent Southern state courts from obstructing justice against African Americans by giving federal courts jurisdiction over civil rights cases. The purpose of this legislation was to establish a sense of equality among blacks and whites. Potential inequality could arise in the southern states where slavery and the oppression of African Americans had been legally allowable. However, it was also during this period Jim Crow laws, both formal and informal, were enacted in the region. Contrary to previous legislation to give federal courts jurisdiction over civil rights cases, the federal courts from Reconstruction onward consistently and frequently decreed Jim Crow segregation to be constitutional and consistent with the law of the lands. Not only did the Jim Crow laws affect African American standing both socially and economically, but also with respect to protection from the law. African Americans were subject to greater rates of incarceration and harsher sentences compared to whites who committed the same crime."," Also during this time, community-sanctioned lynching occurred, where mobs would take an alleged criminal (usually African American), torture, mutilate and kill them. The Grubb family murder would be less likely to result in a lynching because it occurred within the family and it occurred between two African Americans. Although the outcome of the trial was not reported, as a result of the Jim Crow laws and the atmosphere of unequal distribution of justice, the Grubb brother would most likely receive a harsher penalty then a member of the white community.

A systematic counterfeiting scheme had been unearthed, occurring for almost five years. The scheme got its start in Scott County, Virginia five years prior when Clion Berry of Tennessee was arrested for counterfeiting money. He was subsequently released, changed his name and moved to Duffield. While in this location, Berry spent time with a young man that he introduced as his son answering to the name of Canady. Berry spent about two weeks at this location and then fled to which his whereabouts were unknown. Canady, on the other hand, moved to Bristol County where he soon married one of Doc Clendenen's daughters and became a striker in the Doc's blacksmith shop. Soon after he began working with Doc Clendenen, the materials for counterfeiting money were found in his possession. Subsequently, he skipped town moving to Tennessee. Clendenen and other members of his family were arrested and charged. Detectives and police were still looking for Canady. The money that was being counterfeited by Canady was almost an exact replica of the legitimate money used at the time. It had the exact same appearance and weight as the real currency, but the only thing missing was the correct ring around the coin. ","The occurrences of counterfeit money in the South highlights the even greater banking issue that arose during the Reconstruction period. At the conclusion of the Civil War, each bank of issue and currency developed under the Confederacy was made worthless. The North, in order to unify the country, began to create a national banking system and specifically set aside national bank charters specifically for the South. However, many of the people in charge at the time allowed for the New England capitalist to not only take their share of the national banking system, but the South's as well, leaving the South without any charters for national banks and an authorized money circulation that was exhausted. As a result of the move towards national banks, the South was unable to use their state banks as a channel of relief. Also, because of the unequal distribution of the national charters, the South was left without the benefits of the nationalized banking system. For Hugh McClulloch, the secretary of the treasury, the South needed to be given proper national banking systems. He believed that this was an essential step towards a sound and stable financial program for the entire nation.

A systematic counterfeiting scheme had been unearthed, occurring for almost five years. The scheme got its start in Scott County, Virginia five years prior when Clion Berry of Tennessee was arrested for counterfeiting money. He was subsequently released, changed his name and moved to Duffield. While in this location, Berry spent time with a young man that he introduced as his son answering to the name of Canady. Berry spent about two weeks at this location and then fled to which his whereabouts were unknown. Canady, on the other hand, moved to Bristol County where he soon married one of Doc Clendenen's daughters and became a striker in the Doc's blacksmith shop. Soon after he began working with Doc Clendenen, the materials for counterfeiting money were found in his possession. Subsequently, he skipped town moving to Tennessee. Clendenen and other members of his family were arrested and charged. Detectives and police were still looking for Canady. The money that was being counterfeited by Canady was almost an exact replica of the legitimate money used at the time. It had the exact same appearance and weight as the real currency, but the only thing missing was the correct ring around the coin. ","The occurrences of counterfeit money in the South highlights the even greater banking issue that arose during the Reconstruction period. At the conclusion of the Civil War, each bank of issue and currency developed under the Confederacy was made worthless. The North, in order to unify the country, began to create a national banking system and specifically set aside national bank charters specifically for the South. However, many of the people in charge at the time allowed for the New England capitalist to not only take their share of the national banking system, but the South's as well, leaving the South without any charters for national banks and an authorized money circulation that was exhausted. As a result of the move towards national banks, the South was unable to use their state banks as a channel of relief. Also, because of the unequal distribution of the national charters, the South was left without the benefits of the nationalized banking system. For Hugh McClulloch, the secretary of the treasury, the South needed to be given proper national banking systems. He believed that this was an essential step towards a sound and stable financial program for the entire nation.

The feud began after the 1884 election when Cook Humphrey defeated Sam Goodson for the position of sheriff. John Day and Floyd Tolliver were accused of beating John Martin with a club after words were exchanged over the election of Humphrey. This incident was the beginning of the bloody feud between the two families, which ended in thousands of dollars worth of destroyed property and more then twenty-one people dead. The severity of the feud became apparent when the Tolliver family attempted to kill Cook Humphrey, the current sheriff of the town. Subsequently the Tollivers were put on trial, but the court proceedings were not up to the standards of the letter of the law. The attorney presented false witness and the judge was partial to the Tolliver family, which led to the Tollivers being released to the public and the charges being dismissed. ","On the orders of the Governor of Kentucky (who recognized the severity of the Tolliver - Martin feud), Sheriff Hogg assembled a posse of 100 well-armed men to arrest Craig Tolliver and other members of the Tolliver family for the murder and destruction that resulted from the feud. When Craig Tolliver was confronted by the posse led by Sheriff Hogg, he quickly retreated to Cottage Hotel where he and four of his followers barricaded themselves inside the building. After a short battle between the two parties that included about two hours of gunfire, Craig Tolliver along with four other conspirators lay dead at the hands of the posse. ","The Tolliver - Martin Feud exemplifies the typical feudal violence in Kentucky?s volatile environment between the periods of 1875 - 1900. During this period, the Appalachia area was riddled with family feuds ending in much bloodshed and destruction. It has been argued that much of the feuding resulted essentially from the ineffectiveness of the law and lawlessness caused by the Civil War. Many of the local courts and county governments were left ineffective leading to social disorder. This social disorder caused many people to turn to forms of private violence and revenge, consequently turning into many of the feuds seen in the Appalachia region during the 1880s and 1900s. ","Also, it was not uncommon for feuds in this region to occur close to district election days, as seen with the Tolliver feud, which began after the election of Humphrey Cook for sheriff. These election districts were an important feature and chief political unit for inhabitants of the Appalachian region because of its separateness emphasized geographically by the mountains and rivers surrounding the area. The election districts formalized the neighborhood networks that bound families the rest of the year. "," The results of these feuds caused many people to leave the state of Kentucky in search of safer lands. Also, Kentuckians were stereotyped in a very unbecoming light. They were seen as violent, and uneducated, which made Kentucky an undesirable place for people to live. This stereotype which resulted in less people moving and living in Kentucky could have had a major effect upon their economic situation.

He claimed that selling the slaves could not be done without upsetting Amanda's children. Willis added, the slaves are all of one family, and [they are] mostly children which are constantly increasing in value. He did not think it was right to separate families of slaves when it could be avoided. He realized that for slaves, the slave trade was more than just a financial exchange. A one-time miscalculation on the part of an owner might lead to a life-changing sale for the slave, and Jesse Willis did not want this to happen to his family's slaves. Instead, he insisted on avoiding the separation of slave families.","There have been several court documents that reveal that there were other masters who looked out for the welfare of the slave family. Other owners, like the Sanderson's in Duval County and the Hanson's in St. Johns County, would almost never sell a slave and refused to employ overseers who beat slaves. In addition to court proceedings, slave and master accounts also provide information about master-slave relations and the preservation of the slave family. One slave remembers that he never had to do any strenuous work as long as he won in marbles when he played against slaves of other masters. His master's goal was to excite the ambition of his slaves and promote loyalty through kindness, not to depress their spirits by fear and punishment.","Despite the handful of other cases of kind masters who cared for their slaves, Jesse Willis' demand in the Marion County court was not typical of Southern slave owners. The majority of the court petitions in Marion County and throughout eastern Florida consisted of requests to divide, rather than to consolidate, ownership of slaves amongst kin or to sell the slaves at public auction. More often than not, economic interests drove masters' decisions and led to the dehumanization of slaves. The Florida slave was often separated temporarily, and sometimes permanently, from those he or she loved. The abnormality of Willis trial shows that there were probably fewer hard plantations and mean slave drivers in Eastern Florida than there were in Mississippi, Alabama, and in other places where the plantations were great in number and size."],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":1420,"lat":29.0561754463,"lng":-82.0448605922,"zoom":8,"place":"MARION, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2133,"title":"A Fugitive Slave Case in Knox County\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-04-01","end_date":"1851-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In April of 1851, a fugitive slave case involving a black man by the name of Sydney was decided in the Knox County Circuit Court. Sydney's counsel argued that he was a free black man born in Tennessee, whom at an unspecified date was kidnapped and smuggled across the state line to Alabama. There, he was subsequently sold into bondage. The case arose when Sydney escaped from his master and returned to Tennessee. Sydney was found by the court to be a fugitive slave and was directed to be returned to his master in Alabama. After the case was tried, two reports were published in the <em>Knoxville Register</em> by a lawyer named Swan who had brought Sydney's suit to court. In these reports, Swan claimed to accurately document the <em>real</em> facts of the case. Another lawyer, by the name of J.M. Welcker, who had served as legal counsel to the adverse side of the case, read this report and was shocked by its inaccuracy. He believed that the writer of this faulty report had intended to stir up trouble on the subject of slavery. Welcker felt that it was his duty as a citizen to clarify the ruling of this case for the general public.","According to Swan, Phillis, the mother of Sydney, was promised emancipation by her former master in Delaware upon reaching thirty-one years of age. Sydney was born to Phillis in the State of Tennessee before her thirty-first birthday. Swan claimed that upon turning thirty-one, Phillis and her son Alfred, who was also born before Phillis was declared free, were both emancipated by the Tennessee court system. Thomas Brown, the owner of Phillis and her children in Tennessee, was, according to Swan, fully aware of their right to freedom. Swan insinuated by this point that Sydney, like his brother, was also manumitted after his mother had turned thirty-one. Welcker stated that this information was incorrect and anyone familiar with the area would have known that Sydney was born to an enslaved woman, therefore making him a slave by birth. According to Welcker, the children born to Phillis <em>after </em>her manumission were viewed as free. However, no provision was made for the emancipation of the children she gave birth to before she reached the age of thirty-one. Therefore, Sydney was legally a slave when sold to his Alabama master in 1830.","The crux of this case revolved around the status of Sydney's mother at the time of his birth. According to Joshua Rothman, the law of descent claimed that slavery is passed down through the mother. Therefore, if the mother is a slave, the child born of the enslaved woman is also a slave. This point illustrates that if Phillis was indeed enslaved at the time of Sydney's birth, then he was born into slavery and as a result, could only be legally freed by his master."],"display_date":"April 1851","search_date":"1851-04-15","locations":[{"id":12155,"lat":36.0086650052,"lng":-83.9297656575,"zoom":9,"place":"KNOX, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2134,"title":"Southern Reaction to the Nullification Threat\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-06-28","end_date":"1832-06-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was the summer of 1832, and tension hung over Richmond like a thick fog.  National unrest had been building throughout the United States for quite some time, and sectional pressure between the North and South was nearing its boiling point. Those people living in Virginia's capital sensed the impending conflict more than most. Mere months before the South Carolina nullification crisis erupted, John Campbell, a politically active Virginian, returned home to Richmond after extensive travel throughout the country. Immediately upon arriving in the city, Campbell was struck by the attitude of the Virginians he encountered. From all I see and hear since my return home [to Virginia], he wrote to his friend Claiborne Watts Gooch, I think the people of the South (SC included) will support, by a strong vote, the [Presidential] nominee of the [Democratic] Convention. President Andrew Jackson's power, he believed, could not be shaken by any foreseeable event. Campbell immediately gauged the attitude of the South and saw fit to place his faith in the extremely popular Jackson, who would be indirectly nominated for a second term by the first-ever Democratic nominating convention held in Baltimore in 1832.","Campbell did admit to himself, however, that Henry Clay (a Whig) and John Calhoun (a secessionist) would do just about anything to destroy Martin Van Buren, who was then serving Jackson's Vice President, and Jackson himself. Calhoun, he believed, was pushing for disunion in a vain grab for power, hoping to become the eventual king or emperor of a Southern republic. This attitude was surprising coming from a Southerner at a time when regional solidarity was growing, and Calhoun was seen as the face of an increasingly separatist movement. Campbell also voiced his sneaking suspicion that the secessionists (Clay and Calhoun) had a personal interest in separation and were not representing the will of their constituents. Jackson, he felt, could harmonize the Union and preserve American liberty as he had done before. Our Liberty is gone when our Union is dissolved, he wrote. Why should we throw away the fruits of the toil and blood of the fathers of the Revolution? Is it because a Clay or a Calhoun wishes to be President, and the people are too slow in gratifying their ambition? "," Campbell's own opinion after returning to Richmond is significant not only in its foresight (the Union eventually dissolving) but also in its point of view. Campbell was a Southerner living in what would become the capital of the Confederacy, yet he had reservations about nullification and great faith in national unity. In the course of studying the antebellum period, we often assume that all Southern males, for example, thought alike. In reality, there were those that disagreed with nullification and those who did not trust the so-called spokesmen of the South. John Campbell's letter serves as an interesting study of Southern dissent mere months before the North/South divide came sharply into focus."],"display_date":"June 28, 1832","search_date":"1832-06-28","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2138,"title":"Adoption of an Ordinance in Marietta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-02-13","end_date":"1852-02-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Jenny, an African American woman residing in Marietta, Georgia, desperately wanted to move. In 1852, the local government of Marietta passed an ordinance against negroes hiring out their own time or living on lots to themselves. This new law was greatly at odds with Jenny's current living situation. Jenny believed that under the law she would no longer prosper at her current residence. Faced with these unfavorable circumstances, she traveled to Atlanta to see if her options there would be any better. In the city, she encountered a certain Mr. Jeremiah who agreed to take her in on his lot and protect her. To determine whether or not Jenny could take this course of action, Andrew J. Hansell sent a letter to Farish Carter asking for him to approve of her removal to Atlanta.","What remains unclear in this episode is the status of Jenny, the African American woman who desired to relocate. It seems as if Jenny's lifestyle had been seriously affected on account of the passage of Marietta's ordinance. Her displeasure with the new law indicates that she was either hiring herself out for work or living on a lot to herself. Considering these factors, one might conclude that Jenny was a free black. However, the letter sent from Hansell to Carter requesting approval for Jenny to move to Atlanta implied that Jenny was not free to make decisions concerning her place of residence. This letter also mentioned that Jenny would have to return home if she was not permitted to move to Atlanta. The use of the word <em>home</em> indicated that her inhabitance of the dwelling in Marietta was only temporary. ","This incident shows the types of measures local governments in the Antebellum South took to deprive African Americans of what little freedom they had left to enjoy. Due to the passage of Marietta's ordinance, a free black community, like that of Israel Hill in Virginia that historian Melvin Ely describes in his book <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, would never be realized in Cobb County. On Israel Hill, free blacks were permitted to live independently and hire themselves out as laborers. Ely does note, however, that as the issue of slavery grew on the federal level in the 1850's, whites tried once again to reduce the status of free blacks down to a level very close to slavery. It is quite possible that this retrogression of attitudes towards slavery was what the slaves and free blacks of Marietta saw with the passage of the Ordinance in the early 1850's.

The Nullification Crisis threatened to hurl South Carolina into warfare with the rest of the country. In her November 4 reply, Sophia expressed her sorrow upon hearing this news, as well as her doubt that South Carolina would be successful in its defiance of Federal law. Oh That the true interest of my native state was not obscured by such party factionists, Sophia lamented, distressed that South Carolina was being run by the aristocratic party. Horrified, she fearfully remarked on the possibility of civil war. However, Sophia must not have been too worried about this prospect, for she then went on to discuss the cholera epidemic that was plaguing Natchez as well as other family issues. "," Although the threat of civil war seemed improbable to southerners like Sophia in the 1830s, southern farmers and northern merchants had different economic interests at this time. This became an important issue when John Quincy Adams passed the Tariff of 1828. Southerners felt that the tariff favored the North, and swiftly voted Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, into office. However, Jackson failed to remove the tariff. South Carolina, fearful that the Federal Government had become too powerful, issued the Ordinance of Nullification in 1832. The Ordinance stated that South Carolina would no longer collect the tariff. The state began to raise troops to protect its new legislation. Jackson responded by instituting the Force Acts, which allowed him to send troops into South Carolina if the state continued to ignore the tariff. Many southerners who had staunchly supported Jackson were appalled at his institution of the Force Acts. They viewed his actions as an assault on states' rights. Still, like Sophia, the overwhelming majority of the South did not support South Carolina. The state's threats to secede were just too extreme. In January 1833, Mississippi's House of Representatives released a statement condemning South Carolina for acting impulsively. The report declared that the Ordinance of Nullification opposed the Constitution. Still, Mississippi's legislature did not fully support Jackson either as a result of the Force Acts. Many citizens, including Governor Abram M. Scott, believed that Mississippi should stand behind its fellow southern state by contesting Jackson's Force Acts. They thought that the tariff should be lowered. Even some supporters of Jackson expressed sympathy for South Carolina. Although views on the crisis were varied, Mississippi could not encourage disunion. Mississippians like Sophia could not have foreseen at this time that the country would be thrown into civil war in fewer than thirty years.

Both were members of the twenty-fifth congress of the U.S. House of Representatives. Graves represented Kentucky, while Cilley was from Maine. The two men certainly were not enemies, so the nation was shocked when Graves killed his fellow congressman. The conflict arose when Graves delivered a letter to Cilley from Col. James Watson Webb, a newspaper editor. Cilley refused the letter and made disparaging remarks about Webb's character. Graves objected to Cilley's comments. He declared that he would never deliver the note of a man who is not a man of honor, and not a gentleman. "," In the early nineteenth century, honor was essential to privileged men, particularly in the South. An honorable man possessed all of the characteristics needed to be a great leader. An understood code guided the daily conduct of men who considered themselves gentlemen. This system also set elite men apart in a nation centered around egalitarian values. An attack on a man's honor was not only an enormous insult, but could also be ruinous for a political career. Graves took personal offense to Cilley's ridicule of Col. Webb. To defend his honor, Graves challenged Cilley to a duel. On February 24, 1838 the two men met at Bladenburg, Maryland. They loaded their rifles, assumed their individual positions and proceeded to each fire one shot at the other. Both men missed. Cilley asserted that by refusing the letter he meant no disrespect to Graves. He simply did not want to correspond with Col. Webb. Graves would not accept this explanation. The men resumed their positions and fired again. Again, both men missed. At this point the duel should have ended. However, Graves' second, Henry A. Wise, convinced the men to fire another round. After the third shot Cilley fell to the ground. He was dead. "," The <em>Vicksburg Register</em> gave a detailed account of the event on March 16, 1838. The newspaper claimed to make every attempt to give an unbiased depiction of the duel, providing both sides' versions of the story. Politicians often used articles such as this one to emphasize their impartiality. However, they undeniably used newspapers to influence their constituents. Historian Joanne B. Freeman notes, When a duel was particularly controversial - when a duelist died or a chief was involved - politicians capitalized on widespread public interest with contending newspaper accounts, both sides attempting to win public approval while dishonoring their foes. The reputation of a politician involved in a duel often depended less on the duel itself and more on the media hype surrounding the event. The mild account of the Graves-Cilley duel in the <em>Register</em> depicted Graves and Wise as honorable men. Perhaps the <em>Vicksburg Register</em> supported Graves and Wise, or perhaps the article simply reflected the popularity of dueling in the South. The <em>Register</em> portrayed the duel as a respectable affair, but Cilley's death stunned the rest of the nation. According to historian Robert V. Remini many Americans viewed the duel as a barbaric slaughter.

Cass was concerned about the policy that the government would take regarding the Native Americans living in the United States. Cass admitted that whites had harmed the Indians for the past two centuries, and he saw the need to make up for this damage. It would be best for the Indians, he declared, if they were moved west of the Mississippi River. Certainly if they remained in white communities their race would be eventually be destroyed. Cass argued that the average Native American was lazy and stubborn and feared the anger of the Great Spirit should he depart from the customs of his fathers. Because of these characteristics, Cass said, Indians would not realize that whites were genuinely attempting to help them. The best course of action would be to remove the Indians and let them learn from the example of the white settlers. "," The subject of Cass's letter was an important issue in Mississippi in 1832. Until 1830 the Choctaws and the Chickasaws possessed the majority of the land in Mississippi. This began to change immediately after Andrew Jackson assumed office. On January 17, 1930, Mississippi extended its governance over Native American lands, which forced the Native American tribes to move westward if they wanted to maintain their independent government. In the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek the Choctaws agreed to move westward, and in 1832 the Treaty of Pontotoc Creek removed the Chickasaws as well."," The removal of the Choctaw and the Chickasaw changed Mississippi on economic, social, and political levels. White males looking for new opportunities would have been ecstatic to open their local newspaper and see Cass's suggestions to the president. According to historian John Ray Skates, The Indian cessions tripled the public lands available for settlement and provoked explosive changes for the state of Mississippi. Suddenly a huge expanse of land was open and ready to be transformed into cotton fields. "," The plantation owners of Mississippi Delta, however, may have been less excited about the new abundance of land. As more and more people flooded into the remainder of the state, the old plantation owners in the river counties were quickly outnumbered and began to lose political power. Most of the new settlers were Democrats, unlike most of the politicians from the Delta. The new settlers moved the state capital out of the Delta, from Natchez to Jackson. Then, in 1832, the government of Mississippi declared universal suffrage for white men and terminated property holding requirements for office. The plantation owners of the Delta no longer had political control over the state. Although citizens of the Delta probably agreed with Cass that the Indians should be moved, ultimately, they were not happy with the political changes that resulted."],"display_date":"1830 - 1832","search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":7336,"lat":31.1610416216,"lng":-91.3109144316,"zoom":9,"place":"WILKINSON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2185,"title":"Thomas Jefferson Randolph&#39;s Controversial Opportunity to Assist the Choctaw Indians\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-03-08","end_date":"1837-03-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When the mail arrived in Albemarle County on March 8, 1837, Thomas Jefferson Randolph may have been surprised to receive a letter from R. G. Nicholas informing him that he had been nominated and accepted as Com[missioner] for settling claims to reservations under the Choctaw Treaty.  As a prominent gentleman from a well-established Virginian family, Randolph was a natural choice for the position except that the Choctaw Indian tribe lived in Mississippi, far removed from his native state of Virginia.  By the 1830s Virginia no longer had internal incidents with Indians because the nation's frontier lines had expanded and pushed tribes farther west.  But even residents of Albemarle County would have been very interested in the future of the Indians because these tribes lived on very precious land within the South's cotton economy.  ","Although the Choctaw tribe had recently earned distinction in the War of 1812 and had been declared the perpetual friend of America on October 24, 1816, when Mississippi became a state in 1817 the Choctaw Indians threatened the American identity of the new state.  They not only proved a problem for settlers wishing to move to the frontier, but moreover, by continuing to act as an independent nation within the United States, the Choctaws threatened the authority of the Mississippi state government. Grateful for the stability and unity of their own community, Albemarle County residents and other southerners would have expressed concern that the Choctaws posed an obstacle to greater prosperity of the South.  For this reason, political leaders throughout the 1820s and 1830s searched for ways to push the Choctaw westward onto territorial lands that were not officially part of the United States. ","In September of 1830, Andrew Jackson's administration finally concluded the treaty referred to by Nicholas as the Choctaw Treaty. Officially known as the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, the treaty removed the Choctaw Indians west of the Mississippi River and claimed all lands east of the river as the property of the United States.  But Article 14 of the treaty decreed that if any Choctaw Indian agreed to become a citizen of the United States, the U.S. government promised to give them a parcel of land on which they might live and farm.  Nicholas' letter alerted Randolph that he had been nominated to assign these pieces of land to those Choctaws who chose to remain. In presenting him with all of the particulars of the position, Nicholas informed Randolph that his pay would be three thousands dollars a year and that though there would be little personal risk involved the position would require ten or twelve months of his time.  But overall his letter drips of resentment towards the Indians who tried to remain in Mississippi because he considered it a cowardly last attempt to avoid removal.  His bitterness was obvious when he commented to Randolph that, if he accepted the position, his job would require him to assist some of the greatest scoundrels in the world. Nicholas doubted the sincerity of the Choctaw who had chosen to remain and suggested that he would be relived to hear that Randolph had declined accepting the appointment.","A week later, on March 14, 1837, Randolph received the official offer from R.B. Poinsett officially offering him the position of Commissioner to adjust claims to reserves of land under the fourteenth article of the treaty with the Choctaw Indians.  While there is no sign of Randolph's acceptance or refusal of the appointment within these two letters, as seen from Nicholas' letter, such a position would certainly have been debatable in southern society.  While some, like Nicholas, might have resented the Indians as a threat to the unity of the South, others would have defended the Choctaws' rights to the land and would have been grateful for the government's merciful offer to the Indians.  Thus, Randolph's appointment presented him with a quandary in the antebellum South as southerners struggled with their desire to expand and the existing Indian population."],"display_date":"March 8, 1837 - March 14, 1837","search_date":"1837-03-10","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2187,"title":"Courtroom Drama in Black and White at Cumberland Court\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-09-02","end_date":"1834-09-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After a long day of riding through the rain to Cumberland Court, Carter H. Harrison sat down to record the exciting events of the day in his diary and proudly declared, I defended and cleared a negro charged with an attempt to kill by poisoning.  Although Harrison records no further details of the proceedings, this account of September 2, 1834 reflects daily life of the local court system in the South - a realm in which blacks and whites met frequently.          ","While it is unclear whether the negro of Harrison's story was a free black or a slave, both parties commonly appeared in court and both were subjected to a legal system ruled by white men.  Surprisingly however, these white men did not always champion racial prejudice in their role as jurors.  In rural counties of Virginia similar to Albemarle, Melvin Ely notes that often times white juries had personal contact with those involved in the cases and thus, jurors tended to judge them as individuals whom they knew, not as appendages of that abstract, aggregate free black category against which legislator and editorialists aimed racist laws and rhetoric. The court juries thus ironically treated free blacks similarly to other free white men of similar social and economic standing; Ely comments on this unforeseen pattern by remarking a slaves' status as a free man, more than his color or previous condition, governed his treatment by the legal system.  The Virginia courts therefore affirmed the free black man's status in society as higher than that of a slave but failed to record exactly how he should be treated; thus, for many years, free blacks enjoyed moderate courtroom equality based on their undefined role in society and were able to benefit economically from their freedom.","If the negro that Harrison acquitted were a slave, that individual was very fortunate because slaves, in contrast to free blacks, lived in a brutal system of dominance and submission that also transcended the legal system.  Courts in rural, agrarian counties such as Albemarle had little sympathy for slaves who committed crimes against their white masters or neighbors and often issued harsh punishments such as death or exile. The courts did however, try to protect slaves who experienced excessive violence at the hands of their masters but juries hesitated to legally ascribe a slave's death to a beating for fear it would jeopardize the owner's dominance over a slave.  Therefore, courts extended minimal protection to slaves but were always mindful of their primary duty to protect the dominance of the white man and his property.  ","Often times Virginian slaves were made to appear before a called court - a court-like panel specially designed to hear slaves' cases within ten days of their apprehension. Five men sat on this panel and had the power to determine guilt and fix a permanent sentence that could not be appealed.  But the slaves were not helpless in these courts because the panel provided them with a defense attorney and required a unanimous decision in order to convict.  If a defense attorney could not be contracted before the trial, the panel postponed the date because it wanted to reach a fair decision. Although defense attorneys were often assigned minutes before the trial, they often times reduced the charges and could even exonerate the slave.  In 1832, a new Virginian law expanded the jurisdiction of the called courts to include free blacks' cases as well so the negro that Harrison defended could have been a free black or slave whose trial may have also occurred before this type of panel-court.","In his diary, Harrison expressed some disgust at the thought of having to defend people below him when he reflected upon his reasons for never seriously pursuing law as a profession.  He explained that the profession had rendered [itself] odious...by too close a contact with the vicious and illiterate classes of society.  Therefore, although he successfully acquitted a black man in court, by 1834 whites like Harrison challenged the black man's privileges because of his inherently inferior nature. But despite these existing tensions, the courtroom was ultimately a place where blacks could attempt to protect their dignity as well as a realm in which black and white interacted together, albeit unequally."],"display_date":"September 2, 1834","search_date":"1834-09-02","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2197,"title":"James Cody Sues John Baily Over Slander Regarding Illegal Trade\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-12-11","end_date":"1850-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James Cody of Bryan County, Georgia prided himself in having a good reputation as a respectable Southern man. When his neighbor John Baily accused him of buying rice from a slave without written permission from the slave's owner, he was extremely offended. He considered these accusations to be false and demanded to meet John Baily in court to settle this slanderous dispute. Cody felt that Baily's remarks offended his honor and implied that Cody was a dishonest trader and guilty of buying and keeping stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He felt that his good reputation was at stake and he needed to go to court to settle the matter. He also demanded that Baily pay him 5,000 dollars in damages, a huge sum in the 1850's.",">James Cody's indignation and determination to repair his honor, seek redress, and prove that he would not illegally trade with slaves demonstrates many important principles and customs of the South in the 1850's. Lawsuits about slander and false accusations were not uncommon in the South, especially among men. This was due to the fact that a man's honor was central to his sense of self and his public image, so any kind of slander or ill talk would be insulting. Insults, or anything that offended a man's honor, questioned a man's very masculinity. Many people in the South reacted very strongly to an affront to their respectability, and would take the accuser to court. For example, a man in Prince Edwards County, Virginia took his slanderer to court, saying he would rather get back his honor than get money in the case. To those Southerners who did sue for money, such as Cody, the huge amounts of money they asked for probably represented how offended they were at an affront to their honor. ","The second aspect of this case that represented the state of the South, was the fact that the specific slander regarded a white man trading with a slave without the master's permission. Black Codes or laws regarding slaves and their conduct had existed since the very beginning of the eighteenth century, but they got more rigid and more encompassing throughout the nineteenth century all across the South. It was illegal in most states by 1850 for a slave to trade or sell goods without his master's written consent. He was not allowed to trade publicly for his own benefit at all unless his master deemed this acceptable, which some did. A slave guilty of violating a law like this was often punished with a whipping. One reason for this law was that trading and selling allowed slaves some degree of autonomy and gave them their own money, if their master did not demand the proceeds they made from their sales. It also gave them more independence and could make less interested in their master's concerns, which was something whites came to fear more and more as the number of slaves rose. As their numbers rose, so did the potential threat for rebellion or a general challenging of complete white supremacy. Also, as questions over slavery were discussed elsewhere in the nation it added to the insecurity felt throughout the South.","The result of the Cody-Bailey case is not known, or was at least not documented in the court petition record, or it may have been lost over time. However, the important themes that arise in this case are themes that pervaded the pre-war South. The ideas of male honor, the power of slander and the lawsuits that could arise from it, and of the increase in slave codes throughout the South in the mid-eighteenth century, all speak of important ideals and trends in both Georgia, and the South, as a whole."],"display_date":"December 11, 1850","search_date":"1850-12-11","locations":[{"id":1562,"lat":31.8212333753,"lng":-81.1636262055,"zoom":9,"place":"BRYAN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2205,"title":"Youthful Misconduct in Celebration of Christmas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-12-24","end_date":"1879-01-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The members of the City Council of Staunton, Virginia voted against the suspension over the Christmas holiday of an ordinance that forbad the use of pop-crackers in the streets.

I. Miller did not follow the regulations of the General Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America when he tried to baptize and confirm a group of adults on March 24. He was not authorized to perform the rites of baptism and confirmation without prior approval, which would have been given by Reverend J. B. Haskell. Tellingly Reverend Haskell, the prosecutor in the court case, and Reverend Miller, though both of the Central Evangelical Lutheran Church of Staunton, just did not get along. Reverend Miller was also charged with intentional negligence in his failure to admit the newly baptized adults into Church membership and his failure to require the confirmation of baptismal vows. He explained to the Synod that the young ladies he baptized were members of the Staunton Female Seminary and the baptism occurred without the knowledge of their non-Lutheran parents. They desired to publicly profess their faith in Jesus Christ, but had to become regular members of their home church due to the expectations of their parents. The Synod excused Reverend Miller though he had been guilty of this charge, stating that many other members of the Synod were guilty of the same act as the justification for their decision. Further charges against Reverend Miller describe his misconduct toward Reverend Haskell and the dissatisfaction he provoked in the congregation."," The Synod's Constitution holds its members amenable to its authority for a violation of doctrines, morals, and practices. Though Reverend Miller's actions were against the rules described in the Constitution, the Synod accepted Miller's explanations as satisfactory. The council and congregation of the Lutheran Church of Staunton were appalled by the decisions of the Synod, which in their opinion stemmed from the failure of the Synod to observe its own rules of procedure, to decide the grave questions involved according to the evidence. So upset were they by this ruling, the council and congregation decided to dissolve their connection with the Virginia Synod on the sixth of June, 1880 with a vote of 59 to 30."," Historian Donald Mathews argues that early believers in Evangelicalism perceived their religion as liberating thousands by raising them from their low positions to the higher planes of sophistication and enlightenment. This same notion of liberty dictated the actions of the Staunton Lutheran Church, reflecting Mathews's argument. Like the American Revolution that promoted independence from governing by an outside party, the southern states at the time of the Civil War encouraged the autonomy of state government from the greater nation. The division of governments that resulted from these quests for greater liberty demonstrated why the Staunton church separated from the state Synod. The disagreements between the two reverends was raised by their congregation to a question of state versus local power when they decided to criticize the decisions of their governing body. The belief that the congregation was the true unit of Lutheran church placed the power in the hands of the worshippers so that their beliefs took precedence over those of the Synod. The shift from state to local control paralleled the shift that occurred when the southern states demanded their right of succession."],"display_date":"March 24, 1878 - June 6, 1880","search_date":"1879-04-30","locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2210,"title":"The Trial of John W.

Guiteau was delivered at the courthouse on the morning of the twenty-third of January. Although the court officers continually shouted for silence, Guiteau never ceased his criticisms of the court and Judge Porter even as the judge read off the charges against him. Judge Porter compared Guiteau to John Wilkes Booth, suggesting that the murderer of Lincoln shared with Guiteau a desire to win notoriety at any cost. Guiteau was accused of the assassination of President Garfield, with his only real hope of defense lying in a plea of insanity. The jury declared Guiteau guilty as indicted, followed by applause from the crowd and Guiteau's statement that the verdict was an outrage upon the American people.","   The Valley Virginian described the popularity of this trial that enthralled the entire public for the entire eleven weeks of its duration. Though guilty, sympathy often awaits the condemned as the consequences of the verdict come to be considered. However, the case of John W. Guiteau evoked less public sympathy than any crime resulting in capital punishment before it. The desire for a guilty verdict was universal as the nation felt that its own character, as well as the fate of the miserable assassin, was on trial. ","   The Virginian's editorial on the verdict of the case spoke to the faith of Augusta County in the legal system and its desire to protect the president of the nation. Though a national event, the Staunton newspaper published its own thoughts on the outcome of the trial, trying to reconcile the pity felt for those sentenced to a public execution and the outrage of an assassination. The strength of the public outcry upon Garfield's assassination is ironic considering he won the 1880 presidential election against Winfield Scott Hancock with a plurality of only ten thousand out of more than nine million votes. Garfield was the Republican candidate carrying most of the Northern states and none of the former slave states, including Virginia. James Garfield was not installed in office for much time before his assassination; historian James M. McPherson details how he was consequently unable to fully enact his plans to form coalitions between the Republican Party and the newly forming independent parties in the South. The outrage of Guiteau's actions described by The Virginian was not due to admiration for Garfield, but for the office he held. Though the South was often suspicious of Northern attitudes, they were bound enough to the Union to have an emotional investment in its commander-in-chief.

Andrew Jackson Kearney, supposedly of Loudon County, had been drifting from city to city, traveling from Harrisonburg to Staunton to spread his religious fervor. A curious crowd gathered to hear the sermon that followed his public singing and praying, eloquently speaking to answer the question, Why is a man better than a sheep?.","   The following week, Kearney appeared in Charlottesville where he was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon. Upon an accusation of being an imposter, Kearney pulled out a pistol and threatened to fire into the group of onlookers gathered in front of him. It seemed that Andrew Kearney had previously been imprisoned in Maryland for seven years. The Staunton Spectator suggested, in the spirit of his sermon in Staunton, that Kearney should feel sheepish for his deceit of the public regarding his criminal record.","   In the South, preaching has been preferable to other forms of religious expression because it focuses on the style of faith most applicable to the region's enthusiastic character. The preacher is one of few figures in the South able to overcome racial and religious boundaries due to his centrality to religious life. One of the roles played by the preacher is that of sage, placing him in a role of mediation between political and religious life. James M. Dabbs argues that Southerners have a propensity to substitute religion with politics, politics with religion, and to unite the two under morality. The combination of politics, religion, and morality presided over by a preacher is the same grouping of elements which Andrew Jackson Kearney tried to appropriate, thus supporting Dabbs's claim. His decision to preach on the steps of the courthouse in Staunton showed both his desire to make his message public and to unite religious thought with the law. He asserted that his doctrine was lawful with his position, following the traditional Southern pattern of enforcing religion as an official system of belief. Kearney's violent reaction to the questioning of his authority showed the power inherent in the position of preacher. He believed himself to be a religious leader, and as such, beyond public criticism. The newspaper's mockery, however, revealed that those witnessing his sermon refused to grant such an important role in the community.

Middlebrook accused Brown of being overly familiar with his wife, showing jealousy to be the source of the conflict that emerged. Wilson Goings, after listening to the quarrel outside his home, asked Brown inside. Middlebrook's wife was in the house and when Middlebrook was denied entry to the residence he became furious and tried to force his way inside. He managed to open the door enough to fire his pistol and hit Goings, resulting in a severe arm wound. Middlebrook then made his way to another door, gained entrance, and fatally wounded Brown.","   Elzy Middlebrook was arrested on Sunday morning without any attempt at escape. He was indicted on Monday for murder and malicious maiming, all a result of his suspicious love for his wife, barely mentioned throughout the article. The Valley Virginian specifically indicates that all of the parties involved [were] colored.","   The newspaper's report on the race of the individuals involved in the crime is essential to understanding its significance. It is an assertion that violent actions of this sort occur only within a certain set of people, implying that white Americans could rise above such crimes of passions. While under slavery Middlebrook was obliged to accept his wife's sexual contact with men other than himself due to his subservience under his master, his new freedom granted him the liberty to defend what he believed should be rightfully his. The wife becomes a question of property, evident in her absence in the reporting of the incident, and Middlebrook had a right to his property. Steven Hahn contends that the South following the Civil War was formed out of black struggles such as this one, illustrating the nature and complexity of race relations in the nineteenth century. The racial identification is indication of a level of racial prejudice, but the Middlebrook's indictment and trial indicate the due process of law given to every criminal regardless of race.

At six o'clock on June 30, 1883, Mr. Elam and Mr. Beirne met one another to settle the score as gentlemen always had before - with a duel. The procedure was decided in advance, specifying the use of Colt's six-shooters at eight paces. All men not directly involved with the business were asked to leave and the location was clear of lawful authorities due to the early hour. Once the physician questioned the two men for readiness, they had to discharge their weapons between the yell of Fire and the count to three. As soon as the physician called out one the gentlemen fired, but no one was hit in this first round. Mr. Beirne requested a second opportunity and so the process repeated itself. Once again, both weapons fired at the counting off of the first number, but this time someone was injured. ","  Mr. Elam stumbled once hit in the leg, believing at first that Mr. Beirne had injured both of his legs. As the wounded Elam was lowered to the cushions on the ground by his second, Beirne saluted his opponent with his hat and escaped in his carriage. Once Mr. Elam realized that his wound was only in one leg, he wished that he had demanded a third shot. Though not fatal, Elam's injury to his upper right thigh would be dangerous to repair because the bullet had embed itself in his flesh. Following the duel, both parties appeared calm and collected, content that the shots had not proven fatal. There had been no attempt to arrest or even investigate the battle after its occurrence, though their original meeting had been delayed due to three attempts to arrest Beirne.","  Antidueling laws rarely functioned to stop the duel because most law enforcement officials acknowledged that the men of honor fighting in such battles were held to a different code. Historian Kenneth Greenberg claims that men of honor valued their words and their views of the truth above all else; consequently, they were willing to fight to defend a public appearance. However, after the Civil War dueling began to be replaced by shooting-on-sight, promoted by the fact that in some areas of the South almost everyone kept a pistol. Immediate shooting lacks the equality of opportunity provided by a duel, revealing an act of vengeance based on impatient emotion. Mr. Elam and Mr. Beirne chose not to publicize the reasons for their duel, but the choice of method clearly demonstrates that it was a question of honor, thus supporting Greenberg's contention. Following the bloodthirsty violence of the Civil War, anything less than honor would be settled with an informal shot at one's enemy.

W. Adie wrote to his sister from Camden, Missouri on Janurary 9, 1888 after a lull in their family correspondence. He told his sister that he was recently employed by the Chicago Santa Fe and California Railroad. His main concern regarding this job was the weather in Missouri: you can rest assured it's cold enough. I have caught a bad cold and am not at work this morning. Adie did not mention much else of consequence in his letter except to inquire if another relation was also still employed in the Railroad business. He signed off the short letter by saying, give my love to all. I have nothing to say that would interest you so may as well stop writing these few lines excepting to let you know I am still in the land of the living. "," Before the Civil War, 96 percent of railroad manufacturers were northern based, and throughout the war, the North used their railroads much more successfully than the South. After the war, southern railroads were, almost devastated; much of their rolling stock was gone, and many tracks, stations, and bridges were ruined, according to the Robert O'Brien. But with the help of the federal government that sold cheap military railroad property to the South, along with, northern money and northern iron being poured into the south, by the 1880s and 90s, the railroad industry was at its peak growth point: 70,000 miles of track were laid in the 1880s alone. Historian John B. Boles observed that at this time the railroad grew to an extent matched by few independent nations; and trade networks proliferated and the volume of goods increased apace. The same text acknowledged the growth of railroads not only in places like Missouri where Adie was, but other southern states like Georgia, They quickly understood that railroads held the key to economic development: the rails that carried lumber out could also carry persons and goods back in. As the population of the region grew and the open range shrank, commercial agriculture took root with the railroads."," Adie was reasonably proud of his position on a railroad, since it was one of the only booming southern industries at the time. However, working conditions were still tough on actual railroad workers, especially with such a high demand for railroads in the late 1800s. Places like Missouri were often cold in comparison to the deep South, and men like Adie who were subject to the outdoor physical labor that railroad work required could easily get sick. Labor conditions for railroad work were often less than satisfactory, causing the railroad industry to be one of the first birth places for worker unions. There were particularly violent strikes in 1877 and 1894 over work wages, hours, and conditions. Adie reported working on the railroad just after the first strike, and a year after the Federal Railroad Administration was commissioned to ensure that safety regulations were followed for railroad labor in 1887. In this temporary lull of appeasement in between the strikes, even though he might have been prone to catch cold, Adie's actual labor conditions should have been better than before. "," As the twentieth century drew near, railroads became more regulated. In 1887 The Interstate Commerce Act put railroads under the financial supervision of federal institutions. By the Progressive area (post-1900s), the railroad became such a hugely prominent money making industry, that it eventually developed into a popular breeding ground for corruption and monopolies.

Ligget declared his widow the sole executrix of his account. This meant that she had exclusive control over seeing that the provisions of Mr. Ligget's will were satisfied, and had control over all other matters concerning the deceased's estate. Mr. Liggett was a wealthy tobacconist, and upon his death, relinquished his entire estate in St. Louis, Missouri valued at 3,500,000 to Mrs. Liggett. ","The legal status of women in the nineteenth across America was still far below their male counterparts. Edward Pessen noted that this was particularly the case in marriage at this time, where women were often even considered their husband's property in the eyes of the law, and denied many of the same property rights. These social and legal constrictions made it very hard for women like Mrs. Ligget to come into sole possession of any property at all because normally, as Pessen remarks frankly, the wife is dead in law. This suggests that even inheriting property easily turned into an uncertain ordeal in the nineteenth century, because if a man contested a woman's rights to the property, it is very likely the law would recognize his claim over a female's. "," In Pessen's view of women's legal status in the 1800s, Mrs. Ligget is an exception to the general law applications in the nineteenth century. One explanation for this, however, could be that her fortunate property circumstance was affected by where she lived. St. Louis was a growing industrial city, and often cities were not only the first to shift to modern economics, they also tended to be ahead of many rural areas when it came to social and legal reforms. Significant changes in women's rights occurred in the early twentieth-century, so it's possible that St. Louis, as a modernizing city, already began to broaden the legal liberties given to women at the time of Mrs. Leggit's inheritance. The fact that she was of a high social class also could have helped her bypass some legal restrictions against the female possession of the estate after Mr. Leggit's death. "," Though Mrs. Ligget's property circumstance may have been unique to places like St. Louis, it was not uncommon for tobacconists like the Ligget's to hold a high economic status in the post-bellum south at large. One of several economic booms for tobacco companies as a prosperous industry came right after the Civil War. Men like Washington Duke who developed a machine that could produce two hundred cigarettes per minute and Julius Carr who sold about five million pounds of tobacco in a year, proved that the tobacco trade was lucrative in an industrializing South. "," The fact that a woman was on the receiving end of such a profitable business, especially one that functioned on a national level, marked the beginning of a shift toward women's legal rights. Before the Civil War, southern women were often unable to be a significant part of anything politically or economically meaningful. During the Civil War this mentality changed for many southern women, and as Elizabeth Hayes Turner observed in John B. Bowles's A Companion to the American South, roles that formerly had belonged to men blurred as women assumed control over children and slaves, in the absence of their husbands. As the war came to a close, women became more prominent figures in the management and labor of textile mills in particular. With this modification of the social and economic role of women, by the end of the war Confederate soldiers came home to a new woman. But, for the most part it was not until later in the twentieth-century that they were willing to fully recognize it."],"display_date":"December 1, 1897","search_date":"1897-12-01","locations":[{"id":7921,"lat":38.6407017012,"lng":-90.4430188422,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2290,"title":"The Murder of Mrs. Harris \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-12-25","end_date":"1854-12-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["n the day of the murder, Ben Small kept watch in the yard for Isidore. Isidore knew that Mrs. Henry would never let Small in the house, so he had to commit the crime. After the murder, one of the men set fire to the house. Ben worried about the children who were asleep in the house at the time. ","This won't do, the children will be burned; let us wake them or put the fire out, Small reportedly said. ","No, Isidore replied. So much the worse for them. Let them burn, they will tell no tales. ","H.B. Trist of Bowden Plantation wrote to his daughter Willie in New Orleans on Christmas Day, telling her of the incident. Small had confessed to being an accomplice in the premeditated murder of Isidore's white mistress Mrs. Henry, and Trist's account of the murder came from the confession. This accounts, perhaps, for the story of Small's attempt at heroism when he reportedly wanted to save the children; it is possible that Small lied in order to save his own neck. It is unlikely he was capable of much heroism as he was also mixed up in the murder of two white whiskey sellers in the area. It is unclear if Small was a slave on the Marchand plantation or another plantation or if he was a free man. ","Trist found Isidore's betrayal of his mistress with whom he had grown up the most disturbing part of the confession. He thought that since Isidore had been raised together with Mrs. Harris and since she had always been kind to him this made his villainy even worse than Small's. ","In expressing his distress that Isidore could murder a woman whom he had grown up with and who had apparently always been kind to him, Trist was showing that he, like slaveholders throughout the South, subscribed to the doctrine of paternalism. Paternalism was a defense of slavery in which slaveholders claimed that they treated their slaves well and took care of them by providing them with food, clothing lodging, and religion. Slaveholders thought slavery to be a type of parent/child relationship where the slaveholder took care of the slave and the slave was grateful and content to be looked after. ","But Mrs. Harris' murder shows an instance where African Americans were obviously not content and thus showed an active resistance to their enslavement. According to historian Kenneth Stampp, slaves thought of their enslavement in terms of labor extortion and a lack of control over their own time and labor. They would play along with the slaveholder's illusions that they as slaves were helpless, because not to do so might anger their owner and end in some form of punishment by the owner. Slaves struggled against their forced servitude in many ways. Some were careless in their work. Some slaves sabotaged themselves to make themselves unfit for work. Stampp reports on one Kentucky slave who would purposely make himself sick by overdosing on medicines he found in his master's medicine chest. One of the more extreme steps a slave could take to resist enslavement was to run away. This was a dangerous step; runaway slaves usually were caught and brought back to the plantations where they were usually publicly punished as a warning to other potential runaways. A most extreme form of resistance was murder. Slaves murdered both overseers and owners for different reasons. Usually it was because the slave felt he had been treated badly or punished unfairly. According to Stampp, violence was usually only adopted by the most extremely discontented of the slaves. Many states had Black Codes to deal with slave violence. Louisiana's Black Code ordered that a slave be given a trial; if convicted, the slave was either sent to prison or, as was most common in the South, executed.

J. Parliament tried to pay fifty Italians hired to work on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Aberdeen with 750 instead of the 1,500 they were owed, he was seized by the workers and locked up. They told him they would not release him and threatened to kill him unless paid the full amount. When Sheriff Walker and his Deputy came to investigate at around midnight, they too were captured and detained. The Italians talked of killing them as well.","The next day, Reverend Steele got the Italians to agree to release the Sheriff and the Reverend and Parliament signed a statement saying they would be paid in full in a couple of days. When citizens and police from surrounding towns showed up, however, the Italians got spooked and ran to get Parliament. The police and citizens ran after them and fighting ensued. The police fired upon the laborers. By that evening, most of the workers had been captured and taken to jail. Some of the Italians were shot but not seriously injured; the Sheriff, on the other hand, received a severe wound. The people living in the area, who had supported the Italians over the previous weeks, had much sympathy for them. Fearing there would be more fighting, extra police were stationed in the jail.","Immigration of Italians during the mid-eighties in Maryland seems to be studied less than later immigration. Not that many Italians lived in nor were immigrating to the United States between the Civil War and the 1880's. Between 1860 and 1880, 68,000 Italians came to the United States. After 1880, there were only 45,000 Italians still living in the country. In the two decades following 1880, 1,000,000 Italians came to the United States. Therefore, Italian immigration was not yet a large phenomenon during the time of the riot. Historians Richard Walsh and William Fox also focus on the immigration increase after 1900. Perhaps historians' lack of interest also reflects the apathy of Marylanders at the time. In Harford County, the Italian immigrants were denied their due. They had to rise up and threaten to kill their contractor and policemen to get noticed. Immigrants seem to be thrust into the background of Maryland 1880s history, having been a minor part of the population; the riot of Italian workers in Harford County suggests that during this point in time, they were equally ignored."],"display_date":"February 15, 1884 - February 16, 1884","search_date":"1884-02-15","locations":[{"id":6005,"lat":39.5358347431,"lng":-76.0898051386,"zoom":9,"place":"HARFORD, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2300,"title":"A Black Girl Robs another Girl of Fifteen Cents\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-01-24","end_date":"1878-01-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Elizabeth Burley, a twelve year old black girl, was charged on the twenty-third of January with robbing Louisa Kerling.

Historian Edward Ayers says that whites believed blacks held white law in contempt and that black crime was on the rise. In the late eighties, arrests and sentences of black men went up. Not only did whites perpetuate the belief of the dangerous black man but so did newspapers. Although Burley was young and a girl, this does not mean she would not be implicated in the increasing suspicion and fear of blacks. While the reaction to Burley's theft may be explained by a heightened fear of blacks committing crimes, it may also simply be a normal reaction to stealing.","The Sun published other articles of thievery in January of 1878. Charles H. Conway, a youth, was charged with stealing a gold watch worth fifty dollars from his coworker, David Parkinson. In this case, both of the people involved were presumably white (because the article did not mention color) and what was stolen had a higher worth; the young man, however, was still arrested. Again, the complexity Ayers refers to is notable. While there was anxiety over the dangerousness of blacks, punishment for stealing seemed to be universal. The case of Burley can be explained by a mixture of both."],"display_date":"January 24, 1878","search_date":"1878-01-24","locations":[{"id":5933,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2314,"title":"Kicked Out of Virginia?\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While some slaves were able to gain their freedom in nineteenth century Virginia, they were often by law forced to leave the state shortly after their emancipation. Many went to the free states of Ohio or Pennsylvania. However, several petitions made by the residents of Loudoun County reveal that the newly freed blacks were often inclined to stay in Virginia. As the petitions disclose, they received both support and some resistance from their neighbors in Loudoun County.","In 1848, thirty-nine petitioners requested the help of the state legislature in permitting William Watson to remain in Virginia. Watson had been emancipated by his owner and had proved a man of good character, of industrious habits, charged with the support of large family. Additionally, the petition stated that Watson was a convenient and useful person to [the] community in the capacity of a day laborer. A similar petition, signed by 93 residents, was written in Leesburg in 1850, requesting that Harriet Cook, a free black, be permitted to live in the state. The document stated that she possessed a high character and was a valuable member of Society. The petitioners elaborated on her value to their lives when they explained that she provided laundry services to many in the town and her loss would be a great inconvenience.","Despite these petitions, not every citizen in Loudoun County supported the residence of William Watson and Harriet Cook. A 1850 petition asked that the two free blacks be removed from the county and that the law should serve as the remedy in such cases where it ought to be in the city and county courts. Twelve residents of the county put petition. As pointed out by the historian Joshua Rothman, Virginia law required free blacks emancipated after 1806 to leave the state permanently within one year of manumission, unless they received a petition from the state legislature. While some fought to keep their families together and retain the already mangled pieces of their lives, Rothman states others made the difficult move and left a state that didn't want them anymore. That didn't want them while they were free. As the above-mentioned petitions demonstrate, some freed slaves received help from their white neighbors in their fight to stay in the state. This situation reveals, that in race relations, whites did not act like whites were supposed to act and blacks did not act like blacks were supposed to act, when personal relationships complicated the idea of stark racial divides. However, while some in Loudoun County thought the presence of Billy Watson and Harriet Cook proved good, in fact somewhat essential, for community life, others thought it necessary that they leave."],"display_date":"1848 - 1850","search_date":"1849-07-01","locations":[{"id":14002,"lat":39.0907154711,"lng":-77.6357306744,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUDOUN, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2327,"title":"Native American Relations Challenged in Fleming Woods Trading Post Case\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-02-15","end_date":"1840-02-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In July of 1837, the states of Arkansas and Missouri functioned as major areas of activity as Americans moved westward. Travelers relied on local people along these western routes to help provide them with necessary equipment and foodstuffs they needed on their journeys. Looking to capitalize on the growing market, Fleming Wood and his partner Egbert Harris hoped to establish a trading post in the area bordering the boundary line between the military base of Fort Smith, Arkansas and the Choctaw tribe of the Cherokee Nation. "," However, volatile relations that existed in Arkansas and throughout the South between whites and Native Americans stood in the way of simple establishment of a trading post. This was largely from exploitation felt by the Native Americans forced onto reservations and the cultural devastation caused by the white trade of vices such as alcohol. To help ameliorate these problems, the U.S. government created intercourse laws to regulate trade among the two groups. To work within these laws, Wood and Harris enlisted the help of M. Stokes, a lawyer for the Cherokee Nation; with his help, the traders obtained a trading license. "," Yet their luck as traders turned on September 9, 1837. Captain William Armstrong, the acting supervisor of the Western Territory, revoked their license and claimed that the traders had become among the largest whiskey dealers on the line. Though legalized sale of alcohol in Arkansas to whites was commonplace, the spirits sold by Wood and Harris' in their trading post broke the intercourse law because it created direct mercantile competition with the Cherokee Nation. In the interests of both governments, Armstrong also ordered his men to seize remaining goods in the post in order to keep the Indians from visiting the line as much as possible, [and] to prevent the introduction of liquor into the Indian country, and other violations of law. "," Angered by their loss of property and sales in the post, on December 12, 1838, Wood and Harris appealed the revocation of their license. The already volatile relations between the U.S. government and the Cherokee Nation intensified. Almost simultaneous with the appeal, U.S. government officials forced Cherokees off tribal lands during the Trail of Tears. Years of abuse, killing and enslavement of Native American populations ensued, and created juxtaposition to events in the Fleming Woods case that occurred over the course of the next three years. The Cherokee Nation, U.S. government, and the two traders discussed the issue of licensure and seizure of goods in a major review of the Indian Affairs policies. A turning point in U.S. governmental policy, the Fleming Woods case forced U.S. officials to recognize a greater Native American autonomy even in the face of their actions in forced relocation.

Call was an optimist; he was a man firm in his faith in American superiority. He also would either have made a very good lawyer or had very gullible friends. Captain Call convinced seven of his friends that it would be a good idea to buy land in the territory of a foreign country and in a region that appeared to be overrun by savage and American-hating Native Americans. So, in the fall of 1817, he traveled with some his friends to Pensacola, Florida-which was still Spanish territory and was still heavily populated by Seminoles. While in town, he and his companions purchased 80 acres on the south side of town, 2,000 acres on the bay-two to three miles from town-and a number of unimproved lots within the city. The deeds for all of this property were, obviously, written in Spanish and codified by the Spanish court, not the American. Yet Captain Call was not purchasing this land because he had faith in the future of Spain. He believed that the territory of Florida would ultimate change hands and become a part of the United States.","Indeed, his prediction came true, but it was by no means a certainty at the time of his large purchase. The First Seminole War had not yet occurred. The results of that brief war, which ended in the spring of 1818, were primarily the cessation of Florida to the United States. Although Captain Call was certainly not alone in his prediction, the public goal of the war was not to force Spain to hand over Florida. It was a retributive war against the Seminoles, and once which it can be argued, never really ended. The Seminoles, unlike the Creeks, did not have a central leadership structure, making it practically impossible for the United States to sign a treaty with the Seminoles. Instead, it had to be done on a nearly individual scale. The gradual incursion of whites into Seminole lands ultimately resulted in the Second Seminole War."],"display_date":1817,"search_date":"1817-07-02","locations":[{"id":1280,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Florida, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2340,"title":"John Dewery in Prison\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-01-07","end_date":"1836-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John Dewery, a bright mulatto...nineteen or twenty years old, found himself in a precarious situation. As he was sitting in the Clark County Jail in Alabama on January 7, 1836, the Mobile Commercial Register published an announcement about his capture and arrest as an escaped slave. This was problematic because he swore in vain that he was a freed person. Nevertheless, the paper reported that if his owner would not come to reclaim his property, he will be delt with as the law directs.","If this young mulatto boy was currently or at any point a slave, that means he was the child of a sexual relationship across the color line in which an enslaved mother was the partner of some white male. This is evident because southern state laws established that children of any mixed relationship would follow the status of their mother, regardless of who their father might be, keeping them enslaved on the plantation. Of course, this gave white male slave-owners the opportunity to freely engage in elicit sexual relations with their female slaves without fear of the repercussions of unwanted, illegitimate children as these children would still be classified as their slaves. According to Joshua Rothman, such occurrences fed to the complexities and contradictions of a southern society founded on racial domination-which some sexual relationships could only serve to reinforce-and alternately undermined by interracial sex.","On the other hand, it is possible that this young boy was not a slave nor was enslaved ever in his past. Because of the maternally-inherited status-which meant slaves who had a white father were still born as slaves-on which the southern plantation functioned, some mulattos were free while some, born of enslaved mothers, were still slaves. In other words, an individual's physical appearance essentially gave no indication of being free or enslaved. Therefore, many slave traders kidnapped and sold free blacks who were not slaves at all. Notably during the fall months, when planters had money from the sale of their crops, slave traders in Alabama took such illicit action in order to make their own profit. Within the interstate slave trade, numerous free blacks and mulattos were arrested under the assumption that they were escaped slaves and then allowed to be sold simply because traders could presumably legitimize this through the color of their skin. As John waited in his prison cell in Clarke County, his fate was more than likely to be sold in order for the county to pay for jail fees-an embodiment of unpredictable and often times tragic outcome of sex across the color line."],"display_date":"January 7, 1836","search_date":"1836-01-07","locations":[{"id":77,"lat":31.6619891322,"lng":-87.8428758708,"zoom":9,"place":"CLARKE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2352,"title":"Fighting for Equality in the Public Sphere\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-08-25","end_date":"1898-11-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though Reconstruction ended officially in 1877, the country and its people were far from united as racism and segregation became a growing force. Texas, though on the edge of the South, was certainly no stranger to this battle over inequality. On November 18, 1898, the Galveston News ran an article detailing how Isabelle E. Mabson, a black resident of Galveston, TX, filed suit in the district court against the Missouri, Kansas and Texas railway company of Texas and the Wagner palace car company. The lawsuit was for a total of 1,800 in damages based on the fact that Mabson was denied the ability to ride in the first-class car based on her race. On August 25 of that year, Mabson had purchased first-class tickets to take herself and her children from Kansas City home to Galveston. She was able to ride in the first-class car until the train reached Denison, TX where she was ejected from the car by company officials because Mabson and her children were black. The fact that she was forced from the car in front of her fellow passengers caused her great embarrassment. She and her children were offered to ride in the car for black clients, which was cited as dirty and filled with filth of person and language. Mabson was sick at the time and desired the luxury provided by the first-class car, so she left the train and purchased tickets for the remainder of the journey through the Houston and Texas Central railway.","Isabella Mabson was among the first black women to take a stand for equal treatment in the public sphere by filing suit in federal district court. While the outcome of her case is not known, the article highlights the issues that blacks continued to face in Texas after Reconstruction ended. The Fifteenth Amendment passed in 1870, creating equal rights for all men despite race or color; however, women were not included in this amendment. While the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1875 encouraged many to fight public segregation, efforts were soon curtailed when the U.S. Supreme Court declared the section of that act pertaining to public accommodations unconstitutional. This act enabled states, including Texas, to pass Jim Crow laws at the state and local level which greatly constrained the rights of black men and women. Texas, along with other southern states, put into effect a great deal of laws restricting the day to day behaviors of black residents.","Southern history is full of accounts similar to that of Mabson. Frequently, black passengers would purchase tickets to ride in cars with more pleasant conditions only to be demanded by railroad officials to remove themselves immediately. If the black passenger did not comply, the situation could quickly escalate and at times even resulted in assault. In the 1880s and 90s, railway cars became the first site of state-mandated segregation laws in the South. After the Texas government created legislation for railway-car segregation, the practice of segregation in public settings expanded from there; while the frequency of segregation increased, so did racial tensions. As Edward Ayers emphasizes in his book <em>The Promise of the New South</em>, new generations of whites became squeamish about black people in ways their grandparents could never have imagined-- or afforded. Laws such as this were reaffirmed at the national level in 1896 when the U.S. Supreme Court gave its ruling in the case <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em>, in which it declared segregation was permitted under the separate but equal clause. In protest of this kind of segregation, blacks practiced civil disobedience and took legal actions such as the above case initiated by Mabson, while many others simply left and went further north in favor of areas such as Kansas which promised more equal treatment.

Unexpectedly, an African American hiding behind a tree shot Johnson in the head, stunning him and throwing him from his horse. The black man then shot him twice more, first in the wrist and again in the side. Taking him for dead, the assailant dragged Johnson three-hundred yards to a nearby pond, dumping his body in the water. The African American then mounted Johnson's horse and rode off to a party in the neighborhood nearby. Unfortunately for the shooter, the night air somehow revived Joel Johnson and the injured man was able to drag himself back to his home, half a mile away. Johnson related the story to his brother, Abe, who happened to be the Baldwin County Deputy Sheriff. Abe Johnson heard reports that the black man had been seen on his brother's horse, so he set off to arrest the attacker. The sheriff found the man at Jim Malone's home, within the county, and when he tried to arrest the black man, he drew his pistol. Deputy Sheriff Johnson then shot him, whereupon the African American shot right back, the bullet piercing Abe Johnson's chest. The black man then ran, and the sheriff attempted to run after him, shooting once more. The shooter managed to escape, and Abe Johnson perished fifteen minutes later. The black assailant was found dead at four o'clock the following afternoon by onlookers who had developed a search party. He had been shot through the breast and the wrist, and had managed to run half a mile alongside a creek, until he fell into a swamp and died.","After emancipation and during the early years of Reconstruction, there were frequent instances of interracial violence in the South. Episodes like the Johnson men's encounter with a black criminal were especially common in rural areas of the South, where law enforcement in the tumultuous post-war atmosphere was particularly difficult. Some accounts of the Reconstruction years have emphasized the presence of black militiamen and created a false sense among Americans that blacks were out looking to start conflict with whites. There were some blacks who used theft or arson as a means of protest against white oppression, as the black thief in Baldwin County may have intended to, but this was not the norm. Rather, African Americans were usually trying to build new lives as freedmen, not avenge the masters of their pasts. In fact, most of the violence during Reconstruction came from bitter, defeated white Southerners who clung to their support of black enslavement. The concept of white supremacy versus black criminality and inferiority was pervasive in regions like the Gulf Coast. A large Southern crime wave in the late nineteenth century contributed to the tumultuous racial climate, causing an increase in the frequency of lynchings and other forms of interracial violence. Since there were so many African Americans in jails, whites felt there was no doubt that blacks were responsible for the increase in crime rate. This justification further added to the number of violent encounters between the races, such as the shootout between the Johnson brothers and their black assailant. It would be a long time and a difficult struggle before race relations would settle down, and therefore violence between African and white Americans was inevitable in areas like southern Alabama."],"display_date":"December 28, 1881","search_date":"1881-12-28","locations":[{"id":16,"lat":30.2786488602,"lng":-87.5482936023,"zoom":9,"place":"BALDWIN, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2398,"title":"Escaped Prisoner\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-07-05","end_date":"1859-07-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["J.

The economical statistics 1861 in the Nashville Annual Almanac recorded only one escape in 1857, and Reddick was the only escape in 1859.

Trail roads were rough, there were high rivers to cross, diseases to contend with, and of course the possibility of meeting up with Indians. Mary Maverick was making such a journey in the summer of 1837. She was traveling by wagon train from her home in Alabama to the new land of Texas. One day when her party was moving camp, 17 Tonkawa warriors surprised them. Still in war paint, the Indians greeted Maverick's party brandishing several pieces of human flesh. Maverick remembered the Indians coming up to her carriage and asking to see her baby. She denied the request and made sure to show the warriors her pistol and bowie knife. Maverick expressed annoyance when the 17 decided to ride along with the train instead of leave. The 17 Tonkawas did eventually quit the party much to the relief of Maverick. She was certain that had they gotten a hold of her baby, they would have eaten it. ","Meeting Indians was a regular occurrence as whites encroached more and more on tribal lands. The fear and aggravation Maverick experienced was common among settlers who encountered Indians. Maverick's fear that the Tonkawas might eat her baby was not completely unfounded. Tonkawa warriors did have a reputation for cannibalism. Accounts described warriors cutting off the hands and feet of their victims and then eating them. This, along with other obvious cultural differences and bad blood, made the two groups wary of each other. ","From the earliest days of Texas Stephen F. Austin anticipated conflict with Indians in the new settlements. In his first presidency (1836-1838), Sam Houston passed laws providing for frontier defense against both Mexicans and Indians. Houston wanted both protections for his people and to stay on friendly terms with Indian allies. There were, however, problems with the Indian land claims; the Texas government refused to recognize their legitimacy. When Mirabeau B. Lamar became the second president of the Republic of Texas in 1838, Indian tribes found him to be no friend of theirs. Lamar called for, an exterminating war on [Texas Indian] warriors; which will admit no compromise and have no termination except in their total extinction or total expulsion. Lamar wanted the Indians gone because he saw them as dangerous people and competitors for prime real estate. Lamar's attitudes mirrored those of the Texas people. Maverick was afraid of what the Tonkawas might do to her party and just wanted them to go away so that they could camp in peace.

Dirty and unshaven, his tattered, mismatched clothes belied his purpose. Much to the surprise of Sheridan, this raggedy character, whom Sheridan took for a vagabond, tried to sell him land. The man took offense at Sheridan's disbelief, but continued to push the sale of his land. After further questioning, Sheridan learned that the land, although in a good area of Texas, not only was not in cultivation, but also had not yet been cleared. ","Sheridan related this tale in his journal to show one of the problems that confronted a growing Texas: most of the land is in the possession of persons who do not possess a shilling & who consequently are unable to cultivate it. This was true because of the liberal land policy of Texas. The Texas Constitution of 1836 granted a league of land (4,428.4 acres) to heads of households and a labor of land (177 acres) to single men. Later the government also decided to give lands to veterans of the Texas Revolution and their families. With people owning large amounts of land, some who were poorer were unable to make use of all of it. Clearing land was time consuming, and if a man could not afford slaves to help him clear the land, it could easily go uncultivated.","A law of December 1837 produced another problem in Texas land policy. The law created land commissioners whose job was to give certificates to landowners allocating to them their legal amount of land. Once they had obtained their certificate, landowners had to have their land surveyed then approved by the land commission. Sam Houston had opposed this system because he said that it would open the door for fraudulent land certificates and claims to land, and he was right. There were many instances of fraud and shady dealing. The law also created a business for speculators. They would go out and locate the choicest land and obtain for themselves the certificate to this land, all before real settlers could move in. This left those in search of good land at the mercy of businessmen. Texas's generosity with land created opportunities both for eager settlers and slick speculators.

While the scope of the ensuing war that resulted during Lincoln's presidency was far greater than most could have anticipated, this last appeal to North Carolinian voters forebodingly warns of rupture that would lead to the now smiling fields barrowed by cannon balls, and manured with human blood and bones. The article considered that disunion for the current justifications would be modern humanity's greatest sin second only to the biblical original sin.  ","      The paper, eerily anticipating the prospect for Lincoln's victory in the election, made considerable effort to prepare its readers for the event of a Republican president.  An analogy to card games was made, such that if one begins a hand of cards and then finds the hand gone against him, he cannot honorably disengage but must respect his commitment to the other players and play it through.  Similarly, the article warned that North Carolinians must be willing to accept a Lincoln election just as they would expect Northerners to accept Bell's election.  This gesture of logic is considerable, as Lincoln did not even appear on North Carolinian ballots.  Furthermore, the article purported that factional grievances will be better resolved through Constitutional outlets than through disunion.  Finally, the article offered an assurance against disunion: millions of dollars of southern debt to northern creditors.  The pressures which manufacturers would bring to bear on Lincoln to maintain union, it was suggested, would suffice to dissuade the North from precipitating war.","Powerful forces lurked behind the political debates which confronted readers in North Carolina's Piedmont.  Despite optimism in the <em>Raleigh Register</em> that resolution of grievances could occur through constitutional outlets regardless of the election's outcome, retrospect affords the knowledge that this election functioned heavily in precipitating state secessions in the lower South.  Bell's emerging party, while firmly supporting slavery, nevertheless displayed the remarkable diversity in Southern politics leading up to the Spring of 1861.  Daniel Crofts, who has explored upper South unionists in the secession crisis, similarly challenges the conception that white Americans had segregated themselves into distinct and antagonistic factions of North and South during the late antebellum era.  Instead, the scenario during the election of 1860 appears to have included large numbers of Southerners who anticipated continuity of the Union and would have been astonished at the turn of events during the next five months."],"display_date":"November 6, 1860","search_date":"1860-11-06","locations":[{"id":9844,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2431,"title":"African-American Traveler Jailed Despite Documents\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-01-05","end_date":"1848-01-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sherriff Willie Pope incarcerated the black man calling himself Sam Fary just three days after Christmas.  Though Sam claimed himself a free man, Pope placed a front page advertisement in the local paper requesting Fary's owner to come forward, prove property, pay charges and take him away, or he will be dealt with as the law directs. The newspaper notice included a small cartoon of a running black man.  Pope's ad acknowledges Fary's claim to being a free man, and described no fewer than seven documents in Fary's possession.  One document purports that Fary bought his own freedom from James Kagler in 1840.  His other documents included passes, four of which call him Isaac. One document, signed by Kagler and dated five days before the arrest, gave Fary permission to pass within the State, or to visit his connexions in North Carolina. Fary also carried a Dream Book bearing a woman's name. ","Many details of this incident remain unknown, contributing to the mysterious nature of what seems a wholly unjust incarceration.  Sheriff Pope gives all appearances of blatantly holding a free black man in jail and attempting to pass him off as a fugitive slave.  This incident, played out even under the rules of a slaveholding society, offers little rationality for advertising a black man, with documentation of his freedom, as a slave.  Pope excludes any possibility in his notice that Fary may have spoken truthfully and that his paperwork may have been perfectly valid.  Perhaps Fary was utilizing the traditional week of Christmas vacation as an opportunity to visit relatives.  If Fary was in fact telling the truth, Pope stood to gain from re-enslaving him to a local buyer, receiving at the very least the jailing charges. Even if Pope had specific evidence that Fary was indeed a fugitive slave who had obtained false papers, the fact that he omitted such evidence in the advertisement suggests that readers would have automatically believed a white man over a freed black.","The rights of free blacks in Prince Edward County, Virginia, as argued by Mel Ely, blend incongruously with what appears the total lack of rights afforded to Fary in the North Carolina Piedmont.  Ely's description of the possibilities afforded to free blacks in the rural Old South spars with the efforts of those like Willie Pope to contain African-Americans within, or return them to, the system of slavery.  And still, there is probably much relevant information to the case missing from Pope's short ad.

The alleged acts of fraud were investigated by the House Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Justice as early as July 1, 1870. The purpose of the investigation was the look into discrepancies of the district's expenses and general management. The House Committee on Expenditures found that the expenses of the Western District were quite large and not all of these expenses were supported by the proper expense vouchers. A clear example of creative accounting was present in the expense report for the year ending June 30, 1871. There were disbursements of 137,958, with 95,195 going to William A. Britton and the other 42,763 going to Logan H. Roots, a marshal with one months experience. At the end of the next fiscal year, the expenditures for Root managed to climb up to 321,653. Not only had the western district over paid several deputies and marshals but the committee also discovered that there were payments going out to fraudulent deputies as well. The total expenditures for the three years of the investigation of the western district totaled over 750,000. ","In order to attempt to fix the stench in the nostrils of the community, the House Committee on Expenses recommended that the Western District of Arkansas be dissolved and annexed to the Eastern District so that there would be one federal district and one judge for Arkansas. Corruption problems plagued many other areas in the South besides Arkansas courts. In the Supreme Court of Missouri case The State of Missouri vs. Collier, Collier was guilty of bribing an election official 2,600 (of which he took 1,200) to take out 200 of the votes that would have been for Collier's rival in the race for county Probate Judge. After the western district's own corruption scandal under Judge Story, the court continued to function. During Judge Isaac Parker's term from 1873 to 1896, the western district was known as one of the most criminal and violent districts. During this time, no less than 65 deputy United States marshals were killed in the line of duty. The violent elements of the crimes committed in the early stages of the western district also led to violent consequences for the offenders. As Herndon writes, the western district came to have the reputation as having convicted and executed more murderers than any other court had ever done in the history of the world in a like period. These harsh punishments were eventually able to improve conditions in the state as there was a great improvement in the crime rate in the western district by the turn of the twentieth century."],"display_date":"July 1, 1870 - July 1, 1873","search_date":"1871-12-30","locations":[{"id":662,"lat":36.0043370055,"lng":-93.7250552918,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2443,"title":" Lunsford Lane Denied Extension of Residency\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-11-03","end_date":"1841-05-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A free man must go.  After three years of recommendations, petitions, and court proceedings, the Senate of the state of North Carolina denied Lunsford Lane extension on his residency in the state to allow more time to purchase his wife and seven children.  Lunsford had been commended and allowed by his employer, the Governor of the State, to remain employed in the Governor's office keeping order, running errands, and making deliveries, according to a letter sent to the Legislature.  The letter acknowledged that this would be against the North Carolina law that required free slaves to leave within twenty days of being warned out. In 1840, the Secretary to Governor Dudley wrote the first request for Lane's extenuating circumstances.  The letter was answered with no objection, but the situation was considered a legal matter, which resulted in Lane being summoned to court. Due to an unprepared prosecution team, the case was postponed for three months, which allowed Lane to negotiate a petition of relief to be signed by over twenty men and sent to the Legislature for evidence of his strength as a respectable, hard-working man.  When the Court finally met and his case was argued, Lane was not allowed in the Senate chamber because he was a colored man and waited in great fear and anticipation.  The members adjourned and harshly reported Well Lunsford, they have laid you out; the nigger bill is killed.  This was a cruel reality, laced with mockery from the white members of the Senate, and Lane claimed to have felt defeat at its worst and utter hopelessness in the face of humanity.  He was not only denied, but also banished from North Carolina, departing three days later on May 18, 1841, for New York City.What is significant about this narrative is the blurred definition of freedom in all-white institutions in the South.  The freedom granted to Lunsford Lane is an example of the restrictions placed on blacks even after they reached their ultimate goal of liberty.  Freedom was never really free, as historian Robert Fogel found in research of slaves and their owners.  The act of denying citizenship and any extended privileges were both absent from the lives of freed blacks in almost every state, which often left them still suffering from oppression in a white supremacist society, no matter what physical or mental state they were in.  In Lane's case, even though he was awarded freedom, his material conditions and life working for the Governor at least allowed him to be close to his family and earn a substantial living, which were not guaranteed with his freedom."],"display_date":"November 3, 1840 - May 18, 1841","search_date":"1841-02-08","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2445,"title":"Missouri&#39;s Third State Constitution Adopted\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-10-30","end_date":"1875-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For the second time in less than 10 years, Missouri had written a new State Constitution ","which was up for ratification by the citizens of the state.

The case stated that in St. Louis, Missouri in January 1862, the defendant had trespassed on the property of the plaintiff while the defendant was a soldier in the Union Army during the Civil War. Though the plaintiff sought damages for the trespassing, the defendant claimed that he was protected under Section 4, Article 11 of the Constitution of the State of Missouri. According to court documents, Section 4 of the Missouri Constitution exempts persons from liability for acts done during the recent civil war, by virtue of the military authority vested in them by the government of the United States, or in the pursuance of an order received from any person vested with such authority, is valid, and protects from prosecution or actions for all who can show for their acts the authorization of a military officer, acting under the command-in-chief of the army of the United States. The defendant claimed that at the time of the trespass a state of civil war existed, martial law had been declared, and his actions were assessments of orders given by the general of the army of the United States who was in charge of Missouri. Finally, the defendant insisted that he was under the protection of the Act of Congress of 1863 which instituted a two year limitation clause on cases arising from the Civil War. The opinion of the court, written by Justice Miller, stated that the defendant was indeed a Union soldier and would be protected under law as such. In regard to the Act of Congress of 1863 which set the two year limitation, the court stated that it cannot be assumed that Acts of Congress only apply to the federal courts. Its final ruling decreed that all cases involving the legitimacy of the limitations placed on such cases by Acts of Congress be decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. "," In 1861 and 1862, the United States Congress and President Lincoln instituted the First and Second Confiscation Acts. The First Confiscation Act stated that while there was a state of insurgency against the United States, Union soldiers were allowed to seize property of known Confederates. During this time, Parrish states that Union officers, such as General Halleck in Missouri, would underwrite costs, by the charity of men known to be hostile to the Union. The Second Confiscation Act was one of the first enforcements of emancipating slaves as it said that any Confederate who did not surrender within 60 days would be punished by having his slaves freed by Union forces. These acts allowed Union soldiers, such as the defendant, to confiscate and trespass on Southerners' property throughout the war as direct carriers of President Lincoln's orders."],"display_date":"December 1870","search_date":"1870-12-16","locations":[{"id":7647,"lat":38.2610610866,"lng":-90.5377814277,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2459,"title":"THE RIGHT OF CHASTISEMENT: Fulgham vs. the State of Alabama \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-10-06","end_date":"1871-10-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The role of women in antebellum Alabama was ambiguous. Prior to the Civil War, women were keepers of the home. The average, middle-class women raised the children, kept the home and prepared the meals. Both before and after the Civil War, women were subservient to men and their marriages were entirely patriarchal.","Of course, there are exceptions to every rule - George Fulgham's wife was one of them. In October of 1871, a verdict was handed down in the Fulgham vs. the State of Alabama. In this case George Fulgham's privileges and rights as a husband were in question despite his race and status. ","It was early 1871 when George Fulgham, an emancipated slave, was discovered beating his children. The discovery was made by his wife, another emancipated slave. The wife interrupted midway through the flogging. When she voiced her distress over the excessive punishment, Fulgham turned the whip on his wife, striking her twice on the back. Fulgham's wife bravely reported the incident and once in court lawyers for both the complainant, Mrs. Fulgham and the accused, Mr. Fulgham, argued a number of different points. The case focused primarily on the right of chastisement. The right of chastisement refers to a man's limited ability to discipline his wife and family. Prior to Fulgham, a husband not only had the ability to physically reprimand his spouse but he also acquired the rights to his wife's person, the value of both her paid and unpaid labor, and as well as any property that accompanied their nuptials. ","Sex and class equality certainly served as social landmarks for what was acceptable and unacceptable behavior. However, incidents in the home blurred the line between private behavior and public record. Accordingly, justices hearing the case were asked to take into account what qualified as appropriate both in and outside the home. What could be questioned about the closed-door occurrences in private quarters? The significance of class was also questioned. Citizens of lower classes, who simply did not know better, could possibly be exempt from the law due to mere ignorance. Fulgham not only recognized class and gender but race as well. Justices in the case were asked to consider whether or not black relationships were inherently different from white relationships.","The case was on appeal in the Alabama Supreme Court when it reached its final verdict as to the validity of the right of chastisement. The verdict came down on October 6, 1871, essentially in favor of the woman, Mrs. Fulgham. The court claimed that the rule of love superseded the rule of force by denying the privilege of brutality against women.","The Fulgham case, while significant for its time, proved to serve as precedent for later and similar cases at the turn of the century. The verdict provided precedent for gender equality in male and female marital relationship cases to come. Furthermore, the verdict defined the role of women in Alabama and the South on a greater scale. Through Fulgham women were endowed with the assertiveness to defend themselves against the wrong doings of not only their husbands, but society on the whole.

Bibb received a letter from Dealia Ann Smith, a woman from Mineral City requesting help with her divorce case. According to William Cooper, divorce had become more common at this time than in the earlier part of the nineteenth century, however; it was still an anomaly of society. Whether or not Dealia Ann Smith was granted a divorce was not determined in the letter's contents, however, it would have been much easier for her to get a divorce during this time period in comparison to earlier parts of this the nineteenth-century. Changing of the laws helped ease the process of divorce. Earlier laws dictated that a private bill had to be passed by a state legislature in order to grant a divorce. Eventually, the law progressed to where it was easier to get a divorce. According to Cooper, cruelty, abandonment, adultery, impotence, and consanguinity were new grounds for divorce. Smith's husband had been gone for two years and during that time she had received no aid from him, and even while they were together he was still of no use to her. Smith claimed that everything he earned, while he was with her, he gave to his mother and left her with nothing. At the closing of the letter, she said that the last letter he wrote her told her not to write him anymore, thus blatantly implying that he wanted no further contact. Judging from the letter's contents, it was very likely that the state considered Smith's situation as abandonment and granted her divorce. ","The courts also became more sympathetic towards women in other aspects. For example, cruelty was an extremely loose term and often encompassed physical and mental cruelty and judges tended to be pretty lenient. However, a woman still had to prove beyond a doubt that she had not committed adultery, which denoted the archaic attitude that was still present towards women. Divorce also advanced women's rights. In the past, a woman surrendered many of her rights and property to her spouse once she got married; essentially, she possessed the same rights of children. Divorce empowered women to stand up for themselves in one aspect, however; it would be three decades before women received the ultimate symbol of equality in the United States, the right to vote in politics. So although divorce was usually seen in a negative light, in this case, Dealia Ann Smith and the other women who petitioned for divorce during this time were an indirect driving force and stepping-stone to more women's rights."],"display_date":"April 25, 1891","search_date":"1891-04-25","locations":[{"id":14015,"lat":37.9782243481,"lng":-77.9629941666,"zoom":9,"place":"LOUISA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2483,"title":"The Effects of Expansion\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-02","end_date":"1855-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Throughout the mid-nineteenth century, the Union feuded over the issue of slavery expansion in the western territories. On January 2, 1849, the newspaper of Suffolk, Virginia, <em>The Suffolk Intelligencer</em>, printed an article entitled The Great Question. This article examined this turmoil, and pleaded the Union to mend its internal strife. The author explained that Northern fanatics in Congress were imposing abolition notions on the nation, efforts that threatened to bring the nation to the verge of disunion. Two new propositions were being discussed in Washington. The first was a proposal to abolish slavery in the nation's capital, and the second was a motion to bar slavery in California and New Mexico. The article contended that these two proposals had created a kindred feeling among all Southerners, regardless of their political orientation. The Northerners' proposals questioned the equality of a Southern man's property rights; it was hypocritical to allow a man from Ohio to move to Virginia with all his possessions, but to forbid a Virginian from bringing his property (slaves) into Ohio. The author attributed the source of these problems to the recent land acquisitions in the west, most notably the annexations of California, Texas, and New Mexico. The Great Question continued to examine this dilemma by describing the political stances of the Whig and Democratic parties. Though it was too late to quarrel over what has been done, the article claimed that the Whig party initially opposed the acquisition, and that the Democratic party supported the expansion. Therefore, the Intelligencer attributed the current turmoil to the Democrats. The article ends with a glimmer of hope, as the author believed that the councils of Congress would succeed, and reunite the North and South once again.","The article clearly summarizes the nation's state during the time of expansionism, and exposes the beginnings of clear sectional division. Though the nation had yet to split politically, the significance of these proposals would soon divide the Whigs and Democrats, creating sectional rifts that would weaken each party.

This turmoil would continue to heighten tensions between the regions. On a regional scope, the article's description of a newfound Southern unity is extremely important, as Southerners began to unite and to view the North as a common enemy. The mention of equal rights highlights one of the main issues bothering the Southerners, as many were angered that the Northerner's proposals threatened to take away their property. The seeds of disunion were beginning to sprout during this time period, and the nation was slowly moving towards bloody conflict."],"display_date":"January 2, 1849 - December 31, 1855","search_date":"1852-07-02","locations":[{"id":14073,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2518,"title":"News of Fort Sumter Rallies Supporters in Augusta County, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-20","end_date":"1861-04-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James M. Schreckhise wrote to, and received, many letters from many people during the Civil War. He lived with his parents in Augusta County, while many members of his immediate family served in the Confederate Army. Having received information from a first-hand source in South Carolina, he provided a patriotic description of the local reaction to the attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861. Augusta County rallied to support Virginia secession after no diplomatic answers came from the respresentatives that met with President Abraham Lincoln. Schreckhise's own brother was called out and sent to Harpers Ferry. Schreckhise embodied the jingoism that overwhelmed the county when he exclaimed, The Old Dominion has at length arisen from her slumber to shake off the chains of the abominable abolition tyrant. Schreckhise boasted confidently that he doubted there are a thousand votes that could be obtained for this state to remain in the Union. Schreckhise, like many of his neighbors, embraced his state's decision for war and prepared himself for the death and suffering that he would likely witness, in order to defend Souther rights and principles.","Edward Ayers does not portray the nation's craving for resolution as an irrational goal; diplomacy was a possibility right up to the beginning of the Civil War. After the attack on Sumter, the stage was set for war. No individual county caused the war or was the first to jump to battle. Relations between North and South had steadily declined prior to the bombardment of Fort Sumter. Virginia was a strong supporter of states' rights, and Lincoln's response to the bombardment was in clear violation of those rights. South Carolina had seceded, and Virginia believed that it was the right of South Carolina to do so. Lincoln's unwillingness to let South Carolina leave the Union, propelled Virginia into secession. ","Secession was not a rash choice for Virginia; it had been deliberated constantly. When Schreckhise mentions that there are not a thousand votes for Virginia to stay in the Union, this did not reflect irrationality, rather, people's mind were set carefully. Virginians, particularly those in Augusta County, had worked hard for reconciliation, but they would rather submit to war than have endured the ambiguity of war or peace any longer.

He had left four or five letters addressed to his most intimate friends before shooting himself in the head.  The news of John H. Blue's death shocked his Montgomery, Alabama community.  As reported by the <em>Birmingham Age Herald</em>, Blue's suicide was the second act of a larger drama, which began a week previously on December 30, 1894.  On this cold December afternoon, William H. Kelley, chief of the fire department, came home to find Blue in bed with his wife.  Kelley took his baby and went to his father's house where he admitted that the family physician had taken to bed with his wife.  Kelley immediately filed for divorce upon discovering his wife's infidelity.  Though both men were widely respected in the Montgomery community, the town ultimately sided with Blue and was loath to believe the charges against him were true.  Blue was a man of a large family and was generally understood to be of a high moral character.  Ultimately, Blue took the matter into his own hands and his suicide cast a gloom over the city.  ","    Southern states first introduced divorce legislation at the end of the eighteenth century and the first general divorce law in the South was passed down by the Maryland Legislature in 1839.  According to Alabama law detailed in History of Alabama, divorces were allowed in various cases including adultery, impotency, drunkenness, and imprisonment.  Mr. Kelley would have thus been granted a legal divorce on the grounds of infidelity.  In describing the history of divorce in the South, N.E.H. Hull observes, Divorce remained relatively uncommon in the pre-Civil War era, though the rate steadily increased and would continue to increase throughout the next century and a half.  The divorce law in Alabama became more flexible as a result of the increasing prevalence of southern divorce.  As documented in History of Alabama, divorces were subsequently granted if it were proved that the other had been guilty of...violating tombs, stealing from a church, cattle stealing... or other various offenses.  As divorce became less taboo and more readily available in Alabama by the end of the nineteenth century, Blue would not have felt excessive societal guilt over his role in the Kelley divorce.  Why then his suicide?  According to the History of Alabama, divorces were not granted in the state: if adultery was committed by either in order to obtain a divorce.  Perhaps Blue had secretly wished to divorce his wife and start a new life with the former Mrs. Kelley.  If the state deemed his adultery deliberate, Blue would not be granted a divorce, which perhaps proved too much to bear for the physician.     ","    While Blue's suicide can be viewed through the lens of southern divorce practices, the episode also provides and opportunity to explore family values throughout the South at the end of the nineteenth century.  Social historian Carl N. Degler characterizes the South as a place where roots, place, family, and tradition are the essence of identity.  Indeed family was an extremely valuable aspect of identity for most southerners.  Families wealthy enough in the late 1800s and early 1900s commissioned large family portraits while poorer southern families depended on traveling photographers to capture their family's likeness.  Southern social life was so family-centric that historians have likened southern family solidarity to that of a clan.  Blue's suicide can be interpreted according to southern family values at the end of the nineteenth century.  While divorce was legally an option for Mr. Kelley and his wife, the resulting break in Blue's family may not have been an option for the physician."],"display_date":"September 4, 1895","search_date":"1895-09-04","locations":[{"id":304,"lat":32.2202206971,"lng":-86.2076124057,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2535,"title":"Industrial Education for Boys in Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"5/10/00","end_date":"5/10/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The stage was set; the town was ready. The conference on race relations to be held in Montgomery, Alabama was a highly anticipated event. The political affair would bring to town many of the nation's finest orators and most distinguished authorities on the subject of race. On May 8, 1900, the Montgomery Auditorium hosted the conference, which included various speeches on racial issues from greater educational opportunities for blacks in the country to a repeal of the fifteenth amendment. The front page of the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> celebrated the conference's turnout: LARGE AUDIENCES ASSEMBLE TO HEAR THE DISTINGUISED ORATORS PRESENT THEIR VIEWS. "," In the midst of the conference on race relations in Montgomery, one article in the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> pleaded with the state to recognize the needs of poor whites in Alabama before attempting to better the position of blacks. This editorial, Industrial Education for White Boys in Alabama, specifically addressed the educational crisis in Alabama. The editorial cited the 1890 formation of an industrial institution in Tennessee as an example of a thousand fold return to the state in terms of citizenship. The article rallied, People of Alabama, where are your thousand boys? On the waste heap it is feared. The <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> editorial emphasized Alabama's educational emergency and called for a statewide reform, thus challenging the existing model of education in the state. "," The educational deficiencies in Alabama at the beginning of the twentieth century took root in statewide politics. White Democrats regained political power throughout Alabama during what was known as the Bourbon years (1874-1890). The moniker recalled the House of Bourbon's restoration after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. The Democratic Bourbons immediately enacted measures to reduce the state debt and as a result funding for education decreased. In one swift political decision the Democrats eliminated the State Board of Education and significantly reduced both educational appropriations and constitutional guarantees of financial support. According to historian William Rogers, The Democrats opted for decentralization in control of educational affairs. "," These sixteen years of Bourbon rule would impact the statewide educational system into the twentieth century. Until 1891 Alabama schools were awarded funding based on the number of students by race. According to Rogers, townships could appropriate funds based on an amount they might deem just and equitable. This subjective appropriation of funding led to inadequate funding for black schools. However, blacks were not the only students suffering in Alabama. In 1900, there were 104,883 illiterate whites aged ten years or older living across Alabama. At 338,605, the illiteracy was significantly higher for blacks in the state, but these alarming numbers in both categories demonstrated a failed system. In his Bourbon Democracy in Alabama, Allen Going evaluates Alabama's educational system in light of Bourbon politics. He writes, The condition of Alabama schools, however, in comparison with those in other parts of the country was poor indeed. In 1890, the state ranked fourth from the bottom in a listing of various school statistics for all states by the Federal commissioner of education. When the editorial in the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> ran ten years later in 1900, the effects of the Bourbon Democrats lingered throughout Alabama. The educational deficiencies and resultant illiteracy rates at the beginning of the twentieth century resulted from a laissez-faire state government.

Passing by a young lady on the street one fine afternoon, an elderly Alabama politician caught an eyeful. Was she wearing an article of male clothing? The <em>Greeneville Advocate</em> documented the growing women's fashion trend with a sense of urgency: THE BLOOMER IN ALABAMA. The article informed the readership of the so-called Alabama Bill in the December 9, 1896 edition of the Advocate. An unnamed, yet old-fashioned member of the Alabama legislature had drafted the bill in hopes that immediate action would end the growing ladies' fashion trend du jour. The operational definition of bloomer was of particular concern at the time. The Alabama Bill leaves no doubt that it aims at that article especially, and yet a general consensus as to the bloomers' rightful wearer did not exist. Was it, in fact, an article of male clothing or simply inappropriate women's apparel? The Alabama legislator knew for sure that a woman wearing an article of male clothing violated Biblical code and quoted Deuteronomy accordingly: The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to the man; neither the shall a man put on a woman's garment; for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord. "," The mounting concern over the bloomer in Alabama had its root in southern conservatism. Fashion in the South mirrored the southern way of life and changed accordingly to reflect the times. During the antebellum years fashion helped preserve southern values in a time of rapid change and national fragmentation. In a time of southern instability during the Civil War, women played an important role maintaining southern tradition through fashion. The southern woman's clothing became tighter, heavier, and longer in attempts to idealize her heightened morals and purity. Women in both Alabama and the larger Southern culture were seen as a paragon of chastity, piety, and virtue. They were expected to be submissive in all respects to their husbands and lead quiet lives raising the children of the South. However, the arrival of the bloomer in Alabama in the late 1890s brought a change to southern fashion. Social historian Jeanette Lauer notes, The decades following the Civil War witnessed a growing democratization in southern fashion. According to Lauer, this democratization of fashion mitigated against the presumed uniqueness of the southern way of life... In The final decades of the nineteenth century and continuing throughout the twentieth centuries, southern fashion increasingly reflected national trends. The bloomer provides one example of a national phenomenon that extended south and into Alabama. "," The bloomer in Alabama signified societal change in the South. In his appeal to Biblical codes, the old-fashioned Alabama legislator demonstrated his staunch southern conservatism. However, by the late nineteenth century, the link between conservative values and accordingly conservative fashion had significantly weakened. On the other hand, perhaps only southern women felt relief in casting aside the shackles of fashion. After all, for decades women fell prey to the oppressive conservative southern values, which in turn dictated fashion. The unbearable weight of hoop skirts, the excruciating pain of corsets, and the insufferable summer days spent in layered petticoats all contributed to the popularity of the bloomer. The bloomer offered a chance for freedom at the end of an era characterized by male domination. At the end of the nineteenth century, fashion proved a juxtaposition between traditional male conservatism and a new female liberalism.

J.M Neal purchased a large amount of corn from Trice and stayed at the store until 1A.M. when he boarded a train for Pulaski, Tennessee.  Authorities suspected that Warren and his accomplices entered the store at 2 A.M and killed Trice in order to rob the store of money and dry goods. Locals discovered that a  rainy night left footprints leading to Warren's house.  Before authorities could question the African American community, a mob took Warren a mile down the road and hanged him.       Despite the circumstantial evidence facing Warren for the murder of a white man, blacks rarely experienced justice in courtrooms when the crime involved a white man.  Southerners who favored lynching worried that a lengthy jail sentenced prolonged death and allowed African Americans to seek divine forgiveness. Warren's case was just one of several thousand lynching cases after the Civil War.  In many cases, angry mobs grabbed the first black man a bloodhound came across. Before trials could occur, mobs stormed jails and grabbed black men.  Local  judges and police were either involved or submitted to  mob  justice.       With the promise of racial equality created by voting rights, lynching attempted to create the same racial order that existed under slavery. Lynching was rare before the Civil War because slaveholders did not want to destroy their own property.  After Emancipation, Southern whites feared that the younger generation of African Americans born outside of slavery had not yet learned the code of deference and submission in the South. One black observer believed that lynching set an example, knowing full well that one Negro swinging from a tree will serve as well as another to terrorize the community.        Rural areas such as Warren County in Tennessee typically had the highest numbers of lynchings in the South.  There were strong racial tensions in rural areas where there was an influx of new African American settlers that the white community was unfamiliar with. These strange niggers, as they were labeled, did not have anyone in the white or black community to vouch for their character.   Southern Kentucky, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas were rural states  that also had the highest lynching rates in the South.    In Warren County, it would have been difficult for law enforcement to protect Wesley from a furious mob.  Since the majority of lynching occurred in secrecy at remote locations in the South, historians will never know the exact number of lynching victims, but they estimate that it was around five thousand.

Tennessee needed the revenue from the bonds to repay the forty million dollar deficit created by Civil War devastation.  A committee from the general assembly investigating Polk's personal accounts discovered that he transferred four hundred thousand dollars of the state's money into his bank account. The missing money made headline news across the state, but Polk fled before authorities could catch him.  Newspapers wildly speculated that he fled to either Mexico or South America, but nobody knew his whereabouts. The treasurer's friends believed that he lost the state's money speculating on Wall Street stocks.  The people of Nashville were outraged by another example of a long pattern of corruption that began during Reconstruction.  Congress moved quickly to pass a joint resolution that gave the attorney general the authority to seize Polk's assets.       Polk's fraud drew attention in every regional newspaper as well as The New York Times because Tennessee bondholders across the country were interested in the future of the forty million dollar state debt. Democrats blamed the origin of the  debt on railroad subsidization by Republican Governor George Brunlow during  Reconstruction.  In order to settle the debt, Democratic Governor John Calvin Brown's administration issued new bonds in 1873.  Economic depression prolonged the issue when the state defaulted on the interest payments.  With the state buried in debt, resolving the issue was the hottest political issue for the next ten years.  Democrats in control of the government divided into factions who called themselves Redeemers and Bourbons.  While Redeemers were confident that new industry would provide enough revenue to repay the debt, Bourbon Democrats envisioned a continuation of the Old South agriculture and lobbied to readjust the debt. Agricultural Democrats felt no moral obligation to repay debt that accumulated during the corrupt Republican administration.

","While women did not possess many of the rights that men did, particularly the right to vote, they were allowed to own, buy, and sell property. Property ownership among women of social standing was not uncommon in Richmond during the 1840's and 1850's. In fact, even when these women married, they often kept their holdings separated from their husband's and managed them independently. In this case, Frances Taylor trusted her husband to act as her agent and instead he betrayed her. However, many women successfully managed properties with no help at all from men. They had the full legal right to draw up and enter into contracts. Furthermore, this time period saw the birth of the women's suffrage movement. In July 1848, the Seneca Falls Convention marked the beginning of a major movement by women to attempt to gain the right to vote. However, the women's suffrage movement at this time was much stronger in the Midwest then the more traditional South.

By presenting themselves before judges, and passing a series of examinations, aspiring young lawyers declared their new vocations.

In his next correspondence, Harvey has traveled to Jackson, the seat of the state government from his home in Natchez, a major city along the Mississippi River: Now, since I wrote my letter I have been to Jackson and obtained license, 22 of us were examined in our class and none rejected.  The judges and examining committee did us the honor to say we were the best qualified class they had ever examined... no questions missed...

According to John Skates in <em>Mississippi: A Bicentennial History</em>, early Mississippi lawyers simply presented themselves before a singe judge, a practice that yielded lawyers of varying skill in the state. Because of persistent land disputes in the newly attained Native American territories between squatters and settlers, lawyers were busy, and often, successful. As the Mississippi government established itself, the process refined and the best lawyers often rose to the planter caste. As Skates discusses, The aim of many lawyers, like their medical counterparts, was a cotton plantation; hence many of the ablest members of the bar became, eventually, planter-attorney-politicians.    Harvey expressed hope for similar monetary success in his letters; This is a country for rich gals and plenty of money, your fortune is made once you can 'strike a breeze.'

The Richmond Daily Examiner reported that the city council of Richmond now required that Hotel-keepers, restaurant owners, beer saloons, or any place that sells spirits, beer, or cider must close every day at ten o'clock at night and may not open at all on Sundays. Violators of this ordinance were subject to fines of twenty dollars a day. "," In the absence of copious amounts of potable water, Americans consumed alcohol in large quantities during the nineteenth century, becoming a strong target for social reform. Alcoholism continued to become more and more common - husbands abusing or raping their wives, drinking away all of their pay, leaving their children with nothing to eat... and eventually women had had enough. "," Women held an important role in the beginning of the temperance movement. They increasingly became discontented with their place in society. They formed prayer groups and rallied against saloons, preaching that temperance meant purity, marital stability, economic improvement and prosperity, and religious salvation. Women wanted to resettle their lives and rid society of the substance that caused such economic disparity. "," Petitioning continued. Newspapers often ran stories of bar fights, domestic violence, and street scrambles caused by alcohol. Political cartoons published in magazines such as HarpWeek, featured wives with their young children, minus their drunkard father who never returned to provide for his family, leaving them in the cold. Temperance reformers insisted on total abstinence from alcohol and demanded legal prohibition. Many brewers and liquor producers organized public campaigns against women's rights because they knew that once women had a vote, prohibition would not be far behind. "," Temperance became a fight for peace on the home front. Many women felt that their lives had been disrupted by the repercussions of alcoholism. Some Christians believed drinking was sinful against God. Families were falling apart. Something had to change. "," Richmond passed the no sale of alcohol on Sunday's law to appease those who favored prohibition. Limiting the sale of spirits was at least a step in the right direction for reducing the stresses alcohol caused. Many were angered by the passage of the bill. It decreased profits for restaurants and bar owners. Most viewed this act as the precursor to nation-wide prohibition."," Temperance began by encouraging moderate use of hard liquor, but the movement turned quickly into complete elimination. Prohibition by law became a hot topic in every political campaign at every level of government. The Prohibition Party was created to support a candidate for the prohibition efforts. Religions divided between wets and dries. Strong Methodists, Baptists, and Quakers were strongly in support of temperance, while the wets including Episcopalians and Catholics, did not believe that the government should have the power to define morality. "," The war temporarily interrupted the movement simply because everyone was preoccupied with a larger struggle. Nevertheless, after the war, the Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded in 1874 forming one of the largest woman's organizations in the world. Due-paying membership exceeded 200,000 in the late 1800s. Its message was education, if it could 'get to the children' it could create a 'dry' sentiment leading to prohibition."," Temperance was a nationwide issue after the war. Virginia was not alone in restricting the purchases of alcohol. The numbers of women who joined temperance was overwhelming, proving their rising concerns. Women slowly started to gain a voice in government and not long after in 1919, nationwide prohibition came into effect with the passage of the eighteenth amendment.

This license enabled Mr. Austin to distill from domestic materials for one week only. The rules set forth by this license were issued by the United States, not the state of Virginia. Mr. Austin's license shows how alcohol was an important part of the social scene of the South. According to Charles Wilson and William Ferris, the South has always been into heavy drinking, even when Virginia was only a colony, and the colonists heavily on many occasions. Southerners were also known for the variety of drinks that they consumed. Wilson and Ferris explain that brandies were made from apples, peaches, pears, and other local fruit...imported wines/ graced wealthy tables... (and) All classes drank rum, which was obtained in exchange for southern commodities. After the Revolution, molasses became expensive, and whiskey became the major drink of the South."," The Upper South, including Buckingham County, became a region for distilling bourbon which was distilled from corn, a crop which grew well in this region. Whiskey stayed as the prominent drink of the South until the mid twentieth century. Many settlers illegally distilled alcohol on the frontier of the South. Because alcohol was a large part of life in the South, the residents experienced both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, alcohol became the social beverage to most in the South. Whether it was beer at a small farmer's get together or wine at a wealthy planter's dinner party, alcohol became the drink of the social scene in the antebellum South. On the negative side, alcohol brought about widespread alcoholism and violence. "," The negative effects of widespread alcohol use became the main motives for the temperance movements throughout the nineteenth century. The temperance movement took a while to gain a hold in the South, but the religious revivals helped this movement gain momentum. Some townspeople supported this movement, included those strongly influenced by the religious revivals, but they were strongly outnumbered by the alcohol supporters. The wealthy planters still enjoyed drinking as a social activity. Small farmers benefited economically from distilling. The temperance movement of the early nineteenth century accounted for 44 percent of the population of the country, but only eight percent of the South; none of the southern states adopted prohibition in this time period.  Many immigrants had settled in the South along the frontier, making this issue strongly divided among the North and the South; these immigrants came from backgrounds where drinking was a dominate part of their culture. Many of these immigrants had settled along Virginia's frontier, making Virginia a wet state where alcohol supporters outnumbered prohibition supporters. Despite this tension, alcohol remained dominant in the social scene of the South in the early nineteenth century and many farmers sought to distill their own alcohol as Mr. Austin did."],"display_date":"September 30, 1817 - October 7, 1817","search_date":"1817-10-03","locations":[{"id":13687,"lat":37.5453300062,"lng":-78.5815976608,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2651,"title":"The Shooting of Walter Rountree\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-01-01","end_date":"1881-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The animosity between whites and African Americans in Georgia often resulted in violent conflicts. In 1881, Walter Rountree took a walk one day from the University of Georgia with his brother and some of his friends. They encountered two African American men at the town courthouse and a conflict ensued. All the men drew their pistols against one another. In the shooting that followed, Walter Rountree was shot and later died after being carried back to his home. There was almost a riot in the town because the students were upset with the African American men. An examination of the pistols used proved that the gun that killed Rountree belonged to his own brother. However, the African American men involved in the conflict were tried for assault with intent to murder [and] found guilty. ","Georgia's society in 1881 had a guideline for social interactions between blacks and whites that were regulated by strict laws and customs. Because African Americans and whites were living in areas very close to each other and there was still animosity among these southerners, whites felt that it was necessary to have these laws to prevent conflict. The research of Edward Ayers shows that southern whites thought that blacks were to blame for the violence and that black men were...inclined toward...crimes of passion. The laws would help to keep their passions under control and prevent violence. Ayers discovered that some of the social customs that blacks had to observe were that African Americans could not address whites by their first names and could not socialize with white members of society. Since Rountree's community in Athens, Georgia was composed of blacks and whites, it is not unusual that a conflict resulted between him and his white friends and the African Americans in their town. ","African Americans were in a disadvantaged position in Georgia's society, especially concerning the law. The account of this event puts the blame for the conflict completely on the two African American men involved, although there was probably much confusion among all the men. Then the two black men were found guilty for assaulting the white men, but there was no mention of any punishment for the white men. Professor Ayers found that there were many laws created that discriminated against African Americans in society, such as vagrancy and labor laws.

The first lynching happened just five days into the new year. Each week the names, race, alleged crimes, place lynched, and date of the lynching were listed for all those who had been lynched during that year. Each week someone picked up the newspaper to see if anyone had been lynched since the previous week. "," For the week of May 29, 1897, there was not a new lynching listed since the past week, but there had been 28 since the beginning of that year. Lawrence Brown, an African American, accused of arson near Cranbury, South Carolina, was the first one to be lynched in 1897. At least one out of the 28 lynched were white. Two of the 28 were women, Mollie Smith and Amanda Franks, both from Jefferson, Alabama. They were accused of using poison and as a result were lynched. Out of all 28 of the people who were lynched, only one survived, William Clement, a black man of Cambell County, Virginia, who was accused of striking a white man.","Lynching increased in the late 1800s at a steady rate. During the 1890s, according to William Brundage, a growing number of conservative whites, concerned that lynching threatened the social tranquility and economic future of the state, agreed that lynching must end. They discussed whether certain crimes deserved mob vengeance or if they should be handled at the courts' discretion. Lynching affected the region, the state and the south as a whole, as it disrupted the economy. "," During the early 1890s, African Americans debated how to protest using appropriate measures and desperately searched for a way to protect themselves from violence. A picture depicted a few lynched men in the Richmond Planet, the question is posed: Shall this barbarity continue until the God of retribution marshals his strength against the barbarians? The idea growing in Virginia was that lynching was unnecessary and need not be tolerated. Some whites also hoped to end lynching and the violence, believing that it hurt their economy. Many blacks and whites did not want lynching to continue, and yet the there was an increase in the numbers lynched in the 1890s. "," Lynching increased in the south after 1880 through the 1950s, where 80 percent of the nation's lynchings occurred. The number lynched each year did not drop below 100 until several years after the turn of the century. Lynching was a community event, in which mothers and children watched, and the lynchers were very rarely arrested. According to William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E.

As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men. The element that stands out here is that the leaders of the town took the time to investigate Andy Blount?s claims of innocence; more importantly, they concluded that he was in fact innocent.

This greatly disturbed Judge Buchwalter, and the next time Kentucky asked him to send his prisoner to their state, he worried about what would happen to the prisoner. He first contacted Kentucky and pleaded that the prisoner, before being harmed, be given a fair trial."," Reverend A.H. Hampton, Buchwalter's prisoner, was accused of shooting and wounding a white man with intent to kill. Kentucky once again asked Judge M.L. Buchwalter to send the prisoner to Kentucky for the decision of what to do with him. Buckwalter hesitated in sending this man to Kentucky. He first wanted to make sure that the prisoner would be protected until the court made a decision, and that he would be guaranteed a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the United States. Judge Buchwalter did not want to send the charged man to Kentucky and have him lynched before he even had a chance to defend his life. "," When Kentucky could not guarantee such a request, Judge M.L. Buchwalter discharged the prisoner. In this case, Judge Buchwalter represented the beliefs of Ohio as a state. According to The Richmond Planet, Ohio refuses to act as an agent for murderers and will not deliver a black man into the hands of lynchers. "," This article, published in Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, showed the North's beliefs on lynching without a fair trial. It also showed the difference of opinion in Virginia and the South as well. The disapproval or support of lynching seemed to have reached a peak in the 1890s and newspapers all over the nation, such as this one, stated their opinion on the situation. "," Southerners, however, maintained the argument that the lynching was not unwarranted or unexpected. They wouldn't lynch a black man for something that was not harmful, such as communication with a white woman. According to William Brundage, that was only a trivial infraction of racial etiquette. But there were different levels of what was deserving of lynching. Mob vengeance was incited by more serious infractions. Theft was more serious, although it did not elicit mob violence. Minor and implicit sexual crimes incited mobs sometimes. Murder, however, got whole white communities together to lynch blacks. "," The emotions derived from each crime determined the severity of the actions. Rev. A. H. Hampton's actions would probably elicit a strong emotion from a group of whites in Kentucky, and thus he would probably be lynched. Judge M.L. Buchwalter was probably right then, to have not sent him back to Kentucky, because he would not have received a fair and impartial trial, as the Judge had wished he would, before the mob decided that he was undeserving of such a trial.

Joe contested this charge, saying that his owner, Miss Jane Rust, of Page County died in March, and he assumed that he was a free man.  Despite notices of Joe's capture, Sheriff French Strother was unable to prove the certainty behind his claim, because no one from Miss. Rust's estate came forward to verify his freedom or to prove he was their property. Without proof that Joe was either free or enslaved Sheriff Strother concluded that he was a runaway. A public auction for Joe's re-sale into slavery was then scheduled for January 2nd, 1841 at the Rappahannock County Courthouse.  Sheriff Strother advertised in the local paper that Joe would be sold to the highest bidder, to be paid for in cash.  Joe had no voice within the law.  Even if he was telling the truth, Sheriff Strother could not let him go free without proof of what he said was true.  Why would Strother believe him to be telling the truth anyway?  Joe would have seen the benefit in lying, in that he could have been freed on the off chance that they believed him or if he was a runaway, saying he was free would have delayed his trial at the very least.  In spite of his being free or not, the lack of proof sent Joe to the auction block and back into slavery. For Joe, if he were free, the re-sale back into slavery would have seemed like eternal damnation.  This episode shows that without hard evidential proof that a black man was free he was a slave under the eyes of the law.

It is unknown whether Miss Corder consented to Arthur Jordan's advances. However, many people in the town were suspicious that she was being taken advantage of. Once word got out that a black man was having a relationship with a white woman, the people began to speculate that he must be forcing Miss Corder to have sexual relations with him. Arthur approached Miss Corder and convinced her to run away with him. Whether she did it willingly or not, it was to no avail. The Corder family and neighbors pursued the couple into Maryland where they were caught and brought back to Fauquier. Arthur was put into jail to await his sentencing, and Miss Corder was returned to her family."," While Arthur was in jail, many of the community became enraged and decided to lynch the black man they felt posed a threat to their community. There were 50 men gathered outside on horseback and wearing masks. They broke into the jail, gagged Arthur, and dragged him to a nearby graveyard where they hanged him from a locust tree where he was proclaimed unconscious, if not dead after many hours. "," This incident reflects the Southern and racial phenomenon of race hatred which was based on the idea whites had that Negroes were inferior to them. The transition from the slavery system to this kind of caste system, as C. Vann Woodward refers to it, caused both whites and blacks to harbor feelings of suspicion, uneasiness, and mistrust for the others. Woodward mentions that it sometimes seemed that race relations at this point had deteriorated since the time of slavery instead of improving. It is unknown in this particular instance whether Arthur Jordan was guilty of raping Miss Corder and forcing her to do things against her will or if she willingly engaged. However, his lynching by the community shows the deep feelings of resentment that whites held for blacks at the time.

Hume, the Arkansas convention was unique, however, because it contained extensive debates about the role of race.The Civil War raged on, yet Arkansas was already underway of Reconstruction and improving race relations.Jesse N. Cypert, a southern white man from White County, pressed for ratification of a constitution excluding black suffrage, while William H. Grey, a black from Phillips County, advocated for black suffrage.Grey's arguments were rational, thought provoking, and supported by substantial evidence, and the convention approved black suffrage.Grey was treated as a gentleman and, at least in this convention, as an equal.The reigning president insisted that Grey be addressed Mr. ----, from ---- County the same way that the white delegates were addressed.Cypert's excuse for unequal address was that He had spoken of him as a negro, because he was such."," This rationale of racial equality reflects much of the Reconstruction South; it was hard for white southerners to abandon suddenly all previous prejudices.Yet, Grey proved his intelligence and deserved respect through his long oration on the reasons blacks deserved the right to vote.He based the majority of this argument on the idea that poor white southerners were worse off than many African Americans.To convince his peers of this idea, he quoted many South Carolina politicians and a Georgia judge who questioned the ignorance of these poor whites.For example, he quotes William Gregg who, in 1851, stated to the South Carolina Institute that he put[s] down the white people, who ought to work, and who do not, or who are so employed as to be wholly unproductive of State.Grey points out that blacks wanted to work and be productive members of society, yet this ignorant group of white southerners was granted more rights than his own race."," The Reconstruction Acts of March 1867 forced southern states to comply with the North to attain readmission to the Union.Hume notes that Arkansas was one of the former rebellious states to undergo a Constitutional Convention to discuss politics and bridge together opposing factions.Among these factions was the meeting of whites and blacks in a political sphere for the first time since emancipation.This instance shows the small, successful steps made during Reconstruction for black suffrage in a southern state; at the Arkansas Constitutional Convention, Grey epitomized the intelligent free black who desired large changes in southern society.According to John B. Boles, white southerners varied along class lines, and the poor white yeoman farmer or the poor white southerner were in a class separate from the slave-owning farmer or plantation owner.Boles narrates that their economic situation resulted in less education, and poor white southerners suffered substantially during the Civil War years.Using the inequality of whites along intellectual and socio-economic lines, Grey aptly proved to his peers African Americans' right to both respect and suffrage.Grey supported his arguments about blacks' deserved equality by exposing the contradictions in southern society.His victory over a bigoted Cypert was a victory not only for Arkansas, but also for African Americans who were now free and struggling with their newfound emancipation in a discriminatory nation.Such minor victories would be hope for blacks across the South, as acts of injustice dominated southern society for years to come.","--J.R."],"display_date":"March 1, 1867 - January 30, 1868","search_date":"1867-08-15","locations":[{"id":712,"lat":34.5311279044,"lng":-90.7753398937,"zoom":9,"place":"PHILLIPS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2735,"title":"Proud, Patriotic Song of an Arkansas Colored Regiment","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-01","end_date":"1865-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Written in 1863 by the white Captain Lindley Miller, the First Arkansas Colored Regiment of the Union army proudly sang the Song of the First Arkansas to become excited for training and battle.According to Miller's notes, the marching song was sung to the tune of John Brown's Body, which is significant because they honored Brown, the well-known man who attempted a widespread slave insurrection in Harper's Ferry, Virginia in 1859.The song speaks for the patriotic, proud, and dedicated black soldier.The lyrics glorify the fight for de Union and de law.The black soldiers outright profess that they hab done with hoein' cotton and hoein' corn, and they demand they dey will hab to pay us wages, de wages ob their sin.The song incorporates many elements of abolitionist thought.It demands treatment from whites as equals, demanding that whites bow their foreheads to African Americans and a right to property.A political allusion to Father Abraham and his Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 also exemplifies blacks' desire to attain the rights sanctioned to them by the government.Miller's song is a patriotic one, and it is revolutionary in its inclusion of blacks into the American sphere of citizenship.According to Ronald C. McConnell, 647 black men chose to enlist in the First Arkansas Infantry and their Union patriotism is evident in this song.Black soldiers fought in the same war, and they deserved the same respect.The Song of the First Arkansas recognizes their patriotism, bravery, and desire to end slavery in order to attain rights and equality in their nation."," The enslaved people were eager to end slavery, recognizing that the myth of the patriarchy of slaveholders was false.The song illustrates how incorrect the pro-slavery argument that slaves benefited the most from slavery.The lyrics show white slaveholders' oppression of black emancipation, describing When we heard de proclamation, massa hush it as he will.Yet, these black soldiers took the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 literally and wanted to fight to emancipate the slaves of all the southern slaveholding states.According to McConnell, songs in the Civil War evoked enthusiasm and motivated soldiers to fight.The black soldiers remembered the oppression of their fellow blacks and had even more reason to stand up for the abolitionist cause.According to John O.

In 1881, Talladega  County proposed a vote on the outlaw of alcohol consumption and the African American population allegedly voted in a bloc against the prohibition. The article blamed the African American population for the failure of passing prohibition in the county.  As the surrounding counties of Clay, Calhoun, St. Clair, and Shelby had previously outlawed the sale of alcohol, the Christians of Talladega County feared their county would be overrun with the scum and scuff of the other counties if they did not enact the same prohibition.  The Baptists of Talladega County greatly feared the community would become a cesspool of drinking and crime, as the only county in the area to permit alcohol sale and consumption.  Thus, the Baptists of Talladega County beseeched the community to protect their region from alcohol consumption and its consequences by outlawing alcohol trafficking in the county.","The <em>Christian Index</em> emphasized the depraved nature of drunkenness and the tendency for indulgence in spirits to encourage crime and lewd behavior, suggesting that those who consumed alcohol were depraved criminals and delinquents.  Thus, the article's accusation that the African American community voted in a bloc against the prohibition measure suggested that African Americans were depraved for their desire to drink alcohol or protect the right to do so.  As they vehemently condemned alcohol consumption, the <em>Christian Index </em>rebuked the African Americans in Talladega County for their part in the prohibition's failure.","The Baptists' fear of Talladega County's inevitable degeneration through alcohol consumption supports historian Robert Handy's argument that nineteenth-century Baptists believed that drunkenness was the cardinal sin of the land.  According to Handy, total prohibition was the primary and ultimate Southern Baptist position by the 1880's.  Historian Edward Ayers also argues that whites believed blacks were swing voters on the issue of prohibition, but black voters did not actually vote consistently against prohibition. The article portrays whites' view of African Americans as swing voters, as the writer condemned the African Americans for altering the outcome of the election.  Ayers argues that whites gave black voters a great deal of credit when dry forces won because of their perception of blacks as swing voters.  Nevertheless, the black voters were also held responsible when the dry forces lost.

He was later released for lack of evidence. On the following Saturday, December 30, an unknown group of people sought retribution for the alleged robbery and bombarded Gray's home, pounding violently on the door and walls of his house. No serious outcome resulted from that night's altercation, but the party returned to Gray's home on the following evening, repeated the hostility, and demanded that Gray come out to discuss his thievery. Gray refused to appear, and members of the group tore a plank of wood from Gray's door and repeatedly shot into the house through the hole. Gray received bullet wounds in the arm and stomach and died from his injuries. A man named Jim Williams also received serious wounds in the gunfire, as a shot in the forehead resulted in his death five days later. Calvin's stepson received a bullet wound in the leg, but was not fatally injured. Nine or ten people were arrested for their involvement in the bombardment, but all were released for lack of proof of their involvement. ","Gray's story reveals the disparate attitudes that whites possessed toward African Americans in Hawkins   County, Tennessee in the nineteenth century. The Hawkins County legal system treated Gray fairly, dismissing his crime for lack of proof and releasing him even though he was black. However, Gray's murderers did not grant him the same respect, as they violently assaulted him for unproven petty thievery. Gray's death displays the duplicitous nature of many southern whites in the late nineteenth century, as Gray's killers repaid an apparent legal injustice with an even more repulsive injustice. While Gray's killers believed his alleged robbery required retribution, they defied the legal system by punishing Gray outside of the system and by enacting a punishment egregiously disproportionate to the crime. ","Gray's murder served as an informal, citizen-organized judicial system, fulfilling historian Edward Ayers' argument that whites lynched alleged black offenders in the nineteenth century to uphold their perception of justice and to terrorize blacks into acquiescence. While the white mob did not lynch Gray, they terrorized him and might have lynched him if he had succumbed to their demands to exit his house. Instead, he was killed by gunshot for allegedly stealing a few hogs. Ayers argues that the majority of lynched African Americans in the nineteenth century South were tortured and killed for charges of murder, rape, or violation of white womanhood; however, Calvin Gray was hunted down, terrorized, and killed for the alleged robbery of a few hogs. Such disproportionate punishment suggests that some whites in the late nineteenth century possessed an even more severe hatred for blacks than previous accounts indicate.

On the night of his execution, Pratt was provided with spiritual advice in preparation for his execution.  While get readying himself for death, Pratt confessed to the crime for the first time.  At 12:00 a.m., thirty guards escorted Pratt out of the jail to the gallows near downtown Marietta.  The guards allowed Pratt to smoke a cigar, and they talked pleasantly amongst each other.  When Pratt arrived at the gallows, 8,000 people were waiting to witness his execution.  After an African American minister recited a prayer, Pratt publicly confessed his crime and expressed a willingness to die.  At 12:45 a.m., the drop fell, his neck broke, and he completely stopped moving thirteen minutes later.  The guards cut down Pratt's body, giving it to his father, brothers, and sisters who witnessed the execution.","Pink Pratt's execution demonstrates an uncommon instance when a nineteenth-century southern judicial system legitimately accused, convicted, and punished a black man according to the law, even though he committed a violent crime against a white female.  While a white perpetrator may have received a lighter punishment, Pratt was treated in a reasonably fair manner, considering the usual treatment of black offenders in the late nineteenth-century American South.  Pratt was executed as a criminal who committed a heinous offense, but the legal system fairly granted him the traditional religious rituals that it granted white offenders upon their execution.  The nineteenth-century Cobb County judicial system deemed a black criminal worthy of humane treatment, despite the horror of his crime.  ","Pratt's story challenges the traditional account of white reactions to black violent crime against whites.  As historian Edward Ayers argues, southern whites in the post-Civil War era were convinced that blacks were more dangerous than whites and that black men were more inclined to commit crimes of passion.  Nevertheless, the <em>National Police Gazette </em>did not portray Pratt as an atrocious creature, but depicted him talking pleasantly to his guards and expressing a willingness to die for his crime.  He was not portrayed as the brutal, dangerous monster that many southern whites declared blacks to be.  In addition, the public allowed his execution to occur through the legal process.  Ayers argues that black criminals were frequently kidnapped from jails, tortured, burned, and hanged by white mobs because whites believed such blacks were unworthy of legal execution.  However, Pratt was allowed to die through legal execution even though he raped a twelve-year-old white girl.  According to Ayers, whites often justified a lynching simply because the black offender committed the usual crime of sexual assault upon white women.  Whites assumed that black men lusted after white women and they even justified lynching blacks when they committed a minor violation of white womanhood.  Nevertheless, despite Pratt's severe violation of the dignity of an innocent white child, he was permitted to die through formal execution.

Sharp concealed her pregnancy until the birth, attempting to protect her reputation for as long as possible. When her father discovered her secret, he erupted in anger and demanded vengeance upon the man who impregnated her. She initially refused to reveal the name of her child's father, but eventually revealed that her impregnator was Thomas Nation, a Mormon convert who was her sister's husband. Mr. Sharp rushed to Nation's house, threatening to kill his son-in-law and then himself. Upon arriving at Nation's residence, Sharp discovered the dead body of his other daughter, as she had perished that same day in the delivery of her own child. Meanwhile, Nation realized his adultery had been discovered, and he fled from his home and his wife's corpse. After the funeral of his daughter, Mr. Sharp offered a 100 reward for Nation's arrest and the entire community joined in the hunt for the villain. Nation was eventually discovered with two other Mormons on a train going to Chattanooga, Tennessee. The sheriff of Catoosa County sent a deputy to pursue Nation, and they arrested him as he stepped off the train in Chattanooga on August 13, 1880.","It is impossible to determine whether Martha Sharp's intercourse with Thomas Nation was forced or consensual. Nonetheless, Sharp possessed much shame about her pregnancy. Her father's reaction to the incident reveals the severity that nineteenth-century southern society bestowed upon such a scandal. The fact that Mr. Sharp was willing to kill his son-in-law and then end his own life, suggests that Sharp lost all desire to live because of his family's disgrace. However, the community blamed Nation's membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as the reason for the scandal, accusing Nation's religious associations as the cause for the Sharp family's problems.","The <em>National Police Gazette'</em>s article on the scandal supports historian Sarah Barringer Gordon's claim that most Americans of the nineteenth century believed the Latter Day Saints were an uncivilized and barbaric religious group. According to Gordon, anti-Mormon and anti-polygamy Americans argued that no civilized group could disagree about the fundamental question of domestic relations, declaring the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to be an inhumane, undemocratic, and un-American church. The article supports Gordon's argument, as the story castigated Nation more for his Mormon affiliation than for his adultery. Nation was, in fact, practicing adultery with his wife's sister and was not practicing polygamy. However, the article and community emphasized Nation's crime as a Mormon polygamy problem, rather than a problem of morality in general. The article's attack on the Latter Day Saints displays the Protestant community's desire to frame the incident as an isolated Mormon problem, rather than a moral problem that breeched religious divides.

In the introduction, the authors stated that their intention was to give people seeking a new home a brief description of the area and the advantages it offers as one of the foremost cities of the South. Throughout the book, they gave detailed accounts of various aspects of the county, including its public and private facilities, advantages and needs, and its relation to the state as a larger whole in terms of its products, climate, government, and people. "," When the handbook begins discussing the people of Durham, it mentions the negro population, and states that it was largely descended from former slaves, but the importation of those forced laborers was very rare at the beginning of the 18th century onwards. The authors then attributed the large number of blacks in the area to natural causes such as a healthy climate, a humane public system, and the kindly tempers of the owner They stated that African Americans were happy to stay within the state because of the affection shown to them by their previous masters. Since slaves' emancipation, the book claimed African Americans have been shown absolute equal rights, with the exception of the slightly larger poll-tax and property tax, which the writers attributed to their population within the state, not their particular race. When discussing suffrage later in the hand-book, the authors explained why African Americans are withheld from administering to the law themselves as magistrates. It is because, explained the authors, blacks have just been released from slavery and are therefore ignorant of the duties of citizenship. This, the authors claimed, is for everyone's safety, including the colored man. "," This extract is a commentary on the county of Durham that reveals a great deal about their identity. The Educator Company explains current race relations and demographics with a history of the treatment of African Americans, and claims that Durham is a harmonious community now because it has always been so, even in the times of slavery. This belief, as well as the reasoning behind the disenfranchisement of African American's rights, is representative of many other counties' and states' racial ideologies in the South at the turn of the 19th century. "," At this point in time, several southern states were passing laws or constitutional amendments depriving black citizens of their right to vote, or at least making it very difficult to do so. Jim Crow laws were also very popular, and North Carolina was on the brink of adopting the separate but equal statute following the Plessy v. Ferguson trial. Finally, a ruthless white-supremacy campaign launched in 1898 completed a decade of setbacks for African Americans living in North Carolina. This second-class citizenship was adopted by local, state, and national legislatures, and indeed, the vast majority of Americans. However, despite these obstacles, the black community still focused on improving their condition and bettering their community. Contrasting to the Educator Company's opinion of the political ignorance of African Americans, many of them became involved with and supported the newly formed Fusion political party, a combination of Populists and Republicans."],"display_date":"1895 - 1896","search_date":"1896-01-01","locations":[{"id":9427,"lat":36.0420245844,"lng":-78.889350822,"zoom":10,"place":"DURHAM, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2766,"title":"Petition of the U.S. Senate for compensation of land confiscation by United States Troops\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-04-10","end_date":"1874-04-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On this day Mr. West petitioned the United States Senate to obtain compensation for lands which he claimed were taken from him by United States troops in Jackson, Mississippi.

On May 8, 1839, the Mobile Commercial Register published that a committee was investigating reports of certain cruelties towards prisoners. Upon surveying the prison, the committee confirmed that the prison keepers did in fact torture and whip the prisoners, so much that the doctors frequently had to visit to treat their wounds. They also starved them and worked them like horses. They lived in dungeons as dark as death that were kept at practically freezing temperatures.

Those who were in favor of prisons said such institutions were favorable for reforming the individual and making the law more effective. On the other side of the debate, some southerners found reforming criminals to be dangerous and useless, preferring the old methods of fines, branding, local jails, and hangings. In 1834, a referendum in Alabama on prisons reported that voters were overwhelmingly opposed to the system. Nevertheless, the southern penitentiary system continued to expand.","Once created, local governments did not like spending money on prisons. Therefore, imprisonment could become an agonizing ordeal, as it was for the prisoners at Auburn. To raise the funds for upkeep, prisons leased out the prisoners to work in harsh conditions. The prison officials at Auburn were much like the ones all over the South, dealing out severe physical punishments, providing poor food, and focusing more on how they could profit from leases themselves. Even though many citizens were outraged at the conditions seen in Auburn, they did not take any progressive action. In fact, no action was taken in regards to the prison at Auburn until 1862. Because the voters did not even want the prisons in the first place, it was easier to ignore them, and thus, reform was not a popular point of focus in the nineteenth century."],"display_date":"May 8, 1839","search_date":"1839-05-08","locations":[{"id":424,"lat":34.5332418581,"lng":-88.0268639238,"zoom":7,"place":"INDIAN LANDS, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2778,"title":"The New Textile Industry in Athens, Georgia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-11","end_date":"1849-01-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Cotton farming had reached great heights in Georgia by the mid-1800's but some saw that there was still room to grow in the cotton business. Though most of their neighbors were engaged in farming, twenty citizens of Athens, Georgia decided to break the mold. In January of 1849 they announced in the Athens <em>Southern Banner</em>, that they were joining together to form a new business: The Athens Manufacturing Company. In the announcement the company stated, [we] have associated ourselves together as a body corporate for the purpose of engaging in the business of manufacturing cotton and wool yarns and goods, and yarns and goods of which cotton and wool form component parts, and also of the manufacturing of flour and meal, and the repairing of machinery. ","The Athens Manufacturing Company was one of many new cotton-manufacturing companies established in Georgia during the 1840's. This sudden increase in industrialization was largely due to a series of developments over the early 1800's that came together to create a favorable environment for industry in Georgia. Manufacturing companies in Georgia were beginning to exist, but in 1849 they were still few and far between. It took a significant amount of money to start such a business and not many people could afford such a large investment. In the 1810's the change in national business law helped overcome this obstacle. Before this time, individuals or partners owned most businesses. This changed in the 1810's when the government began to recognize new corporate organizations that were composed of multiple investors. ","This group of investors was willing to take its chance at manufacturing but they needed a source of power for the machines they would use to make the cotton and wool products. During the 1820's, people in Georgia successfully harnessed waterpower, which became the source that provided the power for the Athens Manufacturing Company and other industrial businesses. In order to make a profit from the cotton and wool products, the Athens Manufacturing Company needed customers. Without a sufficiently-sized market such a company was not worth investing in; the number of buyers from Athens and the surrounding counties were not nearly enough to support the company. The rapid improvement of transportation systems across the nation in the early nineteenth century was responsible for increasing the size of markets, especially for inland companies such as this one. The Central Rail Road built in the 1830's provided an artery of transportation from central Georgia where Athens was located, to Savannah, an important national and international port on the Atlantic. ","Though Georgia was at the forefront of the textile industry in the South, the North had a significant head start and continued to dominate the national industry throughout the antebellum period. This regional disparity in strength caused political disagreements between the South and the North. This can be seen in looking at the increased tariff on foreign imported products in 1828, which was referred to in the South as the tariff of abominations. The tariff on foreign products was economically beneficial to American manufacturers, who were mainly found in the North, because overseas competition was decreased and they could raise prices. In the South most people were farmers, not manufacturers, and so the tariff was economically harmful because they had to pay more for manufactured goods. The increased price of manufactured products from the North was one source of motivation for the South to move from an almost entirely agricultural economy to a somewhat industrial one. The Athens Manufacturing Company provides an example of this change.

The State had found Nobles guilty of murdering her husband three years prior, and sentenced her to death by hanging the following day. Yet the Twiggs County facility where Nobles was being held received a last minute notice to cancel her execution. Georgia Governor William Atkinson, the only body left with the power to pardon her death sentence, sent the notification that afternoon reducing her punishment to serving life in prison. The governor came to this conclusion after immense pressure from women across the state. Once the Pardon Board had declared that it could do no more for the accused, individual women as well as organizations sent numerous petitions and requests on behalf of Nobles to the governor.

Certain territories in the West had even granted suffrage for all women by this point. Although Georgia had not yet permitted women to vote, women still held power and exerted their influence over everyday affairs. They formed committees and organizations concerned with reducing social ills such as illiteracy, child labor, and the consumption of alcohol. They joined preexisting groups such as the National American Woman Suffrage Association in order to further their own desires to win political recognition.

On Wednesday, October 6, 1897, North Carolina Governor Daniel L. Russell dismissed Otho Wilson, the railroad commissioner, for conspiring with the Southern Railway Company to promote his own economic interest. Wilson did this by appealing to the railway company to stop at his hotel in order to increase the eating-house's business. According to Russell and the witnesses gathered by him to testify against Wilson, this had a negative impact on many businesses in Hickory, North Carolina, the stop that was replaced by Wilson's hotel. The town's only restaurant was forced to close when the train ceased stopping there. Others faced difficulties in transporting or receiving merchandise, and many were inconvenienced by the extra travel now required to reach the closest railroad station. Not only did the effect Wilson's actions had on the town of Hickory warrant his dismissal, but Russell argued that by placing himself under obligations not only to the Southern Railway Company it disqualified him to act as a fair, impartial judge and juror in any controversy that might arise between such corporations and individual citizens. "," A few years later on January 25, 1899, a group of people decided to contest this decision and wrote an appeal to Governor Russell asking for an explanation, as they felt Wilson's dismissal was unjust. Russell responded with a lengthy document that described Wilson's misdeeds and explained how severely he had affected the town of Hickory solely for his own monetary gain. Russell, the first Republican Governor of North Carolina since the end of Reconstruction and the last until 1973, was chastised relentlessly by the Democrats, who took Wilson's indictment for bribery, as well as that of Dr. Moss, the Chairman of the Commissioners of Vance County, to reflect personally upon Russel's legislature since he had originally appointed them to those positions. The Democrats argued that those officials' effects on North Carolina politics and the economies of local towns was unforgivable, and must be corrected with a new Democratic governor. "," This scenario reveals a great deal about both the importance of transportation in South at this time and the politics involved with that institution. At this time, the railroad was the most effective means of transportation throughout the South. As the railroad tracks quickly lengthened, so did the population and industry of places with train stations. Therefore, a railroad commissioner usually made decisions about stopping points with great deliberation because their impact on towns would be considerable, which explains why Wilson's crime was so grave. Also, since railroads were the primary mode of transportation, the politics surrounding them were intense, and as historian Leslie Decker claims, often involved conflicts between political and economic interests. This can be seen in Russell's dilemma and in the reasons cited by the Democrats for his incompetence.

","Thus, when W.W. Price of the northern cotton house Hubbard, Price & Co. arrived in Jackson, Mississippi in 1891 in order to begin establishing a branch house in the city, he was not labeled a carpetbagger.

White southerners, in the words of Richard Nelson Current, were no longer suspicious of Northerners who went south...[to] get rich by plundering the Southern people. They no longer feared negro rule; although black politician Hiram Revels stated, as reprinted by James Wilford Garner, that black voters during reconstruction had been used as mere tools to elect imprudent [and corrupt] men who called themselves Republicans, after 1890, they were no longer used at all. The chivalrous (?) [sic] white Democrats, according to the Cleveland Gazette, were therefore quite content.","Blacks of Mississippi and of the nation as a whole, however, were not pleased. The Atlantic Monthly noted by 1892 that The Fifteenth Amendment is disregarded [in Mississippi] where it is not nullified on the face of the state law. Reporting on this system of Jim Crow law, the Cleveland Gazette noted that the state of Mississippi was referred to by blacks as his Satanic Majesty's abiding place.","The problem, however, was that his Satanic Majesty sometimes left home. According to The Atlantic Monthly, candid Republicans at the North admit that domination by the ignorant blacks of the Gulf States is something to be dreaded. The suppression of the negro vote, wherever such a step is necessary to secure control of the government by the whites, is winked at, if not applauded. For some reason, be it simple racism or otherwise, the 1890 Mississippi constitution made sense to both Democrats and Republicans in both the South and the North. ","It made so much sense that the Justices of the United States Supreme Court, arguably some of the brightest legal minds of the time, supported it in Williams v. Mississippi, 1898. As decided by the majority, Justice McKenna, a newly appointed Californian, opined that the statutes of the 1890 Mississippi constitution do not on their face discriminate between the races, and it has not been shown that their actual administration was evil; only that evil was possible under them.

Hall. No one expected that he would turn up dead hours later. ","Forsythe was shot through the window by a shoeless suspect. Officials initially suspected a burglary. What investigators later discovered was that Forsythe's participation in the Hall case was more involved than imagined. When Hall and four other members of Dodge's elite went to United States Court on December 8 for defrauding Norman Dodge, they also faced criminal charges of conspiracy to assassinate Forsythe. Two of the charged men confessed to their individual responsibilities in the plot and disclosed information about the hired black assassin. Their testimonies gave prosecutors ample evidence to convict each of the five accused men. ","While crime ran out of control across the South in the late nineteenth century, it was not limited to the racial incidents and lynchings that dominated the news. White men and women committed crimes too. Yet these cases were less prominent of an issue at that time because whites faced lesser consequences and publication of their crimes in comparison to blacks. Because racial tension was seeping through the South at this time, the felonies that received the most attention were those performed by blacks or white mobs in lynching. White crimes could squeak by without encountering harsh trials, severe punishments, or public lynchings. In Georgia only 19 whites were lynched in a fifty year span into the twentieth century. That was less than the total number of blacks lynched in Georgia in 1899 alone. While the public lynched blacks for a number of crimes, they lynched whites only in the cases of extreme violence. Class differences existed as well. Of the whites that were mobbed or harshly persecuted in the South, they tended to be vagrants and people without ties to the area and community. Therefore, wealthier citizens that had spent their lives in one place had the respect of their peers and were less likely to be forced into any unpleasant punishment for their crimes. ","Hall's assassination plot was cleverly designed to get rid of a key witness to his original trial without facing the severe consequences of this action. The hired assassin was a black man already wanted for a series of previously committed crimes. He would receive the brunt of the court's and the public's outrage because he was black, and because he was the physical killer. Also, being a well-known and respected lawyer in the area gave Hall the security that a jury of his peers would not be demanding in their sentencing of his trial.

Montgomery, eventually the only black representative at the convention, stood up for things taboo to many in their respective communities. The results of each man's stand not only affected them personally, but also shaped the future of Mississippi for many years to come.","Cook and Montgomery looked back at the years after the Civil War and preceding the 1890 convention and saw the same thing. In 1875, after ten years of Republicans in Mississippi joining forces with blacks, scalawags, and carpetbaggers, resulting in what many white Mississippians referred to as negro rule, it was apparently decided, according to Dunbar Rowland, that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Following an apparently very bloody revolution in which whites took back control (in theory), 15 years of intimidation passed, during which according to James George as printed in the Jackson Clarion Ledger, the method of preserving white supremacy was never entirely satisfactory. Isaiah Montgomery, in his speech during the 1890 convention, described these years in terms of every form of [political] demoralization [for blacks]-bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Although the convention took place under the pretext of, according to Rowland, eliminating ignorance at the ballot box, it was in fact a move to lawfully disenfranchise a majority of black voters by using a poll tax and a literary test in order to establish franchise qualification. According to estimates by Montgomery, the new State Constitution would disenfranchise 11,889 whites and 123,334 blacks in Mississippi. The Cleveland Gazette hoped the unconstitutional and un-American action would be prevented or at least delayed a few years, but it was not to be. ","For his part, and against what would perhaps be expected of a white Mississippian, Marsh Cook, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, took a stand against the principles of the gathering delegation and courageously challenged the Democrats for a seat to the Constitutional Convention in spite of death threats. Isaiah Montgomery did the opposite. As the only black representative to the convention, he took the opportunity to appeal to the good natures of the white representatives and their belief in a Supreme Arbiter, which supposedly would help the two races march together towards new and greater triumphs of progressive civilization. Montgomery apparently recognized the legitimacy of the white demand to rule for their [the whites] own protection, and he foolishly [in retrospect] hoped, by his support of the new constitution and its subsequent passing, that he and other black Mississippians would gain favor in white sight, thus bridging a chasm that has been widening and deepening for a generation He hoped his appeals would lead to the death of the constitutional movement or perhaps, if it passed, an immediate reversal of the new constitution.","Both men failed. Marsh Cook was ambushed and murdered, according to PBS, on a lonely road. The Cleveland Gazette hoped that his murder, being that of a respectable white gentleman, would cause the federal government to take the necessary steps to protect the American citizen at home, be his color what it may. It did not. Montgomery's hopes of racial cooperation also did not materialize. He was lambasted by the Cleveland Gazette, which called his defense of the monstrous franchise provision...a disgrace to the race and to our civilization, and wished he had never been born. For all of their objections, however, Mississippi, and the rest of the South, as many other states followed suit, plunged itself headfirst into a half-century of legal disenfranchisement and discrimination.

Authorities of these towns could at anytime decide whether or not free public schools shall be established. Raleigh citizens voiced their overwhelming approval for this bill during a town meeting. The public school system would be supported by taxation since this was the only way to insure its success. ","The measure proposed in Raleigh is only a small step in the right direction. The South must persist in its endeavor, as the New York Times would argue, by establishing a system of public schools in all the States. In some states, the proportion of illiterates to literates in the population is alarming. Through the establishment of free public schools, the South can fulfill its chief need: education.","There were many reasons for the lack of schooling in the South. Neither the wealthy planters nor the poor farmers pressured the Southern legislatures to spend money on education. Neither group saw much benefit in public education for themselves or their children. Certain Southern whites disliked the idea of educating blacks because they feared that such education might threaten white supremacy. Though they rendered perfunctory tribute to public education in their messages to the legislature, as historian Albert Ray Newsome observes, the governors were in most cases indifferent to education. However, other Southerners recognized that the education of freedom was necessary to prepare citizens for the responsibilities of freedom.

While she waited, however, she was...politely told that accommodations were prepared for her in another part of the building. The lady moved off quietly and took her place in the gallery. In an article in the Montgomery Advertiser the following Tuesday, the woman was excused from her decision to sit in a seat exactly suited to her mind with the dismissal that she knew no better, and probably had been told that she was as good as the whites, and entitled to as many privileges. White Montgomery citizens were beginning to realize that, in order to maintain the racial order of slavery, they would have to make sure that newly freed African-Americans, such as the lady in the church, knew their place.","One of the ways cities like Montgomery informed freedmen of the new social order were with Black Codes. According to historians Leah Atkins, Wayne Flint, William Rogers, and Robert Ward, after the Civil War, many blacks...left their plantations and flocked to...towns and cities such as Montgomery.

Just months after this incident in Montgomery, the Alabama constitutional convention failed to make blacks equal before the law and when the legislature reconvened on January 15, 1866, it enacted laws...to regulate the conduct of blacks. These laws effectively became the Alabama Black Codes, the laws that would form the foundation of legal segregation in Alabama.

George (D. Miss), a man Dunbar Rowland calls a life-long resident of Carroll County, began his overwhelmingly convincing speech on the Senate Floor defending the newly written Mississippi Constitution. The new constitution, according to Rowland's 1902 reflections, was drafted in order to eliminate ignorance at the ballot box, and Senator George's defense was apparently very insightful; he displayed a more intimate knowledge of the constitutions of Massachusetts, Vermont and Connecticut than did the Senators who represented those states, and the speech itself has been called one of the great constitutional law speeches of the Senate. Indeed, the principles that the man from Carroll laid out in his speech were subsequently validated by the United States Supreme Court in Williams v. Mississippi, 1898. ","Two of the 1890 Mississippi Constitution's 285 main sections which George defended, however, have now earned historical renown: Sec. 243 establishing a uniform poll tax of two dollars, to be used in aid of the common schools, and for no other purpose, and Sec. 244 establishing a literacy test consisting of being able to read, understand, and interpret any section of the new Constitution. Although these two sections do not explicitly disenfranchise blacks and the provisions of the constitution of the State of Mississippi and the laws enacted to enforce them [were found in Williams v. Mississippi not to be] repugnant to the Fourteenth [and Fifteenth] Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the result was undoubtedly lopsided. According to William Alexander Mabry, the educational test if administered honestly [disenfranchised] about 123,334 Negroes and only 11,889 whites, leaving a white voting majority of more than 40,000 in the state instead of the existing 70,000 potential Negro majority, not to mention the fact that the Negro majority was already being repressed by bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Unfortunately, contrary to some of the official defenses of the 1890 constitution, including Senator George's, the result of disenfranchising a great number of blacks was intentional. As Rowland stated, the 1875 White Revolution in Mississippi and the subsequent years of intimidation of blacks leading up to the 1890 convention were carried out under the belief that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Even future early twentieth century Mississippi Governor James Kimble Vardaman noted, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, that there is no use to equivocate or lie about the matter. Mississippi's constitutional convention was held for no other purpose than to eliminate the nigger from politics; not the ignorant -- but the nigger. James George had fought since 1875 for this very purpose, and, despite claims of eliminating ignorance, it was in fact racial discrimination he defended before the U.S. Senate. ","Although the man from Carroll County's humble beginnings had earned him the nickname the Great Commoner, and his work in the United States Senate was valuable in aiding education and civil service reform as well as being instrumental in shaping the Sherman Antitrust Law, his staunch defense of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 left a darker legacy to the South. While he was very likely only a product of his time and environment, as well as a much larger underlying racial problem in the South and indeed the entire country, Senator James Z. George's rousing speech left what would become a permanent stain not only on the man from Carroll, but also on the entire South and United Sates as a whole, as it justified before Congress the Jim Crow system of de jure racial segregation and subjugation.

The petitioners wanted a commutation of the sentence of the black man Preston Harris, who was sentenced to be hung for arson. Harris sent fire to the jail where he was housed, though no one seemed to know if it was accidental or purposeful. All of the prisoners housed in the jail were brought out to safety, and the conflagration was put out before too much damage was done. The court ruled that for this offense, Harris should be hung. The petition requested that the sentence be changed from hanging to life imprisonment since the prisoner was only 17 years old. It was obviously a clear case of guilt, but many people felt that it was too harsh for such a young man, even if he was black. "," There are many examples in Southern history of whites (and blacks as well) petitioning for blacks to be granted mercy in regards to very harsh sentences in the Virginia penal system. Historically, petitions were an important part of the American legal system, and citizens actively used this right to redress grievances and plead for mercy, especially with regards to criminals. This collective action allowed the general population to have a say in the specific roles of their government. However, it is not typical for whites to take such specific action for a black man. It was not unknown however, as can be seen throughout Virginia history. For example, in the case of Angela Barnett in 1793, Angela appealed to have her death sentence pardoned since she was with child. With this appeal and the help of petitions from white friends, that sentence was pardoned. While whites may find blacks dangerous as a whole, individual blacks were their friends. In this way, whites saw Harris as an individual person, who was unjustly sentenced, not as a part of the threatening black masses. While the specifics of the case are unknown, it is clear that whites in Southside Virginia saw the injustice of such a harsh sentence for someone so young.

When the Civil War broke, this was exacerbated by the fear that slaves would join the Union army. Louis Hughes was a slave from Mississippi. As the war progressed, Union armies came closer and closer to his hometown until ultimately they came through and destroyed Panola. Masters feared for their lives and their property and decided to send some of their slaves further south and away from the Yankees. Hughes and his wife were part of a group initially sent to Georgia. Once in Atlanta, Hughes and his wife were transferred again, this time to Mobile, Alabama. In Mobile, Hughes was sent to the salt works. There he worked for the rebel government, while his wife worked as a cook in the same factory. Salt was essential for preserving meat, and thus Hughes and his wife were forced to play a critical role in aiding the southern military effort. ","In 1863, it became legal for the Union army to use black troops. While this included freed blacks, Northern troops also enlisted runaways who offered their service. For blacks, this was a way of guaranteeing freedom and showing patriotism. Clearly southerners feared this. They accused Lincoln of inciting slave rebellions and violating laws of war. When it became apparent that Yankee soldiers intended to benefit from using blacks in the army, the fears of masters were renewed and they often sent their slaves South to hide them.

The lynchers, according to the newspaper, would never be prosecuted. On March 27 of the previous year, the same newspaper reported that levee cutters would be properly cared for by the citizens of Bolivar county, as ropes and trees are plentiful up there. Thus it seems that lynching, for American Southerners, was simply an every-day fact of life; according to the Cleveland Gazette, the man in lynched in Texas was just one of 235 that year. Judging by later statistics, a proportionally large amount of those most likely occurred in Mississippi. ","Many if not all of those 235 lynching victims in 1891 were blacks, as African Americans were often the targets of lynch mobs . As the first blurb points out, it was common for whites of the South (and indirectly, by their indifference, the North) to simply let mob justice take its course, in order to, according to Michael Pfeifer, supposedly serve the purposes of local elites and other whites in relieving both economic and sexual anxieties. As white men saw it, the most overt kinds of opposition to their supremacy were frequently represented in these two forms. (Later, according to the Cleveland Gazette, white women of the south would take the take the charge in putting a stop to this mentality and to lynching). Thus the tensions in the South leading to lynchings were deeper simply skin color, although, according to Philip Dray, it was because of skin color that the accusations against those being sought out for lynching were often amplified and exaggerated by individuals in order to incite mobs.","During the late 1800s, according to Johnathan Markovitz, lynchings were carefully designed to convey to black persons in this country that they had no power and nothing else whites were obligated to respect. They were, in other words, used as measures of intimidation in order to prolong a society of white supremacy. Often, mobs of whites would turn lynchings into violent public spectacles, punishing one or two blacks to supposedly, as put by a Mayor of New Orleans, cause the others [to] trouble you no more.","Not all whites supported lynch mobs, however. Governor Hogg certainly did not appreciate the Law of the Mob. As Pfeifer points out, many others, such as Andrew Augustus Gunby, spoke out against lynchings and in support of law and order. They did so, however, often at the risk of their jobs and reputations, as Gunby blamed his stance on the lynching matter for his loss in the Democratic nomination for Congress from Louisiana's Fifth District in 1886. Additionally, Gunby, as many anti-lynching whites most likely did, spoke out in support of white supremacy; it is not as if he was anti-lynching because he believed in the equality of black men and women, he simply wanted the law to be upheld.","This is not the entire story of lynching in the South, however, as it seems things had changed by 1899. The Clarion Ledger, on September 14 and 21 of that year, published articles supporting the decision of the Governor McLaurin to call out the militia for the purpose of detering a lynch mob (an the militia followed his order), and lamenting the lynching of an innocent black man in Lawrence County, thus pointing out the wrongs of lynching. Although the paper still (somewhat paradoxically) supported lynching for rape, the evil [must] stop here. This seems to be, and is in a small way, a complete moral reversal of earlier values espoused by the paper (and supposedly therefore the average Mississippian). Unfortunately, there were some alternate motives.","Interestingly (and horribly) enough, economics played a large part in leading white supremacists to turn away from using lynching as a tool; according to Pfeifer, in the first decades of the twentieth century, an emerging urban bourgeoisie [in the South] wary of public disorder and threats to the accumulation of capital pressed for systematic legal methods for the sustenance of white supremacy. It seemed that by the early 1900s (and according to the Ledger, as early as 1899), the efforts of anti-lynching thinkers such as W.E.B. du Bois and Ida B. Wells, an African American woman who encouraged blacks to boycott, vote, and agitate against white oppressors were causing people everywhere to pay attention to what was happening in the South. Later, as Markovitz points out, efforts of organizations such as the NAACP (founded 1909) were paying off in bringing unwanted publicity to lynchings in the South, thereby threatening business by scaring off investors; influential white businessmen began to push more and more for writing white supremacy into law in order to legitimize the systems of white supremacy as well as maintain the flow of investments into the South. ","This is not to say that lynching stopped, however. The Cleveland Gazette reported episodes of lynchings in Mississippi into the 1920s. Furthermore, it seems white supremacy itself did not bother the aforementioned investors. Many across the country simply wanted to turn a blind eye to ways in which the system was being enforced. It's even questionable as to whether or not whites across the country objected to lynching as a process, as legal lynchings became popular in the early 1900s as a somehow more just and orderly answer to pure mob violence. Thus, it seems the September Ledger issues were merely protesting the evil of mob justice."],"display_date":"November 5, 1891 - December 31, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-03","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2876,"title":"Violence with a Negro Tramp\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-09-27","end_date":"1888-09-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Mr. John Davis was at the Appomatox Depot when he saw a young black man sitting on the steps of a mail car next to the tender. The man was a tramp and when Davis approached the black man to ask what he was doing, the black man cursed Davis and attacked him with a knife. The cuts were not deep and Davis was not seriously injured. The black man escaped by running down the railroad tracks and away from Davis and other townspeople. Mr. Davis had no idea who the man was or what had provoked him to such a violent act. "," However, the next day the young son of George Burton was with a black man named Frederick Claytor. They decided to go tramping together, but Burton was appalled by the black man's behavior and reprimanded him for his repulsive acts. Heated words were exchanged and the Claytor pulled out a pistol and shot Burton in the shoulder. Claytor was arrested in Chesterfield County and was taken for examination to Justice Perkins. It was suspected that Claytor was the same man who had assaulted Mr. Davis, but Mr. Davis failed to show up at the jail to identify him. "," The judge's verdict in this case is unknown, but this case was important because it showed the fear that white's had towards blacks and the violence that some blacks showed to whites in retaliation for their inferior status in Southern society. Violence was a tool that whites used to establish the status quo and order within Southern society. However, when violence was used by blacks against whites, that social order was disrupted. As can be seen in this episode, black violence was portrayed as irrational and unpredictable. White anger was excusable, but black anger was disturbing and unjust. In many ways, this episode reflected the inferiority of blacks that many whites believed was inherent. While Claytor was a tramp, Burton only engaged in tramp-like activities. Black stereotypes were also enforced in this story, as social outcasts who were damaging to society. This distinction between blacks and whites was reflected in the paper and in the way that whites treated blacks.

As a judge and a state senator, he was also a man of wealth. He kept meticulous records of the accounts for his plantation, Cedar Bluff. Reavis filled his ledger with precise descriptions of purchases and sales of cotton, food, supplies, animals, and the biggest investment of all, slaves. Reavis paid the same regard to his slaves he did the mules he sold and the pork he purchased; they were simply necessary items of property needed to conduct the everyday business of running a plantation. The big difference to Reavis between the slaves and other items, however, was money. Reavis maintained a precise list of all of the thirty-one slaves he owned and made note of their names, where and when they were purchases, and, most importantly, how much he invested in them. He purchased his first eighteen slaves on December 25, 1859 for 14,500 in cash. He then purchased three more slaves for 2700 and a division with D. Waller. Reavis purchased the remaining ten slaves on January 2, 1861 for 8,225, with interest. All in all, Reavis' investment totaled 25,425 for his slaves. ","Turner Reavis' attention to detail was not unusual, considering his position as owner of a large plantation. Historian Lucille Griffith concludes that for business reasons, if for no other, planters kept detailed and extensive records. Running a plantation was similar to running a business and slaves were part of the overhead necessary for success. It was important for planters like Reavis to be aware of the amount of money they had invested in their slaves, especially for sums as large as 25, 425. This costly investment, though, generally meant profits for the planters. Historians William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E.

Since the first presidential election, the political system of the United States had managed to contain sectional differences by offering citizens an alternative to violence-the voting box. A loss one year could be balanced simply by winning four years later; no one should have to feel forced into a given action by any election results. Yet as historian Michael Holt contends, Once faith in [the Whigs and the Democrats] collapsed, however, a sense of crisis developed that government was beyond control of the people, that it had become a threatening power dominated by some gigantic conspiracy, and hence that republican institutions were under attack. This feeling-a new feeling of utter hopelessness- is so clearly seen by Judge Magrath and reverberated throughout much of the South in 1860. Instead of relying on politics and the proverbial voting box, the South soon turned to guns and violence.

Rix of Raleigh, NC, eighteen of his slaves were freed from bondage on the condition that they boarded a ship sailing from Norfolk, VA to the west coast of Africa. One of the eighteen took a stand against these terms, and was resold into slavery. The idea for the resettlement of blacks in Africa began as a way for whites to rid themselves of African American presence to counterbalance ever increasing numbers of free blacks living on American soil. The public image that organizations such as the American Colonization Society presented was one of compassion and of Christian values. Soon it became clear that although there were pockets of blacks who looked positively on the idea of colonization, there were a great many others who questioned the professed philanthropy of its [white] promoters. Blacks who did support the movement often did so only when they decided whites would never allow them to claim full and equal citizenship. Many states, including Virginia, had instituted laws forcing freed slaves to exit the state; Furthermore, Georgia had created a system set on deterring blacks from immigrating to their state by giving free blacks the option of a 500 entrance fee or sale into slavery. ","It quickly became clear that Christian benevolence toward a debased and oppressed race was not the driving force for the movement, but rather a deep-seeded White fear of the growing free black population. John Rix's terms of manumission were not unique. The Colored American, a New York City-based African American newspaper, reported seven other conditionally freed slaves that were to join these seventeen on the ship Saluda, bound for Africa. The Norfolk Harbor was a microcosm of a nationally growing trend at this time. From 1820-1830, 1430 blacks boarded ships such as the Saluda bound for Liberia. In 1832 alone, that number rose to 1037-247 of which were manumitted under the condition of emigration. In this Land of the Free, the free people of color across the country were being pressured to leave their native soil. The blacks of Middletown, Connecticut, found themselves asking, Why should we leave this land, so dearly bought by the blood, groans and tears of our fathers? Truly this is our home. ... here let us live and here let us die.

During the summer months, it was common for families of all races to travel throughout the country for vacation and receive such hospitalities as refreshments and other accommodations. The businesses of the area would often provide services to people regardless of color or previous condition of servitude. However, this norm was altered on July 13, 1895. Robert Holland ventured into a private establishment of James F. Angle in Baltimore and requested service, dinner in particular. He was denied twice on the grounds of his color. An attendant stated, We don't serve colored people in here. An important aspect of the article is that they place Mr. Holland in high regard. The article mentions that he was a good looking colored man...of fine intelligence. So the action to deny service was not because the man seemed dangerous, but due to the fact that this particular owner had negative feelings toward members of the opposite race. Helping his cause, Mr. Holland did not react harshly, but exited quietly and immediately confer with a lawyer. This helps to demonstrate that social-cultural developments are still hindered by a superiority attitude of a few. The aggressive nature is making life in the new south an extremely difficult transition","Mr. Holland's experience on that day is a microcosm of the stereotypical South.

However, it is ideal to assume that this could happen free from an occasional disturbance. Human emotions are entangled in Southern race relations, consisting of friendship and hatred. This mixture adds constant pressure on society. For the restaurant to deny service to Mr. Holland demonstrates how stress can lead to blatant acts of discrimination. Something so simple that we now take for granite was only privilege for some. Wilson noticed that the average black man at the time would have taken matters in his own hand. Thus, I believe that Wilson would commend Holland's decision not to take drastic measures but to seek a more formal complaint method.

","Branding runaways had long been a response used in the South. A 1696 South Carolina statute called for different levels of punishment for the repeated offense: First, forty lashes; Second, an R branded on the Right cheek; Third came forty more lashes and the loss of an ear; Fourth for a man was castration and for a woman was an R on the left cheek and the loss of the left ear; Fifth was death or the cord of one of the slave's legs to be cut off above the heel, the severing of the Achilles Tendon.

Hay gave only the name Manuel; either Manuel had no last name, or Hay felt that labeling him as a negro and a slave was sufficient. Hay described Manuel as broad shouldered and well formed, along with giving his height and other physical characteristics, his clothing, and his likely whereabouts (Northamberland, where he had bought Manuel in 1814). He also mentioned a mark on Manuel's head, given according to Hay, by a blow recently given him by one of his fellow servants. "," Hay's last sentence is interesting in two regards. One is that Hay went out of his way to state that the blow was given by a fellow servant. Whether or not this is true (it is entirely possible that Hay himself was responsible for the blow, as the physical abuse of slaves was prevalent), this wording was likely used to avoid a situation where another would find Manuel and take pity on him for being an abused slave. Secondly, he used the word servant to describe Manuel. Richmond (in comparison to other parts of the south) in the early 1800s was not an especially harsh environment for a slave or any African-American. Also, in other texts in the <em>Enquirer </em>this term is used for slave. Thus it is likely that some of the people were not in favor of slavery. By using the word servant as opposed to slave, Hay attempts to avoid bringing up the moral issue of slavery to those people whom he hopes will assist in returning his lost property."," Also interesting is that Hay posted this reward in the <em>Enquirer </em>multiple times (it shows up again on August 9, 12, 23, and 30). Fifty dollars was a substantial sum in 1815, one of the higher rewards offered for a runaway slave, and the fact that Hay would offer that type of reward, as well as continue to buy space in the newspaper to advertise this fact, shows how valuable a slave was for a white person.

These enslaved people were losing one of their most likely chances of gaining their freedom.","Enslaved people often sought manumission, but manumission in the 1830s in Norfolk, VA was tricky business. If freed from slavery, a person was forced to leave the state, in accordance with an 1806 VA state law. The only reprieve from this forced emigration was to get a special dispensation from the state legislature on account of a good record. Many petitions were made, but few granted, especially in the wake of the Nat Turner Rebellion. More often, manumission was made on the condition of emigration to Liberia, a state on the West Coast of Africa established for the purpose of harboring former slaves. For example, when Billy Pugh, a slave owned by the Overseers of the Poor of Norfolk County, was recommended for such a dispensation in December 1832, he was denied; This man had spent thirty years of his life raising several thousand dollars for the poor, and his only reward was the option to leave his home continent for Africa. Only three former slaves were permitted to stay in Virginia during the mid-1930s, all of whom were elderly and had provided significant service to the white population. The economy of Norfolk at this time was inextricably tied with slavery. Most enslaved men were considered semi-skilled or skilled workers, and the women filled scores of domestic positions. The shear numbers of slaves speak to how dependent upon slave labor the county was: In 1830, in a population of 9,814, slaves numbered 3,756, about 38 percent of the population.

Plantation owners frequently believed that their overseers were incompetent, complaining about their work even when the consequences were not so financially devastating. William Scarborough argues that planters did not appreciate the difficulty of the position's many complicated and delicate tasks, and they expected too much of the overseers. The work was obviously complex if planters declined to do it themselves, but in their defense, overseers were sometimes not the most hardworking or determined employees.

At least, this was true in Georgia in 1828. On May 19, 1828 the Argus, a newspaper in Savannah, printed an extract of a letter from a member of Congress, to the Editor. In this letter the politician explained that the mood in Washington was changing in favor of removal of the Native Americans currently living where they had been for a long time on some of the richest land in the heart of Georgia. The Congressman refers to our Indian difficulties and the perplexities of Indians within [Georgia's] boundaries. The words difficulties and perplexities make the Indians sound more like pesky flies than anything else, though they had been on that land far longer than the white Americans had been."," White Georgians did not just take issue with the fact that the Native Americans occupied some of the best cotton soil in the state. Though this fact bothered them, they were far more disconcerted by some of the implications of this occupation. The United States Government had, until this point, attempted to treat the Native Americans as a separate nation. (Whether or not the government actually believed that they were a separate nation is another question.) Because the government signed treaties with the Native Americans and recognized them as separate nations, they were raising the Native Americans up to an equal footing with white males, thus destroying the idea that only white males could enjoy the full rights and privileges offered by the government. By implication, therefore, African Americans should be freed and be allowed to vote, and women should likewise be allowed to cast a ballot. Native American presence in Georgia, therefore threatened the social system that the South rested on. Furthermore, Native American territories offered a convenient place for runaway slaves to hide, thus undermining white supremacy even more. "," The government further encouraged Georgian support of Native American removal by promising to distribute the land to white Georgian farmers by lottery. This guarantee ensured near universal support from white males in Georgia. The possibility of good cotton growing land combined with the reestablishment of white supremacy proved altogether too powerful. Public opinion in Georgia forced Georgia politicians to make Indian Removal a priority in their campaigns and tenures in office, as this letter from Congress clearly demonstrates. In the North, many were opposed to Jackson's proposal. The most vocal groups, religious groups, eventually evolved into abolitionist organizations. Angelina Grimke, before becoming a Quaker or an abolitionist, focused many of her early energies on opposing the Indian Removal Bill. This evolution, though unknown to Georgians in the late 1820s and 1830s, underscores the corollary between Indian rights and African American rights.

Next, as the men approached the house of A.C Gregory, a man, Crawford Ballew, approached them and refused to lower his guns. Mr. Massey fired and as the man?s wife cradled him in her arms, he died of gun wounds. The final verdict was that Ballew came to his death February 8, 1894 by gunshot wounds delivered by F. G. Massey and fired as a result of his defiance of the law officers."," Crawford Ballew, through his involvement in organized crime, met an early death as a result of the statewide support of Prohibition. As a state, South Carolina supported the regulation of liquor sales in response to the flux of alcoholism after the Civil War. According to Edward Ayers, liquor became an omnipresent beverage in the post-Reconstruction era as alcohol stores increased in number. Furthermore, the increase of liquor in society divided entire groups socially and politically. Developers pushed for an increased business pull for bars; they encouraged this as post-war economic growth. Also, whites, blacks, and women of both races found a large role in the prohibition movement as they rallied together to achieve the common goal of the prohibition of alcohol at bars and other similar stores. Janette Greenwood addresses the fact that, especially in the upper classes of both blacks and whites, race was discarded in order to push for social reform. It can be seen that Crawford Ballew?s demise can show how locally, Prohibition inspired an increase in organized crime in the Columbia area; however, across the south, the races and genders alike banded together to try and decrease the negative impact of liquor on their reparative society."],"display_date":"February 8, 1894","search_date":"1894-02-08","locations":[{"id":11641,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2973,"title":"Mistaken Identity\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-02-14","end_date":"1893-02-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mrs. M.A. Moore, widowed mother of seven grown children, was alone in her home one morning. As she went about her household business, a black man forced himself into her house and assaulted her. He then escaped, leaving Mrs. Moore in her house. The white population of Chattanooga was outraged that such an offense could be committed in broad daylight upon a well-respected white woman. So, they cast around for a likely suspect. They arrested Andy Blount on the suspicions of Mrs. Moore's neighbors; they believed he committed the assault. Mrs. Moore herself could not say for certain that Andy Blount was actually the man who came into her home that morning. ","Andy Blount protested to anyone who would listen that he was innocent, that they had arrested the wrong man. His vehemence led to an investigation that same day by white leaders in town. They came to the conclusion that Andy spoke the truth, that he was not the man responsible for the attack. However, the rest of the town did not heed the truth discovered by their leaders. At 1030 that same night the mob forced its way into the jail, actually breaking down the doors in their zeal to get at Andy Blount. Over the protests of the town leaders and jail officials, the mob took Andy Blount down to the bridge across the Tennessee River and there they hanged him. The town remained uncertain as to whether Andy Blount was actually guilty. ","This episode is illustrative of the sway of mob violence in the late 19th century. Indeed, according to Brundage in Lynching in the New South, it was an omnipresent aspect of southern life. All African American men at this time were subject to the whims of the mob, who could capture and kill virtually anyone they pleased, giving the merest of explanations and receiving nothing but the adulation of their fellow townspeople. Central to the conflict in this story is the protection of the white woman, Mrs. Moore. While the men of Chattanooga were not able to undo the harm caused her that morning, they surely could avenge it. It did not matter to Mrs. Moore's neighbors who they blamed, as long as the man they blamed was black. Here we see the phenomenon where black men and white women are linked both socially and sexually. White men at this time believed that white women were the central symbol of the family; as such they needed constant protection from the threat of rape by black men. The element that stands out here is that the leaders of the town took the time to investigate Andy Blount's claims of innocence; more importantly, they concluded that he was in fact innocent. However, their conclusion did little to sway Andy Blount's ultimate fate."],"display_date":"February 14, 1893","search_date":"1893-02-14","locations":[{"id":12056,"lat":35.2006308637,"lng":-85.2180291091,"zoom":9,"place":"HAMILTON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2976,"title":"Mr. Vermillion got between me and my freedom, so I killed him.","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-10-07","end_date":"1845-10-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The inhumane murder of James T. Vermillion by a runaway slave sparked a manhunt in Fairfax County.  The slave, owned by Mr. William Brawner of Prince William County, had not gotten very far when Mr. Vermillion caught him near his house, Pleasant Valley, in Fairfax County. Upon apprehending the runaway, Mr. Vermillion was going to take him to the magistrate for a proper conviction and return to his master, as in due process. The slave, having had a small taste of freedom, could not bear the thought of returning to slavery, prompting him to murder Mr. Vermillion in an attempt to escape yet again.  As this attempt was successful, the slave became both a runaway and a murderer. Whether the runaway was ever caught is unknown.  If he were, he undoubtedly would have been executed for his crimes.  Slaves had very little voice in the judicial system.  Even if the runaway killed Mr. Vermillion unintentionally the likelihood of his conviction and subsequent execution was very high. ","At the center of this narrative is the psychological damage that slavery had on slaves.  They were stripped down mentally and dehumanized in such a way, that freedom was their only real option to a harrowing real life.  This slave was not the only one who cracked under the constrictions and hardships of slavery, which worked to bolster white supremacy. In his book Soul by Soul, historian Walter Johnson makes the point that slaves were no more than commodities.  The process of dehumanization that took place to turn them into objects rather than people was both mentally and physically destructive.  In addition to this, the disciplining of slaves was rarely punishable in court, regardless of how severe.  Courts were even reluctant to chastise abusive slave owners as long as their behavior did not affect the community. Thus, slaves themselves could not charge their master with abuse; someone else in the community would have to bring the case to court. While this directly shows the how little the law represented it also gives insight into how harmful owners could be to their slaves without punishment.  These things combined provided the slaves with a lifestyle that not all could handle.

The guards shoved them into place while the executioner waited with anticipation for his cue to drop the platforms supporting the prisoners' feet.  The sheriff and jailer looked on with authoritative indifference; death for these two men was drawing ever closer.  Time seemed to move in slow motion as a hood and noose was carefully fitted over each man's head.  Finally, with an abrupt, grating creak, the men swung from the thick ropes as the platform doors dropped from beneath them.  Consciousness turned to darkness, emptiness, and then, it was all over."," Although hangings were a common sentence for serious crimes in the nineteenth century South, this particular scene that occurred in St. James Parish, Louisiana in September 1871 is quite unusual.  As the <em>New York Evangelist</em> reported, the two criminals, sheriff, executioner, jailer, and guards shared a surprising similarity: all six of these men were African Americans.  "," Reconstruction in the South is often characterized as a time of strict white repression and violence as whites tried to reckon with the freedom of slaves within their communities.  Especially in Louisiana where many parishes had large African American populations, violence committed by whites against free slaves was paramount.  "," However, this execution complicates the model of white supremacy that was believed to crush and control all African American actions.  This event in St. James Parish, Louisiana reveals an interesting instance that questions the role of African Americans in the maintenance of law and order in the South during Reconstruction.  The names of the African Americans, both the criminals and the law enforcement officials, were not mentioned.  This coupled with the brevity of the article reveals that there was little concern for such an occurrence.  There must have been some interest in this scene, though, or else it would not have even been printed, especially in a New York publication.  Even more interesting is that this event refutes the general view of Reconstruction characterized by brutal white law enforcement.  Whites were usually believed to exercise complete control over African Americans who broke the law.  But, this instance clearly refutes this notion.  That the sheriff, executioner, jailer, and guards were all African American is quite significant.  At least in St. James Parish, African Americans were afforded some autonomy in punishing criminals of their own race.  With a hierarchy that consisted entirely of African American officials, it can be concluded that not all Southern communities had solely white-dominated structures within the realm of law enforcement."," One explanation for this remarkable set-up of law officials can be found in Ted Tunnell's <em>Crucible for Reconstruction</em>.  New Orleans, the largest and most important city in Louisiana at this time, was only separated from St. James by one other parish.  This close proximity allowed ideas and practices to quickly reach neighboring localities.  Furthermore, between 1870 and 1872, with the reorganization of parish boundaries immediately outside the city, New Orleans' top officials were all Republicans.  This political control was greatly beneficial to African Americans.  Republicans were more sympathetic to African American needs than Democrats, and often provided them with the necessary help to secure positions of public office.  Whether or not these law enforcement officials were in office solely because of Republican political dominance in the area at this time, it is nonetheless noteworthy that these African American men were able to govern themselves in the face of harsh white backlash so soon after the war."],"display_date":"September 21, 1871","search_date":"1871-09-21","locations":[{"id":5681,"lat":30.0360710159,"lng":-90.7802066297,"zoom":10,"place":"ST JAMES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2986,"title":"All men are created equal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-12-11","end_date":"1893-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Religious faith and rhetoric dominated nearly every aspect of life for both blacks and whites following Reconstruction in the South. For them, God was an integral factor that offered life guidance in religious terms. Thus, if one failed to adhere to the principles upheld by their religion, they were condemned in religious and social regards. In 1893, Reverend W. Walker Jubb gave a sermon describing the good intentions yet incompetent act to initiate social equality programs in society. Prior to conversing about the subject of Rev. Jubb's sermons, some background is needed. Rev. Jubb of Fall River, Massachusetts preached to a congregation in Baltimore on Dec, 12, 1893. He began preaching in England, before coming to the states and advocating the differences in men are God's works which should not be overturned. In his sermon, he stated, Every man has his own allotted place in society...each class has an intimate relation to some other class, and all, according to the divine plan, are intended to work out the wise and beneficent purpose of the almighty.","This quote exemplifies the attitudes of conservative white southerners throughout the South during this time. For them, they believed that true religion did not allow the restructuring of society which was of divine order and that through a literal, fundamental interpretation of the Bible, allowed social institutions like slavery to exist and persist for centuries. Rev. Jubb, and members of his congregation, recognized that the religious ideas that have shaped their lives should be applied to political issues. Religion provides a measure of law and reform.","Many have recognized the influence that religion has had on political and social attitudes maintained throughout their institutions. Little reform to alleviate poverty and illiteracy among African-American communities were initiated in the south because of the public's contentment with inequality between whites and blacks. Rev. Jubb iterates, Education can give habits of mind, information, memory, power of attention. But can education give the instinctive eagle glance of genius. For many in the South, the answer to this would be an instantaneous, and probably, emphatic no. ","Moreover, this example of a cross between politics and religion, illustrates the importance of the church and religious leaders. The Church was able to serve social and political purposes. Individuals were unable to tackle these dilemmas single-handedly, therefore, the Church would convene to determine an appropriate solution. Morality suddenly fell within the grasps of the Church, and the individual thus lost the ability to rationalize by oneself. The Church had true power in the South, for whatever they ordained was subsequently followed. Charles Wilson made the statement, that even if the preachers were speaking about something meaningless or trivial, the people listened. The yielded mass support, with very little burden. Wilson also stated that they had the ability to become demigods if they fully supported the idea. The religious leaders were also important aspects following Reconstruction. When racial tensions were elevated, the public turned to these specific individuals to fight for their cause. Just like with Rev. Jubb, he defended the institutions presently at work within the South as being consistent with God's plans. He was a regional spokesman, however I believe that the ideals possessed by Rev. Jubb shows how the word of God can be deliberately altered to fit a political purpose. Christianity places extreme emphasis on equality and the fair treatment of one's fellow man. To be antagonistic towards blacks, disobeys the Word, thus is not Christian. A great writer at the time, William Faulkner, explicitly observes the South's attempt to alter religion during this time; I think that the trouble with Christianity is that we've never tried it yet. For if they did, would effortlessly determine that the rhetoric of people like Rev. Jubb as overtly wrong."],"display_date":"December 11, 1893","search_date":"1893-12-11","locations":[{"id":6098,"lat":39.3048367775,"lng":-76.6274800611,"zoom":11,"place":"BALTIMORE CITY, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2987,"title":"Convict Standoff\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-07-13","end_date":"1886-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was already hot. As the Superintendent lined the convicts up to march back to the Dade County coal mines for another day of exhausting labor, one group refused to move. At the head of a long line of men chained together, the leader of the rebellion spoke up to Colonel Tower. He said that he and all the rest of the men from his stockade refused to work another day in the heat at their awful work. He defied the Superintendent to shoot them down- they were prisoners for life anyway and nothing could be worse than what they were set to do. ","Faced with such a situation, Colonel Tower immediately informed Governor McDaniel. Alarmed at the prospect of a rebellion and a breakdown in the convict lease system, Governor McDaniel ordered out the military and held them ready to intervene if necessary. After some consideration, Colonel Tower decided that the best way to control this outburst of Senator Joe Brown?s leased convicts was to starve them out. Feeling comfortable with the measures taken to guard the compound of stockades and with the presence of military backup, Tower put his method into action. Forty-eight hours later, the convicts were still without food, and the residents of nearby Cole City were fearful of vengeful attack. Colonel Tower stood by the stockade with the inmates inside all night. He tried persuasion and threats, keeping a conversation going with the convicts. By daybreak, the rebels were hungry-and a few of them were hungrier than the rest. These few decided that they wanted to surrender, that they had had enough. Their fellow convicts immediately set upon them physically, upset with their actions. Despite this show of force on the part of the rebellion?s leaders, the sentiments of the few soon spread to the rest. By the end of that day, all save one of the rebels had surrendered the cause. ","This episode is indicative of the perils of the southern convict lease system in the post-war period. As historian Mark Carleton notes, this plentiful source of cheap labor was irresistible to southern state governments with prison management problems. Indeed all southern states used the system after the 1870s. This episode indicates the support politicians gave the system because the leases were a source of state revenue at the same time as they eliminated the drain on the state to house and feed criminals. As evidenced in the protests of these convicts in Dade County, the workers were poorly fed and cared-for and suffered physical abuse by those overseeing their work. Carleton makes the point that as convicted criminals, no one was concerned for their well-being. Thus, when conditions became unbearable, they had to speak up for themselves. Indeed, the terrible conditions described by the convicts here appear to historians today to been a very like those under slavery in the antebellum south.

These men, a minister, a school teacher, and school assistant, were reputable citizens of Rhea County, respected by their neighbors and friends in the colony. ","At this time, the Seventh-Day Adventists were a relatively new group. They focused their efforts on evangelizing through printed materials. The significance of this episode lies in how it illustrates the isolated character of the sect, the parameters of their interactions, and their conflicts with the established order and the community?s reactions. The Adventists in the south at this time focused their efforts in creating rural and self-sufficient communities in east Tennessee. One of the tenets of the Adventists is that they do not engage in evangelical efforts with members of other religious organizations. And, it was not uncommon for Adventists to run into trouble with the law because, unlike other common religious groups, they worshipped on Saturday and needed to pursue their work on Sunday. Despite the fact that the people of Rhea County most likely did not have much contact-social or religious- with the members of the Adventist community, the jailed men were treated well. The reason for clemency in the situation was probably related to the tie of Evangelical Christianity between the Adventists and those people inflicting judgment and punishment on them.

In the year of 1897 citizens of Mobile and their representative Thomas H. Smith presented a series of bills to the Alabama Senate regarding child labor reform. These bills were purported to have come from the Mobile Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. All were shot down in committees. Though these laws were for the state of Alabama, the child labor reformers saw New England as being somewhat complicit in opposing the bills. In 1901 the Alabama Child Labor Committee wrote an open appeal to the people and press of New England and received wide endorsement throughout the state, including a former governor and the representative John Craft from Mobile.","The Committee engaged New England in what they thought was an important barrier in the reform movement. They asked for the interest and aid in pushing for child labor laws in the year of 1901, telling New Englanders that the responsibility is also yours. The responsibility lay with New England because, as the committee stated, While the proportion of the children under twelve in our Northern and Southern mills is approximately the same, yet in the mills representing the Northern investments, the actual number of such children employed is twice as great as the number found in the mills controlled by Southern capital. The letter called a Massachusetts representative the aggressive and effective opposition to attempts at proposing child labor laws at the turn of the century as well as being influential in stating opposition to laws being presented in the Alabama Senate in 1897. The appeal was a call for an awakening of public interest in the matter but it also directly spoke to New Englanders whose capital was used to erect factories and mills in Alabama.","From the discourse that carried on between the two it appears that any progress on the issue was greatly impeded in 1901. The Northerners wrote back but mostly denied wrongdoing in the matter, citing only four of the forty mills in the state were northern owned. They also argued that they did support the cause for reform but mostly because they believed young children to not be intelligent enough to do good work. Indeed, it was not just the lack of support from the Northern owners and legislators that made progress difficult. Mobile did not have many mills or factories compared to the rest of Alabama so it is natural that other districts and cities in the state would not necessarily agree with their stance. As early as 1887, Alabama had already enacted child labor legislation and it had been supported by Senator Daniel Smith of Mobile. Fines of up to fifty dollars were issued for employers who violated certain laws. Children under eighteen could not work more than eight hours in mechanical or manufacturing jobs, children under fourteen could not work more than eight hours in a factory, and no child under the age of fifteen was allowed to work in mines. These were certainly important milestones in the reform movement; however, as the appeal written by the Alabama Child Labor Committee demonstrates it was not enough. Citizens of Mobile, Alabama were credited with primarily supporting these laws and most any legislation surrounding the issue, most notably in 1897. Because of the efforts of the citizens and representatives of Mobile though, Alabama was considered to be pioneering the cause of child labor reform."],"display_date":1897,"search_date":"1897-07-02","locations":[{"id":288,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3037,"title":"Dueling in the Bayou\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-05-21","end_date":"1881-05-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The shot sliced through the quiet, heavy bayou air at Willow ditch.

However, when Brewer's son dropped his gun and begged for mercy, Richburg allowed him to live. This confrontation in the form of a duel typifies the white Southern gentleman's way of dealing with a dispute. Moreover, Richburg's grace and mercy highlight a chivalrous, honorable deed that would have served to better his reputation. The culture of excessive masculinity in the South made duels a respected means of settling a conflict."," In the anonymously written <em>Practical Lessons Under the Code Duello</em>, published in 1874, there are valid instances when participation in duels is not only acceptable, but also necessary. The author goes on to state that if a man finds himself in some situation in which his authority or character is threatened, he must be...less than man if he were to submit in silence. The practice of dueling, the author believes, will never fade away, because it will be persisted in as long as a manly independence and a lofty personal pride in all that dignifies and ennobles the human character shall continue to exist. This bold statement clearly reveals the drive that pushed Richburg and Brewer to a duel. The code of honor that came with being a man was deeply branded within the mind of both Southerners."," Joseph Richburg and his neighbor Brewer had been friends in Madison Parish, Louisiana. They were both small planters and knew well the hardships of maintaining a self-sustaining farm. Both men would have relied on a barter system to attain goods and services. However, when Richburg owed Brewer some meat, <em>The National Police Gazette</em> cites that a dispute arose and that out of this tension grew a bad feeling which nothing but gore could satisfy. Richburg was unable to pay Brewer his debt, and so the men confronted one another in a duel. The two men met at Willow ditch, a lonely swamp between Pawpa Lake and Joe's bayou. Brewer brought his twenty-one year old son with him to the meeting, and Richburg brought his fifteen-year old son and his friend, Mr. Willis. Willis, acting as a mediator between the two men, persuaded the men to settle the matter with words and not bullets. Brewer's son, Willis, and Richburg converged to reach an agreement, but suddenly Brewer jumped out from behind a tree, shooting twice at Richburg. The scene described above then unfolded. "," The detailed description <em>The National Police Gazette</em> afforded this event is quite significant. It shows that duels were still a completely acceptable and sometimes necessary way to settle disputes between two men even in 1881.

After thanking the Committee and accepting the nomination, he then turned to the heart of his address: the sacred cause of his party and thus the sacred cause of the Union. The cause of his party was simple: to maintain the strength, unity, and integrity of the United States.  His scorn quickly turned to his fellow Congressmen from South Carolina who stood for nullification and the State Rights party, so called.  He claimed that these representatives would be mocked by the Founding Fathers from their state, who would not be eager to exchange the glories of the Star Spangled Banner for the mock heroics of the Palmetto Button.  The members of the States Rights Party of the Palmetto State, as South Carolina was lovingly called by its citizens, often placed their state's autonomy over that of the nation.  Jackson scornfully mocked their allegiance to their state in contrast with the Founders' allegiance to the Union.","Instead of standing steadfast for states rights, Jackson defended the noble institutions of our country and its rich history and constitution.  This, he claimed, is the debt he owed to the heritage of Georgia.  A few short years after the Nullification Crisis and 22 years before the Civil War, this Congressman from the Black Belt of Georgia left no doubt where he stood in the brooding sectional conflicts of the era. The Nullification Crisis and the call for states rights divided much of the South in the mid-1830s.  Under the leadership of President Andrew Jackson, Congress passed a law that President Jackson signed in 1832 creating protective tariffs over certain manufactured goods from Europe.  These tariffs pushed prices on manufactured goods from abroad above the rates of the same goods from the North, guaranteeing that the South would buy these products from the North rather than from Europe and thus help the economy of the North and of the nation.","South Carolina's bold stance against the federal tariffs placed upon certain manufactured goods also came at a time when Andrew Jackson was busy piecing together a national party.  In fact, the President called his party the Union Party as a symbolic gesture of national harmony and unison at a time of bubbling regional conflicts like the Nullification Crisis.  Unlike later fire eaters of the Deep South who stood for secession and absolute state rights in the face of Unionism, Jabez Jackson and other Union Party members sought to support Georgia by remaining united to the nation during times of sectional conflict.  Unionists like Jabez Jackson remained loyal to the Union rather than the debated rights of their own states in following conflicts such as the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act that seemed to threaten the integrity of the Union.  This Unionist sentiment remained largely prevalent until the late 1850s and early 1860s as war eventually broke out between the North and South."],"display_date":"July 7, 1835","search_date":"1835-07-07","locations":[{"id":1523,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3043,"title":"Blacks in South Carolina: Education and Christianization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-01-01","end_date":"1834-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Several members of South Carolina's Chester County delivered a petition to the state assembly in response to an 1834 act outlawing teaching reading to slaves. The citizens expressed outrage at the legislation, saying themselves and other citizens were prepared to disobey the law because slaves across Southern plantations already had the ability to read. They further expressed their opinion that the law would not be enforced in the state, except in cases of malicious and spiteful intent on some slaveholders' parts to punish men better than themselves. The petitioners denounced the legislation as ridiculous because slave owners would not be able to prevent their slaves from reading and learning to read, much in the same way that they couldn't prevent their slaves from learning to write, a skill many slaves taught themselves despite the watchful eyes of their owners.","    The petition continued to question the logic of the assembly in enacting such legislation and questioned their assumption that intelligence is more likely to produce insurrections among slaves than ignorance. They argued that general ignorance within the slave population is more of a threat because it would make slaves much more susceptible to the influences of any Nat Turner type character that might pass through the region. The petition ended with the scornful question does chivalrous South Carolina quail before gangs of cowardly Africans with a Bible in their hands?","    Despite the moral and Christian basis of this petition, this appeal and many others like it were continually rejected by the state legislators. According to historian Walter Edgar, South Carolina was known across the antebellum South as the most stringent state with regards to teaching blacks, both free and enslaved. However, many individual slave owners did break these laws, mostly in the hopes of educating their slaves about Christianity, knowing that the laws, though strict, were hardly enforced. In reality, it is estimated that around 5 percent of South Carolina's black population had some grasp of reading or writing. The state assembly insisted on enacting such laws because of leaders' beliefs that literate blacks, whether free or enslaved, presented a major threat to the system that the South relied upon so heavily. Additionally, the reference to Nat Turner's rebellion 3 years earlier in southern Virginia gives a sense of the uneasiness that rippled throughout the South as slave owners saw the delicate balance of the system their entire lifestyles depended upon. This episode is an excellent illustration of the different pressures felt by white Southerners throughout the antebellum period: recognizing slaves as human souls entitled to the same rights as whites versus slaves as commodities upholding the economic and cultural basis of Southern culture."],"display_date":1834,"search_date":"1834-07-02","locations":[{"id":11463,"lat":34.6920570183,"lng":-81.1595343266,"zoom":10,"place":"CHESTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3055,"title":"A Near Miss\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-11-25","end_date":"1892-11-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["George Dawson, a white man, was murdered in the town of Jasper, TN. Sheriff Rogers of Jasper had in his custody the three men believed to be responsible for the murder: Floyd Woodlee, John Turner, and Cal Collins. In fact, Woodlee was the only man who confessed to the act. Sheriff Rogers was keeping the men in the county jail until such time as their trial could take place. However, a mob surrounded the jailhouse, demanding that the men be released to them. They were determined to get the men and to take them away, but the mob refrained from actually breaking into the jail with force. ","Sheriff Rogers went outside and stood among the crowd. He spoke to them calmly, rationally persuading them that justice was sure to take its course in the case. He quieted the mob with his speech and they eventually began to go home. The mob dispersed of its own accord, satisfied as it was that the three men would be found guilty and hanged anyway, with very little trouble to them. But the heat was not off. J.T. Simpson, a citizen of Jasper prognosticated that the black men would very likely be lynched, even over the protests of the sheriff, next time the mob assembled, if they were not found guilty of George Dawson's murder. ","This 1892 narrative seems to be an anomaly in the history of lynching in the South. That the local law enforcement prevented lynching in this case is particularly significant given that in this same year, the number of lynchings of black men across the south reached its peak- 155 men killed over the course of this one year. The scenario of the mob surrounding the jail, demanding that the offenders be released to them was common- if the suspected offenders even made it into the jailhouse alive. Some who study the phenomenon of lynching postulate that the practice became common around the turn of the century in the South because of weak social institutions, weak civic institutions, and ineffective law enforcement. They say that all these factors failed to develop sufficiently and so failed to instill in their communities a respect for the rule of law. However, we see in this episode a law enforcement agent standing up to the mob effectively, something that probably occurred rarely. Indeed, in many accounts of lynchings, local officers of the law participated or even instigated the incidents. The incident is tempered through with the prediction that the men protected by Sheriff Rogers will surely be convicted anyway. So, their fate was delayed, rather than changed substantively."],"display_date":"November 25, 1892","search_date":"1892-11-25","locations":[{"id":12227,"lat":35.129342963,"lng":-85.6220026693,"zoom":10,"place":"MARION, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3060,"title":"The Indian Bills\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-06-12","end_date":"1830-06-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On June 12, 1830, the editor of the <em>Macon Telegraph</em> finally snapped.  Under massive pressure from their northern brethren on the Indian Bills, the Telegraph vehemently defended the territorial rights of the state of Georgia.  The newspaper viewed the Indian Bills as a simple issue of property rights, not one of Indian removal and southern supremacy.  According to their interpretation, Georgia had adequately paid the monetary demands of the Cherokees to the land that they once possessed and thus had every right to the land, regardless of who currently resided upon it. After explaining that Georgia sufficiently paid for the land and thus legally owned it, the <em>Macon Telegraph</em> turned its attention to the criticism coming from other states.  The <em>Telegraph</em> placed specific blame on the North, who hated to see the growth of the South and the consequent wane of its own preponderance in Congress.  Removing the Indians and ensuring Georgia's sovereignty would also expand its representative power in Congress, and, alternatively, decrease the congressional delegation of the North.  Because of this, the North, they believed, would do anything to slow the economic and physical expansion of the South.  ","Finally, the Telegraph asserted that Georgia did in fact have the concerns of the poor Indians in mind.   While the North had their own motives in mind rather than those of the Indians, Georgia did not wish to injure or harm the natives.  In fact, the editorial continued, Georgia had already paid a large sum for the land and had patiently awaited the exit of the Indians to lands west of the Mississippi.  This payment proved that the Cherokees had left by their own free choice rather than by coercion.  Furthermore, the Indian tribes were destined for healthy, fertile lands abound in game, leaving them infinitely better off than they were or ever could be in Georgia.","The Telegraph's disdain for the North only grew once Chief Justice John Marshall stepped into the controversy.  In Worcester v. Georgia, Chief Justice Marshall sided with Samuel Austin Worcester and Elizur Butler, two missionaries that wished to live with the Cherokees in Georgia territory.  The Indian Removal Acts had declared that these Cherokees must leave Georgia, but Worcester and Butler ignored the law and instead sued the state.  According to Marshall, the two missionaries and their Cherokee friends had every right to remain in Georgia. Marshall declared that the state of Georgia did not have the authority to regulate the intercourse between the citizens of its state and the members of the Cherokee Nation because the Indian territory remained in the hands of the Cherokees, not in the hands of the Georgia government as the <em>Telegraph</em> asserted.  Thus, the interactions between the Cherokee Nation and the American government must occur on the federal level, not the state level.  In this way, Georgia law was not binding to the Cherokee peoples because it interfered with American laws and treaties that were superior to state law.","Famously, Andrew Jackson strongly resisted Marshall's ruling.  Although Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune misquoted Jackson as saying that John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it, the inaccurate quote captured Jackson's attitude towards Marshall and the Cherokees.  Instead of executing the outcome of Worchester, Jackson continued his policy of Indian removal.  Although many of the Cherokees adopted the customs and habits of the white Georgians, Jackson insisted on their removal from the state.  In 1832, Jackson pressed the Cherokees to sign a treaty ceding their lands to the state of Georgia.  This treaty required that the Cherokees depart the state in two years.  This exodus finally began six years later, in 1838.  Through rain and snow, lacking sufficient food, clothing, and shelter, Jackson forced the Cherokees out of Georgia and towards Oklahoma.  The Trail of Tears was lined with thousands of dead Cherokees, forever removed from their Georgia home."],"display_date":"June 12, 1830","search_date":"1830-06-12","locations":[{"id":1547,"lat":32.8060034472,"lng":-83.7076277097,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3061,"title":"A New Reservation for Geronimo\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-07-07","end_date":"1889-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Chief Geronimo and his Apaches were forcibly removed from the western territories of the United States. The government relocated them to Mt. Vernon Barracks, Alabama, where they were forced to stay, cramped and confined, until the government decided what to do with them and where to send them next. As Native Americans, they were at the mercy of an unsympathetic government. ","Sometime thereafter, Captain John Bourke and Professor Painter of the Indian Rights Association located a tract of land in North Carolina of about 10,000 acres. Cherokees owned the land and 2,000 members of the Cherokee tribe lived on it, but they were willing to sell it to the Indian Rights Association. All that stood in the way of Geronimo and his tribe moving to their reservation was the approval of the Secretary of War. As anything would have been better than the living conditions in Alabama, the tribe was willing to move onto the land if the government would never allow it to return to the west. ","The Cherokees of Swain County managed to escape the forced removal of the eastern Indian tribes along the Trail of Tears in 1838, remaining where they were for the rest of the century. Only by avoiding the Trail of Tears were these Cherokees able to be a party to the land transaction that created a reservation for Geronimo?s Apache tribe. The government of the United States gradually recognized the Cherokee tribe in North Carolina in the period after 1870, enabling the transaction described in this episode. The roles the government and the Native American tribes play in this episode illustrate the long history of forced removal, resettlement, and upheaval characteristic of the interactions of the two groups.

They then ensured the spread of their ideas throughout the state by forming committees not only to take the group?s message to all parts of the state, but to form many other such groups as well.

In Alabama, a region of mostly cash-poor landowners and farmers, free silver seemed to be central to their future economic survival and prosperity. This episode highlights a trend in political alignment at this time. The Populist party and other men standing for free silver joined together in political alliances with traditional Republicans and Democrats in hopes of gaining more power. Indeed, the idea of free silver would get the greatest following in 1896, just a year after the formation of these clubs in Alabama, when the Democrats and Populists run Bryan for president on a free silver platform.

Though Mrs. Todd's passing initially appeared peaceful, the true happenings behind her death were revealed in the subsequent battle for ownership of Mrs. Todd's will. On July 31, 1897 Judge Burroughs resided over the court that was set to declare the official executer of Lucinda Todd's estate. The plaintiff, Mrs. Todd's daughter Josephine Sykes, had accused her brother, Mr. Charles H. Todd, by fraud and deceit....compelled his mother to convey to him by deeds, her entire estate worth ten thousand dollars. These are among the statements provided by the official court transcript when the case appeared to the Supreme Court of Appeals at Richmond. The court was given the task to divide the ten thousand dollar estate of Mrs. Todd, which included properties on Chapel Lane, Henry Street, and Bottimore Roads in Norfolk. What makes this case so intriguing however is the witness called on behalf of the plaintiff, Mrs. Sykes. Ms. Rachiel Crowell was close to Mrs. Todd in her final days. She had traveled to Norfolk to care for Mrs. Todd in the three weeks before she passed away. Ms. Rachiel Crowell was a black woman. Sitting on the court bench, Ms. Crowell answered questions regarding arguments between Charles Todd and Lucinda Todd. However what was important within the historical context was not the questions asked but rather the fact that a black woman was giving testimony against a white man. Prior to the end of the Civil War, blacks were unable to testify against whites. This often prevented enslaved blacks from defending themselves from unwarranted allegations and defending their family members. However the introduction of blacks to the civil and criminal cases allowed for black witnesses with valuable information to provide key witness information.In the case of Sykes vs. Todd, the testimony of Rachiel Crowell proved vital to the eventual conviction of Charles H. Todd. The altercation between Charles Todd and his mother Lucinda Todd was a key component of the courts decision to rule in Mrs. Sykes favor. While Crowell noted no physical abuse, she did take note of the vulgar language and aggressive manner in which Charles Todd approached his mother. The lasting implications of court cases such as Sykes vs. Todd include an increasingly equal legal system. Despite being too late to rectify the legal system in the pre war South, the post bellum era of legal equality as recognized under the fourteenth amendment provided the ability to improve the legal process.

Groesbeck of Ohio took the floor to argue in support of the recent capture of filibusterer, General William Walker. The speech served as a rebuttal to objections raised by Representative Keitt of South Carolina and Representative Stephens of Georgia.","Representatives Keitt and Stephens argued that the seizure of Walker and his company from Nicaragua was illegal. For these two Congressmen, the United States had violated jurisdiction zones established by the “law of 1818” during Walker’s seizure. In defense of the US forces that captured Walker, Representative Groesbeck focused his speech on the theme that “the sea is no sanctuary for crime.” He stated that since Walker and his company were American citizens, “the duty of this Government [was] to keep the peace with all other nations; and to break up combinations of its own citizens who have actually started upon expeditions to violate the peace of other nations.” This being said, Representative Groesbeck saw nothing wrong with the actions the US government took to apprehend Walker and his company: “He [the commander of the US Navy] had the right to cross the line of the marine league from our shore; he had the right to pursue this expedition, which was being <em>carried on</em> across the Gulf; and he had the right, with the consent of Nicaragua, to enter within her jurisdiction.” Simply put, General Walker and his company were rightfully and legally seized and detained by the US government.","William Walker was a man of many skills. Despite his medical education and experience in journalism, he is best remembered as a filibusterer. Walker’s first filibuster occurred in 1853 in Sonora, Mexico. The success of this filibuster prompted Walker to pursue Nicaragua a few years later.","The US Department of State acknowledges that filibustering-the militaristic actions of private citizens in a foreign land-was common in the years between the Mexican War and Civil War. Like Walker, most filibusterers were southern men hoping that the acquisition of new territory in Central America would ensure the expansion and survival of slavery. For this reason, as historian James McPherson wrote, “While much of the northern press condemned Walker as a pirate, southern newspapers praised him as engaged in a ‘noble cause.’” These conflicting perceptions of Walker’s actions created fierce tension in Washington.","When Walker and his company returned to Nicaragua in 1857, the US reacted. Historian Amy Greenberg wrote on this matter, “In May 1857 Walker surrendered to the commander of the United States navy after falling to the combined pressure of a Central American army, Great Britain, and threatened American shipping interest.” As evident in Rep. Groesbeck’s speech, there was a lot of controversy concerning Walker’s seizure. This contention between southerners and northerners in regards to the US actions was, in the end, pointless. In May 1858, a jury in New Orleans acquitted Walker of all charges for violating federal law."],"display_date":"January 11, 1858","search_date":"1858-01-11","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":1471,"tag":"Law/Government/Crime"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":3138,"title":"Texas slaves escape to Mexico\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1861-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While slavery did not exist as early in Texas as in other states such as Virginia and the Carolinas, it still played an important role in the economy and history of Texas. In fact, by the time of the Civil War, slavery was as strongly established in Texas, the newest slave state, as it was in the oldest slave state in the Union.  One slave, James Boyd, was 107 years old when he was interviewed in 1937 in Itasca, Texas. Boyd recalled his hardships of being a slave vividly. While he was not treated awfully, he acknowledged that slaves were treated very poorly and no rights whatsoever. In fact, two of his white owners once whipped two black women to death and never received any repercussions. Boyd realized that as a slave he had no rights or legitimacy under the law as they did not have a jail because, they didn't go to the trouble and expense of buildin' nigger jails. They just whipped us when they wanted to. Under these conditions, it is no wonder that most slaves desired freedom and some attempted to attain it."," Although slavery was such an institutional stronghold, many slaves continually tried to escape to nearby Mexico. Boyd notes that many Texan slaves did run off and try to go north... most in general 'round our part of the country, iffen a nigger want to run away, he'd light out for old Mexico. Crossing the Mexican-Texas border provided instant freedom for the slaves, and, therefore, many slaves would attempt escape for salvation. The Mexican government welcomed the runaways as a way to weaken the slave institution in Texas and potentially deter further territorial assaults by the United States. In fact, so many slaves attempted escape that the congress of the republic passed a law to promote capturing runaways. Promoting the capture of runaways was not only an attempt to stifle the Mexico runaway trend, but also an attempt to counter Mexico's encouragement. Despite the escape of at least three thousand slaves to Mexico by 1851, slavery as an institution was not threatened and it continued to be as important in Texas as it was to the rest of the United States."],"display_date":"1850 - 1861","search_date":"1856-01-01","locations":[{"id":12881,"lat":31.198494943,"lng":-95.2644293385,"zoom":8,"place":"HOUSTON, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3156,"title":"Chincoteague Prohibition\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-04-25","end_date":"1887-04-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On a late April weekend, Chincoteague residents gathered to celebrate the one year anniversary of their local option legislation, which barred their community from devastating alcohol consumption. Crowded in the town's Temperance Hall, because of rain outside, Friday night witnessed the much anticipated literary and musical entertainment. Despite the weather, spirits remained high and prominent male and female speakers generated great joy and thunderous applause. The night's favorite performance came in the form of nine year old Mamie, whose solos left the audience shackled by their laughter. The enthusiasm for the temperance celebration surprised even the event's organizers; as the anniversary resulted in complete success. Despite no boring pleas for money, donations covered all the expenses. Sunday, April 24, celebrated by all the local churches as Temperance Day, witnessed mass meetings at several churches, with gripping sermons that kept people in their pews long past when the doxology and benediction normally concluded services. "," Protestant churches in the South regarded the coming of a New, commercial South in the late nineteenth century as a threat to the Old South culture, so deeply rooted in Christianity. Thus, local organizations, often supported by churches, emerged to improve and perfect an increasingly chaotic society. Movements towards Prohibition grew out of these efforts, which more often than not had a strong female presence. Such a seemingly Puritanical movement generated resistance from those who felt the church had overstepped its bounds. Nonetheless, some isolated communities, like Chincoteague Island, were able to construct their own local temperance options, though areas with a larger lower class typically encountered more resistance. "," On a national level, a prohibition party could never succeed due to the differences between temperance supporters in the North and South. Most Northern prohibitionists were Republicans and former abolitionists, anathema to self-respecting Southern elites. Within Virginia, however, the Prohibition Party increased by 1887 to ten times its support in 1884. These followers tended to see bars and saloons as the basis for the wrongs of Southern culture, fostering lewdness and incessant swearing. Oftentimes, the prohibitionists would reach out to blacks for several reasons. First, they were seen as important swing voters who could counteract the usually dominant Democratic Party. Also, there existed religious and class based reasons that white professionals could associate and share the same values with their black counterparts. This sort of mutual respect appears in a statement made by a white, pro-temperance preacher, Let us make a great pile of all the unreasonable race prejudices, all political animosities, all sectional bitterness, all partisan hate.... The most successful nation-wide coalition in the nineteenth century; however, came with the creation of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the first group formed by solely women to act politically. Nevertheless, no state encompassing prohibition laws emerged until later on in the 1900's. Yet, by 1887, Chincoteague rejoiced in finding what they considered a more perfect society.

White criminals faced one set of rules while blacks faced another. Southern justice did not favor the death penalty unless the accused was black, in which case there was hardly a hesitation in its authorization. On March 15, 1884 in Jonesville, Virginia, Absalom Russell, a white man, was hanged for the murder of Ira Dean. The murder took place two years prior in July of 1882. After the initial guilty verdict, the case traveled through several courts where the guilty verdict was never overturned. Surprisingly, the newspaper points out that the execution of Russell was the first in Lee County since a man was hung for murdering a police officer sixty-seven years before. ","Justice meant different things to different races. Russell, due to his race, was able to have his case heard several times in appeals courts before he was finally hung. The difference in the treatment of blacks and whites in the court room is clear. From 1800-1860, whites were hung in Virginia only for the crime of murder. Half of the blacks that faced the death penalty during that same time period were murderers. Black rapists, burglars, and arsonists were all hung from 1800-1860 in Virginia. This is true in many of the southern states during the nineteenth century. Absalom Russell was able to have his case heard in several courts before finally being hung, while a black man guilty of stealing faced the noose immediately. ","After the Civil War, when treating blacks as property was no longer allowed, many southern states gave their all-white juries the ability to hand down capital punishments. Thus, these states were able to ensure that blacks faced the death penalty far more often than whites. Many blacks did not have the opportunity to face these juries due to the sudden rise in lynchings that took place during Reconstruction. Those responsible for the lynching hardly ever faced repercussions in the court room. The hanging of Absalom Russell was front page news in Wytheville.

William Williston Heartsill, a young 22 year old store clerk working in Marshall, Texas was one of the first to enlist. Before he had left for training, Heartsill began a diary to record all the moments and sentiments leading to the cause of his enlistment. He believed that it was imperative to fight and to the fight the best we can. Heartsill was a passionate man who did not think the war would last longer than 12 months, as their cause is just before high Heaven, that we will succeed in this great undertaking. Heartsill supported and followed actively the road to secession, acknowledging the election of Abraham Lincoln as the event that set the wheels in motion for the mass-meetings that convened in every county in the state to lead to the nearly unanimous vote for secession. "," After Lincoln was elected President, many Texans felt threatened regarding the future of slavery. Although slavery came comparatively late to Texas, by Lincoln's election one of every four Texas families owned slaves. The citizens quickly urged Governor Sam Houston to call a convention for Texas to decide the course of their future. As a man dedicated to the Union, Houston repeatedly forestalled the convention fearing the future results. However, the convention was finally legally organized by state legislature on January 28, 1861. The Texas Ordinance of Secession was drafted and voted upon with a favorable margin of 166 to 8 on February 1, 1861. Houston refused to accept the convention, sign the document, or take the oath of allegiance to the new government, thereby resigning as Governor. "," The Texas Ordinance declared that Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated States to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquillity and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. The decision to secede was fueled by several grievances including the sending of pamphlets and papers to stir insurrection throughout Texas, distribution of arms to slaves and the hindering the slave institution, and refusing to allow appropriations for protection against Indians.

Mr. Conrad delivered a speech on the subject to the meeting in which he discussed the ills inflicted on the southern states by the North such as disregard for run away slave laws and their disregard for the importance of slavery in the South in general. He stated that We assure our northern brethren that the institution against which this insane war is waged, is so interwoven into our social, domestic, and industrial life, that any sudden change would be destructive to us, and even to themselves. While Mr. Conrad made it clear that the citizens of Frederick Country would not tolerate actions against slavery, he also states that secession will only worsen the situation. Mr. Conrad pleads for reconsideration by South Carolina in this statement: Hence; we do not question the power of South Carolina, in virtue of her state sovereignty to absolve her citizens from their allegiance to the federal government. But we do utterly deny her right, under the circumstances that now exist; and as parties to the compact, deeply interested in its fulfillment, we deny that she alone has the right to decide whether adequate cause exists. Mr. Conrad also presented several solutions to the conflict with the North which he suggests giving to the Virginia General Assembly. We may obstruct the wheels of the Federal Government; or defend our Constitutional rights, in arms, under the flag of the Union; and even these extreme measures would be less fatal than a voluntary secession, he stated. He and the members of the meeting agreed that South Carolina did secede the North would be quick to put them back into place and repair their own actions against slavery. The remedy is with our Northern friends: we await their action with trust and confidence that they will now see and appreciate the evil, and apply the proper correctives. "," After the secession of South Carolina the rest of the southern states were left with a very critical decision: stay in the union and allow the north to force its anti-slavery ideals upon the entire south or join the rebellion, unsure of what would come next. The question facing the upper South was not simply whether to secede but whether to aid their brothers farther south. This looming decision divided the South into three sections. The first was made up of those southerners mostly in the lower South who believed in immediate secession, the idea being the quicker secession is accomplished by the south the stronger the statement. The next group was made up of southerners in the upper South with fewer slaves who wished to wait until a group effort by all the states was decided on before seceding. The last group was made up of those who sided with the North and were against secession completely, this seeming to be the group that Mr. Conrad would side with as he confirmed by stating: We have no faith whatever in the success of any southern confederacy of these States, except merely for the temporary object of mutual defense. South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas, being of the immediate secession group, all joined the rebellion with majority votes in their conventions soon after the election of President Abraham Lincoln. About the election of President Lincoln Mr. Conrad stated The election of Mr. Lincoln is recent, was unexpected, fortuitous, and if not already regretted by his supporters, will, in all probability, prove the destruction of his party. Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina also joined the cause with a majority but only after President Lincoln called for a move on South Carolina, being more of the second group. In Virginia the decision on secession was especially important because Virginians were so close to the North and the South at the same time. As Edward Ayers confirmed, More than half of the war's battles were waged with in Virginia's borders, making their decision especially critical. While Virginia did decide to ultimately secede the vote was deeply divided. The slaveholders, mainly living in the east, wanted to secede while the non slave holders in the west wanted to remain in the union. This division was one of the main causes for the creation of the separate Union state of West Virginia in 1863."],"display_date":"December 14, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-14","locations":[{"id":13839,"lat":39.2038567799,"lng":-78.2606208397,"zoom":9,"place":"FREDERICK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3181,"title":"Another Negro Boy Caught Stealing\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-04-17","end_date":"1884-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Will Crockett, a thirteen year old boy became the ninth negro boy in a month to be caught stealing and sent to jail in April of 1884, in Wytheville.

Interjecting their own opinion, the Wytheville Dispatch hoped that his would be a lesson to local merchants to keep ?these little rascals? out of the town?s stores. ","By the end of the Civil War, most blacks expected a swift transition from enslavement to freedom. This did not happen. Reconstruction was arguably the most violent time between races in the South. Whites had for centuries treated blacks as property, and they were forced to free their slaves under the watchful eye of northern officers. ","Two major problems arose during Reconstruction that led to episodes like that of Will Crockett. By 1867, two years after the end of the war, the government in Washington granted suffrage to all freedmen. Three years later the fifteenth amendment passed, declaring that no state could deprive a citizen, regardless of race, of the vote. Gaining a political voice was the ultimate sign of freedom, and one that white southerners were strongly against. White southerners took the law into their own hands, using groups like the Ku Klux Klan to scare blacks away from the polls. By 1877, the Jim Crow laws had been implemented throughout the South ensuring the separation of races. Cleary the Dispatch is in strong favor of Jim Crow.","Alarmingly, Will Crockett was the ninth black boy to be caught stealing in a month in Wytheville. The second problem to arise during Reconstruction was the lack of educational opportunities for African American youths. The Freedmen?s Bureau attempted and was somewhat successful in setting up some schools in the South, but they clearly could not reach the entire South. Often, angry whites along with Ku Klux members would destroy black schools or intimidate the Yankee teachers into leaving. In more rural parts of the South, including Appalachia, many black children were forced to work in order to help the family. They could not attend school. A lack of education among black and white children may have contributed to a higher crime rate. Jim Crow made parts of the South uninhabitable to some blacks and forced others, such as Will Crockett, to test its limits.

There were many factors that led fathers, brothers, and sons, to become soldiers, and just as many reasons to evade the conscription laws.

Although many Texans did fight in the war, the conscription policy proved detrimental to morale since many were forced to fight and others viewed the law as unconstitutional. "," While there were many men fighting, there were still a great number that evaded the war by leaving the country or paying for a substitute to take his place. In fact, conscription tended to force the older men who were settled and needed to stay ar home into finding a substitute.

The legislature furiously answered on November 19, 1815, with a condemning resolution absolutely denying the right of the courts to rule the acts of the state legislature invalid.  The resolution did not specifically mention which acts the Superior Court ruled unconstitutional simply because the Georgia House had no concern for the specific policy ramifications of the actions of the Court.  Instead, the House sought to absolutely deny the right of the Court to rule any act that the Legislature passed unconstitutional, regardless of the contents of the laws in question.","According to the Legislature, the Court had begun usurping their power the moment that it assembled without direction of the Legislature.  During this session, the Court ruled against a wide array of local judges and legislative acts.  The Georgia House of Representatives declared in its resolution that each of these rulings were void because the Superior Court did not have the standing to try any of the cases. ","The resolution continued, declaring that the actions of the judiciary even usurped the power of the citizens of Georgia.  They claimed that only the legislature has the ability to represent the people because it is the only branch directly elected by the people.  In contrast, the unelected judicial branch simply represented a potentially totalitarian body that could not be controlled through the democratic process.  Because of their institutional inability to check the judicial branch, the Georgia House of Representatives had no choice but to condemn the Court publicly.","With a vote of 40 to 35, the Georgia House of Representatives rejected the Superior Court's power to rule on the constitutionality of the actions of the Legislature and declared that the Georgia Superior Court should never again wrest the power of the good citizens of this state through such rulings.  Finally, and most condemningly, the Georgia House recommended a candid examination of the United States Constitution as well as the Georgia Constitution for a better understanding of the court's position in relation to the legislative branch of government.  At the time, no precedent existed regarding whether the state judiciary should simply focus solely on its own state constitution or on the Constitution of the United States as well.  The Georgia House of Representatives concluded that the Georgia Superior Court should re-evaluate both.","The ongoing struggle for power between the judicial, legislative, and executive branches winds its way in and out of American history.  Few powers in the United States Constitution are as vague as that of judicial review, or the power of the judiciary to review the acts of the legislature and executive and rule on their constitutionality.  Even the Founders were split.  While James Madison, the author of the Constitution, favored judicial review, Thomas Jefferson feared it.  ","Georgia's Superior Court, however, did not act entirely out of historical context.  Other state courts had declared their power of judicial review in the twenty eight years of governance under the United States Constitution.  <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>, which was ruled 12 years before this specific controversy in Georgia, declared that the United States Supreme Court had the power of judicial review over the federal government.  On the state level, the Georgia Constitution's language in Article III, Section One seems to mirror that of the federal constitution, and, according to Chief Justice John Marshall, this type of constitutional language allows for the courts to rule acts of the other two branches of government unconstitutional.  However, Chief Justice Marshall's ruling in <em>Marbury</em> did not put the controversy of judicial review to rest.  Many lawyers at the state and federal level did not believe that Marbury settled the judicial review controversy once and for all.

When she reached his house and explained why she had come, Thomas allegedly grabbed Clark and drew her to him. Clark, however, was able to escape and ran home to tell her mother. Thomas was arrested the following day. As night approached on Tuesday, the crowd outside the jail grew larger. Several hundred had gathered by 10 o'clock. The mob began to demand that Thomas be handed over. The mayor pleaded with the crowd to let Thomas undergo trial yelling If the man is not convicted I will lead you in person to hang him. The crowd was insatiable, however, and replied Give us the nigger He won't be here tomorrow The crowd rushed the jail and upon finding Johnson dragged him outside. Johnson tried to escape, but the crowd shot him, dragged him to the corner of King and Fairfax Street, stripped him of his clothes, and hanged him. The mob proceeded to fire shots into his body. After confirming that he was dead, the throng of people dispersed. The response to the lynching was mixed, and many speculated about why it occurred. Some argued that a protest Monday night by many African Americans, arguing that Thomas should not be lynched, may have contributed to the events that following Tuesday. What is clear, however, is that the actions of Tuesday, August 8, 1899 were not unusual."," The lynching of African Americans had become commonplace in the late nineteenth century. Before the Civil war white men were generally the victims of lynching. In the postbellum period, however, lynching and race were strongly related. In the South and border states 85 percent of victims were black. There are several possible explanations. William Brundage argues that southern institutions failed to provide adequate controls to stifle mob violence. Weak educational, religious, and civic institutions, poverty and ineffective law enforcement agencies failed to instill sufficient respect for the rule of law or human dignity. Furthermore, lynching provided a socially accepted channel for aggression in the South."," Although it was an accepted practice, lynching did face opposition from its beginnings. By the time Thomas was lynched in 1893, a number of whites had emerged who were concerned about its implications for the state. Despite these concerns, blacks had very few avenues to address violence towards them. The opposition that was led by blacks tended to be uncoordinated and lacked any concrete program for reform. For rural blacks the only available recourse was usually spontaneous and disorganized protests. More militant methods risked severe sanctions. Lynching continued well into the 20th century: African American Michael Donald was lynched in Mobile Alabama in 1981.

This was the status of the Augusta jail one day after the attempted raid upon its confines by an angry mob of white men. The mob of 500 armed men had been intent on having their justice with William Robinson, an African American man accused of robbing and attempting to assault a white woman, Mrs. Minnie Walker. Hot with anger, the party of men assembled and then proceeded to storm the local jail last night at about one in the morning. The twenty policemen assigned to guard the jail refused the request for Robinson and defended the jail to the best of their ability. While they were successful in barring entry of the mob and the capture of Robinson, two of the police's corps fell in battle with the mob. As a precaution for possible repeat raids, the jail requested additional backup forces for the next few days and nights as courts tried Robinson. Ironically, several of the soldiers posted to guard the prison were apart of the lynching mob the previous night. In an effort to protect Robinson until proven guilty, the court system agreed to speed up the trial's start date. The grand jury assured the city populace that they would indict Robinson; however, the specific fate of the man was not as concrete. Normally, the courts reserved the death penalty for those who actually committed the act, but there was the slim possibility that that they might sentence Robinson to the death penalty based solely on intent. ","The fate of William Robinson is unknown. Did he receive a fair trial? Was he sentenced to death? Were the efforts of an impassioned lynch mob more successful a few days later when the soldiers returned to their normal stations? The Atlanta Constitution failed to provide a follow-up story in the weeks to come. However, one can hazard a guess as to the likely gruesome outcome of Robinson. If mobs did not seize him while he was in jail awaiting trial, there were plenty of opportunities to arrest the man and enact vigilante justice later on. In Georgia, lynching reached horrific heights from 1891-1899. Though Governor Candler agreed to send troops to protect Robinson and the guards of the jail in 1898, he cannot boast a consistent record, for just a year later, he failed to prevent the torrent of brutal lynchings which spread throughout Georgia. ","In the South, lynching was one of the terrorist tactics used to control and threaten African-Americans. In the Reconstruction Era South, lynching of African Americans was used, especially by the Ku Klux Klan, as a tool for reversing the social changes and enfranchisement of African Americans under Federal occupation. This type of racially-motivated lynching continued in the Jim Crow Era as a means of enforcing subservience and preventing economic competition. Although lynchings did occur prior to 1880, radical racism and mob violence peaked during the 1890's in a surge of terrorism that did not dissipate until well into the twentieth-century. Racism and popular mythology of the time created the image of the hyper-sexualized African American male who would rape pure and noble white women like Minnie Walker; however, historians find that in 80% of the cases, there were no sexual charges alleged, let alone proven. Lynch mobs assembled for petty offenses too. Stealing a cow, arguing with a white man, or attempting to register to vote were reason enough for many African Americans to hang in the eyes of the white South. The absolute inhumanity of lynch mobs was not condoned by every single individual in the South, but its pervasiveness throughout the region is telling of the fierce supremacist mentality which reached its height in Georgia in the 1890's.","<em>~ Colleen Elizabeth Laurence</em>"],"display_date":"November 3, 1898","search_date":"1898-11-03","locations":[{"id":2194,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3229,"title":"Seizure of Martin Joson&#39;s Property\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-05-17","end_date":"1877-05-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the years following the Civil War many Southerners faced economic hardships, and Martin Joson was no exception. He was an African American who had been able to amass some property in Natchitoches Parish, and had even been able to make some improvements to his property. Joson's prosperity, however, did not last. He must have developed a large debt to a man named Walo Johnson to warrant the writ of Fi Fa that was issued against him to the Sheriff of Natchitones on May 17, 1877. The writ allowed the sheriff to seize Joson's property, including an improved lot on 2nd Street and a store on Grant Street in the City of Natchitones. The writ allowed him three days to come up with the judgment of the writ along with the costs owed before his property would be sold.","Fi Fa is an abbreviation for Fieri facias a Latin term meaning that you cause to be done.

The postbellum period was not without economic hardships for previously freedmen, as shown by Joson's economic misfortune, and the previously free African Americans felt threatened by the mass of newly freed former slaves just as white southerners did.

An agent roused Culberth from his work to pick up a package which he eventually discovered was full of alcohol Believing it to be the gift of some kind person, Culberth and his friends immediately set forth consuming the package's contents and were in a bawdy state when they finally discovered that their secret supplier was none other than Culbreth's boss. Of course, Culbreth's boss did not intend for the alcohol to reach Culbreth and his comrades. Rather, the boss had a dependency on whisky which he could only assuage by sneaking alcohol into the dry county through the mail. Alas, Culbreth's boss had to endure a few days without his precious whiskey, but he certainly learned his lesson. Upon discovering Culbreth and his friends, The boss took one long sad look at them, and then remarked, 'Well, the next time I want any whisky you may bet your last dollar I will order it in my own name.'  ","As both Jake Culbreth and his boss discovered, there were ways around the local temperance restrictions. Whether through mail, secretive moonshine operations, or go-betweens, individuals founds avenues to satisfy their habit when the drums of temperance began to beat. Though many Americans subscribed to the temperance movement and its ideals, there were plenty of others like Culbreth's boss who simply could not resist. The degree to which they kept this habit secret varied. For example, Culbreth's boss was admittedly ashamed of his indulgence and did not want his neighbors to know, hence, the secret packages. However, there were many other individuals who didn't care at all and flagrantly disobeyed local dictates and societal pressure. An organized temperance movement began in Georgia in the late 1820's and, after early difficulties, flourished through the 1930's. ","Georgia's temperance movement began much as it did in other parts of the United States. Recruiting many in its ranks from the evangelical Protestant population, the temperance movement condemned alcoholic beverages as harmful or even sinful for the individual and society as a whole. In their minds, drinking destroyed families and reputations and fostered poverty, disorder, and crime. Perhaps the mistake between Jake Culbreth and his boss was dismissed by both parties; however, this cannot be said to be the case for all African Americans during the temperance movement. ","After the Civil War, the temperance movement had an odd relationship with racism. White Georgians resisted any mixing of the races in temperance organizations but were eager to make it illegal for emancipated African Americans to drink. The desire to further disenfranchise African Americans as well as the fear of possible criminal activity from them drove white Georgians' desire to impose restrictions. Originally, Georgia's temperance reformers stressed voluntary participation in prohibition, but they later expanded their campaign platform to change the laws to restrict and abolish the sale of alcoholic beverages. This mandatory statewide prohibition in Georgia lasted from 1908 until 1935, a period which substantially extended beyond the national prohibition (1920-1933) in both its starting date and end.

Christmas was to be celebrated in a joyful, yet quiet manner, not with the use of small explosives, which are noisy and might interfere with private celebrations. On the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth of December, a serenade of horns and pop-crackers outside their doors interrupted the holiday jubilations of those City Council members who voted in favor of the ordinance. The boys of the city celebrated Christmas as usual with the sharp bang of the small pop-crackers and the deeper boom of a cannon-cracker, but the spirit of the noise had changed from religious merriment to civic disobedience.","  The council members accepted the protests in good spirits at first and all in the city enjoyed the Christmas festivities. The police were wholly unable to determine the source of the exploded firecrackers, though they tried faithfully. The boys' actions, though regrettable, seemed simply to be an example of youthful disobedience until the following week when the investigations of police misconduct began. Staunton's city council formed a special committee to investigate the negligence and efficiency of the police force in fulfilling its sworn duty. The actions of the boys, though likely simply a desire for youthful activity, demonstrated a disrespect for the law which the community could not tolerate. ","  The noise and dazzle of fireworks has been a traditional way for Southerners to celebrate Christmas since the French in Louisiana first fired their rifles and set off firecrackers in honor of the holiday. The boys of Staunton reminded all of their rights as Southerners with this bold display, seeking to assert that tradition dominated over the law. Though not an egregious example of law breaking, the City Council chose to elevate the incident with its investigation of the conduct of the police force. In the periods of Reconstruction following the Civil War, it was necessary for city officials to assert the authority of the law. Many of the rules governing past Southern behavior had changed, especially regarding slavery; consequently, tradition was no longer an adequate justification for disobedience.

The colored silk line in the genuine are not in the counterfeit. ","The business of counterfeit money was quite a large one throughout the mid nineteenth century according to Johnson. By the time the Civil War had begun 80 percent of the money in circulation in the United States was counterfeit. Because there were so many versions of counterfeit dollars and coins shop keepers and business owners had no choice but to accept the false money because they were not likely to find much real money. During his tenure from 1869 to 1874 as Chief of the Secret Service, Hiram C. Whitley reported (10 percent sample) that 32 people had been caught in the business of counterfeit money in the South in comparison to the 100 in the Mid-Atlantic and seven in New England. After reconstruction the South was left with unused mints that they had relied on during the civil war for the creation of their monetary system. These mints and other newly created ones helped in the increase of counterfeit money throughout the South. Counterfeiting notes, as the article talked about, was much harder than producing coins. It required a large sum of money, dedicated employees and a large group of consumers. Producing coinage was much easier, only requiring an alloy to be poured into a mold and plated. ","The newspaper makes a specific point of telling its readers about the difficulties in picking this counterfeit out. The author stated It is remarkably well executed, and calculated to deceive. The newspaper ran articles through out its existence reporting the creation of new counterfeits. They knew that while the money would still passed through private hands, the banks would be less likely to fall for the trick, causing the readers to lose their money.

The guards allowed the inmates razors and stood outside the cells as the prisoners shaved. According to the article, Hawkins turned to the guard, said, Good-bye, and promptly slit his throat. Being near at hand, we ran to see him. He presented a shocking aspect. The blood was spouting rapidly from the horrid gash in his neck, and the bed on which he lay near his head and neck was all saturated with the purple current. A doctor soon arrived and determined that Hawkins had missed the primary artery and would survive.","The same edition of this paper describes Hawkins' escape from his jail in Harrisonburg, Virginia. For much of the time before his recapture, Hawkins was five miles from the jail. He then went to his family in Dayton, where he hid beneath the bed and passed his time knitting socks, which his wife subsequently sold to neighbors. After some time he gathered his family, stole what was believed to be three or four horses, and set out for the west. Authorities recaptured him on the road and sent him back to jail, where he subsequently attempted suicide. ","Hawkins' public escape and recapture brought the prison system into the public eye. One cannot be sure if it was the condition of the prison that provoked him to attempt suicide, or whether he was just a desperate. However, life was difficult for a convict in a penitentiary in Virginia. Labor occupied most of a prisoner's time. Much more so than today, states used penitentiaries to make a profit. In fact, some men bought or leased prisons and then worked their prisoners to death (The lessees worked them quite literally to death in many cases; the mortality rate ranged from 17-40 percent). Leasing became popular in the South, after the war especially, when states could not afford to keep up the prisons. ","As Edward Ayers states in <em>Vengeance and Justice: Crime and Punishment in the 19th-Century American South</em>, the system of slavery in the ante-bellum South kept much of the lower class under control. Because of southern ideals of honor, it seems that there would be less of a need of a prison system; nonetheless, the South built as many prisons as the North (with the exception of Florida and the Carolinas). The South spent much of the time preceding the war to debate whether or not the penitentiary was in fact in line with the American ideals of liberty. Ironically, unlike the North, their lowest class was already imprisoned within society.",">In 1796, Virginia and Pennsylvania, where the penitentiary started, were the only states that attempted to reduce deaths by capital punishment. At that time, the only offense that warranted it was murder. Punishment varied in every region in the country: the penitentiary system in the West was very different. On November 14th, 1856, James R. Whitehead wrote a letter from the Kansas Territory to his cousin Langhan Scruggs, who lived in the Valley of Virginia. In an earlier letter (September 11th), he had described to great detail the sort of men that were settled in the West; northern and southern relations were mirrored in Kansas. The young men were belligerent and chivalrous, always ready to fight. In Whitehead's mind, the West needed new kinds of settlers. In the letter on November 14th, Whitehead wrote about crime and punishment in the territory. More than three hundred Bills of Indictment had been filed, twenty of which were manslaughter. The punishment was far from death; the men found guilty served five years of confinement and hard labor."],"display_date":"February 29, 1848","search_date":"1848-02-29","locations":[{"id":14232,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3288,"title":"A 5,000 Debt","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-04-15","end_date":"1834-04-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Charles L. Mathews of Greenwood Plantation had one year to pay back half of a 5,000 loan to George Birch of New Orleans. Why Mathews needed the money was unknown. How he was going to pay 2,500 back in one year was also a mystery. The agreement was signed, sealed, and delivered in the presence of two witnesses, George J. S. Walker and J. W. Elliot with no other comment. The Mathews family owned four plantations in West Feliciana, Lafourche, and Rapides parishes in Louisiana. They were no doubt wealthy, owning so much property in three different parishes, but they were by no means close to the trade center of Louisiana: New Orleans. Sugar and cotton planters shipped their goods down river into the rich city to the merchant wholesalers. These New Orleans merchants would in turn sell them to ship captains who would carry them to other parts of the United States and Europe. A plantation's vitality depended heavily on the cultivation of sugar or cotton. Planters were at the mercy of the fluctuations in the market and the fickle shifts of supply and demand.","Most American emigrants to Louisiana, like the Mathews family, came to make a fortune in sugar or cotton or hoped one day to be able to finance such an enterprise, starting out as small farmers. Those beginning out as small farmers hoped to make a profit in their first few seasons, acquire slaves, slowly build up a plantation, and achieve the high social status connected to it. Instead, many acquired massive debt. At least 66 to 75 percent of goods sold to planters in Louisiana were sold on credit. The necessity for Charles Matthew's loan was unknown, but he apparently felt confidant enough that he could repay George Birch within 12 months. He, unlike many planters who acquired loans to buy land and start their enterprise, already had a profitable plantation established. Perhaps the cholera epidemic of the previous year hit the Mathews' plantations hard; perhaps Charles anticipated a good crop and wanted to buy more hands to make the most of it. His reasons were unknown, but his need for funds was not, nor was this need particularly unusual for a farmer in Louisiana in the mid-1830s."],"display_date":"April 15, 1834","search_date":"1834-04-15","locations":[{"id":5780,"lat":31.0257853028,"lng":-91.6912544354,"zoom":9,"place":"WEST FELICIANA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3289,"title":"WANTED \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-07-31","end_date":"1875-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A wanted ad for a man named Jeff Williams appeared in The Daily Mississippi Pilot?s reward section. Williams was a convict who escaped while under lease to a family and working on the Noxubee river levee. The Governor of Mississippi offered 50 dollars for someone to arrest and take Williams to the state penitentiary. The description of the man at large was listed. Along with including his height and age, the paper made a special note that Williams was a mulatto with black hair and was pitted by smallpox. "," Most wanted ads during this time were for missing black convicts. The idea of leasing out convicts came about in the South in the years following the Civil War. Leasing convicts meant that black convicts would have to work the land of a public area or be bound to a white plantation owner who, in exchange for the labor, would pay for the convict?s fines. This idea of leasing convicts became more widespread after the war and gave ex-slave owners a new form of cheap labor to make up for the labor force they lost after the emancipation. Convict leasing also provided the states with a readily available supply of laborers to help build up the railways along with other domestic necessities. "," The high number of black convicts was largely the result of the unfair court systems in the South. Most officers, judges, and even the jurors were predominately white and showed little mercy to black offenders. Yet, most blacks tried to turn to other options to avoid dealing with the court systems of the South. The Freedman?s Bureau was a popular alternative to the unjust systems because in normal trials, blacks did not receive a fair trial. The Freedman?s Bureau was called upon by black defendants to attempt to give them a hearing to try to settle their various disputes with other blacks and, in some cases, disputes with whites. "," In addition to unfair trials, southern laws concerning blacks were also extremely harsh, making it easier to get blacks in prisons to be leased out. Arson became a capital offense, stealing from someone?s home caused the offender to go to prison for life, and the theft of livestock became grand larceny. This increase in severity in the punishments in the south gave railroad, lumber, and mining companies a great opportunity to have access to this type of free labor. The large proportion of the convicts were blacks who had been charged for relatively trivial crimes.

Smith of Alexandria, Louisiana, with the intention to kill her. On the same day as the attack, the slave, whose name was not given, was convicted and sentenced to be hanged. By the next day he was dead. ","The relationship between slave and owner teetered on a precarious balance. On one hand slaveholders reveled in their slaves' dependence and love for them. According to Raymond and Alice Bauer, masters saw their slaves' smiling, bowing, and scraping as evidence of their happiness, docility, and acceptance as part of an inferior race. On the other hand, slaves frustrated their masters with feigned illness and pregnancy, broken tools, and running away for short stints to avoid work. This laziness was punished through whippings and other humiliating practices. Slaves resisted day to day in these subtle ways, confusing and provoking their masters. ","Physical slave violence and insurrection were much rarer than these more passive forms of resistance. Attacks like the one against Mrs. Smith did not occur frequently. Melvin Ely writes that the wake of Nat Turner's rebellion in Virginia in 1831 revealed not a militarized culture of bold, well-armed, dead-eye marksmen born on horseback, but rather a land of frightened, often befuddled white men milling around in ragtag militia musters. They were unprepared for a slave revolt, and were often without the proper supplies to put down an attack should it happen. They feared and prepared for it the way a group of people fear and prepare for a natural disaster, like a volcano which has lain dormant for a hundred years. They had a plan but it was not an immediate concern, just uneasiness lurking in the back of their minds.","Attacks like the one that occurred on that hot July day showed up in newspapers occasionally. At moments like that, deep seeded fears bubbled briefly to the surface and made slaveowners, but also whites everywhere, question just how obedient and satisfied slaves were with their place in American society. While slave attacks brought to light the dangers involved in the peculiar institution, these attacks did not make most whites question whether slavery was morally right or not.

In 1835, James Foreman, an Indian, was sued for murder and he was probably guilty. But, he was acquitted because the law of the state was not constitutional due to the Worcester V. Georgia case in which the United States Supreme Court held that Cherokee Native Americans were entitled to federal protection from the actions of state governments. However, the state supreme court reversed the previous decision, explaining that no treaty was powerful enough to confiscate the sovereignty of a state (the right of the states was already something significant in the South). Judge John Carton, of the Tennessee Supreme Court even used racists and paternalists arguments while he spoke about that case. The case finally reached the national Supreme Court but it was not held because of the new removal treaty signed by the Cherokee.","The relations between native American people and other were therefore quite tense and cohabitation was difficult everywhere in the United States an especially in Tennessee where land was really shared with Indians. However, Tennesseans had to interact with Indians: for trade, in trials, at war, in order to civilize them... This is especially true because there were different tribes near Tennesseans, all with their different traditions. Americans tried to incorporate Indians little by little in their public organization and literally tried to civilize them. However, it was not so easy and Indians did not really lose their culture and their own organization. They just imitated some civilized people characteristic such a well-organized hierarchical political system, for example. Justice was supposed to be the same for everybody and on November 8, 1833, the Tennessee Legislature passed a law in order to extend Tennessee jurisdiction on Indian country even if this law was quite protected for the Indians who were in Tennessee: Indians had their property rights protected, and it was possible for the state's justice to be involved in a case only when it dealt with murder, rape and larceny. Tennessee, on that point was less harsh than other states, such as Georgia, which wanted Indians to be submitted to the law of the state. Therefore, each state had its own way of dealing with Indians who were still on the territory, but finding answers was difficult for every state."],"display_date":1835,"search_date":"1835-07-02","locations":[{"id":12473,"lat":35.8758167006,"lng":-86.8624771941,"zoom":9,"place":"WILLIAMSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3327,"title":"The Republican Party in Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-01-01","end_date":"1868-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1868, a broadside advertising the Mississippi Election Ticket for the Republican Party was released.

On that day, the coroner of Arkansas County held a formal inquest into the death of William Mabbet who had been found near Hickory Point. Curiously, Mabbet's body appeared heavily bruised and beaten, but showed no signs of resistance. If he had been attacked, should there not be some evidence of a struggle?","Violent deaths, like William Mabbet's, were not particularly unusual on the frontier. States and territories throughout the South passed statutes in an attempt to limit the number of concealed weapons a man might carry, but they were careful to specify that these weapons could and should be used in self defense. An important distinction lies in the fact that while such laws were passed, violent brawls and murders still occurred, enough to give the state of Arkansas a reputation as a dangerous place. ","This was due in part to the fact that the territorial government focused most of their attention on organizing new counties and petitioning Congress. The territorial government passed very little legislation concerning anything other than these matters within the first year of its creation and federal troops were often heavily engaged in maintaining borders with the Cherokee, Choctaws, Osages, Quapaws, and other Native American groups within and just outside the new territory. Local courts dealt with justice and, at times, formal proceedings were withheld entirely. As late as 1843, German traveler Friedrich Gerstacker witnessed a shocking account of a horse thief tied to a tree and beaten without a trial. ","The inquest into William Mabbet's death probably took the form of similar proceedings observed by Gerstacker. The court was typically held in a nearby postmaster's home, the jury was made up of neighboring landowners, and a lawyer journeyed to the local town from Little Rock to act as judge. At the end of the hearing, the jury would go outside to a porch or stable to deliberate.

Another round of shots rang out, and the boys were excited even more. As they approached the area, the men hurried into their respective carriages and drove off. On the bank of the canal, lying next to the woods, the boys saw a man with a red handkerchief lying over his face. Wilkins and the boys hurried off to his uncle's to tell him of the dead man in the woods.","The man with the red handkerchief over his face was H.F. Harris; the man responsible for his death was E.C. Yellowly. They were both lawyers of the Greenville bar in Pitt County, North Carolina. During one particular court case, Harris had criticized Yellowly's legal proceedings; Yellowly had responded with harsh criticism of his own. After court, Harris and Yellowly had an altercation that was subdued by friends in the area. Harris challenged Yellowly to a duel, and the challenge was accepted. However, both were arrested and put under heavy bonds to prevent the violence for one year. On the very day the bond was out, Harris renewed the challenge, and it was again accepted. On October 1, 1847, the two rivals met on the Dismal Swamp Canal. Yellowly attempted reconciliation before the duel, but Harris refused. Even as Harris fired his first round, Yellowly shot his pistol in the air, again attempting to make peace. Yet, Harris remained firm and fired another shot that went wild. This time around, Yellowly's ball hit its mark, striking Harris in the forehead, just above his right eyebrow. Seeing Harris fall, Yellowly commanded his second, Go to him, for God's sake, for I don't want to kill him.","Dueling was a common ritual of antebellum Southern life. Southern gentlemen lived by a strong code of honor, and dueling was virtually accepted as a proper way to defend one's honor. In <em>Honor and Slavery</em>, Kenneth S. Greenberg observed how men feared that to refuse a duel was to become a social outcast. The stakes were that high. Accordingly, many men achieved great political success after duels, and among the wealthy classes, most men got off scot-free from their crimes. E.C.

The men divided themselves into committees on issues ranging from education to temperance. On the final evening each committee presented their resolutions on the individual concerns addressed at the convention. The most extensive and detailed solutions addressed the criminal justice and education systems. They advocated a change in the jury system that would allow the participation of black men. They also sought regulations for chain gangs and prison life and the adoption of an anti-lynching law. In education, the men desired a six-month school year, and more private and public funding for schools, especially from the state. The men researched other important issues and reported, although following the convention, no significant public changes were made. Following the Civil War and the ending of slavery, whites needed a new way to cope with free blacks in the society. They solved this problem by adopting Jim Crow laws and segregation policies. While almost all aspects of public life became segregated in the South, education and the criminal justice system were two of the most intensely separated between the races. Schools differed among blacks and whites on the school year, funding, and facilities. White children attended school for six months, three months longer than black children. The white schools also received the majority of the state's education budget for new schools, textbooks, and materials. The remaining money in the budget was given to black schools, which was barely sufficient to keep schools running. The criminal justice system was just as poorly run. Georgia employed a chain gang and the prisons housed predominantly black convicts. The criminals were held at the mercy of white guards and officials who had no hesitation in allowing the prevalence of assault, hunger, sex, inadequate clothing, and even disease. It was not uncommon for guards to hire out black prisoners for labor-an arrangement that resembled slavery. While the Georgia men at the convention tried to make these blatant discriminations disappear, very little came of it. When the Supreme Court declared separate but equal legal in the 1896 case Plessy v.

Canada lay at the end of what was to be a long and dangerous journey. In some instances, a free black man impersonated a slave and led slaves off plantations to follow miles and miles of trails until they reached a designated resting station. The fugitives traveled at night by foot, train, or steam boat up North. They were aided by abolitionists involved in the Underground Railroad, which consisted of a vast network of people working together with the purpose of leading slaves to freedom. Whereas the development of the Underground Railroad allowed more slaves to reach safety, the Fugitive Slave Act was passed to prevent alleged runaway slaves from being protected or aided no matter their location. The Fugitive Slave Act was part of the Compromise of 1850 which prohibited slave-trading in the District of Colombia and admitted California as a free state. Although laws were in place to protect slave owners, the possibility of slaves escaping left many owners uneasy and afraid to leave their slaves unattended."],"display_date":"November 21, 1855","search_date":"1855-11-21","locations":[{"id":5598,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3370,"title":"Purging Polls in Virginia&#39;s Black Belt\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-10-31","end_date":"1889-10-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" In one fell swoop, Democrats in Southampton and Nansemond counties erased over 1,000 black names from the voter registration books, hoping to secure Democratic majorities in previously Republican dominated counties. Looking at Virginia's entire 2 district (heavily African American), which included these Tidewater counties, Democrats appeared to have netted about 4,000 votes, greatly slimming the opposition's lead. Sensing the reaction of Mahone's Readjuster Party, which commanded the Virginian Republican vote, the Democrats planned appropriately. Contacting a renowned gunsmith in Portsmouth, they ordered fifty new Winchester rifles, to be strategically dispersed near important voting precincts. Along with the men unafraid to use these guns, this stern measure of intimidation hoped to discourage white Mahonite leaders from inciting the newly disenfranchised black voters to attack the polling places. Celebrating such an important political gain, Southampton Democrats held a large rally at Newsome's farm attended by great numbers of local farmers. "," Virginia's Reconstruction Constitution in 1869 gave blacks and previously disenfranchised poor whites the right to vote, thus largely expanding the electorate in what had been the South's largest slave holding state. Virginia politics during Reconstruction differed from that of most other former-Confederate states, as no real Republican party emerged. Rather, the Readjuster party took up many Republican platforms, and quickly became the party of the African American vote. The Readjusters combined the black vote with that of the poor whites, and it appeared as if a coalition, capable of challenging the white ruling elite, had finally arisen. Sensing disaster, the Democrats began to couch their political appeals in the late 1880's in strictly racial terms, hoping to appeal to a sense of white solidarity. As they defended themselves from the Readjuster onslaught, Democrats also sought to disenfranchise blacks, thereby stifling a future biracial coalition. "," Unfortunately for the Democrats, the Fifteenth Amendment made it very difficult to restrict the right to vote for race-based reasons at face value. Thus, in this period of Redemption, election officials (most often Democrats themselves) would employ registration and election restrictions that they knew targeted blacks and, subsequently, some poor whites. Oftentimes, they would also commit outright voter fraud by stealing ballots, stuffing ballot boxes, or erasing names from the registration. Virginia also adopted the Australian ballot, aimed at confusing those who could not read, by not listing party names next to candidates, and giving voters less than two minutes in the voting booth. Nonetheless, black leaders, especially in the Tidewater area, continued to resist such coercive measures by flooding the polls with blacks, even if their votes were not being counted. "," Motivated, predominately, by the desire to more effectively hinder the black vote, Virginia, and other Southern states, underwent constitutional conventions in the 1890's. Resulting in residency requirements, grandfather clauses, and poll taxes, the South crippled the non-Democratic vote, evidenced by the drastic decline in voter turnout. Whereas 75 percent of eligible voters voted in 1890, this figure dived to 33 percent by 1900. Outright intimidation, though rare, also would emerge in the form of the Klu Klux Klan and the Red Shirts, vigilante groups who ensured few blacks would slip through the cracks. In Virginia's eastern counties, resistance to such Democratic injustice could also spell doom at the hands of newly purchased Winchester rifles.

The general assembly failed to pass a law that would prohibit anyone under the age of 13 from working in cotton factories. The Savannah Press was disturbed by the actions taken by the legislators in Georgia. The general assembly's actions showed that the need for production outweighed the importance of fair labor standards. ","During the nineteenth century many farmers planed cotton throughout the South. In Georgia, cotton was one of the main cash crops. Before the Civil War slaves worked on cotton plantations which attempted to meet the great national and international consumer need for the product. After the Civil War, freedom was declared for African Americans and many plantation owners lost much of their labor force. The owners of plantations needed people to work the land in order to make sure the need for cotton was met. At the time of the industrialization of America the cotton industry grew, and cotton factories were built throughout the South. Cotton manufacturers needed workers in these factories, and the age of the worker did not seem to matter. Manufacturers were willing to employ anyone and the age or the person did not matter. It seemed to the Savannah Press that the necessity for cotton outweighed moral values of the employers who ran the cotton factories. Employers tended to depend on women and children who were under the age of 16 as the main source of the labor force. One textile executive stated that many employers took no regard as to who should work and how many hours a person should work. The legislators in Georgia seemed to agree with the cotton factory employers on the idea that having as many workers as possible in order to meet the demand for cotton was of the utmost importance.

He also said from then on, the officers would only be able to act after receiving specific permission from him.

While the Democrats had already taken over the Georgia state legislature as early as 1870, the party wished to appease any fears that black citizens may have about the end of Republican rule.  On November 12, 1884, the <em>Savannah News </em>contained an article titled A Word to the Colored People, written by an unnamed Democratic party member.  The author ensured black citizens that they need have no fears that there will be any attempt by the Democratic party to abridge any of the rights and privileges which they gained after the Civil War.  In fact, he insisted that the Democrats were much more willing to help blacks further their condition in the South than the Republicans ever were.  With the Democrats in control, the opportunities of colored men to advance as their race increases in intelligence and improves its condition, will be far greater than they are at present.  ","The article demonstrates the Democratic party's attempt to secure the black citizens' support.  Blacks represented a huge percentage of the South, and had the potential to influence politics.  African Americans composed a majority of the Republican Party's support.  In reaction, the Democrats' political goals included limiting the power of black citizens through instituting poll taxes and new registration requirements.  By communicating their acknowledgement of black enfranchisement, Democrats attempted to detract electoral support from the Republicans.  This movement of Democrats to increase black support for the party was called the New Departure.  However, Democrats were more successful at detracting political support from the Republicans by encouraging dissension and factions within the party.

This was reported in the <em>City Gazette</em> and <em>Commercial Daily Advertiser </em>for months. He had been a paper boy (carrier of the <em>City Gazette</em>) and was able to read and write. He was formerly enslaved in Virginia (his mother was still there) and worked for the Petersburg Intelligencer. He was known for his skill at the printing press. ","The owner believed that Tom had left Charleston by ship and perhaps had forged his own free papers. The owner thought he may have been pretending to need passage to a Camp Meeting. Camp Meetings were the religious craze of the era and were connected most with the Methodist Church. There was a camp meeting being held at a local creek, and it would have considered un-Christian to refuse passage of a black man to a religious service. Many whites justified slavery as a way to spread Christianity to people who would otherwise live without it. ","There were rewards for the return of Tom to the owner (B.S. Thomas) that increased depending on the effort involved in Tom's return. His description is given as 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high, of a bright yellow complexion. Tom was not black (at least not fully), nor was he a stereotypical enslaved person. He was literate and worked in a trade for a major company. Clearly, he had some advantages afforded to him that many plantation field hands lacked and which put him in the perfect position to run away.","Charleston differed from many Southern towns and counties in its freedoms given to enslaved people. Slaves often took care of their own living arrangements and food, and made some (though very small) income. Charleston did not have the large plantations and thus it did not have the high demand for manual labor. Most owners hired out their slaves (most of whom were domestics or skilled in a trade) to other individuals to use. The owners were paid in return and were able to make profit off their slaves' work. Many slaves were allowed to retain some of the payment, and thus allowed some minor freedoms. This autonomy, and the ability of many Charleston slaves to read and write, made a lot of Charlestonians fear rebellion and runaways. Black people had to wear specific badges to identify them as free blacks or hired out slaves. The lack of a badge would indicate runaway status. Badges were often traded among slaves and free blacks, or counterfeited. Tom perhaps obtained a badge or other paperwork to certify he was free. Considering his education and connections, Tom would have been able to get away with a lot of things without being questioned. ","The belief that Tom escaped via ship was reflected in a general fear of runaway slaves through the port that had led to legislation in 1822. The Negro Seaman Acts required black seamen to be locked up while not at sea, so any black man on a ship was assumed to be a run away, and to prevent the black seaman from instigating trouble among the slaves."],"display_date":"May 2, 1815","search_date":"1815-05-02","locations":[{"id":11452,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3391,"title":"Col.

M'Duffie was a congressman for South Carolina at the time, and would later become governor of the state. Original reports sent back to Charleston anticipated that M'Duffie would die from his wound. The next day two letters were received, one from M'Duffie and another from a friend, both claiming that M'Duffie was stable and that they were slowly making the return home.

Greenberg argues that an attack on one's honor (usually, by claiming that he is a liar) is what leads to a duel, not the actual issue over which the original dispute was based. To not duel when challenged would mean that one does not care enough to refute an accusation of lying, and is considered very disgraceful. Honor was such an important institution in Southern society that to lose it would be a severe handicap in the professional, social, and political realms.

Two adds in The Valley Star (the primary newspaper in Lexington, Virginia) were surprisingly similar: one describing a lost horse and the other a lost slave. In Virginia at the time, the two were very similar. Both were considered property and both influenced the livelihood of a farmer. Although many southern planters did feel that slavery was unjust, they could not imagine life without it. The main reason the South was in such disrepair after the Civil War was because the ruling class, the slaveholders, had completely lost its livelihood. The war had taken their property.","On January 18, 1949, Clayton Coleman published an ad in The Valley Star concerning his runaway. LOOK OUT FOR A RUNAWAY 50 REWARD. My man GILES, who calls himself GILES BURLEY, left my plantation in Louisa County, Virginia, on the 3rd day of January. He has gone over the mountains, in company with some of the many hirelings.

The traders were not considered to be the nicest of men, but it was a business, and they were in it to make money. Local traders would start small, and gradually build their enterprises. Sales were commonly made from farm to farm within a region. An ad directly above the aforementioned runaway notice declared a sale of slaves because of the owner's death. The attorney auctioned off ten slaves, including a mother and her three boys under the age of 9. It is presumed that this family would be split among different farms in the region; a reality that was a constant incentive for slaves to behave. ","With the Compromise of 1850 came a tightening of the Fugitive Slave Act. Anyone who helped a slave escape would be punished.

Fowler reportedly had planned to notify U.S. detectives to work the lynching case, hence his beating. ","The White Caps were a vigilante group who operated in Eastern Tennessee in the late nineteenth century. Masked in white, members of this secret organization attempted to drive away or reform obnoxious persons by lynch- law methods. Mob attacks were performed frequently by white people toward blacks as a means to demoralize them and restore the social order among blacks and whites from the Antebellum Period. ","Fowler's experience was not rare. Mob violence first became popular in the South during the Antebellum Period as a form of systematic terrorism against whites as opposed to blacks, who were valuable as chattel. However according to historian W. Fitzhugh Brundage, the end of the Civil War and Reconstruction fueled violence against blacks as whites refused to accept emancipated slaves' quest for economic and political power. Lynching became a favored practice of these mobs, as it mirrored the 'Tyburn gallows,' which were notorious in ancient London as the site of public executions by hanging. These executions became public spectacles and the executed bodies would remain hung as a symbol of justice and warning to those willing to disobey social norm. The number of lynchings in the South began to rise in the 1880s, climaxing in 1892 where mobs executed an estimated seventy one whites, as well as one hundred and fifty five blacks, the largest number of lynchings in history of both the South and the United States of America.

It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one. From politics to economics and the social realm, religion was an important influence in the South."],"display_date":1830,"search_date":"1830-07-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3460,"title":"The Runaway Slave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-04-14","end_date":"1847-04-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For many enslaved people in the Deep South, slavery was the only way of life they had ever known. Regardless, stories of the North and specifically, a place referred to as Philadelphia, were incentive enough to prompt some to brave the terrifying unknown and escape the even more terrifying world in which they were already bound. At some point during the day - or perhaps it was the night - of April 9, 1847 a certain enslaved girl called Harriet disappeared from her owner's home in New Orleans. Details are not disclosed: was Harriet a slave on a large plantation or smaller home within the city? Had she just arrived? Did she have any children - or was she even old enough to bear a child? For all the mystery surrounding her departure from New Orleans, the fact remains that at least her owner was convinced that she had run away. "," A few days later, a small ad appeared in the <em>Times-Picayune</em> offering a 20 reward for this runaway. The description was still minimal, the ad offering only a few characteristics: She has a mark on her forehead, and a pleasing smile when spoken to. Information about her age or coloring was noticeably lacking, but the few brief sentences that were there did offer some insight into this woman's life. According to the owner, Harriet spoke not only English, but also French and Spanish. Her Spanish skills are rather mysterious, as there was virtually no Spanish influence in Louisiana at that point in Antebellum New Orleans. This may have been unintentional, but the fact also remains that Harriet's first listed language was French. The ad also included a stern admonition towards ship captains: they were overtly warned against harboring her."," These details hint at a life that may have been a bit out of the ordinary. The description about Harriet's disappearance, and the information that her owner chose to disclose, suggests that she may not have taken the typical escape route northward, but instead had access to escape via some waterway. The illegal nature of that was easily dismissed in light of Harriet's own defiance of the law. The slave trade was very much alive and well in the world of 1847 Louisiana, but the importation of slaves from Africa to the United States had been put to an end in 1807, after Thomas Jefferson signed a bill with that explicit purpose. Of course, this government action merely meant to some that their business operations would from then on be considered illegal. At that point, slavery had already become an integral part of the American economy, and taking legal action against the institution did not mean that it would quickly or easily fade away into oblivion. Furthermore, in that same year of 1807, plantation owners approved of legislation in their new territory of Louisiana that effectively prevented any slave from potentially becoming emancipated. Although Jefferson no longer allowed Africans to be forcefully immigrated into the United States, the current slaves already living in America at the time received no breaks."],"display_date":"April 14, 1847","search_date":"1847-04-14","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3464,"title":"The Development of a Judicial System\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1817-01-01","end_date":"1822-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Keep little or no money about you or in your trunk, John Bisland advised his son in a letter between the two, since you left this place our negro peer got a key and opened my trunk, he had robbed me of about 900 dollars. Issues between slaves and their masters especially problems with theft became a growing dilemma in the nineteenth century and a consisted of about half of the trials in the Adams County Circuit Court. Not only was the court house a place of law it was also the center of southern communities and a common place where citizens gambled, drank, brawled, listened to oratorical fights of rhetoric, and debated politics.","As the development of courts became a greater priority in American society so did issues concerning the decisions and decision makers in court. There were many debates regarding the process of convicting felons and whether the jury should make the final decision in cases or if judge should have the ultimate say. An article in a local Tennessee paper stated that because the trial by jury is guaranteed by the constitution, the judgments of the jurors must remain untrammeled to their minds but also to the actual law. ","The fact that the law was such a dominant part of nineteenth century life, creating sufficient jails was necessary in order to house convicted felons. In Adams county escapes from poorly constructed jails were so frequent, the sheriff was forced to adopt methods seen as inhuman in order to maintain security. New jails were needed and the architects who designed these structures put great time and thought into creating the safest, most secure facilities possible. Jail plans in Wilkinson County proposed the building to be 40 feet by 24 feet... with the external wall to be built of well burnt brick, two feet thick. Problems with the rapidly growing population played a large role in the design of these facilities especially after multiple embarrassing incidents regarding overcrowded jails had been reported. Because of these issues, in 1822, circuit judges were required to conduct or oversee examinations of jails at least once a year to make sure there were not any outstanding concerns that needed to be fixed.","Along with the costs necessary to construct and maintain court houses and jail facilities it was very expensive to imprison people who had broken the law. One governor of Mississippi demanded immediate trials and banned undetermined times of imprisonment due to the amount of money it cost to hold these prisoners in jail. Other measures were taken towards a similar direction and in 1822 a Mississippi governor allowed all prisoners except the ones who were being held for felonies to walk out of the jail as long the jury believed that they would abide by the decisions made in county court.

Literally. A man named Owings had fought a Mr. Anderson over an issue of honor and had been stabbed in Bath County, Kentucky in 1830. The doctor had declared that Owings's situation was not life threatening, but this diagnosis proved incorrect as the stabbing victim soon passed away.  Owings had asked for trouble. He insulted a woman of Anderson's household, so Anderson returned the favor by stabbing Owings when they met in the courtroom. To Anderson, defending his family's honor was paramount."," Dr. Hood thought that Owings would not die, so the local court did not charge Anderson with murder and merely requested that the violent assailant present himself for judgment at the court's next session. Anderson left town, however, upon hearing that Owings death had made him a murderer. In any case, such violence was typical of the South because of its honor culture and differentiated it from the rest of the United States according to Ed Ayers. It became vitally important to southerners to fight for their honor because this proved that they had honor to defend and deserved respectable social standing. Unfortunately, this promoted a cycle of violence because southerners constantly had to defend their honor. "," Women and slavery encouraged a cult of honor in the South in different ways. Women's moral standing directly affected their husbands' and sons' social status, so men felt compelled to defend their female relations' honor in order to avoid ridicule. Women also informally doled out social rank by judging families' honor, which men had to define through violence. With slavery, whites gained an elevated sense of superiority by degrading black people that they felt compelled to defend. As Ayers notes, It was slavery that allowed wealthy whites to consider themselves the heirs to the manners and pretensions of the English gentry. The idea of the English elite continued to feed a copycat honor culture defendable to the death in the South. In the nineteenth-century South, violence was not only a solution, but a status marker.

According to the Wellsburg Herald, the black population of Wellsburg had been meeting nightly at societies or parties at the residences of other free blacks. But on this particular night something went wrong, or as the local white-owned newspaper mused, [the party] appears...to have been diverted from its legitimate object - affording an opportunity for the younger classes to meet, court, and sport together. The -'green-eyed monster' jealousy was of course not idle. A young free black man by the name of Thomas Groves was in town briefly as an employee on the steamer Miami and attended the party. When he left the house in the company of a local black woman, he got into an altercation with a group of local black men over his relationship with the woman. In the ensuing quarrel a member of the group pulled out a pistol and killed Groves. Though the identity of the actual killer was not known at press time, six of the men had been arrested on charge of being concerned in the riot. A hearing was scheduled for that afternoon.","Western Virginia, soon to become the new state of West Virginia, did not secede from the Union, and thus became a haven for free black men and escaped slaves during and after the Civil War. The border between West Virginia and Virginia was an important escape route from the Confederate states to the Upper South. Many former slaves were drawn to the area by the promise of a large number of high-paying jobs created by the burgeoning mining and timber industries. But in some cases, the influx of newly-free blacks was scarcely tolerated by the whites of the northern Border States. In an area that had traditionally had few blacks because of the lack of demand for slaves, the immigration of African Americans heightened tensions between the two races. The high tensions sometimes led to violence. In this case, however, the violence was limited to the black race, and so was looked on more as a diversion rather than cause for alarm.","Many of these escaped slaves became useful members of the Union Army, and some even became soldiers after conscription of African-Americans was approved in 1863. However, white attitudes toward free blacks in the South would remain a problem well into the 20th century, and soon black-on-black crime would be relatively ignored by many local southern authorities. Though the men in this case were arrested and perhaps even given a trial, this attitude of disdain among the whites would only increase during Reconstruction, and eventually transform into the codified racism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With the displacement of large groups of slaves during the Civil War and the sudden complete emancipation of the 14th Amendment, blacks and whites would be forced to deal with each other on grounds unfamiliar to both races.

He would not give up his land without a fight, but one small problem arose. He had no proof that he owned it. Buchanan found out that land dealings could get nasty. Initially, he had partnered with Thomas Edmiston to purchase a piece of property. Edmiston had traveled to the appropriate land office to buy the land in his own name while Buchanan stayed home. Buchanan then claimed that he had paid Edmiston for a share of the two thousand acre plot. Unfortunately, he lacked the contract proving this and no third party could validate his ownership. This did not turn into a problem until Edmiston passed away. At this time, his heirs began pressuring Buchanan for proof that he had paid Edmiston for his piece of the property.

Knowing this, creditors made use of various legal strategies to maximize their advantage over their clients. Often they would exploit the clerk or sheriff's offices within the courthouse rather than the court itself to win judgments over debtors. If they had exploited their creditor rights properly, the Edmistons probably won the legal battle by contending that their family had never received payment for the land that they had loaned Buchanan.

A Methodist preacher had been teaching the colored people out of catechism No. 1 - teaching them at the plantations, when a Baptist minister heard of his efforts and raised the alarm. The Baptist quickly called a meeting and began to denounce the practice of preaching to the slaves through the catechism. Not all in the audience were convinced by the harangue, however, and one member of the Methodist church declared that her mind was not changed at all; the missionaries would still teach her servants out of the catechism if they would. Eventually, the Baptist minister retired and gave up the idea of convincing the Methodists of the evils of the catechism. ","During the religious awakenings of the nineteenth century, the practice of converting large numbers of slaves to Christianity became more acceptable. Prior to that, slave Christianity was a problematic issue because of the ethics of one Christian holding another in bondage. In the late eighteenth century, Methodists in particular took a strong anti-slavery stand, but were overruled by the laity in the southern states. With the advent of evangelicalism and a new emphasis on personal salvation, however, Christianity came to be seen as a way to control and pacify slaves, and most white preachers emphasized the idea of obedience to those in bondage. Many sermons centered on the idea of obeying an earthly master as one was required to obey a heavenly one. Therefore, the idea of a white minister teaching scripture to slaves was not only accepted, but often encouraged. ","Problems arose, however, when reading became a part of the equation. Knowledge for a slave in the antebellum South was power, and the ability to read and write allowed slaves to forge passes and freedom papers to help them escape. While few southern states actually had laws preventing slave literacy, it was generally discouraged by the whites in power. Therefore, the use of a catechism to preach to slaves was socially contentious, and in some places, illegal. Even the possibility that blacks might learn to read made whites nervous, and so the catechism became a front page issue in slaveholding states like Virginia. ","For many slaves, both church and the Bible became important tools in the quest for literacy. Often slaves would memorize passages during church services and then look them up in secret. In this way, slaves taught themselves to spell and then later, to read. The same problem arose with the catechism. If slaves could memorize passages from the book and then find them later, the book could become another way to learn to recognize words. The narrative also reflects the competition for converts between the different denominations of the Protestant church. In the early years of the Great Revival, Baptists and Methodists in particular fought for control of different populations, as seen in the Baptist minister's determination to address the Methodist missionaries' congregation. This rivalry was still a factor in many parts of the South, even in the 1850s, especially in the less settled regions. Many parts of western Virginia were still wilderness at this time, and so this story would hold particular relevance for those in the less settled parts of the state."],"display_date":"June 26, 1858","search_date":"1858-06-26","locations":[{"id":14833,"lat":38.1460994742,"lng":-82.4270334246,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3539,"title":"Mississippi Congressman Calls for the Annexation of Texas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-02-20","end_date":"1845-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1845, the national debate over the annexation of the young country of Texas into the Union was in full swing.

The people of Mississippi knew that slaves would attempt to escape, and hoped that these new laws would help them keep the property in which they had invested so much.

As the Homestead Bill came to the forefront of the Congressional debate, he felt it was his duty as a Mississippian and a Senator to stand up for what he thought would benefit his constituents, the South, and the country as a whole.  People were afraid that this would bring in an influx of foreign immigrants, but he put that opinion down, and turned it around to seem as a beneficial piece of legislation for the North, which immigrants already overpopulate.  Brown though that the Homestead Bill would eventually spread out the immigration from foreign countries, and alleviate the immigration problems in the North.  "," Brown was representing his constituency through supporting the Homestead Bill, because his people of Mississippi would be some of the first to take advantage of free, fertile land in the west.  Fred Shannon studied this bill, which was not ratified until 1862, and marked a contrast between what Brown claimed, and what the rest of the South believed would happen if the legislation passed.  Shannon states that southerners are those persons who are supposed to have been the most bitter against the homestead legislation.  The rest of the South took the opposite view on the merits of increased immigration into the South, and needless to say, theywere not very cordial. The South, in the 1850s, was a place of white social dominance and plantation slavery. The white dominance spanned across race lines and continued to affect the relations with different nationalities.  The stubbornness of the South to realize the massive amount of land that was at their disposal led to the reluctancy of the lawmakers to ratify the bill."],"display_date":"April 28, 1852","search_date":"1852-04-28","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3549,"title":"A Northern View on Southern People\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the years of 1851 and 1852, Joseph Baldwin traveled through the south documenting everything he saw, in a very detailed manner.  He was from New York, and needless to say, felt out of place and different among the southerners.  Baldwin was a lawyer, and in his book about his travels, Flush Times of Alabama and Mississippi, he takes most of his time explaining the legal matters of the places he visited. Baldwin stopped in the rural western Mississippi county of Noxubee and experienced a court case that would have him perplexed for months to come.  Due to the lack of development in this area, there is only one courthouse in the county, and one must make his way to the courthouse on very rough roads.  Mr. Onslow, as he is referred to by Baldwin, had come on horseback from the Mississippi Swamp, on no other business than to attend to this case.  His preparation was arduous and thorough   his zeal apostolic.  Baldwin clearly portrays his shock regarding the manner in which this southern countryman from the swamp had taken to his business in court.  The underlying theme is the presence of the stereotypes which followed Baldwin on his trek down to the heart of the South. ","On the surface, Onslow was just another uneducated southerner who owned slaves, and was out to expand his enterprise.  Once Baldwin allowed himself to get past Onslow's ruggedness, a very articulate and learned man greeted him. These predetermined stereotypes presented many problems between the North and South during the years preceding the Civil War.  The North viewed the South as uneducated slave holders, who would rather enslave black people rather than do the work themselves.  Mark Smith argues that the elites of the North tried to educate the southerners in the ways of economics and free enterprise.  The southerners saw this as a sign of disrespect, which further enlarged the gap between the two social and geographic groups.  It was very difficult for either side to listen to each other, due to the predetermined stereotypes illustrated in many of Baldwin's entries regarding his travels.  He does, however, make an effort to rid himself of the stereotypes, but they are still evident in his writings, which would characterize the typical northerner's views of a southerner.  These stereotypes led to social hardships and a general disdain for the other portion of the country in the mid nineteenth century."],"display_date":1853,"search_date":"1853-07-02","locations":[{"id":7200,"lat":33.1101145617,"lng":-88.569790999,"zoom":9,"place":"NOXUBEE, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3554,"title":"The Establishment of the First Black Law School\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-01-04","end_date":"1869-01-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["African Americans never enjoyed exclusive access to law schools, much less to graduate schools in general. At the start of 1869, however, John Mercer Langston and the Trustees of Howard University announced the opening of the very first law school in the United States intended for African Americans and those seeking to provide legal defense for other African Americans. Langston himself was the founding Dean of the law school and thus, a major contributor to the school's establishment. When the doors of the Howard School of Law opened on January 4, 1869, it marked a major triumph for African Americans within Washington, DC and throughout the rest of the country.","The Reconstruction Era saw a major increase in the black populations of urban areas. Race relations remained strained, and African Americans found themselves excluded from many of the jobs and opportunities available to whites. Thus, the black community gradually developed its own economy and its own establishments, including schools. Howard University and the Howard University School of Law were but some of the black schools established during the Reconstruction Era that provided the black community with the opportunity to receive educations like those of their white cohorts. As a result of the establishment of black colleges and graduate schools, there emerged a class of black professionals who further strengthened the black communities that were excluded from mainstream white society. Furthermore, it is especially significant that blacks were able to earn law degrees at a time when the rights of blacks had only recently been recognized, and thus, were especially in need of defense and protection. Black lawyers were also much more likely to take on the cases of black clients, as well as to better represent them, due to their common backgrounds."],"display_date":"January 4, 1869","search_date":"1869-01-04","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3561,"title":"Emancipation Celebration\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-01-01","end_date":"1891-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["African Americans gathered in large numbers in Alexandria on New Year's night, January 1, 1891, to celebrate the twenty-eighth anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. Magnus L. Robinson, editor of the Weekly Leader noted with chivalry that in Lannon's Opera House every orchestra chair was filled with the fair sex--never have there been before such an array of Afro-American ladies at a public meeting, giving grace and beauty to an occasion which is sacred to every true Afro-American. The evening began with a prayer and the singing of the Star Spangled Banner. Letters of regret from those who could not come were read. That of Hugh McCulloch, Secretary of the Treasury under Lincoln, reviewed the history of race relations and the attempts to end slavery in the United States. One of his interesting statements was that voting rights for immigrants should be limited, but voting rights for blacks should not. ","The principal speaker of the evening was James M. Townsend of Indiana. He provided a very direct assessment of the state of race relations in his time: But is it not strange, that now, 28 years after Emancipation --after the Amendments to the Constitution--after settling as we thought forever the question of our citizenship, in this country we helped to make and save, that insult is added to injury by the traitorous men who sought to destroy this government, banding themselves together for the avowed purpose of disfranchising, ostracizing, and by some means or other, getting rid of 8,000,000 of the most loyal, patriotic, and inoffensive people on this continent, simply because of their color. He declared his interest in political and civil equality and in a freedom that comes with an equal chance before the law and in business. He recognized that what he sought would be obtained only if African Americans did most of the work of gaining their civil rights themselves, and he argued that blacks should insist on being treated with appropriate dignity. It was all right with him if young African American women spit in the eye of white men who insulted them. ","As Townsend recognized, his fight for freedom and equality was not in harmony with the intentions of the white society of the time. The rights of black men and women, to vote and travel freely, for example, were being increasingly curtailed. Whites began to rely on segregation laws to restrict blacks. Competing with blacks for farm laborers and other resources aggravated many whites. Despite the overwhelming odds, blacks continued to assert their rights. Nonetheless, African Americans would have to endure decades of abuse before they saw any change in treatment.

On Sunday August 6, Clark claimed she went over to Thomas's home to retrieve an axe, which had been loaned to him. When she reached his house and explained why she had come, Thomas allegedly grabbed Clark and drew her to him. Clark, however, was able to escape and ran home to tell her mother. Thomas was arrested the following day. As night approached on Tuesday, the crowd outside the jail grew larger. Several hundred had gathered by 10 o'clock. The mob began to demand that Thomas be handed over. The mayor pleaded with the crowd to let Thomas undergo trial yelling If the man is not convicted I will lead you in person to hang him. The crowd was insatiable, however, and replied Give us the nigger He won't be here tomorrow The crowd rushed the jail and upon finding Johnson dragged him outside. Johnson tried to escape, but the crowd shot him, dragged him to the corner of King and Fairfax Street, stripped him of his clothes, and hanged him. The mob proceeded to fire shots into his body. After confirming that he was dead, the throng of people dispersed. The response to the lynching was mixed, and many speculated about why it occurred. Some argued that a protest Monday night by many African Americans, arguing that Thomas should not be lynched, may have contributed to the events that following Tuesday. What is clear, however, is that the actions of Tuesday, August 8, 1899 were not unusual.","The lynching of African Americans had become commonplace in the late nineteenth century. Before the Civil war white men were generally the victims of lynching. In the postbellum period, however, lynching and race were strongly related. In the South and border states 85 percent of victims were black. There are several possible explanations. William Brundage argues that southern institutions failed to provide adequate controls to stifle mob violence. Weak educational, religious, and civic institutions, poverty and ineffective law enforcement agencies failed to instill sufficient respect for the rule of law or human dignity. Furthermore, lynching provided a socially accepted channel for aggression in the South.","Although it was an accepted practice, lynching did face opposition from its beginnings. By the time Thomas was lynched in 1893, a number of whites had emerged who were concerned about its implications for the state. Despite these concerns, blacks had very few avenues to address violence towards them. The opposition that was led by blacks tended to be uncoordinated and lacked any concrete program for reform. For rural blacks the only available recourse was usually spontaneous and disorganized protests. More militant methods risked severe sanctions. Lynching continued well into the 20th century: African American Michael Donald was lynched in Mobile Alabama in 1981.

He pointed out that, in a republican government, important legislation being passed and affecting the people should be reflective of the interests of at least majority of the people. He claimed, however, that the passage of the bill for black suffrage was almost unanimously rejected by the white race. He complained of the fact that the black right to vote had been acceptingly repudiated in several northern states, and yet, it was forced upon the people in Washington against their will. He then went on to say how this would lead to a negative effect upon the white workingmen of the District of Columbia., as it would bring the blacks to an equal footing with them. Furthermore, he threatened that those Northern states that did not pass black suffrage would sympathize with the white citizens and would likely drop their support for the Republican government as a result.

Of the three witnesses who testified, two of them were black and one of them was white. The first black witness, known as Henry Barret, testified that the assailant had been a white man who he believed may have been dressed in grey and wearing a hat. The following white witness, George Smith, told the defense that he did not see the accused, Oscar Mankin, shoot at the colored man. Lastly, a black, Jane Green, who was with Anderson on the night of the shooting, recalled talk of a black soldier being beaten up in the street outside, to which Anderson responded saying, he could whip any rebel man who had hit a Union man. She then said that Anderson was met by gunshots from Mankin, who she said may have been wearing a black coat and hat. The doctor who then examined Anderson's wound said its position was the result of the bullet coming from an elevation. Upon cross-examination, however, the defense contends that Mankin could not have been responsible given his average height and its inconsistency with the gun being fired from an elevation. At the trial's end, the jury returned the verdict of not guilty.","The proceedings of this trial, as well as the event on which it was based, reveal the nature of the relationship between blacks and whites during and after the Civil War. First, it was common for slaves from the South to join the Union army as an escape from slavery. Although the colored man being beaten up and to whose rescue Anderson came is not identified by the article, it would not be surprising that he was a former slave who came to the North to join the Unionists in the army. In addition, this trial also reveals the inferior treatment received by blacks at the hands of the whites. The testimonies of the black witnesses and victim involved, who were not even slaves, were nevertheless clearly given less consideration by the jury in considering the verdict.

In the evening, the colored people of the city met and formed a group called the Afro-American League. They wrote a preamble and resolutions against the laws requiring separate railroad cars and waiting rooms for blacks and whites. While demanding change in the law, they also wished to educate the population. Their league's object shall be the creation of a healthy public opinion and they will use the church, the press, meetings, and the court system to appeal the laws. "," Whether this League is a branch of the Afro-American League, founded in 1890, is hard to determine from this one article in the <em>Staunton Spectator</em> and Vindicator, the weekly paper for Augusta County. The paper did not say it is, and only listed the fourth resolution. The members said they were organizing a league to be known as the Afro-American League and not anything about being a branch league. The paper made no comment for this event and ran no other articles that day which had racism, black people, or blacks' rights as the subject. There were not any follow-up articles the next week either."," By 1891, Reconstruction had ended, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments had been passed, and Jim Crow laws regulating railroads were already in effect. Jim Crow had not fully seized the South though, and Booker T. Washington and Tuskegee Institute were working for blacks' rights. C. Vann Woodward has noted that by 1890, the hope that Reconstruction and the Civil War had brought was nearly gone. Edward Ayers, however, has noted the uncertainty and lack of concrete rules and regulations governing the South in the 1880's. He also intimated that newspapers bear some of the blame for inciting tension because of their stories and skewed coverage of blacks. This type of story of a meeting was not uncommon because black people continuously worked to retain their rights and gain new ones. They saw themselves losing the enfranchisement and losing the possibility of gaining political positions in society. Meetings like the one in Staunton were not everyday occurrences but groups such as the Afro-American League were beginning to form and trying to exert some influence in towns and cities. A South Carolina woman wrote in her diary that, The negroes are evidently in an excited state. It is important to note that the black people of Staunton had a plan of action. They did not meet to complain about their situation but to improve it. They had a document that explained their goals and beliefs.

In the past, Staunton citizens prided themselves for their gas and music. They needed an equally impressive courthouse that could reflect the citizens' feelings of importance.

That much was certain as they traveled to Washington D.C. from their rural home with Margaret's sister on Christmas Eve, 1877. What wasn't quite so certain was where in the city they could go to hold the ceremony. When they came upon a group of reporters waiting outside City Hall they anxiously asked how, where, and how fast they could be wed. Luckily, the reporters were just the people to ask.  ","Some of the reporters got them through the door of City Hall and to the Marshal's apartment, while others joined forces with some bailiffs to locate a marriage license and someone to officiate the ceremony. It took hardly any time at all before the two were wed in the Criminal Courtroom by none other then Reverend Byron Sunderland himself, who had come running to perform the marriage. This was the very first marriage in the Criminal Courtroom, which was usually the site of proceedings of a very different nature. That a marriage between two black youths could occur in an unconventional location with the help of all kinds of residents of the city of Washington was symbolic of the progress that the nation was trying to make toward equality for all men. ","However, this example of a spur-of-the-moment public wedding between two young, black individuals is more of an anomaly concerning how the idea of citizenship for freed black Americans actually materialized in real life. As David Herbert Donald points out, despite the fact that racial equality had largely been legislated by the 1870s, not everyone was as accommodating as the folks in Washington were that day.  In many parts of the South, there was no one to enforce the kind of treatment the law demanded. Washington D.C. stands out, at least in this example, as a more progressive part of the South, more in touch with the ideals for which the nation's legislators were striving. The Republicans who were in office had passed many laws requiring equal treatment in public spaces for black and white alike; in the case of this marriage in the courtroom, this idea was taken a step further, and the reporters were thrilled to be catching the first marriage in a criminal court room, a marriage of two black people no less. The significance and symbolism of this event is supported by the appearance of Rev. Byron Sunderland, a prominent black clergyman who had advised President Lincoln in the struggle for the emancipation of American slaves."],"display_date":"December 24, 1877","search_date":"1877-12-24","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3598,"title":"The Debate Over Colonization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-02-28","end_date":"1890-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Bishop H. M. Turner decided to pick up a copy of the Evening Star on the night of February 28th, 1890, when a certain headline caught his eye: Bruce on the race issue. The Honorable Blanche Kelsoe Bruce was an old friend of the Bishop's who had become a Senator of the state of Mississippi and moved to Washington D.C. Each man greatly admired the other for his work and his distinguished accomplishments.  Bishop Turner was visiting the capital at the time that he came across the attention-grabbing headline, and by the time he had reached his home in Atlanta at the end of his work-related travels, he had read the article. Suffice it to say that he was perplexed by what he had read, so he determined to write a letter to The Washington Post respectfully challenging Mr. Bruce's negative stance on the issue of colonization for black Americans.  ","Let the negro go if he desires or remain here if he prefers. Let him exercise his own intellect...when you say they have no desire to go to Africa, I say, who know the real condition of our race as well as any man who lives, a million at least of them desire to go somewhere, wrote Bishop Turner. He was trying to express that though there had been some progress made in the push for civil rights for the negroes of the U.S., the nation was still very much a racially prejudiced one. He argued that for some negroes, moving to Liberia was potentially the most advantageous escape from oppression in a white-dominated society; for others, moving to Liberia would only leave them helpless, forlorn, and bereft of their livelihoods, however stifled those livelihoods may be. You, Senator Bruce, say all of you stay here and wait for better times. I say, let us pray God and man to pass the bill of Senator Butler, and let a line of steamships be started between here and Africa, and let such of us as believe that we are not monkeys, and can do something without the white man's domination, go and try the experiment. ","He ended his letter, only to find it quite a bit longer than he had planned to write; however, this issue was very close to his heart and mind, and he wished he had all the space in the world to explain to his countrymen and his fellow black American, Senator Bruce, that it was high time Congress focused on the deplorable state of the negro race in the United States. The issue in this letter to Senator Bruce from Bishop Turner is the fact that colonization was perhaps the path to a better way of life for many black Americans. There was endless controversy in the capitol over colonization throughout most of the 19th century, and by 1890 when this letter was written, many black Americans felt that it should be left to each individual to decide whether or not moving to Africa was his chosen destiny. As historian Ralph Luker then points out, the longings of southern blacks to be freed from oppression continued to feed the dream of emigration... Turner was trying, with his letter, to emphasize that continuing the existing societal dynamic between blacks and whites in the South was futile; it was true that the tension that was growing between whites and blacks in America could neither be solved by sitting idly by and hoping for gradual equality, nor be solved by shipping masses of black Americans to Liberia to begin new lives."],"display_date":"February 28, 1890","search_date":"1890-02-28","locations":[{"id":1279,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3601,"title":"Frederick Douglass Addresses the New American Party\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-02-20","end_date":"1884-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The American Prohibition Convention of 1884 was held in Lincoln Hall and kicked off on the evening of February 20th.  Several prominent politicians, bureaucrats, religious leaders and thought leaders of the time were present to help usher the American Party into the upcoming election season. Mr. E.D. Bailey, who had just been appointed to the committee responsible for nominating a President and Vice President of the United States, spoke first and set the tone for the evening by highlighting a few key themes of critical importance to the American Party:  the party's firm foundation in Jesus Christ's vision of Democracy, the growing need for temperance and prohibition, the threat of Freemasonry on the nation, and the highly objectionable way in which Republicans seemed to appeal to the black community simply to win votes before elections.  ","With the mood perfectly set for his address, Mr. Frederick Douglass took the stage to present his speech on civil rights. We have got rid of slavery. It is gone, gone, gone, never to return. But its long black shadow stretches across our entire continent...You ask sometimes when this negro question will cease...It will cease when we have one country, one citizenship, one liberty, one equality for all people...  He then spoke to the issue of colonization, heatedly denouncing it as a unthinkable solution to the problem of racial inequality. He asserted that black people wanted to take part in the freedom and progress that was so unique to the United States, a nation that they were as much a part of as white men. In fact, he elaborated humorously, many whites and blacks may be closer in relation than they might think given the history of interracial relationships in America He even indicated to his largely male audience that, in general, men could learn something from the more compassionate and respectful attitudes of women, who he had known to show the kind of sensitivity and care necessary to bridging the gaps between the white and black races. Every last one of his words was met with applause, laughter, admission, understanding, and approbation by all those in the hall, white and black alike. ","Retrospectively, this speech which occurred in 1884 came at a hugely significant time in the history of race relations in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States had ruled the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to be unconstitutional less than six months before it was presented at the convention of the American Party. By 1885, as historian Valeria W. Weaver explains, the 'Jim Crow' South was really taking shape, severely impeding if not stopping in its tracks, the push toward the equality between whites and blacks that was the foundation of Douglass' mission."],"display_date":"February 20, 1884","search_date":"1884-02-20","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3603,"title":"No Tolerance for Gambling\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1877-12-19","end_date":"1878-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The police had been keeping a close watch on various buildings around the city of Washington, D.C. where they believed that certain ordinary, reputable citizens of the community by day were, in fact, holding illicit card games by night. 1345 E Street and 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue topped the watch list for the D.C. police and they scheduled and executed a raid on No. 1345 in the middle of the night on December 19th. Led by Sergeants Hollinburger and Guy, the force of 12 men barged into the building only to find that the suspects had fled in the nick of time.         ","What they left behind in their haste to escape confirmed the Sergeants' suspicions: there was indeed a game of faro being played at the residence, and it probably was a regular occurrence that involved gambling of the most notorious, disgraceful kind. Among the evidence that had been left strewn before them, the officers found and confiscated very valuable and expensive items including fine alcohol, exquisite furniture, and the intricate game pieces themselves.         ","As luck would have it, not more than one month later, the police raided the E Street hideout again - this time, the gamblers were caught unawares. Led by Sergeant Hollinburger and Lieutenant Austin, the 6 officers arrested 16 men, two of which, named Wells and Jewell, seemed to be in charge of the game. Though only 6 was found on the table with the chips and cards, Jewell had 465 on his person, all of which he alleged to have received from his patients. Whether Jewell spoke the truth or not, the gamblers had been caught red-handed and the police confiscated everything at the crime scene, including the house itself.        ","This incident is indicative of two major themes in Southern history during the last quarter of the 19th century, about which historian Paul Dolan writes. First, many forms of vice proliferated in the United States, and certain regions were notorious for certain vices, like the West and the South were for gambling. Second, Dolan notes, official police forces in the United States were just gaining ground, generally having been instituted around only 50 years prior to this raid in D.C. Therefore, since social reform was becoming a major concern and crime was rampant, it is easy to understand Sergeant Hollinburger's dogged persistence in catching the secret party of gamblers."],"display_date":"December 19, 1877 - January 18, 1878","search_date":"1878-01-03","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3606,"title":"A Call to the Free-Holders of Rowan and Davie Counties\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-06-22","end_date":"1844-06-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["People in town were gathered around a newspaper with the political platforms for the upcoming Presidential election.  The candidate that seemed to care the most about the people of the county, especially the farmers was A.G. Carter.  He had been the Senator here for twelve years so if he anything he had the experience to make the best politician.  He promised to not burden people with taxes anymore and to vote for a Senator who will have the best interest of the people and county at heart. Carter seemed so honest and straightforward-the way people in North Carolina want to be represented, and he promised to vote for the good, old traditional Republican doctrines. Carter also claimed in his letter that people needed to fight the annexation of Texas, and reclaim this as American land by negotiating a Treaty with Spain.  Texas was a large piece of territory for our people to settle and this could mean a stronger country.  Carter spoke for common folks, announcing that he would work for the best prices and not let politicians deceive people into paying high prices for cheap goods.  Carter appealed to parental concerns by reminding voters of how defective the education system had become; apparently the people of Rowan are not getting the large amount of money that went into a fund for the state to use on education, and if that money went to the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad Co.  citizens would have to pay taxes directly on it.  This didn't seem fair to the people of North Carolina, especially the children who needed opportunities for education in order to get better jobs, and the railroad certainly didn't provide jobs for all the people of North Carolina. Carter said that there was too much legislation instead of too little, and a lot of people agreed judging by the reactions in his letter published in the daily paper. ","Railroad companies and education competed for state funding.  Although many citizens of North Carolina were still self employed, agriculture being the dominant economy of the South, there was an influx of funding from Southern states into their technological and industrial advances in order to keep up with Northern urban economies.  This is consistent with the views of William Cooper and Thomas Terrill, historians who claimed that significant growth in the later antebellum periods, spurred by the Panic of 1837, severely depressed cotton prices until the mid-1840s, leaving the South considerably underdeveloped in comparison with Northern states.  This was due to resistance from Southern politicians, who garnered support and funding for issues that were intangible for many citizens.  However, the South did benefit from participation in industrialization due to the fact that crops and textiles could be more widely distributed in more convenient, quicker ways.  This was an imperative equalizer to Northern society, but also an essential for Southern growth."],"display_date":"June 22, 1844","search_date":"1844-06-22","locations":[{"id":9412,"lat":35.9291897812,"lng":-80.544596269,"zoom":10,"place":"DAVIE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3608,"title":"Bettie V.

The movement was a period of intense religious activism that trickled down from northern, urban cities and affected Protestant denominations with a heightened sense of social activism. Bettie V. Jones, a resident of Fluvanna County, Virginia, received numerous letters from family and friends, including her husband, William J. Payne, and various other people from and around Charlottesville, Virginia. According to the letters, the Payne family was prominent in the political sphere of central Virginia; included in the letters is a mention of the 1852 Whig convention and the upcoming election, along with a seating chart for the House of Delegates for the 1853-54 session. Jones, a Methodist herself, corresponded with a few Albemarle County residents about the Charlottesville Methodist Church revival, an event that was probably similar to the countless other religious awakenings sweeping the nation that sought to, among other things, counter the assertion that the Bible was fallible. ","Of particular interest to the historian in the collection is a letter addressed to Jones from a family member in Arkansas, a slave state admitted in 1836 on the condition that Michigan was admitted in 1837 as a free state. The issue of runaway slaves is addressed in the letter, a contentious subject that caused a great deal of strife among slaveholders and non-slaveholders alike. The Fugitive Slave Law, enacted in 1850, was established in response to the demands from the South for more stringent and detailed Federal legislation concerning the rights of slaveholders and the punishment of runaway slaves. This controversial law further divided those for and against slavery, prompting the increase in the number of abolitionists and the inception and increased efficiency of the Underground Railroad. ","The central tension that is elucidated in the letters to Bettie V. Jones is that of the revivalist spirit and increased moral awareness of southern Americans coupled with the institution of slavery. The collective conscience of the American South was at a crossroads in the 1850s; on one hand, the comfortably profitable lifestyle many southerners had grown accustomed to depended on slave labor as the backbone of their economic system while, conversely, the Third Great Awakening signified a renewal of vigor and strength in relation to the importance of personal religion. In 1845, some slaveholding states left the official Methodist Church to form their own branch, one that condoned slavery on the basis of moral justification by invoking God's will and the examples of slavery in the Bible. The Third Great Awakening focused on the intertwining of religion in the public and private sphere, a relationship that forced both community leaders and citizens to evaluate their beliefs in order to steer clear of hypocrisy. Bettie V. Jones, along with the other central Virginians who experienced the awakening, grappled with the inherent moral and social contradictions presented by religion and slavery that created an unsolvable dilemma, one that only a schism could reconcile."],"display_date":"1849 - 1856","search_date":"1852-12-31","locations":[{"id":13819,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3610,"title":"Washington Says Farewell to Dick Wallach\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-02-26","end_date":"1881-02-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 26, 1881, the <em>Evening Star</em> printed an article, 'A Noble Life' about Mr. Richard Wallach. Though he had not yet passed away, the city was already mourning his inevitable passing that was sure to come within days.  The residents of Washington, D.C. had been proud to call Richard Wallach their Mayor for several years, and news of his impending death caused many to reflect on the beneficial impact he had had on the city and the well-being of all who lived in it. ","While he was mayor the City Hall, which had previously acquired the bad name of 'the Buzzard's Roost,' was very unhospitable quarters for the noble army of jobbers and strikers, said the <em>Star</em>, describing how full of integrity Mr. Wallach was. That same day, the <em>National Republican</em> sang his praises in an article entitled, 'Waiting for Death': As a citizen he was enterprising, energetic, liberal, laboring zealously and faithfully for the city, which appreciated his efforts on her behalf. Clearly, 'Dick' Wallach's personal and professional integrity had manifested itself in his mayoral accomplishments; the man had set the bar for mayors in Washington's future.  Mr. Wallach passed away during the afternoon on March 4th, 1881. His funeral was attended by many prominent members of the community, black and white, male and female. ","What made Mr. Wallach's death so monumental to the Washington D.C. community was the fact that he symbolized all that education reform had done and was continuing to do for the community. Wallach had made education his primary concern, and he spent his long tenure in office striving to make the city's system better. This was very much in step with the rest of the South at the time. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, throughout the late 19th century South where progressive reform was deepening rapidly, school and educational reform was priority number one. The reasons were many, and pertained to both black and white schooling: the educational system didn't have the money to pay teachers or furnish schools, students weren't showing up, and literacy was abysmal, especially when compared to that of more Northern parts of the U.S.  Richard Wallach's death deeply saddened a community that had felt the benefits of his work right in their own homes."],"display_date":"February 26, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-26","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3614,"title":"Amherst County Citizens Petition for a Railroad \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1851-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["According to W.W. Scott's <em>History of Orange County</em>, the period of time between 1848 and 1860 was relatively serene and well-organized in that particular area of central Virginia. Following the United States' triumphant victory in the Mexican War of 1848, one of Virginia's sons and a decorated hero from the war, General Zachary Taylor, was elected President. The era that began in 1850 is known to historians as an age of industrial and public improvement; the legislature and citizenry of Amherst County, for example, petitioned for the construction of a railroad connection between the cities of Lynchburg and Charlottesville. In 1851, the citizens of Amherst County wrote a petition to the governing body in Richmond arguing the position that the state of Virginia would be well-served if a connecting branch was constructed in their district. Citing the unity, consistency, and harmony that would result from the completion of the railroad, they argued eloquently and persuasively in the three-page memorandum. Their request was granted, and the decision to improve public transportation in central Virginia was not without precedent; in the previous year, a section of the Blue Ridge Turnpike was opened to public travel. The roads were engineered by General William Mahone, a man remembered as one of countless connections and political acumen and commemorated by Scott for his exceptional work on the highways.","Transportation during the mid-nineteenth century was still dominated by horsepower, and the opening of the highways provided an easier, more efficient passage through and around the Blue Ridge Mountains. In addition, the Orange and Alexandria railroad company was given special access to a private lot off the turnpike to construct buildings and operate businesses, a provision that would have increased employment opportunities and drawn a more focused attention at that particular intersection of railway and road. In addition to desiring one grand, systematized improvement, the authors of the Amherst County memorandum cited the increased potential for economic prosperity that would surely follow the construction of the connecting branch.","During the 1850s and 1860s, railroad technology was booming. Building on the advancements of earlier rail-related endeavors, such as the Baltimore and Ohio rail line that was the first to evolve into a major system, the railways of mid-century transported not only material goods but also the promise of economic expansion and proliferation. As the railroad snaked its way through the American South, it brought with it untold benefits of increasing population and the amplified opportunity for financial benefit. The construction and opening of roads like the Fredericksburg and Valley Plank Road and the Blue Ridge Turnpike not only facilitated improved travel in central Virginia but also, through its conciliatory provisions with flourishing railroad companies, opened avenues of future economic gain. Amherst County residents were acutely aware of this and, through a strongly worded petition to Richmond, affected a fortuitous change."],"display_date":"1850 - 1851","search_date":"1850-12-31","locations":[{"id":13622,"lat":37.6048121175,"lng":-79.1451153205,"zoom":9,"place":"AMHERST, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3640,"title":"African American Vote Eliminated in Louisiana\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"10/19/00","end_date":"10/19/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In October of 1900 the African Americans of Louisiana did not vote. The newly implemented Poll Tax Qualifications eliminated their ability to do so. The total amount of white men that registered to vote was 102,723 against only 1,147 registered African American men. What was true of the state as a whole was equally true of individual parishes, as well. Fifteen parishes reported less than ten African Americans were able to register to vote. There was even only a single black man registered in the parish of St. Charles. The poll tax cut down the African American vote by roughly 130,000 men. Only about 35,000 whites had allowed themselves to be disenfranchised by the poll tax laws either because they do not value the ballot, or because of neglect or carelessness.","The voting situation in Louisiana in October of 1900 was not unique to this state alone. The Poll Tax Qualifications required each person registering to vote to pay a tax for their vote. The origin of the implementation of the poll tax rests in the development of the Populist Party of the 1880s and 1890s in the Southern United States. The Populist Party demanded a graduated income tax, government ownership of the railroads, a tariff for revenue only, the direct election of U.S. senators, and other measures designed to strengthen political democracy and give farmers economic parity with business and industry. The Populists in the South gave the Democrats the only competition they had seen in the polls since the end of Reconstruction. The competition became so intense that both parties pushed for African Americans to be able to vote in the election so that they could have their votes. However, the Democrats won, and when the Populists were defeated the Democrats implemented various laws into their state constitutions in order to disenfranchise the African American voter. After payment of a poll tax was made a pre-requisite to voting, very few blacks had enough money to pay for it, along with impoverished white citizens, thus eliminating their ability to register to vote. This poll tax lived on for several decades, until the Twenty-Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1964 declared poll taxes unconstitutional in all states. The large disparity between black voters and white voters in Louisiana, therefore, was common to southern states in 1900 because of the disabling poll tax."],"display_date":"October 19, 1900","search_date":"1900-10-19","locations":[{"id":5666,"lat":29.8836153938,"lng":-90.3630468207,"zoom":9,"place":"ST CHARLES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3643,"title":"Moses Austin&#39;s Final Move\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-07-17","end_date":"1830-07-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Moses Austin had been dead nine years when his final move came about. The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one. From politics to economics and the social realm, religion was an important influence in the South."],"display_date":"July 17, 1830","search_date":"1830-07-17","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3648,"title":"Settling the Debts of Robert Riddick\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-12-13","end_date":"1827-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On December 13, 1819, Joseph Prentis took over as the Executor of the will of the late Robert M. Riddick of Nansemond County due to the death of the named executor, Thomas Swepson. Mr. Riddick's will called for the disposal of his estate for the payment of his debts. However, Riddick stipulated that in order to raise the deficiency [the Executor was] fully authorized and requested to mortgage the lands and to hire out the slaves for the purpose. For the next eight years, Mr. Prentis hired out Riddick's slaves to neighboring farmers in order to pay off the debts of the deceased. At the time of his death, Robert Riddick owned eighteen slaves. This number, while not huge, was quite substantial and suggested a sizable agricultural operation. Although, when one looks at Mr. Prentis' description of the slaves and the value he placed on each, one can see that perhaps the number alone can be a bit misleading. ","Of the eighteen slaves Mr. Prentis listed in his account book on December 31, 1819, only six were adult males. Furthermore, of those six only two were considered valued over 300 and one of those, Tom Bray valued at 350, was well past his prime at forty-eight years of age. However, Armistead was valued at 500 because he was only eighteen years of age and presumably had a whole lifetime of labor in front of him. The only other male slave close to the value of Tom Bray and Armistead was a man named Jacob, described by Prentis as a small and weakly fellow forty two years old. The other three men were worthless or close to it. Dempsey, valued at 100, was approaching at fifty-five years old. The remaining two, Mingo and Jimmy, both were appraised at 0. Mingo was around seventy years old and very diseased having lost one eye and nearly blind in the other while Jimmy was about sixty years of age and listed as very decrepit. The twelve other slaves that constituted Robert Riddick's property were all adult females and their small children. Of these there were three adult women appraised at 300 or higher. These three were all between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-nine years old, prime childbearing ages."," Further reading into the account book of Mr. Prentis reveals that he was able to hire out Mr. Riddick's slaves to pay off the late man's debts, as directed in the will. Naturally, the amount received for each slave hired out makes sense when compared to their values listed earlier. In the year 1820, old Jimmy was hired out for only five dollars. The small and weak Jacob fetched 32.50 while fifty-five year-old Dempsey earned thirty dollars. Although much younger than Tom Bray, Armistead was hired out for 34 while Tom was hired for 55. Though one cannot be sure, this was probably due to the fact that the older Tom had some skill that was in demand by his temporary master."," The story of Robert Riddick, his slaves, and the posthumous management of his estate was a common one in the slave-holding South. Southern slaveholders, while wealthy in land and human property, did not have a lot of capital at their disposal and frequently purchased on credit which often plunged them into debt. The death of a slaveholder required that those debts be settled, and often that was accomplished through the hiring out of slaves to raise the money necessary to pay the creditors. This process was time-consuming but it allowed the late slaveholder's family to retain ownership of the slaves that a quick settlement of the estate (i.e. the auction of the slaves) would not accomplish. The amount of time it took to pay off the debts of a deceased slaveholder through the hiring of his slave property could vary greatly depending upon the size of his debts and the sex, age, and physical condition of his slaves. For example, the job of settling Riddick's debts may have taken less time if half of his slaves had been young, healthy males like Armistead. Richard Randolph a Prince Edward County slaveholder discussed in Ely's <em>Israel on the Appomattox</em>, owned a great number of slaves that were to be manumitted upon his death. However, his wife kept them in bondage for a further ten years until the debts could be settled. The fact that slaveholders were willing to wait years to pay off debts through slave-hiring speaks to the value of slave property in the antebellum South. Southerners would rather wait than loose their property forever in a quick sale."],"display_date":"December 13, 1819 - December 31, 1827","search_date":"1823-12-22","locations":[{"id":14070,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3653,"title":"Slave Management in Darlington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-10-13","end_date":"1852-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There were always fears of slave rebellions. In a letter dated October 13th, 1849, from E.W. Cooper, Thomas Cassels Law learned of a Negro insurrection in his home district of Darlington, South Carolina. Cooper served on an investigating committee to respond to the matter. Although they could not gather sufficient evidence to have the four leading insurrectionists hanged, they were lodged in jail and later sent out of the state. One of the enslaved men mentioned that word was spreading around Darlington that this was the last year the slaves would be held in bondage; white men traveling between Sumterville and Darlington City were apparently spreading the rumors. Cooper believed his own slaves were largely ignorant of the matter, but he warned Law, You had better keep a look out.","It is unclear how much of an impact this letter had on T.C. Law, but it is known that he was an active member of the Darlington Agricultural Society. In 1852, Thomas Cassels Law gave an address to the society entitled, Report on Management of Slaves - Duty of Overseers and Employers. Law's chief purpose was to give some insight in keeping an efficient and productive operation, and he incorporated an intricate analysis of the relationships between master and slave and overseer. He began, If slaves were brutes, as many seem to view them we might more easily point out their proper management, but they are human beings - morally accountable - committed to our care by a mysterious Providence, for, no doubt, a wise purpose. Law advocated for a moderate and constant work schedule for slaves, with proper intervals of rest. Yet, he also justified the use of the whip by citing scripture: he that spareth the rod hateth his child. Law recommended giving slaves a small plot that they could work in their off time and have a small notion of ownership. When the owner buys crops from his own slaves, it convinces them of your doing justice. ","As Law's report suggests, the relationship between master and slave was intricate and multi-faceted, layered with contradictions. Slaves were seen as racially inferior, yet still morally accountable human beings. Slaves were quite literally the property of their owners, and Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul </em>examines the reduction of human beings to financial numbers. Yet, Law and other planters found it immoral and improper to rule by simple and violent dominion over their chattel. Religious and racial convictions compelled white masters to treat slaves with paternalistic supervision. There was also a level of insecurity. So, giving a token piece of land to the slaves and convincing them of the justice of the system was a rational approach to slaveholding. Though men like Thomas Cassels Law may have applied the industry of slavery moderately and sensibly on their plantations, the existence of slaves as economic property was inherently dehumanizing."],"display_date":"October 13, 1849 - August 10, 1852","search_date":"1851-03-13","locations":[{"id":11496,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3664,"title":"Register of Free Negroes in Washington County, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-03-26","end_date":"1856-07-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Beginning in 1838, Washington County registered its 144 free blacks in a notebook by describing their physical attributes. Following regulations set by the state mandating free black registration, James H. Trufs journeyed to the county clerk's office to register himself. The first entry, which labels Trufs as number one, describes him as a dark mulatto. Included in the description is his age, height, and scars. Trufs had a small scar over his right eye, and a small scar on his left fore finger just below the upper joint. John Henderson Miles, number two, had three scars on the left arm, one of which was occasioned by a fork having been run through his arm. John Longley, number 40, obtained his defining scar by a tomahawk. Number 18, George Rush, who had several of his front teeth in his upper jaw missing, had a large scar on the inside of the right leg a little above the ankle occasioned by a scald. Just as noteworthy as the scars were the free blacks' occupations. The occupations included boot and shoemaker, barber, sadler, cabinet maker, farmers, wagoner, and housewife. Of equal note to the scars and occupations was just how these blacks obtained their freedom. Some were free born like Trufs, while Rosannah and Harvey Hill became emancipated by deed from John McCauley in court. Number eight, who had a large scar said to have been occasioned by a cut with a sickle, was emancipated by the will of Jonus Smyth, of the same name that Smyth County was derived. Number four, Theodore Sterrett, was emancipated by deed from Thomas Findlay. The Virginia General Assembly enforced Robert Craigton's will on March 23, 1836 by an act, which granted Delila Boyer her freedom.","Each piece of information noted by the county clerk was taken down with a certain purpose. The scars served as the defining physical characteristics for free blacks. The occupations showed which jobs black people took versus which jobs required education that they would be unable to hold, such as jobs in the printing industry. Finally, the details of their freedom were taken down to have written record in case anyone ever questioned a free black's legality. In the antebellum South, these records were kept like a census. They were only used against free blacks in the wake of major violence. Only in the immediate aftermath of Nat Turner's rebellion and other rebellions were free black registrations used as a list of possible suspects. Once the anxiety subsided, normal race relations between whites and free blacks resumed in a cordial state. Either way, there was a basic need to identify free blacks precisely. In the case of a rebellion, whites needed to know who their enemies were, and in the case of peace, whites needed to keep tabs on who the leaders of black society were for trading purposes and for maintaining race relations.","The information taken down for the records emphasized a stratified society. Blacks, on many of the entries, were not even given names, but were merely assigned a number to differentiate themselves. Furthermore, whereas whites were defined by their status, blacks were defined by how many scars they had and where they had gotten them. It seemed likely that some scars were the mark of white masters when the free blacks were slaves or just a consequence of racial tensions turned violent, because the descriptions of some of the scars seemed almost impossible to have occured naturally.","The very act of registering blacks displayed black inferiority. The very law that required free blacks to register at the county courthouse marked them as inferior in status. One of the aims of the free black registration law was to monitor the movement of free blacks between localities. White people had to make sure that the free blacks did not feel they were too free. The white lawmakers who instituted the law made sure that where the free blacks were free, they were not really free. Whites barred them from the rights and symbols associated with freedom, because the law presumed that all blacks were slaves, so free blacks had to have documents proving their freedom. Free blacks had to walk around with free papers, which they might have to show at any time. The entire concept of registering free blacks in Washington County reflected the inequality that existed for free blacks in southern society. Black people had to undergo so many obstacles that whites imposed on them in order to maintain safety within society. The free black registration underscored a large theme of complex race relations in the antebellum South, even for an activity that was done without violence."],"display_date":"March 26, 1838 - July 28, 1856","search_date":"1847-05-27","locations":[{"id":14341,"lat":36.7495375423,"lng":-81.8835070546,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3671,"title":"Reconstruction and the Ku Klux Klan \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-02-12","end_date":"1870-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Reverend Hamilton W.

In the years following the war, however, he settled down in Andersonville, Georgia, and sought to spread political voice to freedmen. His intentions were motivated by a humanitarian desire to assist the freedmen adjust to their new lives. His efforts at ensuring the enfranchisement of blacks did not go unnoticed, however. On February 12, 1869, a letter was waiting for Pierson when he arrived at his home. Adorned with a skull and cross bones at the top, it addressed him as Sir. Pierson was called a vagrant carpet-bagger and a scoundrel of the deepest dye for maliciously interfering in the political realm of the town. The threatening letter was from the white supremacist group, the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan warned him to stop his efforts at enfranchising blacks and leave the region immediately. If he failed to comply with their demands, they threatened to kill him. The letter concluded by stating that Congressional reconstruction, the military, nor anything else under Heaven could protect him should he decide to not abide by the group's orders.","Upon receiving the threatening letter from the KKK, Pierson left Andersonville and traveled to the nation's capital, Washington D.C. While there, he wrote a letter to United States Senator Charles Sumner detailing his experience. In addition, he included descriptions of various acts of violence against black citizens in the South, and demanded that they be addressed and punishments be enforced. In 1870, Congress passed the Force Acts to help end the violence and enforce the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of the Constitution.","The KKK was a secret society created during the Reconstruction era to intimidate blacks and white reformers. The white-supremacist group employed terrorizing methods towards individuals usually associated with the Republican Party. Northerners were often associated with the Republican Party by southerners. This elucidates the connection between Northerners and the term carpetbaggers. The term carpetbagger was used as a derogatory reference for northern whites who moved to the southern states during Reconstruction. They were often viewed as exploiters who were taking advantage of the economic, social, and political conditions of southern society for their own personal gain. Members of the KKK blamed the Republicans for overturning their social order and imposing restrictions on southern whites who had supported the Confederate war effort. They burned black-owned buildings, and terrorized and killed freedmen who tried to exercise their right to vote in elections. Unfortunately, their efforts were usually successful. However, due to the efforts of reformers such as Pierson who demanded that the government take action, the KKK gradually faded away."],"display_date":"February 12, 1869 - December 31, 1870","search_date":"1870-01-21","locations":[{"id":2224,"lat":32.0399997503,"lng":-84.1970888963,"zoom":9,"place":"SUMTER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3675,"title":"Chastisement of Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-11","end_date":"1864-06-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Emma Mordecai was enjoying the pleasantly cool weather when a very disagreeable affair concerning the servants disturbed her afternoon.

Zephaniah Turner raised this question repeatedly before the House of Delegates in Richmond. In the eyes of Turner, West Virginians were just as responsible for payment as Virginians, seeing as how the debt had existed before dismemberment of the state. Turner blasted Virginia's political representatives for rattling on about preserving honor when their priority should have been to prevent burdening the state's citizens with enormous taxes. When the people discover the unjust tax plans, Turner exclaimed, they would run out the current leaders and elevate to their places others who have less sublimated ideas of honor and fame and the past, and more practical ones as to the present and future."," In the aftermath of the Civil War, Virginia faced a significant economic hurdle-- a public debt of approximately 45 million. Although the debt, initially used to fund transportation initiatives like railroads and canals, started out as 33 million prior to war, the amount had swelled to its present state. Debates ensued over how to pay this sum. Since the westernmost counties of Virginia had only established the new state of West Virginia in 1863, some, like Turner, argued that the debt belonged to West Virginia as well and thus Virginians were not legally bound to pay anything. However, the main controversy of 1871 became whether Virginia should fund its entire debt plus interest or pay at a readjusted (reduced) level. This battle catalyzed the formation of two factions, the Funders and the Readjusters."," In 1871 the state government passed the Funding Act. This legislation pledged Virginia to pay the debt in full, marking the state as the only southern postwar government to fund its debt at such a high rate. As rationale, Funders pointed to the importance of saving the honor of Virginia, although additional motivation came from the fact that many were looking to profit from their state bonds. The Funders' decision eventually proved to be a strain for Virginia as it exhausted the state of its revenues and forced it to borrow just to continue operating its government. Leaders also severed funding for social services such as asylums, encouraged skyrocketing property taxes, and enforced new taxation on items such as dogs and liquor consumption. In addition, although constitutional requirements demanded the state to assume most of the cost of the new public school system, the Funders instead chose to shut down half of its schools, citing public education as a luxury.

According to an ordinance passed on September 8, 1873, no vehicle of any kind was allowed to traverse that specific lane, the most important and populous street of the city. The F&P Railroad Company, on the other hand, charged that when Richmond chartered the company in 1834, the city specifically granted the company's directors the power to place whatever vehicles they deemed necessary on the railroads. The court eventually ruled in favor of Richmond, deciding that the city's inherent right to guard the safety and welfare of its citizens did not violate any contract between Richmond and the F&P Railroad Company."," In the Reconstruction-era South, railroads played a prominent role, expanding in number (mileage doubled in the years from 1865 to 1880) while functioning as a symbol for urban development and economic growth.

By the time of the case, however, Broad Street had become a site of many retail businesses and served as a bustling tourist site. "," At the same time, railroad companies suffered their share of critics. Many felt that the railroads exploited their lack of supervision to act like institutions beyond the reach of legislatures or courts. For example, railroads often charged excessively high fees, but denounced suggestions of rate regulations as violations of private property rights.

Northern leaders had degraded you and themselves, he criticized, by inviting the co-operation of the black race with Abraham Lincoln's proclamation freeing slaves in the Confederacy and inviting them into the North's army and navy. Just before, the Union had been condemning the South for seeking the intervention of the white French and English. "," In response to Lincoln's actions, Davis issued a statement of his own, declaring slave status for all free blacks in the South. Captured black Union soldiers would also be deemed chattel, as would all African Americans in any states taken by the Confederacy. Slavery is a corner-stone of a Western Republic, Davis emphasized, and the proper condition of the negro is slavery, or a complete subjection to the white man. "," The Confederate President composed his address during a bleak time for the South. A few months earlier, Southern troops had suffered defeats in both Kentucky and Maryland, obliterating any hopes of recognition and aid from England or any other European nations. Davis knew that Great Britain would not risk involvement in the conflict unless signs clearly pointed toward a Confederate victory. In addition, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation provided the North with the moral upper hand in the eyes of anti-slavery England and France. The South recognized its need to defend itself as the elimination of slavery became a major goal of the North, which had initially put forth preservation of the Union as its primary aim above all else. "," Davis' reference to blacks in the Union military reflected another significant difference between the North and the South. The North employed African Americans even before Lincoln's declaration; Union commanders sometimes recruited black troops, and in 1862 the War Department sanctioned the recruitment of African Americans. By the end of the war, almost one out of every ten Union soldiers was African American.

During debates for the December Legislative session, several people, including the governor, presented their opinions to defend the bank. Benjamin Yancey, after summarizing the previous remarks, passionately defended the bank. He provided a brief history of the bank in the state and differentiated it from the national bank. He explained why the state bank has served a public good even though most citizens were unaware of it. The bank, according to Yancey, had paid profits into the state treasury department that went to pay off public debt that financed public projects. Furthermore, the bank had never been in better condition and was financially sound where all available assets met its liabilities. Another example of the public good given emphatically was the loan to the Georgia Rail Road Banking Company. This loan provided resources to a company that would build railroads that will bring more connections to the state and bring in untold millions. Finally, Yancey demonstrated how the bank had kept the prices of slaves from depreciating. He cited an example in Alabama to persuade others to realize without the bank, the economy would not be in good shape. ","As seen during the 1830's, the issue of the bank of the United States became ever more important. The historian Michael O'Brien discusses the role Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun played in matters of the bank of the United States. O'Brien provides support to the position that the bank played a very important role in politics.

Calhoun, Congress passed a bill concerning the admission of California as a state. The bill, classified as unfair to the Southern cause by the Keowee Courier, was protested by Southern senators in particular Senator Badger. The Courier reflected on the prudence of how to protect Southern rights within the senate proceedings. Concerns were expressed regarding what the future would hold in store if California were admitted in the Union as a free state. The great discussion involved several senators, Badger, Downs and Pratt, and whether or not they should enter a formal protest into the bill. Debates continued in the House of Representatives and involved whether or not to establish a territorial government for Utah. Nevertheless, the Bill passed the Senate with Senator Pratt of Maryland voting against the bill and Senators Downs and Badger abstained from voting on the bill. ","The compromise of 1850 had a tremendous effect on the country. Both Northern and Southern loyalists felt the compromise weakened their positions. As argued in the book, The Civil War and Reconstruction, Henry Clay, usually given credit for enabling a compromise, did play a pivotal role, but he did not lay out all of the terms of a compromise. Clay's dramatic Senate speech early on in the year summed up his life as a politician and continued the approach that slavery was bad and evil but did little to actually bring it to an end. Calhoun, before his death, gave a speech in the Senate saying how the union had lost its old republic sense that the hostility towards the South and slavery had to be stopped or else secession could be justified. Donald, Baker and Holt provide evidence to support that point and seem to indicate that secession could be close at hand.

The project was being headed up by four commissioners who would be in charge of deciding who will complete the project. An article in the Greenville Mountaineer informed readers that they should contact one of the following people: FR. Alexander, WM. S. Mills, Richard Morris, M.R. Alexander. ","One of the main policy objectives of the Whig Party was to improve the infrastructure within states with government money. This policy conflicted directly with the Democratic position, mainly against President Andrew Jackson who fought against unnecessary government spending. The turnpike in South Carolina required funding from the state and Whig support. ","As the Whigs continued to build support, projects such as this became more popular and feasible. As the decades continued to pass, railroad construction became a more important issue and encouraged the debate of how to allocate state funds. The historian Walter Edgar cites that as early as 1827, the South Carolina Canal and Railroad Company came into existence and played an important role. Edgar's evidence emphasizes the role played by infrastructure and transportation within South Carolina. ","This narrative reflects the growth of statewide infrastructure and corresponds to the national debates of the proper role of government in the economy.

For example, while slave traders attempted to sell him, he suffered because he was considered too white and spent time in horrible slave conditions as a result. After settling in South Carolina, he decided to escape numerous times but was always caught. He received as punishment numerous floggings and lashings; he was also chained and beaten. Those conditions only made him more determined to gain his freedom. He eventually escaped because he was white enough to convince others he was not a slave. He eventually reached Liverpool, England.

Overall, the treatment of slaves, as argued by Donald, Baker and Holt, reflected the white supremacists' views that they were fundamentally different than whites. Roper's narrative also reflects the treatment of mulattos since even some black blood in a person meant that a person did not deserve freedom. After arriving in England, he joined a Christian Church even though he was not allowed to practice in the Christian Church in America because he was a slave.

The years leading up to the affair were full of bargains, compromises, and violent encounters that transcended both racial and societal lines. On January 7, 1847, many newspapers distributed articles focusing on the ongoing war with Mexico. The dispute increased social and political unrest back east, and the decision of whether or not to allow slavery in the new lands previously occupied by Mexicans was at or near the top of the agenda. In an attempt to bolster and create a harmonious atmosphere in the nation's capital, the news publication The National Era ran an article proclaiming the importance of order and abstinence from violence in the District at such a perilous time. The most threatening concern expressed in the article was the importance of keeping the city running smoothly and peacefully, despite widespread domestic turmoil. The citizens of Washington felt this was vital because visiting foreign diplomats saw Washington as a picture or representation of the nation as a whole. Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the city in order to secure positive foreign relations. After all, if anarchy existed in the city of Washington, then visiting foreign diplomats would be less inclined to trade or do business and would also leave with a poor impression of Americans and republican liberty in general. The gradual emergence of a world economy built upon trading was fundamental to the existence of both the North and South. This futuristic ideal economy requires, at the very least, peaceful conditions back in Washington so as to promote the kind of city-on-a-hill atmosphere that will attract foreign support. Richmond for example, saw an increase in urban population and a rise of new professions such as prostitution - which could yield a livable economic income at the time. After further examination, Joshua Rothman pointed out that resources were scarce and consequently, prostitutes constantly assaulted one another in public. If upon arrival foreign ambassadors or diplomats were greeted with a scene similar to the picture Rothman paints of Richmond, then their view of Washington would no doubt be negative, and therefore detrimental to the reputation, accountability, and future existence of the nation as a whole."],"display_date":"January 7, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-07","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3700,"title":"Twelve Years a Slave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-02","end_date":"1853-01-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The memoirs of Solomon Northup vividly portrayed the descent of a former New York freedman into the harsh system of slavery faced by many African Americans living in the antebellum South. Few people probably recalled January 4, 1853, as a significant day in the history of the United States. However, on this day a very important meeting was being held in the small town of Marksville, Louisiana, and the fate of one man was changed forever. For this day marked the release of Solomon Northup from years of involuntary servitude after being deceived and forced into slavery against his will while visiting the city of Washington.Solomon was not the first slave, nor the last, to be set free from the chains of slavery. What makes his story stand out, however, is that he was not born a slave; he had worked various jobs throughout his lifetime, always looking to better the lives of his family. It was this desire to provide a better life for his family that led him to take a job offer that would forever change his life. While working in Saratoga Springs, New York, Solomon met two white men named Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton who offered Northup a job providing musical entertainment for the circus. They said the circus was currently located in Washington, D.C., but would be traveling back North; Solomon agreed to take the trip.  Although free blacks traveling through areas where slavery was legal could acquire papers as proof of freedom, documentation was not always a guarantee of safety.  In Washington, Solomon was captured at a bar, presumably drugged, and woke up a few days later, ill from his poisoning, alone in the darkness of a basement in chains.  He had been robbed of his documents, money, and ultimately his freedom. Slave traders used a variety of tactics to illegally enslave freedmen, whether by force or physical violence, or, as in Solomon's case, by tricking, drugging, and other deceitful means.  At the threat of death, Solomon was silenced and shipped to Louisiana where he spent twelve years doing hard labor. In the novel Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson, he reiterates this harsh reality by stating that, none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known, so they were sold with new ones. Although Mr. Northup sought to bring his captors to trial, they were never prosecuted and he mysteriously disappeared. To this day, Solomon's burial site has not been identified and it is still not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured, or died of natural causes. Walter Johnson best describes Northup's experience: despite the fact that he was able to achieve his restitution of freedom, he met the same end as many African Americans from that time; unexplainable, undocumented, and seemingly unnoticed disappearance."],"display_date":"January 2, 1853 - January 4, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3702,"title":"Prospectus for 1850\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-12-13","end_date":"1849-12-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the antebellum period newspapers frequently published editorials that prophesized the events to come. These special prospectuses gave readers a direct insight into the minds of the editors by outlining their principles and beliefs. The National Era was a weekly abolitionist newspaper and the editor of the paper, Mr. Bailey, was interested in publishing literary ideas as well as developments and changes taking place during this period of history.Many of these prophecies did indeed come true as illustrated by one of Mr. Bailey's arguments, which essentially stated that federal legislation ought to be amended so as to place a limit on the President's time in office. The ratifications of the twenty-second amendment ratified on February 27, 1951, provided that, No person shall be elected to the office of President of the United States more than twice. Therefore, Bailey's prediction proved to be valid, despite being a hundred years overdue. In a way, many of Bailey's predictions proved to be more valid than the speculations from Edward Bellamy's famous work Looking backward: 2000-1887. For example, Bellamy predicts cheaper costs for education in the years to come for public schools, when in fact tuition rates and student debts have been gradually increasing over time. Though many of the penny press' so called prospectuses did shed some insight on the future to come, they also had an ambivalent side with predictions so vague that they easily could have some aspects of truth.

Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press. In an article published on March 12, 1857, The National Era ran an explanatory article breaking down the case and illustrating its ramifications.The article pointed out that, with the Dred Scott ruling, an African American could never become a citizen of the United States. More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable. If he or she were the victim of the ever-increasing practice of kidnapping free blacks and selling them back into slavery as with Solomon Northup, a freeborn person of color, then that person would have no means to pursue any kind of defense in their name. Though it was certainly not the only account of its kind, Northup's story began in New York where he was lured with tales of lucrative labor opportunities to Washington, D.C. There, he was drugged, threatened with death if he told anyone the truth about his true identity, and put on a boat bound for New Orleans where he would work as a slave for almost twelve years. Upon reviewing Northup's memoirs, Walter Johnson concluded Northup's account centered on a single question: who can be trusted?

Many rumors circulated about secret deals with foreign countries in exchange for economic and Republican support. One particular rumor published in an article from the Farmer's Cabinet concerned the possibility of a United States acquisition of all Nicaraguan lands in exchange for help establishing a firm and stable government. The authors pre-disposition against the British was quite apparent as the author went so far as to blame them for creating a treaty with Nicaragua to debunk the United States' plans for expansion into Latin America. This geopolitical chess game is not an unfamiliar scene in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There were many occasions when it was rumored that Washington had already worked out plans with a foreign nation only to discover later that such a possibility could never exist. Only a few weeks after this article was published, the Panama Railway opened, becoming the first railway to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The influence of articles like the one from the Farmer's Cabinet helped to keep Washington in check. Furthermore, without discussion of the possibilities of expanding the national boundaries, it would be nearly impossible for a democratic government to get enough sources of information to make a clear and rational decision on the proper course of action.

Though he was clearly disgusted over imperialist actions taken by the United States in the West, which upset the delicate balance between free and slave states, his will and conviction appeared to be weakening.Merely six days later, the Senate ratified the treaty and America gained five hundred twenty-five thousand square miles of territory at a net cost of just under twenty million U.S. dollars. Daniel Webster had every right to be skeptical of the suspicious circumstances that surrounded the acquisition of the formerly Mexican lands. Trist negotiated the treaty without President Polk's prior consent, but Polk later agreed to the treaty and sent it to Congress to be ratified. Finally, in May of 1848, Mexican officials agreed to the terms, and the war was officially over. Richard Winders, a historian and former Curator for the Alamo, even went as far as to make the point that the United States' War with Mexico doomed the two great parties of the era by forcing their associates to take sides on the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories and indirectly on the future of the institution of slavery itself. In hindsight, Webster's fear of instability stemming from the new lands was correct, but at the time, the majority of Congress disagreed and Webster settled for peace, despite his unwavering certainty that it would be short lived.

A seat of racial tension, particularly because of an established African American population that controlled many prestigious government and military positions, Hamburg had undergone nearly eleven years of Reconstruction that had, in the opinion of South Carolinian Sam Aleckson, brought some \"tranquility to the state and people.\" Nonetheless, the success of Reconstruction (especially in Hamburg) was blemished when a white Ku Klux Klan mob assaulted a black militia group led by South Carolina National Guard Captain Doc L. Adams. ","    At the time of the incident, Adams' regiment had been parading legally on the streets of Hamburg in celebration of the Fourth of July. Two white men, Messrs. Henry Gatzen and Thomas Butler, approached them and instructed them to move to the side of the road, which they did begrudgingly. This action, however, was not enough for Mr. Butler, and he reported the militia company for \"obstructing the highway\" to the local trial justice, Mr. Prince Rivers, who printed out a warrant against Capt. Adams. This action Mr. Butler carried out in accordance with South Carolina law. The second action Mr. Butler took, however, was much less lawful. Butler related the stubborn response of the militia company to his cousin, General M.C. Butler (an ex-Confederate general and a participant in Ku Klux Klan activities), who took the law into his own hands, demanding that the militia company turn over its legally-held weaponry as well as summoning an armed mob from Augusta, Georgia, to assault the black National Guard regiment.","    Soon after, Butler's mob forced the militia men into a local house and threatened to blow up the house with cannon fire. Weary of this threat, the militia company escaped the building, but was unable to evade General Butler's mob, which murdered five and severely wounded three of the captured African Americans. This violence occurred for no other reason than the company's immediate refusal to move from a public road.","    The Hamburg Fourth of July incident, while cheerless in outcome, portrays race relations in South Carolina during Reconstruction, specifically whites' blunt refusal to end antebellum traditions and accept society's newly freed members.

According to the local newspaper, <em>The Spectator</em>, upon arrival at the excursion's destination \"[t]he day was pleasantly spent in amusements and games of different kinds-ten pins, croquet, dancing, &c.\"  Such activity was a relatively common feature of the temperance movement in the American South after the Civil War.  The main goal of this movement was to eliminate, or at least reduce, alcohol consumption among the populace.  According to historian Thomas Pegram, the movement was filled largely with women who often engaged in public, grassroots activities to spread their message.

He worked often to secure the individual rights of freedmen that many white southerners worked to undermine.

Historian Eric Foner notes that General Weitzel, the U.S. Army commander at Richmond, had \"ordered that before receiving assistance, whites take an oath of loyalty and blacks sign labor contracts,\" forcing the freedmen into essentially a less glorified version of slavery for the sake of the South's economy. The soldiers carried out the harsh orders of the U.S. Army lest they face the consequences of desertion: death.

A leather-bound book as tall as a man's forearm with robin's egg blue pages was then opened reverently, and a man's voice read aloud the last meeting's minutes.  After he finished, his hand held a pen poised above the first line of a new page, ready to record in flowing script the minutes of the newest meeting of the Philosophian Society.  ","The Society met to discuss important philosophical, historical, and contemporary issues.  During a typical meeting the members decided on a small question to discuss immediately and another question to more seriously and thoroughly debate at a later time.  For the postponed debate, specific members - often teams of two or more - were assigned positions in favor or against and given several weeks to prepare.","The March 22, 1861 meeting exemplifies the Philosophian Society's typical blend of topics.  The immediate discussion questioned whether Joan of Arc was an enthusiast or imposter.  For official debate, the men considered if \"a man [was] justified in obeying a law of his country which he [felt] to be morally wrong?\"  While the Philosophian Society covered both ancient and current issues, the minutes reveal that its members felt the latter to be more important because of the ratio of time and effort spent on each.  At the conclusion of the debate on April 5, 1861, the secretary recorded the Philosophian Society's decision: a man was <em>not</em> justified in obeying laws he felt morally wrong.  The Society's emphasis on contemporary issues also included the admittance of free  states into the Southern Confederacy, the taking of Fort Sumter immediately following secession, and the prohibition of the slave trade in the Southern Confederacy's constitution.  ","Furman's Philosophian Society mirrored the larger trend by addressing the divisive and emotionally charged topics of religion, politics, and war.  According to Jonathan Daniel Wells, debate was not limited to collegiate societies, like those at Furman or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but spread into the wider southern population.  Southerners established literary and debating societies to open dialogues in which they willingly and safely discussed such controversial issues for both education and entertainment.  Stephen Ash's depiction of John Robertson illustrates the importance of a safe forum.  John Robertson, an East  Tennessean who supported the Confederacy in a largely Unionist area, experienced violent and destructive persecution because of his beliefs.  Wells suggests that debating societies allowed people of different opinions to present their contradicting views in a civil manner without fear of retribution.","These southern societies applied their northern predecessors' models of organization and operation even as the gap widened between northern and southern states.  They grew in number and popularity as the middle class enlarged, serving an important centralizing and community-building function in a south divided by limited transportation systems and scattered populations.

Randolph, representative of Albemarle  County, gave a speech in regards to possible emancipation within the state.  Although it was 1832 at the time of this address, the proposed plan that Randolph spoke about would only affect slaves born after 1840 and would take 80 years to complete.  Virginians would hold male and female slaves until they reached the ages of 18 and 21.  Upon this age, the state would remove the slaves from the Commonwealth.  This produced a heated debate among Virginia leaders, and Randolph sought to promote the plan; at the very least, he wanted to propose the idea to all the constituents of Virginia.     ","            The Virginia emancipation debate of the 1830s rarely consisted of extreme abolitionist views.  However, some Virginians did have opinions about whether or not the institution of slavery was politically and economically necessary.  Randolph suggested that the gradual emancipation plan would not hurt the state economically, as it \"levies no money tax upon the people - each slave pays his own removal by his hire.\"  He argued that slaves would still be in the state until they reached adulthood, and even afterwards, they could be sold to other southern states for a profit.  Politically, Randolph argued that since the plan would take a full 80 years, its effects would not be sudden.  He said even if negative consequences emerged, then \"a repeal of the law\" would bring things back to the 1832 standard.  ","            In addition to the political and economic aspects of gradual emancipation, Randolph discussed the immorality of slavery.  He pointed out that slavery was not justified by the fact that other lands practiced it.  He argued that \"upon the same principle he could justify...plurality of wives...,murder...,\" and other endeavors that Americans considered wrong, but which took place in other areas.  Furthermore, he criticized the many Southerners who used the Bible to justify slavery.  He highlighted the Biblical passages that actually made slavery a dishonorable practice, such as \"that which teaches charity, justice, and good will to all.\"  At a time when southerners rarely questioned the morality of slavery's moral aspect, Randolph clearly took a risk in some of his arguments.","            Following his political, economic, and moral reasoning, Randolph exploited southerners' anxieties regarding slaves in order to advance his argument.  The Nat Turner Rebellion, which led to the deaths of many Virginians, afflicted fear upon the state and led some to question the institution of slavery.  Randolph argued that if gradual emancipation and removal were not put into effect, then the slave population would grow and become uncontrollable.  He said this group could potentially be found \"burning with enthusiasm for the liberation of their race\" and rebel.  Even with this daunting point, there were still many listeners who opposed Randolph's strong democratic views.  Randolph therefore implored that his fellow delegates at least propose the plan to their constituents in order to decide what step to take next.  Mostly western Virginians, along with the state's governor and a few legislators, applauded Randolph's idea. However, other eastern Virginians such as William Brodnax thought it was \"a scheme...destined to produce 30 years of domestic warfare...(and)...to make every patriarch a child-seller.\"   Various ideas emerged following Jefferson's proposal, including Brodnax's plan for immediate deportation, many elitists' hope to discontinue the debate all together, and Archibald Bryce's \"abstract affirmation of colonization.\"  Randolph supported Bryce in hopes to start any sort of emancipation movement. Legislators debated Bryce's plan to fund the deportation of blacks but ultimately only passed it in the House without confirming it in the Senate.  Thus, although, Virginia adopted what historian William Freehling calls \"an ambivalent, ineffective colonization experiment,\" the power struggle between eastern elitists and western egalitarians was significant.  It foreshadowed the tension in Virginia that would persist for decades to come.

In <em>The Mariner's Chronicle</em>, one gentleman on board described the scene in the boiler room as a \"complete wreck - a picture of destruction\".  He witnessed one man with \"the whole of the forehead blown away: the brains were still beating.  Tufts of hair, shreds of clothing, and splotches of blood might be seen in every direction\".  Outside the boiler room \"on every side were to be heard groans and mingled exclamations of grief and despair\" as men and women dealt with the injured.  One man's face \"was entirely black; his body without a particle of skin.  He had been flayed alive\".  To witness such horrors - fellow passengers in pain, near death, and begging for death to \"free them from present suffering\" - devastated the survivors.  The gentleman judged that between forty and fifty people perished either instantly, from injury, from inhaling steam or gas, or from drowning.  "," No doubt people faced danger when traveling during the 19th century.   John Burke in \"Bursting Boilers and Federal Power\" stated that between 1816 and 1848 about 233 steamboat explosions occurred.  The lack of regulation on the boilers at that time contributed to most of the accidents.  Steamboat explosions caused the loss of goods affecting the economy as well as the loss of lives affecting each individual and each family.  Ultimately, the loss of lives and goods played a crucial role in affecting American history.  The number of lives lost compelled American legislation to question how steamboats could become safer and whether federal power had the right to create regulatory agencies.    ","In 1824, the <em>Gibbons v Ogden</em> ruling handed down by Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that \"the power to regulate commerce, so far as it extends, is exclusively vested in Congress\" allowing Congress to regulate private business and to interfere where government had never interfered before.  As more steamboat explosions killed more lives, the American people reacted.  In 1830, Secretary of Treasury Samuel D. Ingham gave money to The Franklin Institute to experiment and inspect steam engine boilers.  The combination of the number of deaths due to explosions and the data from the experiments forced the Steamboat Act of 1838 to become law.  The Steamboat Act of 1852 established the Steamboat Inspection Service, one of the first federal agency to regulate private industry, allowing the Act of 1838 to be enforced by a government agency.  Aside from safer traveling, the impact of this legislation still affects Americans.  John Ward in \"The Future of an Explosion\" further explained, \"From that distant carnage on the rivers of the West came the Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and all the other government regulatory and investigative agencies that seek to protect us today\".  A steamboat explosion occurring in 1830 changed the lives of Americans far after other transportation replaced steamboats.  The loss of human life makes a difference."],"display_date":"February 24, 1830","search_date":"1830-02-24","locations":[{"id":12366,"lat":35.2121822757,"lng":-89.8820367379,"zoom":9,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3915,"title":"The Outcast of Virginia\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-08","end_date":"1832-12-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            \"A Voice from Louisa\" wrote to the <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> in December 1832 with the hope that a man like John Tyler would not be elected as a United States Senator once again.

Additionally, he was the only Democrat in the Senate to oppose an act allowing the federal government to ignore South Carolina's policy of nullification.  In January 1833, Virginia's legislature resolved not to sanction nullification, further opposing Tyler's personal belief in states' rights.

To use the words of her editors, the Gazette continued printing \" at a cost and trouble of which many of our readers have not the least conception; for if they had, there would not be so many who would still withhold what they owe us for our labor.\" ","    The war cost the Confederacy a great deal of resources, making simple and everyday items and foodstuffs scarce. The South sent its young men off to fight the North, which meant that they also sent off a majority of their farmers to go fight. Conscription was strict and only a small demographic of men were exempt from service. The Confederacy exempted only those planters owning twenty or more slaves and those that grew food crops only. Planters and the Confederacy could not waste land on cotton. The women and young sons of these soldier-farmers had a hard time bringing in the harvest without the extra labor of fathers and older brothers or sons, so food was scarce. The slaves also found it easier to resist their mistresses or run away with their masters and overseers away at war. Even a number of slaves were drawn away from the fields to fight alongside or serve the Confederate Army. Historian William Blair writes \"large-scale farmers on whom the burden of production now rested felt besieged by their own people, as nonproducers and the poor clamored for regulated prices on foodstuffs and the Confederacy demanded slaves for production and military work.\" The Richmond Bread Riot in 1863, when 68 women were arrested in the Richmond market after causing a ruckus and breaking into shops to steal bread, illustrated these tensions.","    Not only could the Confederacy not produce enough food, but the Union Army also destroyed what little they had when marching through Southern towns. Blair writes of the destruction the Union Army doled out within \"a five-mile radius around Dayton\" in the Shenandoah Valley. Blair states that the Union Army burned and killed \"a total of 2,000 barns filled with wheat, hay, and implements; seventy mills filled with grain; and roughly 4,000 head of livestock.\" This lack of supplies, coupled with the Confederacy continuously printing its own unbacked paper money and raising the inflation rate, effectively crippled the South's economy. Thus when the Gazette asked for repayment, it offered a variety of methods to pay off amassed debts: \"we will take from those in arrears, 1 in specie, 1 bushel of wheat, 1 1/8 bushels of corn, 7 pounds of good bacon or butter, 75 pounds of clean rags, or a half load of wood for each year as may best suit subscribers.\""],"display_date":"April 27, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-27","locations":[{"id":14234,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3953,"title":"Scandals and Public Discourse: The Beecher/Tilton Affair in the Atlanta Constitution\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-11-02","end_date":"1876-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The accusations of adultery against Henry Ward Beecher caused a great stir in public discourse in the late nineteenth century.  Beginning in 1872, when Victoria Woodhull published in <em>Woodhull and Clafin's Weekly</em> an account of the affair between the famed pastor, Beecher, and his parishioner, Elizabeth Tilton, the scandal captivated the public. The details of the affair and its aftermath were complicated and convoluted. At first, Beecher chose to ignore Woodhull's initial accusation, which seemed to be a logical strategy as she was notorious for creating scandal. As time went on though, and adultery accusations accumulated, events escalated and Beecher was forced to take the defensive. Elizabeth Tilton's husband, Theodore, filed suit against his former friend, Beecher, in 1875. Elizabeth Tilton presented contradictory evidence before, during and after the trial stating at different times that Beecher was innocent or that he was guilty.  Due to inconclusive evidence, contradictory accounts presented in the case, and an indecisive jury, Beecher was exonerated. Because of their involvement in the trial, Elizabeth and Theodore Tilton, who by the end of the case were no longer married, among others were excommunicated from Beecher's church. ","As a case study of public discourse in reference to the trial, the newspaper, <em>The Atlanta Constitution,</em> handled the events within the scope of a nation with a shifting structure and societal values.  In fact, the case was so etched in rhetoric indicative of  the changing era that even as late as 1895 an <em>Atlanta Constitution</em> article tried to make sense of what happened by stating that Elizabeth Tilton was hypnotized, which was why she acted in such contradictory ways. According to historian, Altina Waller, the case excited public discourse to such an extent because it was a representation of the power struggle and breakdown of traditional structure in the post- Civil War society. Beecher and Tilton entered the trial as anomalies to traditional structure. Beecher was a prominent liberal Christian and both he and Tilton were involved in the promotion of women's rights and other radical reform movements. Yet in the trial, Beecher tried to present himself as more moderate than Tilton so as to have an attractive case to more people which shows that even Beecher acknowledged that people may not have been ready for some of his progressive ideas.  Despite this, the progressives still supported Beecher and the traditionalists took up the cause, not necessarily for Tilton but against Beecher. The conflict of the trial turned into one between progressives and traditionalists and became a symbol of people's attempt to understand and adapt to social changes.  By the end of the trial, neither man was fully exonerated in the eyes of the public. The trial became emblematic of the vices of the struggle between progressives and traditionalists.","Through various articles, the <em>Constitution </em>supported Waller's view and highlighted the impact of the case on public discourse in that it often explains the volatile nature of discussion of the case and also served as bank of impassioned rhetoric. For example, in the article \"Fighting About Beecher Trial,\" the <em>Constitution</em> stated that people discussed the trial and became so heated in their arguments that certain bars had to ban the discussion of the Beecher trial to prevent violence. The <em>Constitution </em>also emphasized the misdemeanors of all involved in the trial. The majority of the articles did not approve of either Beecher or Tilton's actions and illustrated them as adulterous and evil. Beecher, in particular, was made to be a villain in the paper since he was supposed to have been a pious man, yet was accused of adultery and manipulation. Through the disapproval of the actions of Beecher and Tilton in the trial, the <em>Constitution </em>discredited new social systems and upheld more traditional values.

Over two hundred listeners gathered for a picnic at the local Fisher's Hill one July morning in 1888.  The event was relaxed with picnic food, a speech, and a Woodstock Cornet Band for entertainment.  Yet it focused on an issue of substantial importance: temperance.  As the local <em>Strasburg Weekly Dots</em> paper reported, the theme of the picnic was \"Liquor Traffic is a Crime\" and Virginians gathered in their common belief that alcohol was unnecessary and unjust.  ","The idea of temperance that the people of Shenandoah County promoted was not isolated to their area. Beginning around the 1830s, many Southerners, especially women, started to worry about the negative aspects of alcohol consumption.  One of the most important temperance organizations was the Women's Christian Temperance Union, created in 1874.  Other local temperance efforts, such as this picnic, occurred throughout the nineteenth century.  ","Religious and racial tensions plagued many temperance efforts. Most of the temperance women were evangelical Protestants who often criticized the Irish Catholics and Germans frequently associated with alcohol consumption and production.  Discord also existed between blacks and whites, as some white women claimed that black men were especially a danger with alcohol.  Although these apprehensions existed, for the most part the temperance movement was successful in incorporating women of various \"socio-economic, racial, religious, and national identities.\" Many women used the Bible to justify temperance; they claimed that it was God's plan for women to help the men and \"most commonly likened women...to Christ's apostles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dots</em> does not mention the demographic or religious background of the picnic's guests having had any effect; in fact, it says there \"was no disorder.\" This furthers the idea that locals were unified by a common aspiration. ","Although temperance is traditionally associated with women against alcohol consumption, at the time, it was just as important in promoting white women's overall equality.  For example, the WCTU helped educate women \"to take on public personas because the nineteenth century offered [them] limited formal education in rhetoric.\"  Often, people saw the strive for equality as radical.  Thus, as historian Carol Mattingly writes, \"newspaper reporting focused largely on issues of gender rather than on the subject of temperance\" which she says \"reflects a general discomfort with women's changing roles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dot</em>s, on the other hand, presents an article focused on the issue of temperance as opposed to gender.  This is likely because the focus of their gathering was \"not yet Congress, Legislature, Judge, Jury, Church or state;...but the Rum Traffic, was the prisoner at the bar.\" Long-term changes for women, such as the Nineteenth Amendment, would not occur for some time. Still, the nineteenth-century temperance movement fueled the steps towards gender equality.  Events such as the Shenandoah County Temperance Picnic, although small, represented a larger movement that took place throughout the South."],"display_date":"June 28, 1888","search_date":"1888-06-28","locations":[{"id":14271,"lat":38.8584536791,"lng":-78.5704125087,"zoom":9,"place":"SHENANDOAH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3956,"title":"The Education of African Americans After the Civil War\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-01-01","end_date":"1886-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"Our crops are poor on account of too much wet in the summer which prevented us from working with them,\" John McClure, a resident of Albemarle  County, wrote to his aunt and uncle.  He went on to explain that \"with what little (crops) we have to sell won't bring enough to pay for the expense of raising it.\"  Other such maladies that McClure noted were that the livestock was not selling for a sufficient amount, that many people were ill and dying, and that \"this portion of Virginia has suffered very much with hay cholera,\" which made farmers' meat suffer.  The most challenging trouble he described was the state's economic position, which furthered the racial equality dispute.","After the war, much of the South experienced high debt.  Thus, the government was hesitant to fund certain programs but did raise taxes in order to appropriate money for public education.  Proponents of this had various rationalizations.  First, throughout the post-war South there were much lower literacy and school attendance rates among blacks and whites, as compared to the North.  Furthermore, Southern families grew in size, meaning there were more children to send to school.  Finally, given the hard economic times, the Southern states struggled to pay teachers and upkeep school buildings unless they taxed.  Not everyone favored these taxes, though, and as McClure wrote, it caused \"our state to disagree.\"","On the other side of the debate were white Southerners like McClure who feared blacks would \"infect\" the white students.  Another apprehension was that blacks were inherently immoral, irresponsible, and did not deserve an education.  There were also those who worried about what other types of freedoms blacks would seek if granted equal education.  McClure also mentioned the argument that the tax money was wasted on blacks.  He said that \"9 out of 10 of them may go to school 5 years and they won't advance much beyond a spelling book and in 12 months after leaving school will forget everything.\"  Not only did he find blacks ignorant, but he also claimed that they did not value an education because \"everything they care for is to frolic and drink whiskey.\"  Although McClure wrote this letter in 1886, the sentiments on both sides were not entirely new.","The issue of black and white equality versus inequality was present even before the Civil War began.  What was newest to the debate was the political and religious controversy it sparked.  In the 1870s, the Republican Party promoted funding for public education, claiming that it furthered the ideal of patriotism.  Catholics and some Democrats, on the other hand, argued that the Republicans' platform jeopardized individualism.  Catholics instead sought to gain funding for <em>private</em> education.  No matter how many people wanted public education, racial tensions were at a peak, and many did not want to pay for schooling if it was going to be for blacks.  Some historians saw the \"African factor as the difference between success and failure,\" suggesting that \"white racism undermined any movement for meaningful national unification through mass education\" at the time.  ","As the 1880s arrived, so did a new leading political party of Virginia: the Readjusters, who promoted public education for both blacks and whites.  During this decade, the focus on two parties dwindled while various independent political thoughts emerged.  The truth revealed in McClure's letter was that during that era,Virginia political tension was strong.  He also accurately portrayed the anxieties of many southern whites in regards to post-war education.  Yet history does contradict McClure's fear of public education being a complete waste.  While early Reconstruction may have not been successful in mass education, there were many achievements from 1880 to 1900 as literacy rates rose dramatically among whites <em>and</em> blacks.

She had been close to death for several days and her family was stricken with feelings of uncertainty and anger.  They wanted the police officer who had brutally beaten their loved one to be brought to justice, yet this seemed unlikely in Charlottesville,  Virginia, a predominantly white city.  The family maintained hope that they would finally see racial equality and justice converge.  Unfortunately, however, the day that the beaten woman would receive the justice she truly deserved would never come. ","            On September 3, 1890, Policeman Saunders was on duty, patrolling a largely white neighborhood in Charlottesville,  Virginia.   He focused his attention on an innocent black woman who seemed out of place in the area.  After questioning the \"suspicious\" woman, Policeman Saunders decided to arrest her.  The woman resisted the seemingly unwarranted arrest and the result was bloodshed.  The police officer brutally beat the woman over the head numerous times with his billet.  As news of the savage beating spread throughout Charlottesville, individuals of the black community banded together, demanding that the officer be tried for excessive and unjust force.   The demands of justice by the black community were ignored by the white politicians and the police officer went unpunished.  ","            Black inferiority was an uncontested aspect of the South during late 1800s.  The failure of Reconstruction allowed blatant racism to become an accepted part of the Southern states.   Whites often used violence to instill fear in the minds of black Southerners in an attempt to regain the level of control which they had prior to the Civil War.  This rampant violence and widespread fear shaped and defined the relationships between blacks and whites during the late nineteenth century.   To remedy this overt discrimination in the Southern states, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which made it illegal to discriminate against blacks by assigning them an inferior legal and economic status.  Approximately two years later the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, guaranteeing \"equal protection of the laws\" to every American citizen.   In response to this legislation, however, the Southern states passed a new set of laws that \"permitted local officials to informally discriminate against blacks.\"   The actions of the Southern states following national legislation indicate a desperate effort to retain a position a position of superiority over newly freed black Southerners.  Unfortunately, the desperate attempt to maintain a sense of white supremacy in the South resulted in the disappearance of any form of legal justice in the black community.  The absence of legal action against Policeman Saunders is just one example of the widespread acts of injustice which plagued blacks across the United   States following the abolition of slavery.

Advertisements present in the Norfolk-based newspaper attempted to sell goods such as Christmas supplies, hats, and chlorine tooth wash. While these impersonal objects were goods commonly traded and sold in the marketplace, the advertisement section also included references to Southern property that had run away from their masters. Perhaps the most telling aspect of these advertisements was that no significant distinction was made between missing cattle and missing slaves. To the slave master, steers and slaves were equal under the nature of the law: both were fundamental illustrations of private property. ","To comprehend the importance of the <em>Beacon's </em>advertisements, it is essential to understand the Southern belief that slaves were inherently the property of their masters. This prevalent reasoning had predated the Constitution and was deeply entrenched in Southern culture by 1832. Records from the debates of the Constitutional Convention, presented in the <em>Cambridge Modern History</em>, illustrate that Southerners held a consensus that \"slaves were property only; like other property, they were entirely subject to the wills of the master.\" This conception was no different from the perception regarding steers. In the two advertisements aforementioned, the descriptions of the missing cattle and runaway slaves relied solely upon physical peculiarities. While the two missing steers had \"marks under half moon under the right ear,\" the runaway slave named Lucy was \"stout\" with a \"very yellow complexion.\" In both circumstances, vested rights in private property possessed by the plantation owner dictated that the property be returned. ","The Southern perception of slaves as \"chattel property,\" mirrored in the two advertisements of the <em>American Beacon</em>,<em> </em>supports an underlying observation that blacks and cattle held equal rights under <em>de facto</em> Southern law. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word \"chattel\" is defined as \"a personal possession.\" As previously stated, slaves in the South were considered \"property...subject to the wills of their masters.\" The words \"chattel\" and \"cattle\" share a common language origin; both terms come from the Old French word \"chatel,\" which arises from the Latin word \"caput,\" meaning \"head.\" By relegating slaves to the restricted rights and properties of chattel, slave owners fundamentally equalized the rights of slaves and the rights of cattle. As a result, listing rewards for runaway slaves next to advertisements for runaway cattle, chlorine tooth wash, and medical elixirs was not conflicting in either intention or theory.  ","From expressed Southern mentality and advertisements found in the <em>Beacon</em>, it becomes readily apparent that blacks and whites were not regarded as equal beings under the encompassing mantle of equal protection. Blacks, bought and sold as mere chattel, were only regarded as equals to steers, \"glass beads,\" and \"harmonical walking canes.\" The subsequent equality under the law and inherent relation between steers and slaves was a founding principle of the Southern plantation economy, helping preserve the institution of slavery until the conclusion of the Civil War.

It all began in 1828 when Congress enacted the so-called Tariff of Abominations. Many Southerners thought the highly protective tariff was detrimental to agrarian interests.  Under the leadership of John C. Calhoun, South Carolina stated that a national tariff was unconstitutional when it benefited some states and not others.  To ease tension, President Andrew Jackson lowered the tariff in July 1832.  It was not enough.  ","In November of 1832, South Carolina's Nullification Convention met and pronounced both tariffs unconstitutional as well as unenforceable.  If the national government made any attempt to enforce the tariff, South Carolina would secede from the Union.  In response, Jackson sent the tactical strategist Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott and \"five additional companies of Artillery and two companies of the fourth regiment of Infantry\" to Charleston.  On December 10, 1832, Jackson sent a message to South Carolina declaring its actions \"inconsistent\" and \"incompatible.\"  ","While South Carolina reacted vehemently to the tariff, many Virginians demurred.  South     Carolina's governor James Hamilton mentioned that Nullification was a \"peaceful and constitutional\" remedy.  The Lynchburg Virginian, however, scoffed at his diction and saw war and revolution ahead, not peace.  Governor Hamilton readied the State Guard in Charleston and requested the removal of U.S. troops from the state citadel in Charleston.  The paper claimed, \" war is no children's game - least of all, civil war, in which personal revenge is so apt to mingle with the public quarrel.\"  Though Lynchburg was against the actions of its Southern neighbor, Whigs in Richmond were inclined toward Nullification.  In the coming years, Virginia's divisive tendencies would play a more important role."," After the threat of military action, South Carolina agreed to compromise and a much lower tariff was passed in 1833.

Woods wrote a letter to the Rector of the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia about reapplying to the Commissionership of Accounts.  A year earlier in June 1885, Woods, an attorney from Charlottesville, was appointed and was \"in sympathy with the political tenets of the majority of the board...and recommended by some of the professors.\"  Now, he was worried about his reappointment because he feared that it would \"be decided on political principle.\" If he was not reelected, Woods let the rector know that he understood it would be \" a direct reflection upon my efficiency as an officer or upon my political standing.\"  His own political party in the past nine months of office came into conflict with the University and he adamantly stated that he would believe it a direct reflection of his political affiliations if not reelected.  By acknowledging the influence and the consequences associated with political leanings, Woods understood that merit alone was not worth much in the corrupt world of nineteenth century politics. ","    Whether or not he received the position, Woods expressed a realistic fear of the late nineteenth century.  Corruption was rampant in the 1880s, especially in the political arena.  Political machines and party bosses abounded and the civil service was a mess of personal favors and nepotism.  In his first term as President from 1885 until 1889, Grover Cleveland worked to bring an end to such corruption.  In the wake of fraudulent Boss Tweed and in the presence of the powerfully corrupt Tammany Hall machine, Cleveland's campaign of political honesty appealed to many citizens.  These citizens voted for his morality in the election of 1884 that pitted Cleveland, a Democrat, against a bribe-accepting Republican candidate. As president, Cleveland was able to convince the Republican dominated Senate to repeal the Tenure of Office Act.  When Cleveland came into office, many inept Republicans dominated the federal bureaucracy.  He wished to replace the incompetent with the worthy.  The act dictated that the Senate had to approve dismissals and appointments.  This was problematic for Cleveland since Republicans had the majority.  Arguing that the act was unconstitutional, he got his repeal and the additional executive powers the Constitution provided.  Though he did not bring an end to corruption, Cleveland's little steps led to more significant changes in the future.","    It is no wonder that citizens like Woods would worry about the effects of political leanings when political favoritism was everywhere.  Gradually, the corruption and patronage so ubiquitous in late nineteenth and early twentieth century politics subsided, due in part to the example President Cleveland set in both of his terms.

However, the men of the South did not agree with southern women.  They believed that women were not suited for politics, as it was seen as unfeminine.  Nevertheless, southern women continued to work towards the vote through reform efforts and conventions - the first being the Women's Rights Convention in South   Carolina in 1870.

He served as a surgeon with the title of Major in the Confederate Army during the war and continued to practice medicine after the surrender. In the terms of the oath he swore to \"support and defend the Constitution\" and to support all laws including \"the emancipation of slaves\" from that time forward. By taking this oath, he secured amnesty for serving the Confederacy during the war, considered an act of treason. That day he received a slip of paper noting that he had taken the oath, but he returned six days later to request a letter from the Provost Marshall confirming his allegiance and giving him permission to purchase a pistol for his own protection. Almost a month later, on June 26, he returned yet again for a duplicate certificate of his Oath of Allegiance. Papers such as these restored J.H. Claiborne and other former Confederates to their status of citizens of the United States during Reconstruction, a time when a Confederate war record often excluded men from the political landscape they once ruled. Generals Lee and Grant determined the terms of the surrender at Appomattox, but this agreement did not begin to address many of the questions created by the end of the struggle. Politicians determined the terms of reunion during the era of Reconstruction. The status of Confederate veterans proved to be a controversial issue in the halls of Congress as well as throughout the South. On one hand, Southerners needed to be punished for their rebellion, and it would be irresponsible to place the same white aristocracy back in power post-war. However, to suppress almost the entire white male population would leave few educated men to rebuild the southern governments.","President Johnson laid out the terms for Confederate amnesty in May 1865 through a proclamation that gave amnesty restoring all rights and property (except for slaves) to ex-Confederates who would take an oath of loyalty to the Union. Exempted from the proclamation were top ranking Confederates, as well as owners of more than 20,000 in property. These southerners who were not given amnesty in the proclamation would have to swallow their pride and appeal to the President Johnson for amnesty. Inevitably Johnson pardoned almost anyone who requested one, a much more lenient policy than the previously proposed Wade-Davis Bill of June 1864 that required men to swear that they had never aided the Confederacy in order to participate politically. Johnson pardoned over 7,000 men by 1866 restoring the white aristocracy to power and destroying the moment of hope for black equality and political participation."],"display_date":"May 27, 1865","search_date":"1865-05-27","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4086,"title":"Organization of Women&#39;s Movements in the South: Belle Kearney, WCTU, and Suffrage","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-04-01","end_date":"8/18/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["  For many women in the South, the Women's Christian Temperance Union served as an opportunity to organize with other women, gain public career skills, and work outside the home. This experience was later able to transfer in women's work for suffrage. Belle Kearney, a leader within the WCTU and later a women's suffragist, wrote about the beginning of her career in the WCTU in her autobiography, <em>A Slaveholder's Daughter</em>. In this work she analyzes the affects of the Civil War on women in the South and discusses her own experiences as a daughter this post-Civil War society. Kearney desired to be well educated and to pursue a life beyond the domestic sphere of women. She stated that women in the South had assumed responsibility while the men were at war yet when the men returned, women were expected to return to the female domain. For Kearney, remaining in this womanly sphere was not acceptable. In 1889, she was given her chance for public work when her father encouraged her to listen to a speech given by the President of the WCTU, Frances Willard. After this, Kearney accepted a position in the WCTU which became, for her, an outlet to the public sphere and prepared her to later serve in the women's suffrage movement.            ","According to historian Louise M. Young, this experience in the WCTU was not exclusive to Kearney. Women's promotion of temperance was seen as acceptable public work for them because temperance fell into the womanly sphere of \"protecting the home.\" This allowed women in public work to become more acceptable and thus gave women the courage and ability to work for more radical causes such as women's suffrage.  So, women took the training hat they received in the WCTU and applied it to the suffrage movement. Temperance also opened other avenues for suffrage in that supporters of temperance wanted to give women the vote so that they would have political power to enforce temperance. For the South, this was important because Southern women had not participated in the abolition movement in the North which had prepared women for the first wave of the women's suffrage movement. Thus, in the South the WCTU served to prepare women for the women's suffrage movement as the abolition movement had in the North."],"display_date":"April 1, 1889 - August 18, 1920","search_date":"1904-12-09","locations":[{"id":7161,"lat":32.6346973664,"lng":-90.0338114186,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4107,"title":"Making Their Own Way \n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-02-28","end_date":"1849-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["       In 1849 a law was passed in the state of Delaware that threatened to sell free blacks into a year of servitude if they were \"idle and poor\" and remained unemployed.

Free blacks instead of taking on jobs related to working fields and crops became artisans and engaged in skilled labor .They even created their own jobs, such as saw mill workers, engineers, fisherman, and hat makers. By 1857 more than twelve percent of the free black population in Delaware were skilled laborers.

Arrested in New Echota by the Georgia Guard and detained indefinitely, Butler and Worcester were charged with the direct violation of a new Georgia state law which addressed the issue of Americans dwelling within Native American territory. The law, passed on December 22, 1830, created a requirement for white men to declare an oath of loyalty to the Georgia state government and to receive a residency license from the governor. Those who did not abide by these laws would be imprisoned for a minimum of four years hard labor.  Refusing either to take the oath or leave, Butler and Worcester, shackled around the neck, endured the four-day march to Camp Gilmer in Lawrenceville. ","This incident raised questions about the extent of state power and whether Georgia had the right to exert political authority within the Cherokee territory. American Baptist Magazine defended the actions of Butler and Worcester. While Worcester appealed the ruling of the state, in a letter which was summarized in the magazine, Butler claimed that he and Worcester had influenced the convicts at Milledgeville penitentiary: some promised to renounce profanity and other inappropriate behavior. The missionaries led the prisoners in song, religious readings, and prayer sessions. ","This controversy surrounding the power of state government brought the case to the Supreme Court, presided over by Chief Justice John Marshall. The court ruled in favor of Butler and Worcester on March 3, 1832. In his opinion, Marshall declared the laws of Georgia unconstitutional and unenforceable within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation. Marshall also ordered the state to reverse its judgment against the two prisoners. Although defiance from the state government continued, Marshall's decision in the case of Worcester v. Georgia represents the pivotal recognition of Cherokee sovereignty within the boundaries of the American Nation and the acknowledgment of their existence as an independent power in the eyes of American law.

Having completed its cross-country trip more than four hours ahead of schedule, the Transcontinental Express finally ground to a halt.  The <em>Friends' Intelligencer </em>claimed that the trip, leaving from Jersey City at 1:00 A.M. on June 1, 1876 and arriving in San Francisco approximately half past nine on the morning of the 4th, was made by a speed train in \"26 minutes less than 84 hours,\" or three and a half days. Such a journey in a normal locomotive would have taken seven days. The <em>Scientific American </em>professed the Transcontinental Express \"to be the longest and fastest continuous run that has ever been made on any road in any country.\" This statement reveals the sentiment favoring technological innovation and record setting pace that prevailed in the society during that time. ","Historian Sarah Gordon claims that \"express trains\" were passenger trains that carried express packages and did not stop at every station. She states that these trains \"usually traveled about thirty miles an hour, somewhat faster than other through trains.\" Due to America's burgeoning economy during the 1870s and 1880s, most trains carried a combination of passengers and goods for exchange in other areas. However, slower passenger trains that stopped at every station were available for those who needed it. According to Gordon, these \"accommodation trains ran along through routes, usually at ten to twenty miles per hour.\" While practical use usually dictated the speed of trains, the social status of passengers usually dictated the service, luxury, and safety found onboard, at least initially. The luxurious Pullman cars, decorated in the style of Victorian England, and various private cars were often used by the rich for extended travel. These cars stood in stark contrast to the rancid, poorly lit, and anachronistic passenger cars and day coaches that were frequented by the poor, who often used the railroad for transportation over shorter distances. Eventually, as Gordon postulates, \"the railroads sought to draw all lines under the same rules of operation, regardless of passenger needs. Beginning in the 1880s the science of railroading began to displace remarkable social diversity of passenger travel.\"","Therefore, as railroads such as the Transcontinental Express became faster, more powerful, and more widely used, problems in the system led to the need for regulation and standardization. \"Especially between 1870 and 1900, railroads leaned in the direction of national standards in ticketing, time, track gauges, baggage, the structure of train cars, and the behavior of passengers.\" Not all attempts at standardization were successful. For instance, the Master Car-Builders' Association suggested standard brakes, seats, couplings, heating apparatuses, and ventilating systems on cars during the 1870s, but not all railroads could afford such upgrades to be made. At the same time, attempts were made to set ticket prices, yet none were very successful. On the other hand, many efforts at homogenization were successful. Standard time was universally adopted in 1883, making scheduling significantly easier and more predictable. Also in 1883, railroad companies placed a 250-pound limit on passenger luggage. Three years later, between May 31 and June 1, 1886, most railroads conformed to standard gauge of four feet eight and one-half inches wide, vastly improving the efficiency of transportation as railroads could connect with one another. By 1890, \"a new national standard of reasonable behavior\" permeated the railroad as employees, as well as passengers, were called to abide by a pragmatic code of conduct, \"to make public behavior compatible with urban technology and with the needs of crowds rather than the needs of the individual,\" according to Gordon. While trains such as the Transcontinental Express were setting transportation records, the standards on faster and more powerful trains \"developed to promote the efficient and safe transfer of passengers in all parts of the country.\""],"display_date":"June 1, 1876 - June 4, 1876","search_date":"1876-06-02","locations":[{"id":8523,"lat":40.7416518725,"lng":-74.0773468609,"zoom":11,"place":"HUDSON, New Jersey"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4133,"title":"Judge Clayton Removed from Office\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-12-06","end_date":"1831-12-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" Augustin Smith Clayton was a lawyer, congressman, and judge for the state of Georgia.

In 1831, however, Clayton declared unconstitutional a Georgia law that prohibited Indians from digging gold on their own land. After this decision he was not reelected for another term. Clayton was curious about his loss at reelection and suspected that it was a consequence of his decision in his last case. He wrote a letter to Chancellor James Kent, a prominent New York lawyer, asking whether he was correct in assuming this. Kent agreed with Clayton's assumption. In addition, he offered a detailed opinion as further explanation and proof of how Native Americans were being treated and why there was so much opposition against them at this time."," Opposition to the Cherokee tribe had begun in 1828 in Georgia. Clayton was elected to judgeship that same year, thus many of his trials were about the struggles between the Cherokees and Georgia. At this time, the Cherokee Indians still had possession of northern Georgia. However, later in 1828, Georgia's government issued new legislation extending its reach over Cherokee land. This new legislation was issued even though the Cherokees had written their own constitution in 1827, in an effort to claim they were a sovereign state. By doing so, the Cherokees tried to deny the state of Georgia any right to their land. The state of Georgia ignored the Cherokee constitution and tried to take their land anyway. The result was a bitter struggle between the Cherokee Indians and the state of Georgia. Judge Clayton's initial opposition to Cherokee rights is an important example of how many people felt at this time.

Finally, an agreement was reached.  In September of 1850 the provisions that would become the Compromise of 1850 were passed.  About a year later, on September 5, 1851, Winchester Graham, a representative from South Carolina, gave a speech in Barnwell, S.C. that defended his support of the Compromise measures.  In the beginning of his speech, Graham called the compromise \"...the greatest legislative victory to be found in the annals of our country and that the institutions of the South are now resting on firmer foundations than they ever had before...\"  Next, Graham gave an overview of the major pieces of the compromise.  First, Graham talked about the abolition of the slave trade in Washington, D.C.  He argued that this was of no consequence to the South and that the Congress had the power to regulate the commerce of the District of Columbia.  Second, he talked about the admittance of California as a free state.  He dispelled the myth that this was a policy of the Free Soil Party intended to entrap the South, and argued that slavery would never have come to California because of its climate and terrain.  Graham supported the admittance of California as a whole, instead of divided at the 36' 30' line of the Missouri Compromise, because if it had been split it would allow two free states to come into the Union instead of one.  Third, Graham argued that the Texas-New Mexico border act, long viewed as an assault on the slave state of Texas, was proposed by a southerner, Pearce of Maryland, and was beneficial to the Southern cause.  This measure helped the South because it paid of the debts of Texas and also gave the South \"40,000 miles of free territory\" to establish new slave states to bolster Texas and the South.  Finally, the Fugitive Slave Act was a major victory for the South because it allowed for greater protection and return of their property, the slaves.  In conclusion, Graham said that the Compromise led the nation away from the brink of succession; this succession would have caused a costly war that would have taken a horrific toll on the South. ","    The debate over the Compromise of 1850 was one of the most contentious and heated debates in the history of the United States Senate.  Political fanatics, from the North and South, objected to the measures, bringing the nation to brink of disunion and hostility.  Author John Waugh argues that the compromise was built on the back of the \"political middle\" with measures that were meant to appease the North, the admittance of California, and ones to appease the South, the Fugitive Slave Act.  While the other measures, especially the Texas-New Mexico border act, represented a political quagmire, from which both sides refused to relent.  In his defense of the Compromise, Graham interpreted all of the measures as strengthening the South, even the concessions to the North.  His speech was an appeal to his constituents, making them realize that the compromise, and his support of it, led them away form the disaster of succession while also helping the Southern cause.  Graham wanted his constituents to view the measures as a victory, not as a compromise, because it helped avoid the destruction of the Union and reinforced slavery in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1851","search_date":"1851-09-05","locations":[{"id":11437,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4142,"title":"President Jackson Responds to Nullification\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-10","end_date":"1832-12-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    The crisis threatened to tear the nation apart.  This crisis was the passage of the Nullification Ordinances by the South Carolina State Assembly in November of 1832.  The unity and survival of the nation depended upon President Andrew Jackson's response.  On December 10, 1832, President Jackson presented his response to the Congress, arguing that the justification for state nullification of federal laws was misguided, unconstitutional, and treasonous to the country.   Jackson began his proclamation by outlining the reasons and reservations that led South Carolina to pass the ordinance; their major concerns were the tariffs of May 29, 1828 and June 14, 1832.  South Carolina believed these measures were unfair and didn't fall within the constitutional power of Congress to raise revenue; they proclaimed the laws null and void and threatened succession.  In his address, Jackson showed that the doctrine of nullification was \"incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.\"   First, he posited that South Carolina's objections based on stated powers and fairness were misguided and incorrect because the Constitution gave Congress the \"discretionary power\" to raise revenue by taxation.  Next, Jackson argued the Constitution joined the states into a single nation, and \"in becoming parts of a nation...they surrender many of their essential parts of sovereignty.\"  Thus, secession was wholly unconstitutional because it is an affront to national authority.  Finally, Jackson warned the people of South Carolina, who he believed were tricked into nullification by political and social leaders, that any action of \"disunion, by force, is treason.\"  He made an emotional appeal for these people to see the error of their position.  His address ends with a hope that the nation will survive and be reconciled by reasonableness and harmony, but also an assurance that it will be reconciled by force, if necessary.  ","    President's Jackson's speech came at a crucial time during his presidency; he had just been elected to a second term, but already his popular and political support was flagging.  But, according to historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Jackson's handling of the nullification crisis and his resolve to ensure the survival of the union, both evident in the December speech, gained him temporary \"popular acclaim,\" making him the \"country's hero.\"  Jackson, a shrewd political, turned his new popularity into a political weapon to further the other policies of his administration, most notably his continued war against the Bank of the United States.  Jackson's speech and eventual handling of the nullification crisis were viewed, by the majority of the nation, as the actions of a strong leader dedicated to the nation and its survival; he used this renewed trust to further the political goals of his presidency.

This was a road that led to economic prosperity for the South.  This was the Blue Ridge Railroad.  In 1860, the President of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, Edward Frost, in a report to the stockholders and the state legislature, reported on the condition and growth of the line, proposed a plan for its expansion, and requested renewed assistance from the government of South Carolina.  Frost started his report with a proposition to finish the railroad form Walhalla, S.C. to Clayton, S.C. Then, he reported on the past development of the railroad; noting that from 1859 to 1860, the government instructed and only provided the company with enough of a grant, 310,000, to finish the line up to Walhalla.  The railroad was initially planned to run all along the Southeast, from South Carolina to Knoxville, Tennessee.  But, the company ran into work stoppages and reduced state funding in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.  In this report, Frost proposed that the South Carolina legislature provide funding to finish the line to Clayton.  He argued that this would provide the other surrounding state governments with the incentive to fund the completion of the other proposed sections of the railroad, the sections in western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and northwest Georgia.  But, the railroad would have to be finished to Clayton, because it was a connecting city to these other areas.  According to the report, the completion of the road would be a major economic advantage, linking markets throughout the South.  Frost argued that the completed road would make this section of the South competitive with Northern industry and transportation.  Frost estimated the cost of the line from Walhalla to Clayton at about 1.5 million to 2 million and the total cost of the road to Knoxville at 4.5 million.  He asked the state legislature to provide 1 million in bonds to continue construction to Clayton.  Finally, Frost made a plea to his stockholders:  \"...in case the work should be discontinued, the officers of this company should be exempt from any aspersions of bad judgment or ill faith...\"  This report was intended to show his proposition and his plan, but if the state legislature didn't grant the bonds, Frost wanted to ensure the security of his position. ","    There was a major disparity in railroad transportation between the North and South; this lack of a developed transportation system would later be seen as a major cause of the Southern loss during the Civil War.   The case of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company is indicative of this trend of struggling railroads in the South.  Historian James Ward showed that Southern railroads, especially in the 1840s and mid-1850s, received less government aide and investment than their Northern counterparts.  He argued that this disparity in financing was due to the long-ranging effects of an economic depression in 1839, the reduced market price of cotton, and finally weakened European markets in the mid-1850s, due to the Crimean War.  These events depleted government resources in the South, creating this decline in government support of transportation infrastructure.  The reduced funding led to the work stoppages that hindered the completion of the Blue Ridge Railroad, and many other railroads in the South.  When the state had money to reinvest in railroads, the South was already technologically trailing the North by a decade or more.

After the Civil War, the North wanted to ensure the abolition of slavery, recognition of the rights of African Americans, and that the South would remain a part of the nation; these were the major goals of the Reconstruction policies.   To meet these goals, The North required all former Confederate states to write a new state constitution, incorporating these measures, in order to be readmitted to the Union.  From January 14, 1868 to March 17, 1868, delegates met in Charleston, South Carolina to formulate a new South Carolina State Constitution.  This new constitution incorporated the goals of the North.  Article I included provisions that:  stated the equality of all men (Sec. 1), abolished slavery (Sec. 2), asserted that the Union was \"indissoluble\" (Sec. 5), and pledged \"paramount allegiance\" to the United States Constitution (Sec. 4).  While Article I abolished slavery and dictated equality, the new constitution also had to have provisions that ensured the political and social rights for African Americans.  Article VIII Sections Two and Eight ensured the political freedom of universal male suffrage regardless of \"race, color, or former condition.\"  While, Article X Section Ten, which ensured that \"all public schools...shall be free and open to all children...without regard to race or color,\" was intended to provide the social right to education.   With these new statues in the state constitution, the North felt that South Carolina had met the provisions to be readmitted to the Union; the North hoped these new laws would end the discrimination and disenfranchisement of the African American community in South Carolina.  ","    Historian Richard Zuczek argues that while the constitution provided a new government and new protections for African Americans, \"State whites rejected out-of-hand the constitution and the government it would establish.  For Carolinians, although the new constitution 'may have the authority of law...it has not and never can have the moral sanction of right, truth, or justice...\"  Because the new constitution was written mainly by African Americans and white Republicans, most of the white citizens of South Carolina saw the constitution and the government as illegitimate and longed for the reinstallation of a society based on white supremacy.  This attitude represented the major failure of Reconstruction; it ended de jure political and social discrimination against African Americans, but could not address the de facto discrimination based upon the attitudes and culture of white Carolinians.  These attitudes led to actions that disrupted the government and ensured that African Americans were not given the equality or rights the new constitution guaranteed them.  Southern whites used extralegal forms of violent or economic coercion to continue the discrimination of African Americans; the new rights, provided by the law, were being circumvented by a society that hoped for a return to the antebellum culture of racial superiority.  Thus, the goals of Reconstruction could not be fully applied to a society that was not ready to embrace a culture of racial equality."],"display_date":"January 14, 1868 - March 17, 1868","search_date":"1868-02-14","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4188,"title":"Admiral Semmes Charged With Treason\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-12-25","end_date":"1865-12-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Civil War was over, and it was time for those who led the South to be punished.  <em>The Norfolk Virginian</em> reported on Monday, December 25, 1865, that the Union arrested \"Raphael Semmes, late Admiral in the Confederate navy, and commander of the celebrated cruiser Alabama,\" with \"a profound feeling of shame.\"  The people of the South lamented the \"unexpected arrest and immediate transfer to a Northern jail\" of this \"true born American,\" and considered Admiral Semmes a war hero.

To Mrs. Virginia Clay, wife of Senator Clement Clay of Alabama, the fifty-five year old Houston was a \"Senatorial Hercules\" and a \"roughish old hero\".  In her book, <em>A Belle of the 50's</em>, Mrs. Clay explains Houston's whittling habit saying that \"a seemingly inexhaustible supply of soft wood was always kept in his desk [in the Senate] and out of it he whittled stars and hearts and other fanciful shapes.\"  One day, she received an envelope while she watched in the gallery of the Senate and \"within a tiny, shiny, freshly whittled wooden heart, on which the roguish old hero had inscribed, 'Lady I send thee my heart Sam Houston'\" (99).  She further mentioned his youthful nature as she explained that \"nothing amused him more than to reduce to a confused silence those who surrounded him, by suddenly addressing them in all sorts of unknown words\" in a number of Indian dialects (100).  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Sam Houston to Mrs. Clay she found in his attire as \"he wore a leopard-skin vest, with a voluminous scarlet neck-tie, and over his bushy grey locks rested an immense sombrero... wrapped around his broad shoulders he wore a gaily coloured Mexican <em>serape</em>, in which scarlet predominated\" (98- 99). ","Numerous reasons explain why Sam Houston would wear a serape as Marion Wisehart in <em>Sam Houston: American Giant</em> wrote, \"Senator Houston wore a bright Mexican serape to protect his back and chest from drafts\" (497).  Or perhaps with the time he spent near Mexico, Senator Houston became more comfortable in that clothing style.  Regardless, the same man that Mrs. Clay describes seems very different than the General who led an army of Texans to victory at San Jacinto.  Sam Houston acted as statesman, politician, and soldier.  He fought in the War of 1812, governed Tennessee and later Texas as Governor of two different states, became elected twice as the President of the Republic of Texas, and worked as a Senator for Texas fighting against succession (though a slaveowner himself).  Wisehart describes another aspect of Houston as \"he could talk extemporaneously for two or three hours and hold his audience in thrall.  After sleeping all night on the cold, damp ground, he could sit on a log and write powerful appeals to stimulate patriotic ardor or eloquent petitions in his own defense\" (vii).  As explained in <em>The Autobiography of Sam Houston,</em> \"It is of such violent contrasts that an epic figure is made\" (xv).  The diversity in the behavior of Sam Houston can not be separated.  Sam Houston the whittler is the same man as President Sam Houston.

A common trend among politicians was to use the ideas of the founders to argue both for and against these ideas, hence it is not surprising that on December 28, 1832 Alexander Rives, a Virginia lawyer, wrote to James Madison, one of the last surviving Founding Fathers, seeking council on this issue. Rives and Madison had never met, but Rives felt the matter so pressing that he forewent the usual formalities apologizing for his forwardness and the disruption of Madison's retirement. Of greatest concern to Rives was the fact that secessionists often referred to the writings of Madison in defense of their position, particularly the Virginia Resolution of 1798. Rives thought this to be a misinterpretation and hoped to be able to, \"Lay before my acquaintances some public evidence of what I conceive a fatal and insidious error,\" and thereby prove that Madison's writing did not endorse secession."," The main conflict arose due to Madison's argument in his Virginia Resolution that ultimate authority lay within the state and not the national government. Madison had always been a champion of the union, but political turmoil near the turn of the century caused him to endorse ideas that were more states rights oriented. The Virginia Resolution was a response to the Alien and Sedition Acts which Madison found to be extremely unpalatable and in direct conflict with the Constitution. He argued that in such cases states were obliged to nullify these laws for they were so unconstitutional that they threatened the rights of the citizens in those states. As Kevin Gutzman explains, \"Madison's document asserted that the state had a 'duty' to maintain its 'rights and liberties' within its boundaries.\" But Madison made clear that such actions were not to be taken without careful deliberation and only when the government overstepped the powers granted to it by the Constitution."," Rives believed that these words did not grant the states the power to arbitrarily secede nor did he believe that this was Madison's intention. He stated, \"That the opinions of the chief architect of our political systems should not be misconstrued or perverted to sinister purposes.\" Rives hoped that Madison could clarify his intentions and in doing so dissuade any improper use of his ideas.","In his response Madison agreed with Rives sentiments. He stated that, \"I do not consider the proceedings of Virginia in '98-99 as countenancing the doctrine that a State may <em>at will</em> secede from its constitutional compact with other states.\" The grievances of 1832, Madison felt, were not dire enough to constitute secession. Moreover, Madison argued that secession required the consent of the other states and not simply the whim of a single state. This confirmation made Rives's interpretation all the more legitimate in the eyes of the people this time. Thus, Rives letter to Madison portrays a desire of the people of the 1830s to qualify their political actions with the intentions of the founders who still held great authority in the people's minds."],"display_date":"December 28, 1832 - January 12, 1833","search_date":"1833-01-04","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4235,"title":"The Black Warrior Affair Exposes U.S. Tensions with Spain\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-02-28","end_date":"1854-03-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 13, 1854 the Charleston Daily Courier ran a series of correspondences from Havana which reported on the escalating Black Warrior affair. These correspondences explain that on February 28 the ship Black Warrior stopped in Havana on its way from Mobile to New York as it had done numerous times in the past and upon arriving delivered its manifest to customs as was required. The captain listed his cargo only as ballasts as he had ordinarily done since all other cargo was in transit. However, the Black Warrior also carried 1000 bales of cotton and the customs officer, upon learning of this, seized the ship and cargo without giving the captain an opportunity to change the manifest. The correspondence explained that the outrage stemmed from the fact that under Spanish law a captain had twelve hours from the time the ship arrived in which he could make corrections to the manifest if an error had occurred, a time which had not elapsed when the ship was seized. The captain immediately informed the U.S. Consul in Havana who attempted to resolve the matter by petitioning the Captain General of Havana to release the ship and cargo. But the correspondence states that the Captain General responded \"the law must take its course\" and so made a speedy end to this affair impossible.","Normally such a minor customs battle would hold little importance for the people of Charleston and the nation as a whole, but the escalating political interest in the affair is best explained by tensions between the United States and Spain around this time. The bulk of this tension was the result of the United States' continued interest in acquiring Cuba from Spain; a sentiment especially strong among Southern Democrats who saw it as an opportunity to create another slave state out of Cuba and among some moderates who hoped that the acquisition of Cuba would ease the growing tensions between the North and South. Also, some hoped that a war with Spain over Cuba would turn the nation's attentions from internal divisions onto national affairs and so alleviate the growing regional crisis in the United States. Thus, it is not surprising that in his essay Henry James tells \"Of the sensation created throughout the length and breadth of the Union by the detention of the Black Warrior.\" Many newspapers portrayed the \"Black Warrior Affair\" as an outrage and a slight against American honor that deserved retribution. Strong political pressure was exerted on President Peirce to act, and Peirce himself was not totally indifferent to the political possibilities this crisis created. While sentiments in the correspondence were not so strong, the author did emphasize the idea that the United States had been wronged in some way. He too called for action by the government to intervene in this \"outrageous affair.\" However, the Spanish government, realizing the political implications, quickly resolved the issue by releasing the ship and cargo. While there were some lingering political repercussions, American interest in the affair ebbed with this resolution and emphasis shift back to the problems of the nation. The strong reaction to this minor incident, however, reveals the volatile political atmosphere of the nation at this time."],"display_date":"February 28, 1854 - March 16, 1854","search_date":"1854-03-07","locations":[{"id":11456,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4258,"title":"An Early Condemnation of &#39;Legal&#39; Disenfranchisement\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-02-07","end_date":"1880-02-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February7, 1880 the <em>New York Times</em> ran an article condemning educational tests for voting registration in the South which an editorial in the Charleston <em>News</em> had proposed as a way of suppressing the black vote. The article explains that the reasoning behind the author in the <em>News</em> editorial was that the \"'more intelligent and reasonable citizens must rule'\" no matter whether they are the majority or not and that suppressing the Negro vote was the only way to ensure this. The problem the <em>News</em> editorial author saw was that the current method of violence and intimidation seemed to violate the law and went against the sentiments of many people both in the state of South Carolina and outside it. Moreover, the current method was inconsistent in its effects, whereas an indoctrinated system would be much more systematized and effective. ","The concepts expressed in the News article were a precursor to future action by southern states. In 1890 Mississippi enacted laws such as literacy tests as a method of \"legal\" disenfranchisement, and as the <em>News</em> article predicted these laws worked amazingly well. They were so effective, in fact, that by 1900 all but four southern states had enacted some form of literacy tests and in those states that had them the black vote was all but extinct. The reason these literacy tests worked so well on the black population was that most slaves had never been taught to read or write and only some progress had been made in educating them after Emancipation. ","The successful imposition of these literacy tests was due in part to the fact that there was wide support for them across the country. The author of the New York Times article, in fact, voiced his support for literacy tests as \"a simple and natural method by which a community can protect itself against serious abuse and dangers.\" The problem the author saw was that these laws would not be administered equally or impartially and were simply a tool for suppressing the black vote. Under this premise \"an educational test becomes merely an instrumentality of wrong and fraud\" and so cannot be tolerated because it interferes with the democratic process. ","One must conclude in reading this article that Northern politicians were well aware of Southern intentions to disenfranchise blacks using legal tools long before they were ever able to enact them. The question is why did they let them? Part of the reason lies in the fact that the Democratic Party returned to national dominance in the mid 1880s and undid much of the Reconstruction legislation meant to ensure black rights. But Richard Valelly in his book <em>The Two Reconstructions</em> argues that it was also the fact that the Republican Party lost interest in the black community as a political group. As he states, \"The enormous and rapid growth of the Republican Party in the late 1890s outside the South substituted for lost black voters at the margin.\" So despite the fact that Republicans in the North knew that Southerners sought legal means to disenfranchise blacks they lacked the legal power and political interest to do anything about it."],"display_date":"February 7, 1880","search_date":"1880-02-07","locations":[{"id":11459,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4279,"title":"The Jim Crow Car Trials in Georgia\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-01-01","end_date":"1889-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When Mr. Heard bought his train ticket for Philadelphia to Atlanta, little did he expect the events that would transpire as a result of that trip. In the spring of 1887, William M. Heard, an African American, brought suit against the Georgia Railroad Company after he was obligated to move into a segregated \"Jim Crow\" car. This action set into motion a series of court cases that specifically dealt with racial segregation in railroad cars and attempted to fight against the general ideology of Jim Crow.  Interstate Commerce Laws had been passed by congress in an attempt to deter such segregation, but Jim Crow was strong in the South and growing more powerful every year. Heard was one of the many brave men who attempted to fight the growing and terrible trend of racial segregation. ","Purchasing a first-class ticket in Philadelphia, Heard peacefully road the train until it reached the Georgia border at Augusta. The Atlanta Constitution describes how, at this location, Heard was compelled as a black man to vacate his car and ride in another car where \"the accommodation[s] were second class and inferior in every way\" to those in the first class car that the white passengers occupied. This segregated car to which he was banished was what became known as the \"Jim Crow\" car. Heard had been involved in a similar incident over a year before which had resulted in a successful suit against the company. The Constitution relates that he decided to bring additional suit against the Georgia Railroad Company in order to obtain further confirmation of the Interstate Commerce Commissioners' opposition to such practices by the railroad companies. The Georgia Railroad Company quickly objected to the suit based on \"various grounds\" including the \"jurisdiction of the courts,\" said the Constitution. The company quickly responded to Heard's petition by saying that the cars for the \"colored passengers [were] equally as safe, comfortable, and clean...as those provided for the whites.\" The suit was postponed for a significant period and eventually halted at a stalemate. However Heard had done his part in the fight against segregation of railroad cars. ","Heard was not the only sufferer who decided to fight back. Another suit was filed to the Interstate Commerce Commission by a man name William H. Councill. According to the May 31 Constitution, Councill was seeking 25,000 worth of damages for being \"forcibly ejected from a first-class car after having paid for a first class ticket.\" He was subsequently subjected to riding in the \"Jim Crow\" car. The trend had been set, and the Georgia Railroad Company soon found itself mired down with court cases. The ranks against the Georgia Railroad Company and railroad segregation began to swell even more with the key addition of Rev. George C. Rowe of Charleston. The Constitution describes how Rev. Rowe began a nationwide campaign after he and several other colored passengers were forced to ride in the \"Jim Crow\" car after purchasing first-class tickets. The purpose of Rowe's campaign was to rally support, both moral and financial, with which to bring suit against the Georgia Railroad Company and against racial segregation in general. While the efforts of men such as Heard, Councill, and Rowe may have fallen short in achieving racial equality, their fortitude certainly helped establish precedence for the long and difficult fight against inequality."],"display_date":"1887 - 1889","search_date":"1888-07-01","locations":[{"id":2193,"lat":33.3596398044,"lng":-82.0735645683,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4291,"title":"Lincoln, Mudd, and The Dry Tortugas","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-14","end_date":"1869-03-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Dry Tortugas were never intended to serve as host to the most notorious convicts of the 19th Century, but President Johnson altered the prison selection as reported by the New York Times on July, 19 1865.

","Ponce de Leon made a discovery in 1513 that would later serve as home to a group of men connected to the assassination of an American President.  The island chain would later receive the name of the \"Dry Tortugas\", each word in reference to an identifying feature of the islands as noted by early explorers.  The \"dry\" depicts the lack of a fresh water source on the islands, an essential piece of information that sailors relied upon.  \"Tortugas\" was a maritime term for sea turtles, and these creatures also happened to be the main source of meat for anyone inhabiting the islands; such as the crew of the HMS Tyger did in 1742 after they were shipwrecked and stranded for 55 days.  The extreme isolation of the Dry Tortugas along with its strategic location, not unlike that of Gibraltar, made them the target for a US Fort that would serve to protect shipping lanes and carry out the Monroe doctrine.","Construction of Fort Jefferson began in 1846 and was never completed.  The massive structure covered 11 acres of land on Garden Key, the only island in the Dry Tortugas suitable to serve host to the large mason building.  The American Civil War caused Fort Jefferson to double as a military prison and housed several hundred inmates in the second story gun casemates.  ","In April, 1865 John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Lincoln and fled Ford's Theatre.  After breaking a leg, he sought medical attention from Dr. Samuel Mudd, a prior acquaintance, and proceeded to dodge the authorities for several more days before being shot.  Dr. Samuel Mudd, Edmund Spangler, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlin were all sentenced to life in prison for their alleged roles in the assassination of President Lincoln.  Following their sentencing, the Lincoln conspirators departed in July, 1865 for Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas.  ","In the fall of 1867 several cases of Yellow Fever broke out amongst the troops garrisoned at Fort Jefferson and by mid-September an epidemic gripped the fort.  After the medical officer passed away, Dr. Mudd volunteered his services which saved many of the soldier's lives.  More extraordinary was the fact that Dr. Mudd himself had Yellow Fever and he continued to labor through the disease.   Despite Dr. Mudd's best efforts, his comrade in chains Michael O'Laughlin passed away from the epidemic along with a handful of soldiers.

He also witnessed several people die horrible deaths in the blaze, because they were unable to free themselves from the debris. Rescue efforts were abandoned when the strong wintery winds caused the fire to escalate. Passengers and crew on the train by J.E. Burchell's estimate was as many as two hundred fifty people.  Ninety-two people died due to injuries sustained from the crash or from the fire that plagued the wreck."," J. E. Burchell's account was published in the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em> on December 30, 1876, the day after the accident. The next day his story ran in the <em>New York Times. </em>Both of these newspapers were able to advertise the severity of the death rate and damage from the accident, because of the personal account of one of the survivors. The Ashtabula Bridge Disaster caused the public to wonder about the stability of the Railroad Companies and their constructional efforts to connect railway systems throughout the East Coast, and toward the West. <em>The New York Times</em> completed a follow up story at the request of their readers to address reasons why it had collapsed; \"the result of defects and errors made in designing, constructing, and erecting it; that a great defect, and one which appears in many parts of the structure, was the dependence of every member for its efficient action on the probability that all or nearly all the others would retain their positions.\" People were horrified that Railroad Companies, in hast of construction, neglected to administer safety codes or inspection. "," By the 1870s the American public was use to iron bridges collapsing, but the railroad was more of a public commodity, then in its earlier days. The more deaths caused by the railroad, the more people expected payment for their losses. Some railway companies sought to avoid having to pay the damages by sticking with wooden trusses, but the application of cast iron was cheap and easy to get then. The Ashtabula Disaster awakened the feeling of national shock. The reality that ninety- four people had died in the horrific accident and forty-three passengers of the Pacific Express were burnt beyond recognition became a catalyst for the government to eradicate these problems. In 1887 the Interstate Commerce Act was passed by Congress to ensure safer methods of construction. Ashtabula Bridge Disaster became one of the most publicized bridge collapses. The distress the event caused the public assisted in the shift of power from privately owned railroad companies to government sponsored corporations."],"display_date":"December 29, 1876","search_date":"1876-12-29","locations":[{"id":10019,"lat":41.707475015,"lng":-80.7485016298,"zoom":9,"place":"ASHTABULA, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4318,"title":"Women of Hocking Valley Become a Force for Miners Strike\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-10-25","end_date":"1884-10-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A wood engraved image of the Hocking Valley Miners' Strike was published on October 25, 1884 in <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>. It depicted four officers leading a miner through a large crowd of women.  In the picture some women held clubs that were raised in threatening positions, while the rest had faces that were contorted with rage.  Joseph Becker sketched this scene in Buchtel, a mining town in Hocking County, Ohio during the Hocking Valley Miners' Strike of 1884. Miners, women and men, from forty-eight mines in Hocking Valley arranged the strike in order to dispute high living costs and decreased wages.  The miners had hoped to expand their rights as a worker by means of peaceful demonstrations with the organized political support of the Knights of Labor.  Nine months later, the striking miners were unable to come to an agreed compromise with the mine operators and returned to the mines. "," The women of the Hocking Valley miners were a familiar image, which grabbed the publics' attention toward the miners' plight during the 1880s. Their struggle for economic balance and the stability of their employment could only be recognized, because of the image of working class mothers and wives engaged in a united front.  Hocking Valley Miners were not only assisted by the image of their fellow workers in <em>Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper</em>, but became connected through the family oriented association of the Knights of Labor.  This association was a national working class group that tried to end \"industrial capitalism\" by incorporating new ways to oppose unjust industrial policies.  The Knights of Labor was the first organized labor group to successfully attempted to change basic working conditions for all workers despite race , gender, position, age, and regardless of their experience. This large union would eventually assist the Hocking Valley mining families through two strikes during the 1880s. "," One of the biggest issues during these strikes was the rivalry of appearing levels in working class. Miners had been hired as individual groups, led by a selected manager. Most of the time family members would form a \"family system of production\". The necessity of many hands versus the few, children and women were part of the company.  This unit method allowed miners to work at an individual pace, but work was limited by the price of coal per ton. With the advancement of technology and the change in safety, job description changed the way workers were viewed as employees.  The emergence of the change between manual labor and skilled labor created a strained working force in the mines.  Wages and restrictions limited workers by age, gender, and skill sets, rather than the longevity of their employment. Job description was not a common term until the Knights of Labor and other Mining groups created the unity of workers.  No longer would miners receive the benefit of selected associates, but an organized layer of employees, based on their skills or experience. "," The sketch of the miners' women in Hocking Valley is an image that fueled the miners' progress toward the creation of a company that would unite under the protection of the United Mine Workers of America in 1890.  The image relays the importance of the labor union to the worker as standardizing the work force.  The uniqueness of the Hocking Valley Miner's Strike is that the workers' struggle was a family action.  Women were used by the newspapers to express the unfair working conditions and the poor pay of the Hocking miners.  Due to the efforts of the mining families in Hocking Valley and publicized notice in newspapers, miners succeeded in obtaining stable wages and equal opportunities, but the creation of the mining unions created a clear definition in skilled workers, manual laborers, and family working units."],"display_date":"October 25, 1884","search_date":"1884-10-25","locations":[{"id":10289,"lat":39.4969744596,"lng":-82.4791535659,"zoom":10,"place":"HOCKING, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4334,"title":"Mulatto Man Granted Freedom\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-12-01","end_date":"1831-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In December 1831, Quaker abolitionist Benjamin Lundy published a small article in his newspaper The Genius of Universal Emancipation entitled \"Important Legal Decision.\"  The article told the story of a free mulatto man named Batkin who, after being convicted of a crime in Virginia, had been sold into slavery.  Batkin had been sold to a man in Tennessee, and he petitioned that state's court for his freedom.  The Circuit Court of Tennessee found that the original Virginia law under which Batkin had been enslaved was a violation of both the Bill of Rights of Virginia and the clause of the Constitution which prohibits bills of attainder, finding someone guilty without benefit of a trial.  Lundy concluded his article with a plea to his readers, urging them to action: \"How many poor wretches may yet be pining in slavery, who were as illegally doomed to that condition as was the ultimately more fortunate Batkin\" ","Lundy believed in limiting the expansion of slavery, but he also sought to establish a colony for freed slaves outside of the United States; he traveled to Mexico, Haiti and Canada looking for suitable sites. While his article was sympathetic to the plight of Batkin, his colinizationist views seem at odds with this abolitionist writing.  Lundy was an agent of the American Colonization Society and used his newspaper to promote its positions. He inspired other abolitionists, including William Lloyd Garrison who, prior to beginning his own newspaper, The Liberator, edited The Genius of Universal Emancipation while Lundy was abroad.  Garrison credited Lundy as \"awakening\" him to the abolitionist cause.  ","In addition to cases like that of Batkin, in which free men were sold into slavery, others were convicted into public service.  Slaves convicted of crimes were also conscripted into this public work as well.  Convict labor was also used as a form of punishment for whites, blurring the line between not only slavery and freedom, but of black and white.

The article continued to claim, \"the value of such sanitary care was particularly tested in 1878, when the disease was very fatal in Memphis, Shreveport, and in Texas.\" In the wake of numerous epidemics of yellow fever, cholera, and the like, people throughout the country called for sanitary reform and regulation. The rapid urbanization experienced during the nineteenth century had highlighted the insufficient methods for disposing of waste and refuse. As exclaimed in the <em>New York Daily Times</em>: \"we need nothing but noses to know that there is something rotten in the street.\"","The initial push for sanitary reform came in the 1840s, yet would not culminate in any significant changes until the 1870s and 1880s. In the early stages of urban development, city-dwellers practiced private-lot waste removal, in which, as Peterson describes, they \"discharged their wastes upon the land adjoining their dwellings and shops, principally within the confines of the private lot but also into the streets.\" In reaction to similar problems in England during the 1840s, British reformer Edwin Chadwick developed an innovative system of water-carriage sewerage, in which pressurized water was passed through small, egg-shaped pipes to carry solid wastes away from the city. Chadwick also accepted the filth theory, which held \"that gases or miasmas emanating from decaying organic matter caused disease.\" However, not much progress was made in sanitary reform in America before the Civil War; as Peterson remarks, \"only Jersey City, Brooklyn, and Chicago, in fact, attempted major works before the Civil War. Not until after the war and the return of cholera in 1866 did many cities introduce systematic sewerage.\" At that point, American pioneers followed Chadwick's suit, installing comprehensive and integrated sewer systems in major cities across the nation. Legislation was passed to provide for the administrative reform of sanitation. Boards of Health began cropping up in cities around the country. The American Public Health Association, which Peterson claims, \"became the principal voice of American sanitary reform,\" was formed in 1872. Sanitary survey planning emerged as a useful practice, as it \"required the study of every street, lot, and building in a city to determine the precise location of any prevalent and all suspect environmental conditions.\"     ","The impact of American sanitary reform was most readily observed in the comprehensive reconstruction plan developed for Memphis, Tennessee in response to a devastating yellow fever epidemic in 1878, which claimed 5,150 lives out of its population of approximately 45,000. A National Board of Health was created in March 1879 to deal with the problem. It conducted an exhaustive, citywide survey and made nine proposals to improve the city's sanitation. George E. Waring was chosen to construct an innovative and controversial sewage system in the city. According to the <em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>, Waring's \"pipes were much smaller than customary, were for house sewage only, without manholes, well ventilated, and were flushed every twenty-four hours by means of automatic flush tanks.\" Although the plan only pertained to health matters and not to the city's future growth, the sanitary reform conducted in Memphis considerably improved the city's sanitation and proved to be a significant step towards the eventual practice of city planning. ","However, in the 1880s and 1890s, German and French bacteriologists soon discovered the microscopic pathogenic organisms responsible for diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera, among others. Peterson states, \"As this new public health approach gradually took hold, it shifted attention away from the root premise of sanitary reform - that most infectious disease had its source in the visible environment.\" Thus, preventative measures such as isolation, immunization, disinfection, and antitoxins became more important than sanitary reform. Sanitary scientists developed methods of filtration and chlorination of water, allowing polluted water to become purified. Although sanitary reform eventually lost momentum in the face of microorganisms and filtration, the movement sparked valuable innovations in sewerage and city planning as methods to control the byproducts of urbanization during the nineteenth century.

The <em>Franklin Repository </em>of April 27, 1859 contains a summary of the April 13th anti-Buchanan speech made by the Honorable John Hickman at the Independent Democratic Convention at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Hickman was outraged at the conduct of President Buchanan which he believed had violated the Constitution of the United Sates - particularly in relation to the issues of slavery and popular sovereignty.  \"Suddenly,\" said Hickman, in order to carry the election in his home state of Missouri, \"he became transformed from the sympathizer with down trodden freedom, to the open and shameless defender of aggressive and law defying slavery.\" There is \"an eternal antagonism between <em>freedom</em> and <em>slavery\", </em>said Hickman. Buchanan, according to Hickman, exceeded the powers granted to him as President by the Constitution by usurping powers of Congress. His policies had driven the country to the point of insolvency by not providing for proper supervision of the country's finances. Public property, Hickman contended, sold for less than its value and high wages were paid to workers who do nothing because they are friends or supporters of Buchanan. The Post Office had been poorly managed and also the victim of patronage. As a result of their own policies, said Hickman, the administration had become unable to act they are so afraid. Hickman next attacked the advisability of the acquisition of Cuba particularly in light of the fact that it will add to the strength of the slave states. Finally, he made a call to stand up against the wrongs of the administration, to defend the Union and fight against slavery.","Buchanan was well aware the Union was in jeopardy but wanted desperately to preserve the status quo. He was not a defender of slavery but he recognized its economic importance to the South. He was troubled by the Constitutional guarantees of State sovereignty which applied to both the North and the South and the issue of the constitutionality of secession.

This was an important event because the international slave trade had been considered piracy but had not been prosecuted due to the existence of slavery in the United States. Now, however, the Lincoln administration changed all that with the first execution by hanging of one of the most notorious and successful of all of the slave traders.","Gordon, a native of Maine, had been engaged in the slave trade for many years. On August 8, 1860 off the West Coast of Africa his ship stopped and was boarded by Lieutenant Henry D. Todd, U.S.N. of the United States steamer <em>Mohican</em>. When Lieutenant Todd boarded the ship which was flying the American flag he was horrified by both the sight and smell of what he saw.  On board, he found eight hundred and ninety-seven men, women and children. They ranged in age from six months to forty years; half were children and the other half, one quarter men and one quarter women. They were so crowded together he could not move without stepping on someone. The smell was so foul as to be sickening. Disease ran rampant. Twenty-nine had died and been thrown overboard.","The sailors claimed that they had been told this was a legitimate voyage or they would have never signed on. They also said that it was obvious that Gordon was the Captain. Gordon eventually admitted to them that the <em>Erie</em> was a slave ship and they were told they would receive one dollar for each slave who arrived safely at their destination.","Gordon was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. All attempts to have him pardoned were unsuccessful and he was scheduled to be hanged. The night before, he somehow managed to come into the possession of a poison, probably strychnine, and attempted to commit suicide rather than face the hangman's noose. Unfortunately for him, his attempt was thwarted by the efforts of physicians who pumped his stomach and saved his life. ","Gordon's last request was that they cut a lock of his hair and send it to his wife along with a ring he removed from his finger. Gordon was given rather large amounts of whiskey to keep him alive for the execution and so he was not sober when he went to his fate. ","The execution of Gordon was so important a signal of the impending end of the slave trade that the execution was held in an unlikely place – City Prison, New York City – better known as \"The Tombs\". Gordon was the only slave trader ever executed in the United States.

Probably using the fact that he had resided in a state where slavery was illegal, Illinois, this slave's lawyer would have argued that once the slave passed into Illinois he became a free man. The \"once free, always free\" argument was frequently used to the great benefit of enslaved blacks, in many cases leading to their freedom.

Although it may seem outlandish, the strength of this local legend about the Lafitte brothers, Pierre and Jean, persists to this day. The National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings, as well as The National Historic Landmarks Program, describe the structure on Bourbon Street as being built by the Lafittes between 1772 and 1791. Both sources claim that the brothers used the building to front a blacksmith shop to cover their reprehensible dealings in pirating and slavery."," The cottage at 941 Bourbon Street is a historical building in itself. It is located at the intersection of Bourbon and Saint Philip Street. This section of New Orleans is known as the French Quarter or Vieux Carre. The streets forming the Vieux Carre, or the old square, are the original streets of the city. William C. Davis explains that the names are \"redolent of [the] French and Spanish History.\" Historians acknowledge that this area prospered during the time of the Lafittes. Furthermore, the structure of the cottage is very emblematic of the French Colonial architectural style of the time period. The cottage is constructed with timbers of cypress, soft brick, and plaster. According to the historian Liliane Crete, the fact that the wood is cypress illustrates that \"the lowland of Louisiana was entirely covered with cypresses.\"","While 941 Bourbon Street is important because of its preservation of a historic style and time period, it is the brothers associated with it that solidify its historical importance and legendary quality. Many stories exist that tell of the Lafitte's blacksmith shop located on Bourbon Street and Saint Philip Street and the affairs, adventures, and trials of the brothers. The Lafitte brothers are very important to the history of New Orleans, particularly the slave trade. Many people in Louisiana wanted slaves, but several situations limited the supply, such as the embargo on importation of Africans into the United States. The Lafittes exploited the situation in order to become wealthy by providing slaves through illicit dealings when no one else could. They also became involved in many scandals and political situations.","Although legends, myths and other sources believe that the Lafittes lived or worked in the building, others argue the association. The author Barbara SoRelle Bacot believes, \"[941 Bourbon Street] is romantically known as Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop, but it has nothing to do with Lafitte or any blacksmith.\"  She attributes the association to the nineteenth century writer George Washington Cable. Although it is difficult to find concrete evidence for either side, whether the Lafitte brothers truly built the structure is not what is important. 941 Bourbon Street is enlivened by the local legends of Pierre and Jean Lafitte and in turn has immortalized their legends in the region."],"display_date":"1810 - 1823","search_date":"1816-12-31","locations":[{"id":5594,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4623,"title":"Crittenden Attempts to Stave off Secession","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-12-18","end_date":"1860-12-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":null,"display_date":"December 18, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-18","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4446,"title":"<em>Governor Claiborne Remembered 23 Years After Death...</em>\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-20","end_date":"1840-08-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["        All the earth stood silent on December 20, 1803, as the Mississippi territorial governor rode in on the streets of New Orleans. Beautiful women adorned the balconies that hung over the Place d' Armes. Each country, represented by its own amount of officials and military, watched as the France flag descended and the American flag ascended succinctly down the pole, meeting halfway to acknowledge exchange of powers. President Thomas Jefferson instructed William Claiborne, Mississippi's current territorial governor at the time and General Wilkinson, commander of the United States Western Army to receive Louisiana from France, who just received it from Spain within the same year. The transaction happened in a time frame of less than 20 days. With the documents signed making the Louisiana Purchase official, Governor Claiborne made a speech to the inhabitants that promised their way of life would not be disturbed. The United States received the \"keys\" to the city and thus the elected William C.C. Claiborne began to act as governor of the territory of Louisiana.","            The Portrait of Governor Claiborne was painted in 1840, 23 years after his death. It is probable that E.B. Savary chose to paint the Governor at a time where New Orleans had a growing population. According to U.S. Bureau of the Census for Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places, New Orleans was the third largest city in 1840 with a population of 102,193 persons. Aside from the rise of popularization of New Orleans, many Louisianans favored Claiborne due to his passiveness in government. Many considered Claiborne qualified for governor because he had served as assistant to a Congress clerk, opened a law firm, appointed as a Tennessee Supreme Court Judge, and selected by President Thomas Jefferson to preside as Mississippi territorial governor. From the very beginning Claiborne sought to appease the people of New Orleans. He adopted their style, delayed the necessary revisions to the laws, and appointed locals to the political office.  This led to a number of critics including that of Andrew Jackson, major General of U.S. forces. In his opinion, he thought of Claiborne as \"much better qualified for great pomp and show, and courting popularity-quiet life- in civil walks- than military achievements amidst peril danger\". Vincent Nolte, a local German-born merchant described Claiborne as \"a weak, intriguing, and gutless man who had not the energy necessary to give a great impulse to the population of Louisiana and cared only for his popularity and preeminence\".

David Wilmot, a Democratic representative from Pennsylvania at the time, added a proposal of how to settle the slavery question once and for all, known as the Wilmot Proviso. The proviso called for an end to slavery in any new states admitted to the Union. In 1848, the people elected Whig Zachary Taylor for president over Democratic contender Lewis Cass. So how did President Taylor really feel about the proviso?","    An excerpted news source in Augusta, Georgia, reported that some Democratic papers had published a letter said to be written by General Taylor in the Spring of 1847 regarding the proviso. The contents included in the 1848 pamphlet state that the letter was susceptible of a construction that would make General Taylor seem to favor that doctrine. That letter was later proven to be false and possibly fabricated, as the editor who received the letter and interpreted it to mean that President Taylor would favor the Wilmot Proviso had abandoned the issue, and General Taylor with it. This sampled article is one of several pieces in a anonymously published pamphlet from 1848 that look at whether Taylor actually believed that Congress had the constitutional power to settle the slavery question with the Wilmot Proviso. ","    Scholarship from 2006 suggests a split between the Northern and Southern Whigs on Taylor's intentions. James Brewer Stewart, Professor of History at Macalester College, argues that in 1848, the Southern Whigs claimed Taylor despised the Wilmot Proviso and if elected, he would successfully oppose it; yet Northern Whigs guaranteed that the moment that Congress passed the Proviso, Taylor would sign it.","    Towards the end of the pamphlet, the anonymous author found direct testimony of Taylor's opposition to the Wilmot Proviso through strained readings and comparisons. The language found from an exchange between southern statesman Joseph Segar and Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise in Hampton, Virginia stated that Taylor would exercise the veto on any bill containing the provisions of the Wilmot Proviso. Historian Holman Hamilton also adds that Taylor and Cass occupied the same ground, that the Proviso should not be adopted. Considering Taylor himself was a slaveholder,  he would not compromise his and his fellow southerners' lifestyle, yet again delaying resolution of resolving slavery in the United States."],"display_date":1848,"search_date":"1848-07-01","locations":[{"id":6208,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":11,"place":"SUFFOLK, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4460,"title":"NAACP&#39;s Litigation Strategy in Prince Edward County\n","course_id":19,"status":"P","start_date":"5/1/48","end_date":"12/1/56","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["      The NAACP's litigation strategy against school segregation went through a drastic change during the summer of 1950. Instead of working within the confines of Plessy v. Ferguson, which declared the constitutionality of the \"separate but equal doctrine\", the NAACP decided that the time had come to force the courts to reconsider segregation. Prior to 1950, the NAACP only tried cases where they could prove obvious inequality in segregated public education.  This philosophy changed dramatically at the Boston convention in the summer of 1950, when the NAACP made a resolution to only take new cases that challenged the institution of segregation itself.  The NAACP's deliberate change in legal maneuvering had alienating effects in both white and black communities, but it was ultimately successful with Brown decision. When looking at the relationship of history and the law, it is important to ask how and why such a pronounced change occurred in the legal thinking of the NAACP's lawyers. The Prince Edward County case provides helpful insight into understanding this legal change because it was filed in 1951 just as the NAACP was in the process of transitioning their legal strategy. ","      While the NAACP lawyers were busy going through huge organizational changes, the African American students at Moton High School in Prince Edward County were equally busy unifying themselves to go on strike. Under the student-initiated leadership of Barbara Johns, the students at Moton High were tired of their overcrowded and dilapidated school, and the students sought legal redress from the school board . The students at Moton High called upon the Richmond branch of the NAACP to help with its legal campaign. However, the student leaders at Moton high were completely unaware of the NAACP's change in legal strategy. Instead of integration, students like Barbara were merely hoping to improve their segregated educational facilities.  The leading attorneys Oliver Hill and Spottswood Robinson had a completely different agenda. In a speech to the African American students and parents in Prince Edward County, Robinson implored the necessity for challenging segregation as an institution stating \"The NAACP has undertaken its non-segregation policy after realizing that previous experiences had proven that there can exist no equality in a segregated school system\".  The previous experiences that Robinson mentions come directly from previous court rulings where ridiculous restrictions and exceptions were made by segregationists to maintain white supremacy.","       Prior to 1950 most NAACP lawyers and organizers believed that public school officials would eventually realize that operating dual public school systems with equal facilities was economically infeasible. However, as the NAACP tried cases with graduate students, it became apparent that segregationists were not rational. Instead of working within the free market system, segregationists would spare little expense to keep white and black students apart. The NAACP grew exceedingly disillusioned with the idea that segregation would eventually come to an end for economic reasons. Furthermore, equal facility suits were time consuming and expensive to prove and the outcomes of such suits only applied to the district where the case was brought.   While previous cases challenged the inequality of segregated facilities, the NAACP lawyers took an extremely different approach in the Prince Edward County case. In the Prince Edward County case much of the evidence was based on sociological and psychological research that focused on the negative effects that segregation had on African American children.  Reputable doctors and psychologists demonstrated how the segregated facilities led black students to have lower conceptions of themselves and their race. The acceptance of this evidence as credible is crucial to understanding how the system of segregation was undermined in the Brown vs. Board of Education case."],"display_date":"May 1, 1948 - December 1, 1956","search_date":"1952-08-16","locations":[{"id":26640,"lat":37.2242881205,"lng":-78.441116268,"zoom":10,"place":"Prince Edward, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":62,"tag":"Prince Edward"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Race and Politics of Reconciliation","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":19,"school_id":1}},{"id":4538,"title":"To free, or not to free.

The year before the South passed the North in integration of schools and the North’s integration record continued to decline in the 1960s.  The question facing Americans was whether the busing plans would overcome the opposition.  Some cities moved forward with the forced integration via busing, but other cities fought back.  Opposition ranged from legal appeals to violence.  President Nixon held a strong anti-busing stance and instructed the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to “work with individual school districts to hold busing to the minimum required by law.”  Some felt that his opposition caused more problems.","The New York Times examined specific cases to see how desegregation was taking place.  In Houston, Texas, Nixon intervened with citywide busing and “asked the Justice Department to appeal the ruling.”  Denver, Colorado’s opposition won in their court case and went on to consider other plans.  San Francisco, California saw “heckling and fist fights” at meetings discussing busing.  They experienced large opposition from Chinese-Americans, as well as conservative whites.  The assistant chief of the Office of Intergroup Relations for the California Department of Education, Ted Neff, felt that “Racial and ethnic isolation is increasing.”  Wichita, Kansas, under pressure to integrate, chose to integrate according to the “city’s racial make-up”.  Pontiac, Michigan appealed a court order to start busing in the fall failed and   ten buses were firebombed as school was beginning that year.  The Seattle, Washington school board attempted to implement a citywide busing plan, but was stopped by a court order.  Rochester, New York began busing voluntarily, while Providence, Rhode Island was in it’s third stage of desegregation, there were still strong objections seen here.  Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth, of Minnesota, underwent partial integration.  The states of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts sternly enforced busing, particularly in major cities.  Harrisburg, Pennsylvania began a busing program in 1970 “based on the students’ racial and economic background.” Pittsburgh and Philadelphia appealed the order.  “Richardson Dilworth, president of the Philadelphia school board and former Mayor, said, ‘The white population of this city would never permit the kind of massive cross-busing the order would require, nor would the City Council or the state legislature appropriate the money’” The Massachusetts Board of Education chose to deny $21.3 million dollars in funding from Boston, because of their unwillingness to comply with the busing program.","These events coincided with, and in some cases were a reaction to, the influential court case of <em>Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education </em>(1971)<em>. </em>This stated that because racial integration is so important, busing could be used, if necessary.  Opponents to busing, like the cities mentioned in the article, felt busing interfered with their community.  Although Nixon campaigned on a strict anti-busing stance, he was not able to stop the busing programs from moving forward.

Or at least one of his 12 original Constitutional amendments had been resuscitated. With near unanimity (Senate: 99-0; House: 414-3) Congress showed its support for the Twenty-Seventh Amendment on May 20,1992. The Amendment prohibits adjustments to Congressional salaries from taking effect before an election intercedes. Yet the vote was largely meaningless, as earlier in the month Michigan had become the thirty-eighth state to ratify the proposal – thus giving it the three-quarters proportion needed to amend the Constitution. Six states originally ratified the proposal between 1789 and 1791; Ohio became the seventh in 1873. Only one other state (Wyoming, in 1978) would endorse it before a legislative aide in Texas named Gregory Watson stumbled across the amendment in 1982 and initiated a campaign for its revival. By 1988, a total of 25 states had ratified Madison's motion.","But had the 203 years between its proposal and ultimate adoption rendered the earliest states' approval invalid? No, according to Don Wilson, Archivist of the United States, who certified the Amendment's validity six days prior to the vote in Congress. (It has become practice recently for proposals to contain a sunset clause – typically seven years – but this was not the case with Madison's amendments.) And thus it became law. Although why – after having lain dormant for two centuries – should this proposal suddenly take on such importance?","There is a theory as to how “structural” amendments such as the Twenty-Seventh arise. An event triggers widespread awareness of a problem with how government works. In response, a coalition forms that amends the Constitution to resolve the problem. In 1989, Congress implemented pay raises that saw Senate salaries increase 14 percent – and House salaries go up 40 percent – by 1991. Over this same time frame, public confidence in Congress fell significantly. There was little public appetite for Congressional pay increases in the face of growing perceptions of arrogance and allegations of corruption against some members of Congress. It is no surprise then that the elections of 1990 and 1992 revealed strong anti-incumbent sentiments amongst the electorate. Combined with Watson's drive, this led 15 states (including the linchpin, Michigan) to endorse the resolution between 1989 and 1992, as a means of restoring some legitimacy to the governing institutions in the public’s eye.

Nevertheless, it is an example of the tradition of using the constitution to correct a structural problem of government, one even the Founding Fathers recognized as an issue. “James Madison saw something wrong with members of Congress increasing their own salaries, unchecked by their constituencies...

Hunt.  Presiding over the cases at Law argued and determined in the Court of Appeals of South Carolina at Charleston were the Honorable judges David Johnson, J.B. O’Neall, and W.M. Harper.  Lieutenant McCready approached the court with the following argument, “The relator prays the court to grant him a writ of mandamus, to be directed to the said Col. Hunt, and all others whom it may concern in refusing to deliver to the relator his commission and commanding him and them to acknowledge your relator as rightfully entitled to exercise the said office of Lieutenant of the Washington Light infantry,  aforesaid and the relator further prays for such other, and further relief in the premises, as to the Court shall seem meet.”  After McCready’s argument was brought before the court, Colonel Hunt presented his opening statement arguing that Lieutenant M’Cready had refused the oath provided under the Military Act.  In defense of his actions Colonel Hunt demonstrated why he refused to commission the young officer in which the presiding Judge Johnson stated, “And for the cause why he refused to commission the said Edward McCready, the respondent sheweth that the authority given to the colonel of a Regiment to issue commissions, respondent considers purely executive; and that he is bound to do what he presumes the Governor would do, if he had acted directly.”","                Of the many following arguments, Mr. Attorney General Smith provides an insight into whether the oath under the military act required allegiance to the state.  Mr. Smith argues whether the state can demand such allegiance, “If she has, of course there can be none due to the general government and all objections based upon any such supposition, are laid aside.”  By providing the history of the word allegiance, Mr. Smith brings before the court the issue as to where the word allegiance derived and makes his claim that the term is used to “form the bond of connexion and obedience between the people and the government.”  Mr. Attorney General Smith then expounds upon the term of allegiance and its subservient role to sovereignty.  “Having now settled that allegiance is due to sovereignty, and that sovereignty is that power in a state, which is supreme, irresistible, absolute and uncontrollable; the next questions in order are was there every any sovereignty in South Carolina?”  The intricacies of the legal process are extremely well noted and documented in the text ranging from the extensive vernacular used by the judges and attorneys to the adherence to state statutes and local ordinances all the while connecting them to the Constitution.  Mr. Smith concludes his argument before the court, “I trust that I have shewn, that the state has a right to the exclusive allegiance of her citizens, and whether the oath in the Military Bill is considered as passed by the authority of the Ordinance, or as a mere act of the legislature, passed by the authority of its general legislative powers, it is equally constitutional.” Judge Johnson delivers the opinion of the court by issuing a writ of mandamus to Lieutenant McCready under the presumption that, “the allegiance of the citizens of South Carolina is due both to the state government and the government of the United sates—that the state constitution having prescribed the form of an oath on that subject, the legislature had no authority to change, add to, or alter it.  That the convention having been called for a specific object, and that object having been fully attained and accomplished, the legislature could not derive their authority to require an oath of allegiance, in a different form, from an ordinace of the convention, subsequently passed.”"],"display_date":"May 25, 1834","search_date":"1834-05-25","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":715,"tag":"Military"},{"id":744,"tag":"court case"},{"id":745,"tag":"charleston, sc"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5074,"title":"William Whaley, Esq Presents his case before the Supreme Court of South Carolina","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-01-01","end_date":"1869-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Civil War was one of the most important events in American History, however, a major part of the Civil War is not emphasized. That is, its economic impact. With the freeing of thousands of slaves who had previously been property, the economic impact on slave owners and traders was enormous. Many, many court cases arose in regards to the issue of “Bonds given in the Sale of Negros.” One such case, Calhoun vs Calhoun, was eventually brought before the Supreme Court of the state of South Carolina.","Mr. William Whaley, Esq presented his argument for the defendant, the farmer who had bought the slaves, to the Court. The issue is, of course, that Calhoun, the buyer, had not had the money to directly purchase all his slaves and had issued bonds to the slave trader for them. When, however, all the slaves were freed, he did not pay the bonds. The slave trader Calhoun now brought a suit against him for the debt of those bonds.","Mr. Whaley's arugment had two separate parts. The first part discussed whether or not the court had jurisdiction. There were two important points he made here. The first is, there were federal and state laws prohibiting the interference with the completion of a contract. However, both the state of South Carolina and the Federal government had since issued laws that stated any cases or contracts dealing with the sale of African-Americans were to be null and void.","The second part of the argument lay in the idea of what a bond is. It is a debter-issued “IOU” of sorts, wherein he is promising to pay the seller a certain price for his good, with both parties knowing he doesn't have the money or trade-goods at the time of purchase. Whaley argued that therefore, the slaves are in a sense on loan, until the buyer had fully paid the price. If that being the case then, it is the fully economic responsibility of the seller to take the loss, as the purchaser never entirely owned the slaves.","This case is one of many, many similar cases brought to the courts all throughout the South after the Civil War and the freeing of the slaves. The change in law that occurred after the Civil War shows a dramatic shift towards that of a capitalist mindset. Judges increasingly ruled in favor of the capitalist market. However, in a case like this, it is not exactly clear who the capitalist is, the ex-slave buyer, or the ex-slaver seller, now both feeling the economic impact of all that lost capital. It was a huge burden to farmers and slave traders, but a great boost to the economy as the slaves now owned their own labor."],"display_date":"1868 - 1869","search_date":"1868-12-31","locations":[{"id":11638,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":746,"tag":"Supreme Court"},{"id":747,"tag":"Negro Bonds"},{"id":748,"tag":"Whaley"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5257,"title":"<strong>Dr. Timothy Leary Defends Responsible Use of LSD</strong>","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"5/1/66","end_date":"5/31/66","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["By 1966, interest in LSD had proliferated in the public sphere to an enormous extent. The debate over the chemical’s risks and therapeutic possibilities led to Senate subcommittee hearings on its use. Acid, as LSD is commonly called, had been sensationalized by mass media publications and, although in its early years it had been extensively and responsibly studied by medical professionals, the effects of such a powerful chemical remained unclear. Psychologist Timothy Leary was one of the most prominent advocates of LSD, arguing that his medical research of LSD had shown tremendous therapeutic possibilities. However, many Americans remained suspicious of the chemical’s powerful nature. Chairman Thomas Dodd, a conservative Democrat from Connecticut, called for quick measures to stamp out the rapid spread of LSD among America’s youth generation.","In order to gain a better understanding of LSD’s implications, Senator Dodd convened subcommittee hearings on recreational drug use among America’s youth. Leary was one of many expert witnesses called to testify. In his testimony, he asserted that “the challenge of the psychedelic chemicals is not just how to control them, but how to use them,” emphasizing the need for further investigation of LSD rather than complete prohibition. Leary also claimed that LSD and many other psychedelic drugs were not dangerous if used wisely and with precautions.","However, his opinion endured aggressive questioning by Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who criticized Leary’s testimony as “general hyperbole.” Additionally, the subcommittee chairman cited an earlier testimony by another doctor who argued that LSD encouraged homicidal tendencies and destructive behavior. Leary continued his attempts to placate the committee and remove LSD’s negative associations. When Kennedy asked if LSD usage was “extremely dangerous,” Leary replied, “Sir, the motor car is dangerous if used improperly… Human stupidity and ignorance is the only danger human beings face in this world.” Leary’s testimony urged for some type of licensing that would require LSD users to be highly trained, much like a pilot’s license, so that responsible adults could use LSD “for serious purposes, such as spiritual growth, pursuit of knowledge, or their own personal development.” He also noted that without such licensing, Americans faced “another era of prohibition” that would create a new group of college-educated white-collar criminals. In a later autobiographical work, Leary would claim that Kennedy’s bullying presence was merely an attempt “to gain respectability points by lynching me!”","Leary was one of many experts who testified at the 1966 subcommittee hearings, which showed both ardent support and uncompromising opposition to LSD. Its testimonies marked the conflict between medical professionals, intellectuals, and government officials who struggled to agree on LSD’s meaning as well its regulation. The hearings also embodied the highly politicized atmosphere of the 1960s, which had conservative politicians utilizing acid as a scapegoat and to suppress radicalism among America’s younger generations. Just several months after the subcommittee hearings, LSD was banned in California. By October 1968, possession of LSD was banned federally in the United States with the passage of the Staggers-Dodd Bill, marking a tremendous step towards the “War On Drugs” campaign that would arise in the 1970s."],"display_date":"May 1966","search_date":"1966-05-16","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1007,"tag":"Drug Culture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5261,"title":"Surgeon General Fights Prejudice to Provide the Facts on AIDS to the Public","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/84","end_date":"12/31/88","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Timothy Murphy, author of <em>AIDS, Morality, and Culture,</em> recalled that in, “A 1988 report…some 8 to 60 percent of persons surveyed considered AIDS to be God’s punishment for immoral sexual behavior.”  Many of President Ronald Reagan’s closest advisors also felt the individuals who had contracted AIDS were deserving of the plague that was now cleansing the earth of the unfaithful.  Much of the language used to discuss the epidemic was considered to be bedroom language and too taboo to say in public.","Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, charged with writing a detailed report on AIDS for the American people, described the development of AIDS in the US, “AIDS entered the consciousness of the public health service very quietly, very gradually, and with no fanfare at all.”  Even Surgeon General Koop found himself cut off from the deliberations for the first five years of the epidemic. President Reagan’s advisors shielded and isolated the president from the AIDS epidemic.  These individuals kept AIDS at the bottom of the presidential agenda because they felt there was nothing the government could do. However, Roger Higgs argues that the AIDS epidemic brought “greater openness” in public discourse in due time.","Negative stigmatism made it difficult for Koop to approach presidential advisors even after it was proven that it could be transmitted outside of homosexual acts.  The initial term for the epidemic was Gay-Related Immune Deficiency or GRID, in reference to the largest initial group of individuals to experience the disease.  Research proved that it was also transmissible through blood transfusion and heterosexual sex and the name was changed to Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS in 1982.  Despite the lingering social stigma, Koop remembered that the “the first public health priority…stop further transmission.”","The Reagan administration dealt with the crisis in a lackadaisical fashion and restricted Surgeon General Koop from obtaining information. Because of this public health measures for the prevention of AIDS took developed slower than they should have, even as research on the disease was progressing at an astounding rate.  Koop stated “we learned as much about the virus of AIDS in six years as we had learned about the polio virus in the previous 40 years.”  Development of the technology to detect and screen the blood for AIDS contamination was pivotal in the prevention of transmission.","The stigmas surrounding AIDS created ethical concerns for the dissemination of information to the general public.  Koop recalled that advisors to the president were very upset with certain terminology in the report, specifically “penis, vagina, rectum and condom.”  The AIDS epidemic exposed this language, making it mainstream and allowed for easier open and serious discussions about safe sex.  Koop was right when he stated, “at last with that report, the people of the country knew what was myth and what was reality about the AIDS epidemic.”  The American public was in the dark entirely too long, mostly due to the negative stigmas that surrounded AIDS in relation to homosexuality.  Koop fought to balance the need to share information and to please the Reagan administration and mainstream America."],"display_date":"1984 - 1988","search_date":"1986-07-02","locations":[{"id":40259,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5288,"title":"<p>Birth of Eugenics – Death of Compassion&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" /&gt;</p>","course_id":73,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/24","end_date":"10/19/27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 19, 1927, Carrie Buck struggled against the orderlies taking her to the operating room. She wondered how she came to this point in her life. She had been given to a foster family, then raped and impregnated by a family friend. Authorities took away her daughter, Vivian, when Carrie was institutionalized to hide the foster family’s shame. Carrie became Virginia’s first test case in a groundbreaking Supreme Court case on the sterilization of institutionalized individuals. However, Carrie lost the case and was forced by the court to follow through with the dehumanizing sterilization process.","The wishes of the Supreme Court had been carried out according to <em>Buck v. Bell (1924)</em>. Involuntary sterilization was to be the answer to all social ills by breeding out all of “the undesirable traits” in humanity. Harry H. Laughlin wrote the Model Eugenical Sterilization Law that began the wave of mandatory sterilization for individuals in institutions. The main scope of the law was to prevent the “socially inadequate classes” of people from procreating thereby tainting the American people. According to Laughlin, these groups included “insane, epileptic, diseased, blind, deaf, deformed, and dependent (including orphans, ne’er-do-wells, the homeless, tramps and paupers).”","Laughlin did not come to the <em>Buck v. Bell </em>trial, nor did he ever meet Carrie Buck, although he did testify in writing that the Virginia Colony’s director, Albert Priddy, correctly assessed Carrie and her family as members of “the shiftless, ignorant, and worthless class of anti-social whites of the South.” Authorities regularly assessed individuals in the south as “non-producing and shiftless persons, living on public and private charity.”","When the Supreme Court supported <em>Buck v. Bell</em> in an 8-1 vote, Laughlin celebrated because this led the way for more sterilization laws to be passed and his work at the Eugenics Records Office in Cold Harbor could continue supported by the Supreme Court. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stated in his opinion that “three generations of imbeciles is enough,” speaking of Carrie’s mother, Carrie, and her daughter. Vivian was declared an imbecile at age six months because she did not follow a coin with her eyes in front of a camera. The Supreme Court’s decision took away the rights of the people deemed unworthy by society to choose to be sterilized or not. <em>Laughlin emphasized that the endorsement of state authority to perform compulsory operations without regard for the consent of the patient or his family was an \"outstanding feature\" of the </em><em>Buck</em><em> decision.</em>","The south was the area most affected by the sterilization laws. Laughlin’s law supported the idea that segregation was not only a necessity, but also required to maintain the purity of the American people. Whereas many Northern states put sterilizations laws into effect much earlier than southern states, like Virginia and South Carolina, only California surpassed the south in the number of compulsory sterilizations. The relevant sections of the sterilization law only came off the books in 1974 in the state of Virginia. In 2002, Virginia State Governor Mark Warner made an official apology to the Buck family and “the survivors of involuntary sterilization.”"],"display_date":"January 1, 1924 - October 19, 1927","search_date":"1925-11-24","locations":[{"id":20511,"lat":37.4182087686,"lng":-79.1519048441,"zoom":12,"place":"Lynchburg City, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}],"course":{"name":"History of the New South","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":73,"school_id":49}},{"id":5301,"title":"Georgia Congressman Alexander Stephens Discourages Southern Secession","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-11-01","end_date":"1860-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While angry Georgians voted in favor of secession in 1860, the small, sickly Georgia Congressman Alexander Stephens stood by and watched, helpless to avoid the crisis he had known was coming for years.  During Georgia’s secession in November of 1860, Congressman Stephens spoke in firm opposition.  Stephens, soon to be elected Vice President of the Confederacy, argued that Southern states should not secede until a Constitutional right was violated.  “If all our hopes are to be blasted, if the Republic is to go down,” exclaimed Stephens, “let us be found to the last moment standing on the deck with the Constitution of the United States waving over our heads.”","Alexander Stephens began his career in politics as a member of the Whig Party, focused on economic development through support of Henry Clay’s American System.  He worked with Zachary Taylor’s campaign for the election of 1848.  During the campaign he met Abraham Lincoln, and the two formed a friendly relationship.  When Taylor admitted California and New Mexico to the Union as free states, betraying Southern Whigs such as Stephens, Stephens reluctantly left the party and became a Democrat.","Stephens had been a strong supporter of Henry Clay’s Compromise of 1850, and in the rising conflict he referred to it as the ultimate law to be answered to—particularly in matters of popular sovereignty.  While his fellow Southerners became increasingly irate over the slavery debate in the 1850s, Stephens desperately referred to the Constitution and the Compromise of 1850, arguing that so long as none of the laws of these documents had been broken, the South had not been harmed.","When the South erupted with anger over the election of Illinois Republican Abraham Lincoln in 1860, Stephens knew the Union could not last.  Georgia Governor Joe Brown called for a convention in November of 1860 to discuss possible secession, an idea most Georgians already supported.  At the convention Alexander Stephens spoke logically—though not passionately—against secession, on the grounds that no Constitutional law had been violated in Lincoln’s election.  Stephens declared, “The result was different from what we wished; but the election has been constitutionally held.”  Stephens further suggested that since the North had committed no Constitutional offense, the South should not secede until a Constitutional right was violated.  This way the South would be fighting with justice on their side, and not simply against the Constitution in which Stephens so strongly believed."],"display_date":"November 1848 -

The Copperheads threatened aggression against both Federal officers and members of the Union military. However, “authorities in this State and Indiana were soon informed of the demonstration and an adequate force to squelch all the traitors was soon at hand.” While the Copperheads then dispersed without any bloodshed, they were said to be bold and swore that a draft would not occur in Edgar County, Illinois.","The term Copperhead was first coined in an article that appeared in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on July 20, 1861.

The reason for this was that some individuals within the Midwest had Southern roots. However, the Copperheads’ yeomen interests within the Midwest conflicted with the Republican industrialists, which precipitated bitterness.","Copperheads opposed the escalation of the sectional conflict into a full blown war.

Once in Ohio, they sought refuge at a former slave’s home.","The fugitives’ owners arrived the next day searching for the runaways in order to take them back to Kentucky.  Because of The Fugitive Slave Act passed in 1850, they were able to obtain a warrant and the assistance of the local United States Marshal.  The act stated that it was the duty of marshals and deputy marshals to carry out the warrants.  <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> detailed the events that unfolded at the house where Garner and her family were hiding: shots were fired, a deputy marshal was injured, and the door was breached.  Upon entry into the house, they discovered the dead child.  <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> described the scene by saying, “a deed of horror had been consummated, for weltering in its blood, the throat being cut ear to ear and the head almost severed from the body, upon the floor lay one of the children of the younger couple, a girl three years old.”  Garner proceeded to hit the dead child with a shovel before being restrained.  At the time, it was unclear who had killed the child; <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> stated, “The fearful act lies between one or the other of the miserable parents, perhaps both, but doubtless, the truth will be brought out by the coroner to-day.”","Indeed, the truth was “brought out.”  Julius Yanuck, a historian, discusses the story in a journal article almost a century later.  When Garner discovered that they were about to be captured, she devised a desperate plan that would save her children from returning to slavery – escape through death.  Quickly she grabbed a knife and seized her three-year-old daughter.  Using the knife, she gashed open her daughter’s throat.  She then turned to her other children, but was stopped before she could manage to do more than mildly injure them.","Much agitation grew out of the escape and murder.  <em>The Cincinnati Enquirer</em> summed up the article and captured the sense of tension by saying, “Abolitionists regard the parents of the murdered child as a hero and heroine, teeming with lofty and holy emotions, who, Virginiuslike would rather imbue their hands in the blood of their offspring than allow them to wear the shackles of slavery, while others look upon them as brutal and unnatural murderers.”  Whether selfish or selfless, the acts of Garner were not quickly forgotten."],"display_date":"January 27, 1856 -

Curtin submitted his views and worries on the recent riots that had occurred in Schuylkill County to Secretary of War, E.M. Stanton. He described several scenarios for upholding the draft in the wake of these rioting men without jailing or punishing them. He wrote in the letter, “I think you would get the men more easily than by the use of force. Men unwilling to go, and unable to pay the probable fine, will serve in the army on pay [in preference] to being shut up in prison without pay.” In this way he is tried to get men to fight in the war and meet the manpower demands, rather than waste their talents in jail.","Many men were uneasy about the idea of a draft and, when it was enacted on March 3, 1963; many riots against the draft, like the one in Schuylkill County, erupted. Notably, the Irish were among the most outraged in the face of the draft. They were opposed to helping slaves in any way, but also they were upset that as non-naturalized citizens, they should not be forced to fight if they did not have the right to vote.","Most men did not have the money to be exempted and if they did, the money could be used for different things then getting exempt from the war. For some reasons such as this, the Civil War became known as the rich man’s war. When a man wanted to be exempted from the draft the fine was $300. This is seen when Curtin wrote in his letter to the Secretary of War, “Those who are able to pay the fine will prefer using the money in procuring substitutes. The same limit of the fine will probably regulate the price of substitutes.” Adjusted for inflation, if Union Soldiers wanted to be exempt from the war, they would have to pay an equivalent of $5,454.55 in today’s economy.","In the summer of 1863 more riots broke out in Cass Township in Schuylkill County in central Pennsylvania. The township did not meet its quota for the war effort, which is why the call for the draft happened in the first place.

Elleanor's life story was penned in her narrative, <em>Memoirs of Elleanor Eldridge.</em> Elleanor was born into a very perculiar set of circumstances. Born in Rhode Island, she was the daughter of a free African-American Man and a female descendent from the Narrahganset tribe. The death of Elleanor’s mother acted as a catalyst that began Elleanor’s life of “self-government and spirited action”(2). Being born into freedom, she was granted many advantages that others of her race still did not possess. However advantageous the circumstances of her birth were, it still did not negate the inferiority of her position within society. It cannot be forgotten that Elleanor was still an African-American girl living in a highly racialized society. She was also the oldest child of the single-parent household with several siblings that needed to be taken care of. While Elleanor was not a slave in the general sense of the word, she was still a slave to the society she was born into. The death of her mother caused Elleanor to sell herself back into a institutionalized version of slavery, where Elleanor was a commodity to the people she served.","Upon the tragic death of her mother, Elleanor packed all of her belongings into a small leather rucksack, kissed each of her brothers and sisters, said goodbye to her father, and set out on a long, dirt road to seek work at the home of her mother’s former employer, the Bakers. The Bakers were an affluent Rhode Island family, who had been very fond of Elleanor's mother. Elleanor, possessing much of her mother's beauty, skill, and charms, was the natural choice for her replacement. Yet, before agreeing to the generous terms of employment that the Baker family had offered her, the ambitious ten-year-old proceeded to bargain the terms of her employment. Through this, Elleanor had placed herself in the “space between person and thing”(1). She was no longer in complete possession of of her own circumstances, and by extension was guilty of selling herself as a commodity, which could be bargained for. However, Elleanor had taken control of the situation through making her own choice of employer. She felt satisfied with the choice she had made for the Bakers maintained a level of respect for Elleanor and possessed the uncommon view of their servants as “belonging to the same great family of man”(2). Elleanor was aware that not all masters shared the same ideals as the Bakers did. Most employers maintained the practice of treating their servants as objects, instead of “accountable beings--as persons indeed, capable of independent thought, feeling, and action--susceptible alike of pleasure and pain, they are considered as the mere appendages of luxury”(2). Through choosing her own employer, power over Elleanor changed hands in Elleanor's favor.","As many faithful years with the Baker Family passed by, Elleanor continued to affect the conditions of her servitude on her own terms. After a year’s work, Elleanor requested that her weekly wages be raised to two cents. From a very young age, Elleanor learned the value of her services and herself as a commodity. From there, she set higher standards for the type of employer she was interested in working for. She was able to have control over her employment circumstances, which was a rarity for her time. She may have had to place herself back into a system she had been lucky to escape at birth, but Elleanor was able to regain control of her own personhood and avocation. She used her circumstances to carve out a place for herself within society as an individual blessed with the freedoms and liberties granted to her."," "],"display_date":"March 1794 - March 1799","search_date":"1796-09-14","locations":[{"id":15349,"lat":41.7585954468,"lng":-71.3839450728,"zoom":7,"place":"Kent, Rhode Island"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":270,"tag":"Freedom"},{"id":468,"tag":"employment"},{"id":1604,"tag":"Female"},{"id":1605,"tag":"Freed Slave"},{"id":1606,"tag":"Liberty"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5681,"title":"The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 and its Deinstitutionalizing Effect on Saint Elizabeth's Hospital","course_id":107,"status":"P","start_date":"10/31/63","end_date":"10/31/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Due to a growing need for mental health services, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was built by the United States Congress as a result of the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation Act of 1852. The Institution opened in Washington, DC in 1855 as the “Government Hospital for the Insane”. A prominent leader in the mental health field, Dorthea Dix, lobbied for the construction of the facility and founded the facility with the goal of providing the \"most humane care and enlightened curative treatment of the insane of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia.” Before this, many of the patients that could be considered “insane” were simply put in jail and were not receiving the care they needed. The name of the facility was later changed to Saint Elizabeth’s in 1916 because it temporarily provided medical care for wounded soldiers during the Civil War and those that were being treated were reluctant to tell people that they were being cared for at a mental institution. Instead they used the name of the colonial area the hospital was originally built on, Saint Elizabeth’s. Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was the first government-run mental institution in the country and was one of the largest mental institutions in the country. The hospital was a pioneer in mental health care at the time of its existence. At its prime in the 1940’s, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was home to over 7,000 patients.","Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital now operates with a small fraction of that number of patients, largely due to a certain historical event, the Community Mental Health Act of 1963. This Act, fully titled the “Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963,” promoted community-based health care and provided federal funding for such facilities. One of the main purposes of this act to was provide government assistance “in improving mental health through grants for construction of community mental health centers.” The government began to fund the construction of outpatient facilities in order to allow mental patients to live more normal lives. Prior to this, mental hospitals were what Erving Goffman would consider “total institutions,” meaning that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was a place in which all of the patients’ activities took place with a large group of others on a schedule, which shut the patients off from the rest of society. This act led to a considerable amount of deinstitutionalization all over the country. The total number of mentally ill patients that were institutionalized went from 650,000 in 1955 to less than 150,000 in 1983. The act, in conjunction with the quickly deteriorating living conditions at the hospital, meant that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was no exception.  With the passage of the Community Mental Health Act of 1963, more patients opted for outpatient care and the number of patients at the hospital steadily declined."],"display_date":"October 31, 1963","search_date":"1963-10-31","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":1655,"tag":"Space"},{"id":267,"tag":"Health"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Making the Modern Hospital","school":"Vanderbilt University","course_id":107,"school_id":60}},{"id":5693,"title":"Three Tribes Confederate for Peace","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-10-21","end_date":"1867-10-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The chiefs and headmen of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Indian tribes met with the United States commissioners, such as Nathaniel G. Taylor and William S. Harney, in Kansas to seal their tribes’ fate in America on October 21, 1867. The United States government referred to the Treaty with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache as a peace treaty, but in reality it forced the tribes to conform to the wills and regulations set forth by the United States government. The treaty demanded that the three Indian tribes confederate and “to be placed, in every respect, upon an equal footing.” The three tribes merged together and were required “to accept as their permanent home the reservation described in the aforesaid treaty” and “to pledge themselves to make no permanent settlement at any place, nor on any lands, outside of said reservation.” All aspects of life on the reservation had to be equally shared and distributed such as clothes, jobs, school buildings, teachers, and the educational system. The United States government required the Indians to keep peace with the white men and every citizen under the jurisdiction of the United States government. This treaty also stated that by signing this treaty this treaty, the Indian tribes “give up and forever relinquish to the United States all rights, privileges, and grants now vested in them, or intended to be transferred to them.” The people of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes gave up their culture, independence, and their tribes’ futures when they signed this treaty.","In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the United States government did not allow Indian tribes to practice their own culture, live freely, and the government did not believe that Indians should be privileged with the common rights of citizens of the United States of America. The government rejected Indians as citizens of the United States. This is evident because the treaty of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes forced the tribes to assimilate with one another and live as if they had always been one uniformed, equal tribe. The Indians’ daily lives were completely changed, and every aspect of their lives was under direct control of the United States government, especially the Native Americans’ educational system. Although this educational system set forth by the government was presented as a gift and a privilege, it is evident that it wasn’t very advantageous, and the educational system did not put the Native Americans’ needs first.","The historian David Adams shows that in reality, these educational institutions created on Native American reservations intended to completely restructure the Native American’s minds and personalities. In attempts to civilize the savage Native Americans, the government forced the children to cut their hair and wear standard American school uniforms, instead of their normal tribal clothing. Some children were also taken from the families and home reservations and transported to other reservations to attend boarding school. In making such drastic changes to the children’s lifestyles, it was inevitable that the children would become more Americanized, which is exactly what the United States government wanted. The rights and privileges of the Native Americans were truly relinquished to the United States government, just like the Treaty with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache enforced; the Native Americans did not even have control of their children and their children’s education.  These said advantages, like an educational system, given to the Native Americans were not really advantages at all. They were just a ploy in order for the United States government to gain what they wanted, land ownership, and keep the Native Americans out of their way to manifest destiny.<br /><br />"],"display_date":"October 21, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-21","locations":[{"id":4489,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"SHAWNEE, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5700,"title":"Native American Education Improves Under U.S. Government","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/76","end_date":"12/31/76","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Third Annual Report to the Congress of the United States outlined the needs, concerns, funding, and progresses of the Indian educational system set forth by the government. The National Advisory Council on Indian Education created this report in 1976 in Washington, D.C. The president of the United States appointed this council in order to assist the 570 native groups affected by the regulations of the Indian educational system. The council comprised of Americans who observed and worked with the native groups. Observations of the council members “revealed that much remains to be done before adequate and equal educational opportunities can be achieved by the Indian people.” The annual report stated that for the Indian people, Indian Education “is a method of teaching that revives an appreciation for Indian heritage and generates a positive self-image so that one accepts and understands the environment and social conditions surrounding him.” This appreciation of Indian heritage and positive self-image was lost many years ago when the American government first intruded onto Indian territories. The council addressed this loss in the report to Congress by stating that the American Indians’ 200 years experience under an authoritarian paternal relationship with the Federal Government has “clearly demonstrated that paternalism is alien to liberty and freedom.”","The Third Annual Report to the Congress of the United States clearly showed how the government progressed and improved upon the Indian Educational System. Historian David Adams exposed that the government originally created the Indian Educational System to civilize the natives, because the natives were believed to be savages. The school system intended to provide the natives with an education that would habituate them to the customs and advantages of a civilized life. The government tried to manipulate the natives into becoming exactly like American citizens, regardless of their heritage, religion, traditions, or tribal affiliations. The government believed that since the native ways of life were different than the traditional American lifestyle, the natives must be less civilized than American citizens. The government most recently formed educational policies regarding Indian Education with goals to respect the wishes and the desires of natives so that the natives may design and manage their own educational programs according to the tribal level. The United States government has allowed the natives to incorporate their own values, beliefs, and culture into the natives’ educational system instead of strictly regulating every aspect of native life. In reality, there has never truly been an American Educational system prior to modern-day; the faux system was based on the standard methods and systems of the non-Indian society and a process by which the government has tried to teach the natives how to become like the white man."],"display_date":1976,"search_date":"1976-07-01","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5783,"title":"One Man’s Death Wish Due to the Slave Law of Kansas","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-06-06","end_date":"1856-06-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1855, Senator David Atchison of Missouri said, “Mark every scoundrel among you that is the least tainted with free-soilism, or abolitionism, and exterminate him…[e]nter every election district in Kansas . . . and vote at the point of a Bowie knife or revolver!” according to historian James McPherson.

The Slave Law Act managed situations ranging from free people who violated the Law Code (who were sentenced to die) to those who aided, concealed, and/or  rescued slaves who also deserved a death penalty. Furthermore, those who printed indecent documents or helped minorities print indecent documents were penalized accordingly, and finally those who opposed slavery and were forced to sit as a juror to any violation to the above clauses.

Groesbeck of Ohio took the floor to argue in support of the recent capture of filibusterer, General William Walker. The speech served as a rebuttal to objections raised by Representative Keitt of South Carolina and Representative Stephens of Georgia.","Representatives Keitt and Stephens argued that the seizure of Walker and his company from Nicaragua was illegal. For these two Congressmen, the United States had violated jurisdiction zones established by the “law of 1818” during Walker’s seizure. In defense of the US forces that captured Walker, Representative Groesbeck focused his speech on the theme that “the sea is no sanctuary for crime.” He stated that since Walker and his company were American citizens, “the duty of this Government [was] to keep the peace with all other nations; and to break up combinations of its own citizens who have actually started upon expeditions to violate the peace of other nations.” This being said, Representative Groesbeck saw nothing wrong with the actions the US government took to apprehend Walker and his company: “He [the commander of the US Navy] had the right to cross the line of the marine league from our shore; he had the right to pursue this expedition, which was being <em>carried on</em> across the Gulf; and he had the right, with the consent of Nicaragua, to enter within her jurisdiction.” Simply put, General Walker and his company were rightfully and legally seized and detained by the US government.","William Walker was a man of many skills. Despite his medical education and experience in journalism, he is best remembered as a filibusterer. Walker’s first filibuster occurred in 1853 in Sonora, Mexico. The success of this filibuster prompted Walker to pursue Nicaragua a few years later.","The US Department of State acknowledges that filibustering-the militaristic actions of private citizens in a foreign land-was common in the years between the Mexican War and Civil War. Like Walker, most filibusterers were southern men hoping that the acquisition of new territory in Central America would ensure the expansion and survival of slavery. For this reason, as historian James McPherson wrote, “While much of the northern press condemned Walker as a pirate, southern newspapers praised him as engaged in a ‘noble cause.’” These conflicting perceptions of Walker’s actions created fierce tension in Washington.","When Walker and his company returned to Nicaragua in 1857, the US reacted. Historian Amy Greenberg wrote on this matter, “In May 1857 Walker surrendered to the commander of the United States navy after falling to the combined pressure of a Central American army, Great Britain, and threatened American shipping interest.” As evident in Rep. Groesbeck’s speech, there was a lot of controversy concerning Walker’s seizure. This contention between southerners and northerners in regards to the US actions was, in the end, pointless. In May 1858, a jury in New Orleans acquitted Walker of all charges for violating federal law."],"display_date":"January 11, 1858","search_date":"1858-01-11","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":1854,"tag":"Filibuster"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6082,"title":"<strong>The United States Sues <em>The</em> <em>Progressive</em> Over Nuclear Secrets</strong>","course_id":123,"status":"P","start_date":"3/9/79","end_date":"3/28/79","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 9, 1979, the U.S. Government issued a restraining order that stopped <em>The Progressive </em>from publishing an article entitled, “<em>The H-Bomb Secret: How We Got It, Why We're Telling It.”</em> The question posed to the court by the U.S. was, “…a clash between allegedly vital security interests of the United States and the competing constitutional doctrine against prior restraint in publication.” The U.S. also said that if a document poses a threat to national security than it should be classified as such and be censored justly to protect the security of the people it is supposed to protect. <em>The Progressive</em> argued, “While acknowledging that freedom of the press is not absolute, they maintain that the publication of the projected article does not rise to the level of immediate, direct and irreparable harm which could justify incursion into First Amendment freedoms.”","<em>The Progressive</em> is a magazine published in Madison, Wisconsin.

This was a polarizing issue, as some thought it was unwise to release this article because it could fall into the wrong hands. Others believed if the government exercised prior restraint in this case, it might set a dangerous precedent for the future. All in all, it was the courts job not to decide if it was unwise, but to see if it fell within the parameters of the law. This case could have set in motion a government that censors its people unlawfully.

The act authorized the federal Department of Health and Human Services to maintain and establish clear property rights for both deceased human corpses and living donors with regards to organ donation and transplantation. These rights meant that there would be a federal ethical standard when it came to receiving money as an incentive to donate organs and ensured that no one person would be able to make a profit from the practice.","The National Organ Transplantation Act’s structure is categorized into four titles; ","Title I - Task Force on Organ Procurement and Transplantation","Title II - Organ Procurement Activities","Title III - Prohibition of Organ Purchases","Title IV - Miscellaneous"," The document, under Title III states “It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce”. If this law is broken, repercussion can lead to fines of up to $50,000 dollars. The main goal of this regulation was to keep organs from ending up on the black market. Compensating donors could lead to a downward spiral for the organ transplant system as we know it., and lead to a system where organization and equality does not exist and third party individuals may even make commissions or profits from organs sold. The ethical concern for respecting human body parts or deceased remains was an upmost concern of legislators in Congress."," The shortage of organs was at an all-time high in 1983 and the demand for transplantation was growing at an accelerated speed. The National Organ Transplantation Act provided a solution to the problem and established a structure for the United States transplantation system, along with influencing other systems by setting a precedent around the world. "," NOTA established the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) as a system or framework for organ donation. This system is in part reputable and maintained due to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). The goal of UNOS is to maintain a system where the trend is to increase the number of transplants yearly while shrinking the wait list for organs. UNOS sought to improve outcomes of wait-listed organ recipients and donors or matches who are donating their organs to family members or strangers."," The National Organ Transplantation Act, while holding much weight in ethical standards and consideration for the future of the donor/recipient, has undergone much scrutiny over the past thirty years for not being progressive and for taking away organ donors’ financial incentive. The argument is that it can be virtually impossible for elective donors to donate because they are unable to take off from work for recovery, hence why compensation may be an incentive to shrink the organ waiting list. Advocates for NOTA believe that UNOS is involved in making the transplantation process a smooth one with fair and equal opportunity for all in the who participate in the process such as the donor, recipient, even family members who are directly related."," "],"display_date":"October 19, 1984","search_date":"1984-10-19","locations":[{"id":52836,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington DC"}],"tags":[{"id":3094,"tag":"Act"},{"id":3093,"tag":"Organ Donor"},{"id":3092,"tag":"Organ Transplant"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":162,"school_id":43}},{"id":6618,"title":"Dr. Sharp's Indiana Plan to \"Render Sterile Confirmed Criminals and Mental Defectives\"","course_id":165,"status":"P","start_date":"3/9/07","end_date":"12/31/21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1907, the state of Indiana passed the world’s first sterilization law “to prevent procreation of confirmed criminals, idiots, imbeciles and rapists.” Over the next decade, hundreds of sterilization procedures would be performed under this law, sometimes under dubious circumstances. The 1907 Indiana law came as a direct consequence of fears concerning social changes that coincided with the growth of industrialization at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. The middle and upper classes dreaded the perceived immorality in mounting urbanization, the encroachment of foreign cultures, and that lower-class people would out-breed these higher classes.  In Indiana, there was a particular concern with poor, white Kentuckians moving into the state. Simultaneously, eugenic ideas were seen akin to public health issues.  At a time when cures and vaccines were being created for diseases of the body, some authorities hoped that eugenic efforts could function as preventative measures for mental and hereditary health. The greatest concern of eugenicists was the financial burden put on charitable organizations and tax payers in sustaining a populace they saw as “degenerate.”","Dr. Harry C. Sharp, convinced that sterilization was the noblest answer to these perceived societal issues, was a driving force in the Indiana law’s passing. Even though marriage laws and segregation were also seen as solutions to eugenic problems in the early 1900s, Sharp asserted that sterilized individuals could enjoy normal, happy lives. Previously, physical castration had been used as a punitive action against criminals. However, negative physiological effects of the procedure on the patient caused castration to be considered in violation of the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment. Consequently, questions regarding whether sterilization could be construed as cruel and unusual punishment were addressed early on. In 1907 and 1909, Sharp gave two speeches to the National Prison Association in which he cited sterilization procedures he had performed for experimental, therapeutic purposes. A young man, Sharp claimed in 1907, had actually requested the procedure to cure his masturbation. In 1909, Sharp detailed that he had sterilized an 11-year-old epileptic girl who was then able to experience puberty normally. Sharp insisted that because of clear differences from castration, sterilization could not be seen as a punishment and thus was not unconstitutional.","At Sharp’s 1907 speech, the Indiana sterilization plan was met with great praise.  A number of board members also contemplated on the procedure’s disciplinary potential. Dr. Sharp responded to these notions by insisting that sterilization was “purely a medical measure.”  Yet, after two years, reactions to sterilization became increasingly divisive. Upon Sharp’s conclusion to his 1909 speech, the NPA’s treasurer rose in protest and declared the topic of sterilization improper for their organization.  Some found religious reasoning both in favor and against sterilization. Many still favored sterilizations, lest the entirety of the nation be overpopulated with “epileptic hospitals and homes for the feeble-minded” and civilization be “doomed.”  This logic spread sterilization laws into several other states. However, by 1913 the constitutionality of the sterilization law was seriously doubted due to sterilizations being performed questionably and without expressed legal sanction. The Indiana law was finally deemed unconstitutional in 1921.  Nevertheless, by the end of the 1920s there were new sterilization laws that would endure for another half century."],"display_date":"March 9, 1907 - December 31, 1921","search_date":"1914-08-04","locations":[{"id":8678,"lat":42.6525793,"lng":-73.7562317,"zoom":8,"place":"ALBANY, New York"},{"id":52993,"lat":47.6062095,"lng":-122.3320708,"zoom":8,"place":"Seattle, Washington"},{"id":52992,"lat":40.2671941,"lng":-86.1349019,"zoom":8,"place":"Indiana, United States"}],"tags":[{"id":3189,"tag":"1900s"},{"id":3188,"tag":"1907 Indiana Law"},{"id":3187,"tag":"Eugenic Legislation"},{"id":533,"tag":"Eugenics"},{"id":2937,"tag":"United States"},{"id":3186,"tag":"Involuntary Sterilization"},{"id":3185,"tag":"Vasectomy"},{"id":3184,"tag":"Eugenic Sterilization"},{"id":3183,"tag":"Indiana Sterilization Law"},{"id":3182,"tag":"H.C.

Davis, Justice of the Peace in Nye County, Nevada. “On the morning of the day following the marriage the father of the child missed her, and suspecting the cause of her absence he went to Main’s cabin accompanied by another man,” reported the <em>Reese River Reveille,</em>  “where an altercation took place between him and his son-in-law, and shots were exchanged, without damage to either party.” After this incident, the man accompanying her father took Frank Ellis away from Main and proceeded to take her to her mother. According to the news report, “Main, the husband of the child, entered a complaint against Ellis, and Justice Davis caused him to be arrested.”","The meaning of marriage in America during the 19<sup>th </sup>century was mainly connected with expectations of calmness, quietness, and having the feeling of being settled. In some marriage cases such as this one, these three expectations were not always followed and it effected the young Frank Ellis. The traditional way of marriage at the time was the future husband asked permission, or the blessing, from the future bride’s parents. Although marriage in the late teens was not uncommon, marriage in the middle teens, ages sixteen and seventeen, could marry if their parents signed the marriage license application. The marriage laws of 1861 until 1873 in Nevada, however, required males to be eighteen years of age and females at least sixteen years of age provided they had the consent of their respective fathers, and if their fathers were not living, then they must receive the consent of their mothers. In Main’s case, consent was not given and the child was only thirteen years of age. Nevertheless, it appeared the husbands, fathers, and brothers of Belmont formed a large group and returned Ellis to Frank Main.","After she was returned, Main dropped the charges of assault with a deadly weapon, and the father was released. The unlawful Frank Main had escaped with marrying a thirteen year-old girl, without consent of the parents, and having her returned to him by the county men. According to the <em>Reese River Reveille</em>, the situation had improved and future cases of youth marriages will be monitored more closely so this does not happen again. Typical of the inconsistent application of the law in this time period, especially on the frontier, this situation of unlawful marriages had escaped any further lawful action."],"display_date":"January 31, 1867 - February 4, 1867","search_date":"1867-02-02","locations":[{"id":52995,"lat":38.5807111,"lng":-116.0413889,"zoom":7,"place":"Nye County, Nevada"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}},{"id":6796,"title":"The Wiretapping Profiteer","course_id":180,"status":"P","start_date":"1/14/45","end_date":"2/26/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Feb 26th, 1960, the <em>New York Times</em> announced the outcome of the case of a 56 year-old man named John G. Broady in New York City's General Sessions Court. Broady was a private investigator and attorney who pleaded guilty to “three charges of eleven-count of indictment charged with conspiracy and making false representations in order to obtain information from telephone companies”. Judge Mitchell D. Schweitzer sentenced Broady to a six-month suspended sentence on Feb 25th. Regarding what a suspended sentence entailed, it meant that the judge decided to delay the defendant’s prison sentence after he was been found guilty. The judge granted Broady a period of probation, rather than immediately having the defendant serve his sentence. As long as Broady does not break the law again and fulfills the conditions in his probation, his prison sentence would be lifted. Judge Schweitzer noted that the defendant was already serving a “two-four year term for illegal wiretapping - a term that he began serving [in January], so he considered the idea of giving Broady another sentence to serve no purpose”. The sentence that the judge is referring to occurred back in 1955, when Broady was convicted for his involvement in a secret wiretapping business in an apartment located on 360 E. 55th Street, New York City. This organization was linked to 100,000 of the city's telephones. Broady’s collaborators were Shannon B. Warren, an electrical technician; and Walter Asmann and Carl R. Ruh, two members of the New York telephone company. These men placed taps on multiple “business and private phones, and sold the information” to clients. All of the men who involved were detained during a police raid in 1955.  ","As a consequence of this operation’s discovery, it exposed to NYC authorities how easy it was for third parties to illicitly tap into the city’s extensive telephone network. During the 1950s, the crime of eavesdropping in the state of New York existed in a gray area. While the American federal government considered illegal wiretapping as an uncondonable crime, the New York state’s government was far more lenient towards the practice, as its own independent legistation allowed the practice to operate with and without court approval. This meant that there were significant disparities between the federal and state wiretapping statutes. With this knowledge in mind, Broady argued in his 1956 trial that “all state efforts to penalize wiretapping and conduct associated with wiretapping were unconstitutional”. With this argument, Broady attempted to try to avoid being punished for his criminal activity via a legal loophole. This pressured the legal authorities to bring the eavesdroppers to trial as soon as possible, as they were aware of this issue in New York’s wiretapping laws. The original court case in the 50's resulted with Broady being convicted as the operation's brainchild. As for his accomplices, they were acquitted of any charges because they agreed to testify against him. Due to the outcome of this case, the federal government decided to update New York's legal code on wiretapping. By 1957, the state of New York made the practice of unwarranted wiretapping to be officially illegal. Any illegally intercepted evidence was outlawed from being submitted in New York courts. The state’s legal definition of eavesdropping was updated to include bugging on microphones and dictaphones.  "],"display_date":"January 14, 1945 - February 26, 1960","search_date":"1952-08-05","locations":[{"id":53112,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":8,"place":"New York, NY, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":3549,"tag":"wire-tapping"},{"id":290,"tag":"Crime"},{"id":97,"tag":"Espionage"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":3545,"tag":"wiretapping"},{"id":3546,"tag":"eavesdropping"},{"id":3547,"tag":"criminal law"},{"id":3548,"tag":"NYC"},{"id":3550,"tag":"wire tapping"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":180,"school_id":28}},{"id":6865,"title":"Congress Passes Comstock Act","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-03-03","end_date":"1873-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","On March 3, 1873, Congress approved <em>An Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use.</em>  The Comstock Act created penalties for owning or selling anything deemed obscene. This included pictures, books, drawings, and drugs such as birth control. The act also defined penalties for any drug or medicine that had “immoral use.” Penalties included imprisonment from six months to five years per offense and a fine ranging from one hundred dollars to two thousand dollars."," ","Anthony Comstock, anti-obscenity campaigner and main advocate behind the act, joined the Union Army after his brother was killed at Gettysburg. The 17th Connecticut Regiment acquired more downtime than other regiments. Due to lack of discipline and downtime, soldiers used pornography to entertain themselves. The lack of disciple and erotic behavior around him shocked Comstock. During his time in the war, he met people from the United States Christian Commission, which affirmed his religiosity and activism. After the war concluded, Comstock became involved with activists of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA)  New York chapter. Their mission was to protect young men from the dangers of themselves. Through their efforts as a collective, the Comstock act passed in 1873."," ","The outbreak of the Civil War with the railroads and postal service in full effect allowed the production of erotic materials to be circulated for a cheaper rate. Photography had just been widely introduced to the world. This allowed erotic materials to be in circulation in new ways and placed in the hands of many soldiers nationwide. Anthony Comstock’s convictions about religious morality inspired him to use legislation to prevent stop the rising turpitude."," ","Due to the Comstock Act, however, more than pornography or lewd writing fell under new scrutiny. Physicians and scholars could not publish educational medical literature that dealt with subjects such as reproduction or sexual health. Issues later arose about the First Amendment and free speech. E.B. Foote Jr. along with many other free speech advocates, fell under threat by punishment due to the Comstock act when they tried to release materials. During this time, the women’s rights movement continued to grow and the Comstock Act became a source of conflict due to its prohibition on birth control. Margaret Sanger, birth control advocate, and others willingly broke the law to get information known and people the medical necessities that they need."," "," "],"display_date":"March 3, 1873","search_date":"1873-03-03","locations":[{"id":52836,"lat":39.279585883987,"lng":-74.703578125,"zoom":5,"place":"Washington DC"},{"id":52839,"lat":46.146075582925,"lng":-119.352015625,"zoom":4,"place":"United States"}],"tags":[{"id":3675,"tag":"Obscenity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":2772,"tag":"Congress"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
