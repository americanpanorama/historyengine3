The Resettlement Administration, established in 1935, was originally designed to move farmers to more productive agricultural areas. Once farmers were moved off of poor landscapes, the agency sent in conservation experts to reclaim and improve the land. The Resettlement Administraion also oversaw the creation of model communities, designed to serve as examples of how people could live more harmoniously with the environment. The towns highlighted the necessity of green space and public transportation and emphasized the value of cooperative living. The Resettlement Administration worked with over 200 existing rural and suburban communities and actually designed three entirely new towns before the agency was dissolved.","Greenbelt, Maryland, was one of the three towns planned and established by the Resettlement Administration. Established in 1937, Greenbelt attracted unemployed and impoverished people who wanted to make a new life for themselves and were willing to be active civic participants. One citizen of Greenbelt in the early years said first inhabitants felt like pioneers working in uncharted territory. Their enthusiasm for the Greenbelt project showed itself in the creation of numerous cooperative organizations within the town. Within the first ten months, Greenbelt’s civic-minded inhabitants had founded twenty-nine clubs and organizations.","Despite this enthusiasm of the residents in the foundation of Greenbelt, there was a disappointing trend toward racial exclusion. The town originated as an exclusively white community. The only hint of diversity was the presence and acceptance of Jewish residents. The original plan for Greenbelt called for a segregated black section, the Rossville Rural Development. Officials quietly dropped the plan and later justified their decision by explaining that African Americans had their own low cost housing in Northeast Washington.","Racial inequity was a persistent problem in the New Deal, and the Resettlement Administration Programs were no different.The racial exclusiveness of Greenbelt was not unique. Several other Resettlement Administration towns who also did not allow African Americans, including Trussville, Alabama, Greendale, Wisconsin, and Arthurdale in Reedsville, West Virginia."," "],"display_date":"1935 - 1937","search_date":"1936-07-01","locations":[{"id":23887,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"Prince Georges, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":2533,"tag":"Greenbelt Maryland"},{"id":889,"tag":"Racism"},{"id":1084,"tag":"The New Deal"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}},{"id":6304,"title":"Greenbelt Maryland and the Traditional Family","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/37","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Great Depression had devastating affect on the American economy. President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal programs were designed for relief, recovery, and reform. The Resettlement Administration was one of several new agencies created by the program. Under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, the RA helped relocate farmers, refinance farms, and establish new and more sustainable communities. This last project --the creation of “greenbelt towns”-- was among the agency's most innovative.","The Greenbelt community in Maryland was designed to help sustain traditional families. It included a playground, green space, and close proximity to neighbors. All of these choices were designed to foster a sense of community and connection. As evidence that the program was building stronger families, a report issued in 1942 boasted that the birth rate in Greenbelt was 35 births per 1000 households, as compared to 17 nationwide."," "],"display_date":"1937 - 1945","search_date":"1941-07-02","locations":[{"id":23887,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"Prince Georges, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":1969,"tag":"Public housing"},{"id":2533,"tag":"Greenbelt Maryland"},{"id":1084,"tag":"The New Deal"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}}]}
