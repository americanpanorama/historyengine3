In the prison that December, Rogan had seen a side of the Civil War few remember now. He experienced almost a month of weather he described as miserable and intensely cold. To compound matters, adequate clothing and blankets were in short supply. Smallpox had also appeared in the prison again and Rogan remarks “Great suffering is in store for our boys here.” But on this day Rogan hoped to get his mind off his troubles.","Rogan had been imprisoned in Fort Armstrong since December 5<sup>th</sup> 1863. He was kept away from his wife, child and home with little chance of escape or parole. In this prison he watched the men of his regiment succumb to disease, malnutrition and the elements. One winter prior, 232 of his fellow prisoners died in January alone. During the twenty month existence of the prison 1,960 prisoners died. This means one out of every fifteen prisoners at Fort Armstrong perished while being held on the island. While in prison, Rogan also had to deal with the loss of his brother Richard who died right after being promoted to Colonel. Just one month before his December journey out onto the frozen Mississippi, Rogan records in his diary that “The boys are actually killing and eating all dogs that go into the prison. Too bad indeed to be thus reduced.” So what was this man, who had experienced more than his share of hardship and tragedy doing? He was going ice skating.","On December 29<sup>th</sup> Rogan makes the following entry in his diary","“Days in prison are so like each other that they fail to give items to record. The only thing I have had to vary the monotony of to day is some exercise on the ice. I buckled on a pair of scates and tried to learn the art which appears to be one of great amusement.”","As a single entry, in a diary of three hundred and forty one entries, this tiny record of a man’s day reduced to three lines may seem insignificant, and in the scope of the great struggle that was the Civil War it may be. Yet this entry captures one of the biggest challenges prisoners of war faced; boredom.  Rogan’s diary is full of entries describing the repetitiveness and monotony of prison life. Rogan spent much of his time reading. During the course of his captivity Rogan only mentions one work in specific, d'Aubigné’s History of the Reformation of the Sixteenth Century, d'Aubigné was a French scholar on the Reformation and at the time his work was the leading academic history. Such a scholastic taste in reading material is interesting to note. Yet Rogan and others involved themselves in a multitude of pastimes.","Like other prisoners in the camp, Rogan spent his days carving the numerous mussel shells that were common in the Mississippi. The subjects of these carvings were often objects from nature. Doves, leaves, and fish were common as were rings.These small trinkets were sold when possible, allowing the prisoners to buy things at the store in camp. Rogan talks about his “shirt stud and breast pin business” he operated while in prison. He remarks on August 13<sup>th</sup> “Cash accounts show $2.00 clear profit. Time being out of the question.”","Even through the suffering, Rogan and 10,448 of his fellow inmates survived their stay at Fort Armstrong. Rogan’s actions out in the frozen air on the Mississippi December 29<sup>th</sup> paint the picture of a man who, even when faced with the hellish conditions of the prison, did not despair.  Throughout his imprisonment he kept writing, reading, exercising, and praying. Even with so many lives being cut short around him he never stopped trying to improve himself and he never let the bleakness of his situation dictate his actions. Which is why on that cold December day with “Constant effort” the 34 year old soldier and father taught himself how to ice skate."],"display_date":"December 29, 1865","search_date":"1865-12-29","locations":[{"id":2959,"lat":41.4683061448,"lng":-90.5658101504,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCK ISLAND, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":1404,"tag":"Rock Island"},{"id":1403,"tag":"Ft.

He, along with his unit, had surrendered to the Japanese in April and had been subjected to the Bataan death march which saw many prisoners expire from horrid conditions. Edmund then decided that the best way to live out his captivity was to keep a diary to both record his experiences and give him something to occupy his time. Edmund also had a friend, a Brigadier General and poet by the name of William Brougher, who would recite a number of poems to Edmund; Edmund would then record these poems in a notebook that he had smuggled into the camp. These poems ranged from descriptions of hardships of their captivity to memories women they knew from back home. The poems played a crucial role in maintaining the morale of the captives.","Brougher’s first poem is titled “First Fruits of the Spirit” and seems to describe how humans are able to cope with extreme hardships. The poem opens with the first stanza describing hardships:","Some burdens are more than human flesh can bear;","Some tasks are more than human hands can do","Some dangers more than human hearts can dare","The first stanza metaphorically details the rough conditions endured by the men during their captivity. The hardships hinted at in the poem show the tremendous strain placed upon the will of the men. The contents then shift to a topic that is slightly more upbeat as it describes the men’s ability to cope with these difficulties:","When weary bodies crumple on the road,","Spirit lifts us up and bids us stand;","When hearts recoil with fear before the foe,","Spirit draws the sword and takes command","This stanza shows the human spirit’s tenacious ability to cope with hardships, such as the poor conditions in the camp and the cruelty of the prisoners’ captors. The work also seems to reference the bond of comradeship developed by the soldiers as the verses seem to be a reference for the men helping each other during the troubling times. Overall, the work may be symbolic of Edmund and William’s will to survive their ordeal.","Historian Charles B. Rolland argues that the seemingly mundane act of writing poetry was extremely useful in helping the prisoners of war survive. The poems themselves were utilized to help the men vent their emotions and served as a mechanism for coping with both the rough conditions in the camps and the brutal working conditions imposed upon the prisoners. Furthermore, Roland states that poems were useful for dealing with boredom as the Japanese captors often banned any activity designed for entertainment; consequently, Edmund went through much trouble to secretly keep his journal and would have likely suffered a beating if he had been discovered with this illicit possession. The banning of activities often had an adverse effect on the prisoners’ morale as the only thing they were able to look forward to was work. Thus the writing of poetry gave the men something to pass their time with. In conclusion, poetry was a useful way for prisoners of war to both pass time and boost morale."," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"April 9, 1942 - July 5, 1945","search_date":"1943-11-21","locations":[{"id":52663,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":1402,"tag":"Prisoners of war"},{"id":536,"tag":"Poetry"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6113,"title":"Colonel Edmund Voices His Concerns","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"4/9/42","end_date":"7/5/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Colonel Edmund had seen his fair share of cruelty during his time in captivity at the hands of the Japanese. After being forced on a 500 mile march along with his men through the tropical conditions of the Philippines, he and his men now found themselves crammed into the former U.S. army base Camp O’Donnel. Upon arrival at the camp, the Colonel became weary of the treatment they would receive, especially in the aftermath of the long and arduous march they had recently been forced to take. He was also disappointed with the conditions in the main camp itself. Overall, his main concerns seemed to be the lack of food, clothing","Colonel Edmund first addresses the statements made by the camp commander which ensured that the prisoners would receive the best possible treatment: “We understood the camp commandant to say in his recent speech that prisoners of war would be treated according to international custom”. He then precedes to list off grievances pertaining to the inadequate conditions such as the water supply: “The water supply, except in the rainy season, is completely inadequate<sup>”</sup>; he also describes the limited clothing possessed by the prisoners: “Many are in bad need of clothing, articles are normally replaced only if the POW can identify that they have none at all of the article concerned… repair facilities are inadequate much clothing is falling to pieces<sup>”</sup>. These grievances are hard for one to imagine, the prisoners were without water and adequate clothing and at the mercy of the brutal tropical sun. Many were sun-burned badly and suffered from severe dehydration. But the colonel’s most severe concern seemed to be the beating of prisoners by the guards: “Many POWs, including officers of the highest rank, have been repeatedly struck with the fist, boot, and rifle butt for offenses often most trivial; in many cases they have not understood the offense<sup>”</sup>.  Colonel Edmund is disgusted at this fact the most because it appears as random acts of violence for no good reason. He particularly despises the fact that many prisoners were not informed of the violation they committed. Edmund felt the need to address these concerns due to his rank and concern for his men.","With these descriptions in mind, how does one account for the gap in the rhetoric of the camp commander and the terrible reality of the camp conditions? Historian Gavan Daws argues that the mistreatment of POWs stems from two reasons: the Japanese were not prepared to take on large numbers of prisoners, and the code of <em>Bushido</em> that was enforced by Japan’s militarist government. At the onset of the war, the Japanese enjoyed a rapid string of victories which saw the capture of many prisoners. These rapid successes left the Japanese in the awkward position of having inadequate supplies for the prisoners which would explain the shortages of items such as food, water, and clothing. As for the overall mistreatment of prisoners, the Japanese army still followed the code of <em>Bushido</em> which was a relic from feudal Japan; the code stated that being captured was one of the greatest dishonors a warrior could suffer, as a result, many Japanese soldiers did not wish to show mercy as they believed that none would be shown to them. With this in mind, one can realize that the Japanese did not expect any mercy to be shown to them and as a result, did not feel the need to take good care of their prisoners. Overall the combination of these factors led to numerous human rights abuses towards Japan’s prisoners of war."," "," "],"display_date":"April 9, 1942 - July 5, 1945","search_date":"1943-11-21","locations":[{"id":52663,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":1402,"tag":"Prisoners of war"},{"id":2270,"tag":"Atrocities"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6878,"title":"H.H.

Gregg, Superintendent for the Transportation and Telegraph Department of the state of Pennsylvania, issued a report addressed to state governor Andrew G. Curtin.  This document detailed an official trip which Gregg undertook to Civil War cemeteries and burial grounds in the south.  Gregg listed several reasons for his trip. Curtin had instructed him to report the conditions under which Union casualties had been buried, and to determine the feasibility of returning the soldiers’ bodies to their family members. The governor had assigned a Col. Chamberlain to this duty as well.  Chamberlain’s assignment took him further south, between Nashville, Tennessee, and Andersonville, Georgia."," Gregg began his journey on December 18, 1865, in Washington, D.C., and from  there, he traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to inspect the burial grounds of the surrounding area.  He determined some graves there to be sufficiently prepared and well-marked, but he found the graves of Union soldiers who had died as Confederate prisoners to be chaotic and unmarked.  He further mentioned a catalog of names that he believed would be useful to family members of the deceased.  Gregg then traveled on to Danville, Virginia, to inspect the graveyards of its infamous Confederate prison.  He reported the graves there to be sufficiently marked to allow for the identification and return of bodies.  From Danville, Gregg traveled to Salisbury, North Carolina, where he found the conditions of mass graves appalling.  He warned that human remains might soon be exposed by erosion, without correction of the site. His letter also cautioned that the identification of particular casualties would most likely be impossible. Gregg had intended to continue to Columbia, South Carolina, but found railroad routes too damaged for travel there to be practical.  Instead, he decided to inspect hospital graveyards, and found them to be largely adequate.  ","            Included in Gregg’s report were the results of Col. Chamberlain’s assessment of the graveyards at Andersonville.  Chamberlain reported that the identification and shipment of individuals to Pennsylvania would be largely impossible.   "," Gregg and Chamberlain were not alone in their mission. The war had left hundreds of thousands of soldiers dead and unidentified.  Private organizations, including one founded by famous nurse Clara Barton, sought to distribute information to the families of deceased soldiers. Following the war, many Union casualties, identified or not, were reinterred, often in national cemeteries. By the time Chamberlain visited Andersonville, a federal expedition had already reinterred 13,363 bodies, 12,912 of which had been successfully identified.  The war’s effect would continue to be seen through reburial efforts, long after guns were silenced."," "," "],"display_date":"January 16, 1866","search_date":"1866-01-16","locations":[{"id":53205,"lat":40.2734277,"lng":-76.7336521,"zoom":7,"place":"Pennsylvania, Dauphin County"}],"tags":[{"id":3686,"tag":"Andersonville"},{"id":3685,"tag":"cemeteries"},{"id":1402,"tag":"Prisoners of war"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
