It has been said that the one who jumped the highest was the head of the household. Also the broom would be waved over the couples head to ward off evil spirits.

Waters Schwab, the president of J.R. Wood & Sons, Inc., the increase was due to the Korean crisis.  It was mere weeks before this escalation of ring sales that the Korean War began.  Mr. Schwab noted that this increase in sales was following the same pattern that occurred at the beginning of the Second World War.   One of the executives of Lambert Brothers, Inc., Henry Lambert, explained that jewellery stores were filled with young couples purchasing rings.  This occurrence seemed to grow in just under a fortnight, and had not been seen since the end of World War II.","<br />Throughout the twentieth century this trend of increased weddings, and ring sales before, and during a major conflict was noted in both America and Europe.  During the months prior to World War I and World War II, young couples were joined in matrimony much more frequently than in times of peace.  In addition to the increase in marriages, there was a change in the average age that men and women were wed.  Throughout the first half of the twentieth century the average matrimonial age for men dropped from twenty-six to twenty-three, and for women dropped from twenty-two to twenty.","<br />Some argue that, the major influence on this sudden explosion of romance in the United States was the Selective Service Act of 1948 which reintroduced conscription.  The original act was passed in 1917 and revised in 1940.  Volunteer enlistment in the years following World War II was not enough to satisfy the needs of in this new Korean conflict.  The new act required all males over the age of eighteen to register for the draft and made all males between the ages of nineteen and twenty-six eligible to be drafted, thus increasing the number of conscripts by 100,000.  When the Selective Service Act was imposed in 1917 there appeared to have been a corresponding rise in the sale of wedding and engagement rings.  This trend was again seen at the outbreak of the Korean War.  The Selective Service Act was further revised in 1951 (Universal Military Training and Service Act) introducing a college or training exemption and reducing the draft age from nineteen to eighteen and a half.   While the war cast a dark shadow over these rushed marital vows, the uncertainty of the times and the notion that these men and women did not want to take the chance of deferring their weddings until after the war may shed some light on this upward trend in weddings and jewellery sales."],"display_date":"July 15, 1950 - July 27, 1953","search_date":"1952-01-19","locations":[{"id":28501,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":665,"tag":"Conscription"},{"id":664,"tag":"Korean War"},{"id":405,"tag":"Marriage"}],"course":{"name":"American History since the Civil War","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":42,"school_id":28}},{"id":5056,"title":"<em>Who's to Blame for an Expensive Matrimony?</em>","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-11-02","end_date":"1867-11-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Harper’s Bazar first issue opposes the general consensus that women's expensive spending habits are to blame for the decrease in marriage during the nineteenth century. The magazine took on the daunting task and discussed marriage in its first issue on November 2, 1867. The first issue contained several articles that discussed various concerns of nineteenth century women. But, its most controversial article was entitled, “Expensive Matrimony.” The piece was one of the firsts of its time because during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, most newspapers and magazines did not discuss matrimony.","The author contradicted the idea that the reason for the decrease in marriage is women and their bad spending habits. She said it was wrong to blame women for the decrease in marriage rates because there was no statistical data to support the idea. She believed that men, in fact had worse spending habits than women did. The author stated that although women did tend to spend on clothing, men spent on larger, pricier items. She also stated that when it came down to it, men were greedier than women and men would put money before family. Men were more business oriented and would choose their careers and money over anything else. She said that since men usually focused more on their careers than family, they were more to blame for the decrease in marriage than women.","She also explains that not all women had bad spending habits. Some women were good with finances and saving money and it was wrong to simply assume that all women were bad with money. The author made several more valid points, such as the fact that women had self control and could stop shopping and spending money on clothing if need be.","The article demonstrated that marriage rates had been decreasing since the nineteenth century. It showed that people had the tendency to blame females for this decrease. Although, the article was based on personal opinion and did not present any facts, it exemplified the worries of nineteenth century women. It also showed that women were beginning to have a voice. But, unfortunately, it was usually only women of the high middle class.

Nestled in the mountains of southern Italy laid the village of Montefalcone. In 1870, the town was awash with celebration—not from its kingdom’s recent conquests but from a single wedding. Fiorita Corso was betrothed to Aniello Vitale, the orphaned son of a wealthy local merchant; imported cloth and wine streamed in from across the country, and the families busied themselves with preparations.","Aniello’s father Raffaele had owned houses and property across the Campania region of southern Italy. He owned a prosperous store, selling groceries, cloth, and medicine. Around 1860, while bathing his horses, Raffaele was pulled underwater by a horse and drowned. As his widow mourned, the business fell into decline, servants stole from the family, and little-by-little their wealth disappeared. Aniello had gone to northern Italy to study for the priesthood, but with no money he was forced to return home, where he met and married Fiorita.","In the weeks leading to the wedding, according to custom, Fiorita had helped sew the pillows and blankets the couple would need in their new home. The pillows were simple and elegant, with white and green material stitched together with loving precision. Today, the colors have faded, the subtle smell of decay clings to the fabric, and the texture has irrevocably changed with the passage of decades. When the family settled in Chicago, Illinois, years later, the pillow was among the few belongings taken with them. It remained in the family for 140 years, passed through the generations to the present day.","In 1850, less than 4000 Italians were recorded in the entirety of the United States. By 1880, there were 44,000; by 1900, over 480,000. Most, like the Vitale descendents, were from southern Italy, where the standard of living declined dramatically in the closing decades of the nineteenth century. Disease and starvation swept the Italian countryside, and the cost of food skyrocketed. The pre-modern agricultural system could not support its people, and the lack of democracy gave citizens no voice in their own government. Once in America, however, the agriculturally-based immigrants were forced to adapt to lives in New York and Chicago. Like the Vitales, many immigrants settled in ethnic neighborhoods and clung to their language and cultural traditions. Even as they struggled to transcend the bleak realities of urban existence, many clung to ethnic identities with an almost sacred reverence. Such cultural bonds provided security and meaning amidst the integrating and potentially oppressive forces of industrial America.

Written in 1859, the literary piece begins by expressing the unsettled feeling that women encounter during the process of growing older. The fear of growing old is attached to the stigma of being old and unmarried, or becoming an “old maid.” Grout explains the uncomfortable nature of attending social gatherings and being sold and marketed in a sense by one’s own mother. “Doting mamas” play a role in encouraging anxiety about the process of finding a husband amongst young women. Grout stresses the need for young women to reemphasize virtues rather than the superficial traits that men find appealing. She interrogates the notion that marriage should be a woman’s highest aspiration and quotes a girl who proclaims that she has “wed art,” in order to support her point that women can be fulfilled by more than marriage. Florence Nightingale, a woman who devoted her life to the service of others, is also cited as evidence of Grout’s point. The piece finishes with a call for women to value their precious school years, and to not dismiss the joys that such an experience can bring.","Concurrently with the shifting focus away from marriage and onto school, chapter seven “Husbands and Wives” from Karen Lystra’s Searching the Heart: Women, Men, and Romantic Love in Nineteenth-Century America, discusses the new role that love had begun to play in nineteenth century marriage and courtship. This chapter expounds on Grout’s essay explaining that for the first time, during this period, marriage was conceived in terms of love and personal choice, along with the traditional set of sex specific duties that married people were meant to fulfill. The excitement of courtship played an important role in determining the future of a relationship. Although it was acknowledged that this initial feeling often fades, it was thought to lead to deeper and more fulfilling companionship during a marriage. One woman is quoted in the chapter regarding the benefits of being married or not being married and echoing Grout’s essay saying: “not that I would advise you to throw yourself away, for the sake of getting married,” continuing on to explain that there is enjoyment after the excitement wears off (196). Nineteenth century Americans feared a loveless marriage, not confusing companionship with affection.  A lack of love did not play into the reason behind divorce though. Instead, an inability to perform culturally prescribed duties caused a marriage to end during this period, often forcing women to bear the brunt of the blame for the split. The new emphasis on love rather than just money and status during this century explains why women such as E.M Grout could afford to say that men should be evaluated for their, “acts of love, or deeds of mercy.” The new trend in female education and the importance of love in a relationship both affected the changing institution of marriage in the nineteenth century."],"display_date":1859,"search_date":"1859-07-02","locations":[{"id":6121,"lat":41.5286517402,"lng":-71.0500153769,"zoom":9,"place":"BRISTOL, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":405,"tag":"Marriage"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":81,"school_id":2}},{"id":5721,"title":"Uncertainty of Marriage in World War Two","course_id":110,"status":"P","start_date":"11/1/42","end_date":"11/30/44","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","The rush to marry during World War Two may have had negative effects on Opal Bonilla, wife of Nicholas Bonilla. The couple met in Birmingham in June of 1942.  Stationed in Fort Benning, Georgia, Nicholas and Opal began corresponding and continued reciprocating mail throughout their courtship.  After only months of dating, “Nicky Boy” and “Darling Opal” wed in November of 1942.  After their brief ceremony, Nicholas had to return to Fort Benning and received news of being transferred to Fort Bragg in North Carolina.  After getting married and even learning of their pregnancy, the couple, especially Opal, seemed to be self-conscious about their decision.   Opal wrote in a letter dated November 19, “How do you feel about our marriage? Do you miss me? Do you love me? Do you want to be with me?”  In her next letter dated November 20, Opal asks again, “Do you love me as much as I love you?”.  The next day she signs her letter with “I haven’t taken my ring off”.","Doris Weatherford, an American History Professor, speculates why women like Opal asked such questions after tying the knot.  According to her research, many women wanted to volunteer for war work any way they could and that included direct contact with servicemen.  These women believed that marrying a soldier was the equivalence of responding to Uncle Sam.  Others sought out marriages because they feared waiting too long for the right man would result in never getting married at all.  Those that had already married hastily began to wonder about the roles they played in their marriages.  Was it for love, patriotic duty, or draft evasion?  Weatherford goes on to write that these women were advised against war marriages so not to repeat the high divorce rate by previous generations in reference to World War One.","Perhaps some of these ideas about war marriage passed through the mind of Opal Bonilla which led her to raise questions of doubt.  There was no denying that she was left in a vulnerable state to raise a child alone.  Yet Opal and Nicky continued writing back and forth as he eventually was shipped to Europe. She kept writing to him into 1944 even when months would go by without hearing from him. These months with no word proved to be unfortunate.  They were never reunited and Nicholas never met his daughter, Sandra, because he was killed attempting to thrust into Berlin with Allied paratroopers."],"display_date":"November 1942 - November 1944","search_date":"1943-11-15","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"},{"id":27496,"lat":32.3469701692,"lng":-84.78704688,"zoom":10,"place":"Chattahoochee, Georgia"},{"id":25218,"lat":35.0485350444,"lng":-78.8273232021,"zoom":9,"place":"Cumberland, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1718,"tag":"Wartime Brides"},{"id":405,"tag":"Marriage"},{"id":220,"tag":"alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}},{"id":6667,"title":"A Marriage License and its Properties","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Before and during the Civil War era, marriages were seen as a beneficial contract to, normally, the male spouse.
