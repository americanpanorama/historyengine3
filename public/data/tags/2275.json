There were 1,000 women from the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and 1,000 men from the Anti-Saloon League that marched silently to the capital.  The article states that the ranks were swelled by hundreds of people who joined the march singing “Onward, Christian Soldiers,” and “America” as they were marching. The marchers were met by Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas and Alabama Representative Richmond P. Hobson at the steps of the capital. The group of marchers then proceeded to present multiple petitions that would allow a constitutional amendment to be made so the making and selling of intoxicants in the United States would be prohibited.","After the presentations of the petitions speeches were made by the leaders of the two factions. Both factions seemed to receive warm responses from the two politicians meaning they had obtained their support. Later in the same day Senator Sheppard introduced the proposed constitutional amendment in the Senate. The article says, “the galleries were only half full, but his address in support of the amendment was punctuated with outbursts of applause which Vice President Marshall made no effort to stop.”  The Senator went on to conclude his proposal with these words, “Prohibition will embrace the whole United States within a comparatively short time. The movement is so strong throughout the nation that nothing in the world can prevent its ultimate complete success.” The article ends with saying that Senator Thompson and Owen joined the indorsement of the amendment proposal.","This newspaper article from the <em>New York Times</em> shows precisely what historians have suggested when they speak on how women supported the idea prohibition and this is a firsthand account of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union in action. The article also shows how organizations sought after the support of politicians in order to get the prohibition act into effect. This article fits perfectly with the beliefs of historian Peter Sasso and supports a number of his theses, but the main one being Sasso’s belief that the League was looking for political support. On page forty-seven of his journal Sasso talks about how one of the League leaders, Wayne Wheeler, believed that prohibition could only be accomplished through political advocacy. Gaining political support is one of the ways the League wanted to get prohibition into effect and it is clearly visible in the newspaper article.  Sasso also says how Wheeler sought to control the balance of power in key Congressional districts. This newspaper article shows perfectly how the League took steps to ensure political support to their idea. This article also shows how the WCTU and the Anti-Saloon League worked in make prohibition a reality."],"display_date":"December 10, 1913 - December 11, 1913","search_date":"1913-12-10","locations":[{"id":17283,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":1746,"tag":"Washington, D.C."},{"id":2274,"tag":"WCTU"},{"id":2275,"tag":"Anti-Saloon League"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6243,"title":"\"The Hun Rule Association\" was a political cartoon used by the Anti-Saloon League to marry patriotism and prohibition by vilifying the German brewing inductry in the United States.","course_id":133,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/17","end_date":"12/31/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the early twentieth century, the United States was involved in two “wars”, a military conflict in which those of German ancestry were vilified as part of the war effort, and a social and political campaign that used this hatred of Germans as a tool to further its cause.  America’s entry into World War One sparked an anti-German sentiment that targeted many accomplished members of society that had come to the United States in the first wave of immigrants from Europe.  At the same time, a battle was being fought against the consumption of alcohol, blaming it for all of society’s ills. Since the majority of the breweries in the United States were owned by German immigrants and still retained German names, they became a convenient target of both prohibitionist and anti-German crusaders.","The cartoon “Hun Rule Association” was created by the Anti-Saloon League in the period of 1914-1920, when the United States was at war in Europe during World War 1 (Anti-German Prohibition).  It depicts a parade of beer kegs and bottles, many with stereotypical German faces on them, marching and waving placards.  The placards state the supposed ills that the Anti-Saloon League blamed on alcohol consumption.  The use of German imagery and the term “hun,” an anti-German slur, was meant to associate our enemies oversees with the liquor and beer industries, making Prohibition appear patriotic in a sense.  The Anti-Saloon League went as far as to refer to the Milwaukee brewing industry as “the worst of all our German enemies” (Digital History). These enemies that the league spoke out against were, in fact, some of the most successful and industrious immigrants that had come to America, spreading a culture that is still ingrained in the collective American society.  Germans built a flourishing brewing industry and distribution network, dominating saloon business.  They also introduced the concept of beer gardens to America, providing a family-friendly drinking environment that included food, games, and live music in a well-lit, inviting setting (Immigration).","The organization responsible for this and many other anti-German, prohibitionist cartoons was the Anti-Saloon League.  The organization was founded in 1895 by members of the Republican Party as a national, bipartisan organization tasked with the advancement of alcohol prohibition through public support.  It exerted influence on religious leaders and local politicians to allow it to spread its message to the largest number of citizens possible.  The readers of these cartoons created by the League were ordinary patriotic, god-fearing people that were easily swayed by clever rhetoric.  These common folk would then demand that their church leaders and local politicians do their part for the prohibition cause, further strengthening the movement.","The results of cartoons like “Hun Rule Association” were rapid and violent.  German culture was swept under the rug as German music, including that of Beethoven, was no longer played, books were burned, and businesses were boycotted (German Immigration).  German citizens were attacked, beaten, and on occasion lynched as examples to others.  A once proud and substantial portion of the population was forced to hide a proud heritage, one that had already become a major part of American culture.  Financially, the German beer brewing industry faced massive losses when National Prohibition went into effect.  The value of breweries during the period of prohibition dropped as much as two-thirds (Immigration).  The only way that breweries remained in business until alcohol was made legal again was to diversify production, manufacturing barley malt syrup, ‘near beer’, malted milk, and other pantry staples.","“Hun Rule Association” and similar propaganda remain today as examples of misguided crusades against convenient enemies.  The German immigrants that helped to build business and industry in the United States were victimized, but they still retain their place in American society.  Alcohol’s prohibition did little to lessen its supposed effects, namely wife beating, child abuse, corruption, and Machine politics (Digital History).  The Anti-Saloon League is long gone, but beer is a booming business, and German culture is experiencing a resurgence in the United States."],"display_date":"1917 - 1933","search_date":"1925-07-02","locations":[{"id":17541,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"},{"id":16292,"lat":43.0070321924,"lng":-87.9667286742,"zoom":10,"place":"Milwaukee, Wisconsin"},{"id":18861,"lat":38.6407017012,"lng":-90.4430188422,"zoom":9,"place":"St Louis, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2478,"tag":"german americans"},{"id":2477,"tag":"world war one"},{"id":2275,"tag":"Anti-Saloon League"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":133,"school_id":43}}]}
