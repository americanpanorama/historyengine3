John Nolan included a drawing of this Greenville hotspot in his book <em>A Guide to Historic Greenville</em>, which allows his readers to peek back at forgotten times. The Mansion House was not just any hotel, as every notable who had to visit Greenville in the mid and late 19<sup>th</sup> century stayed here. Vice President John Calhoun even had a preferred room in The Mansion House during its hey days. The hotel was the most luxurious experience that Greenville had to offer during this period in time, and a veritable must see on South Main Street. During the Spanish-American War the hotel served as a military division headquarters, but soon afterwards the building became too dilapidated to maintain its function as a Greenville hotspot.","One specific notable, however, has had an entirely different experience in the urban space surrounding the Mansion House. William Lowndes Yancey, born in Warren County, Georgia in 1814, came to Greenville to become editor of the newspaper known as the <em>Greenville Mountaineer</em>. His career would expand beyond that into the field of politics, but it was right next to the Mansion House, in front of Dr. Crittenden’s store, where he did something that would have a severe impact on another influential family of the Greenville area. On September 8, 1838 Yancey shot his wife’s uncle, Dr. Robinson Earle, to death on South Main Street, which was the start of a controversial murder trial in the city. Yancey had committed this foul act because he felt his honor was compromised by Earle, who had called him a liar. Revenge of honor was not uncommon in the South during this time, and Greenville was in this aspect a true southern city.","Almost exactly a century after it was built, the Mansion House was closed down and demolished, and the rest of South Main Street also underwent extensive renovation. Only a few feet next to where the Mansion Hotel used to grace South Main, a new hotel was erected in 1924, called the Westin Poinsett. This hotel is still part of the city’s spatial fingerprint today and it was built in a similar characteristic L-shape. The drawing in Nolan's book helps us picture how Yancey and Earle walked the streets of 19<sup>th</sup> century Greenville and where Yancey took Earle’s life because of a silly argument."],"display_date":"1820 - 1838","search_date":"1829-07-01","locations":[{"id":11530,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENVILLE, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":2372,"tag":"South Main Street"},{"id":2371,"tag":"Yancey"},{"id":2370,"tag":"Earle"},{"id":2369,"tag":"Mansion House"},{"id":91,"tag":"Murder"},{"id":1412,"tag":"Greenville, SC"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban U.S. (2014)","school":"Furman University","course_id":135,"school_id":4}},{"id":6182,"title":"<strong>A Murder Trial in the <em>Greenville Mountaineer</em></strong>","course_id":135,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-01-01","end_date":"1839-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On November 9, 1838 the <em>Greenville Mountaineer </em>reported on a murder trial against none other than its own editor, mister William Lowndes Yancey. Yancey shot and killed his wife’s uncle, Dr. Robinson Earle, on South Main Street in broad daylight in September 1838. The Yancey family was well known in the Greenville area in the 1820s, as was the Earle family, which caused this trial to become a rather infamous one. The murder was quite a violent, because Yancey not only shot Earle, but he bludgeoned him repeatedly with his pistol and attempted to stab him with his sword after he did not fall down immediately. The entire conflict ensued after Yancey had struck Earle's son, who had called him a liar after Yancey defamed a politician that was related to the Earles. While Dr. Earle and Yancey initially worked out their differences while walking through the downtown area, Yancey lost his temper when Earle once again called him a liar. The article in the <em>Greenville Mountaineer </em>offers an elaborate account of the events leading up to the murder, with witness testimonials and details of conversations between victim and perpetrator. Even though the murder was well recorded due to the many witnesses, Yancey pleads not guilty when he is on trial. He ends up not being acquitted, but the judge does rule that Yancey acted out of self-defense and sentenced him to a mere year in prison and a fine.","The size of the article tells us something about the impact this trial had on the society of Greenville in 1838, and it is very understandable that the murder of one notable by another in broad daylight on South Main Street was the talk of the town. Interestingly enough, the murder did not result in a family feud, as Yancey’s son Ben would even be buried in the Earle Family Cemetery on Old Buncombe Road in a later year.","The <em>Greenville Mountaineer </em>was a newspaper that focused largely on anti-nullification and was located on Buncombe Street in Greenville. The article it wrote on Yancey's trial seems quite sensationalistic and the paper also allowed Yancey to keep sending in articles while he was incarcerated. The <em>Mountaineer</em>'s attempts to sell more papers through this strategy did not work wonders, as it did not operate independently for a very long time. The <em>Greenville Mountaineer </em>merged with the <em>Southern Patriot </em>as it was purchased by the latter paper’s editor. The competition between smaller newspapers was very high in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and a lot of newspapers came and went through mergers or bankruptcies. Although the murder was infamous, impactful and well-documented at the time, it did very little to damage Yancey’s reputation after he was convicted, since revenge of honor was commonly accepted at the time."],"display_date":"1838 - 1839","search_date":"1838-12-31","locations":[{"id":11531,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENVILLE, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":2373,"tag":"Greenville Mountaineer"},{"id":2370,"tag":"Earle"},{"id":2371,"tag":"Yancey"},{"id":91,"tag":"Murder"},{"id":1412,"tag":"Greenville, SC"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban U.S. (2014)","school":"Furman University","course_id":135,"school_id":4}},{"id":6183,"title":"<strong>Mapping a Crime Scene in Greenville, South Carolina</strong>","course_id":135,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-01-01","end_date":"1838-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Writer of the <em>Greenville Century Book</em> S.S. Crittenden has personal ties to that fateful day in November 1838, when newspaper editor William Lowndes Yancey shot his wife’s uncle, Dr. Robinson Earle in the heart of the downtown area. The murder was conducted because Earle had called Yancey ‘a damned liar,’ and Yancey felt that he needed to defend his honor against Earle’s accusations. This remarkable murder of one notable on another in fact took place on or right in front of the porch of Dr. John Crittenden’s store in Greenville, South Carolina. S.S. Crittenden was Dr. John Crittenden’s son, and born and raised in Greenville. He was still a young boy of eleven years old during the murder of Dr. Earle, as Crittenden’s year of birth is 1829. Dr. Crittenden’s store was located on the corner in front of The Mansion House hotel on South Main Street. Crittenden does describe the location of his father’s store on South Main in such a way that, even though he does not specifically mention the murder, it helps to map the 1838 murder scene. The only time when Crittenden wrote of Yancey in his Century Book, is when he mentions the names of previous editors of the <em>Greenville Mountaineer</em>, which suggests that he knows of Yancey, and that the murder was not detrimental to his reputation. More evidence for this is the fact that Yancey’s time in jail did not stop him from contributing articles to the <em>Greenville Mountaineer</em> and he was pardoned after only a few months. Later on in life, Yancey even made it to Congress. This is quite interesting, as the Earle family is a very well-known and influential family in the Greenville area, and Yancey and Earle were in fact family by marriage. While Crittenden’s book features a lot of information about the city of Greenville and life in the late 19th century and early 20th century, he may have intentionally chosen not to focus on crimes in the area, as the book has a romantic undertone and seems to have been written to commemorate the city, rather than critically analyze it. However, the fact that Helsey included the murder of Dr. Earle in her book Hidden History of Greenville County tells us something about its virtually non-existent notoriety."],"display_date":1838,"search_date":"1838-07-02","locations":[{"id":11531,"lat":34.8943497126,"lng":-82.3707811393,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENVILLE, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1412,"tag":"Greenville, SC"},{"id":2371,"tag":"Yancey"},{"id":2370,"tag":"Earle"},{"id":91,"tag":"Murder"},{"id":2374,"tag":"Mansion Hotel"},{"id":2375,"tag":"Crittenden"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban U.S. (2014)","school":"Furman University","course_id":135,"school_id":4}}]}
