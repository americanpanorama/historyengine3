Although efforts were made in the newly formed free black communities to organize schools, few African Americans received any education at all before the Reconstruction Era when public schools were opened. Even then, establishments for black children were poorly financed and largely ignored. Emerging in the 1870s, Jim Crow laws ruled the educational system and schools became legally racially segregated. In 1890, the first “coloured” school building in Winter Park was opened to African American children, under the harsh conditions of the time.","In 1896, the Supreme Court decision of Plessy vs. Ferguson established separate public schools for black and white students. The decision also deprived African American children of equivalent educational advantages. “Coloured” schools had to make do with scant financial support and negligible resources. A damaged photograph from 1890 documents the opening of the first school building for African Americans in the city of Winter Park, Florida. This schoolhouse appears consistent with the common characteristics of “coloured” schoolhouses emerging across the nation- few teachers, far too many students, and clearly under-financed. Two schoolteachers pose in the photograph alongside roughly 40 students – schoolchildren who mostly are in want of shoes. The schoolchildren in the photograph range from toddler-aged to early teens- a characteristic typical of the time, as generally one teacher supervised dozens of students in all subjects, and grades.","The lack of proper and fair financing for black learning institutions affected the quality of the education provided. Teachers could not give pupils ample individual attention, and therefore students were made to work exponentially harder in order to succeed. However, as the 1890 photograph illustrates, attendance was high and both students and teachers alike were proud of their new privilege, however tainted it may have been.","The struggle for fair and equal education for African Americans was long and hard, but much progress was made through the efforts of organizations such as the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People) and individuals like Oliver Brown, who pushed for fairness in the education system.U.S. schools were legally desegregated in 1954 by the Supreme Court decision of Brown vs. Board of Education, which overturned Plessy vs. Ferguson, and stated that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” Groups of African American students like “Little Rock Nine” began to enter previously “all-white” schools, and thus began the long process of de-segregation in American public schools. Though the U.S. school system still struggles with issues relating to fair education of African American children, the nation has certainly come a long way since the founding of Winter Park’s first “coloured” schoolhouse in 1890."],"display_date":"1870 - 1890","search_date":"1880-07-01","locations":[{"id":1442,"lat":28.5174877311,"lng":-81.2997194005,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":467,"tag":"Black Schools"},{"id":466,"tag":"Educational System"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":472,"tag":"Plessy vs. Ferguson"},{"id":473,"tag":"Brown vs. Board of Educat"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4892,"title":"African American Schools","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-01","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the spring of 1865, slavery successfully ended in the United States when the Confederate army surrendered. All slaves in the Confederacy were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation set by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, which said that slaves in Confederate-held areas were free. Slaves in the border states and Union controlled parts of the South were freed on December 6, 1865, by the Thirteenth Amendment. Between 1861 and 1865, about four million black slaves were freed.","In the beginning of the nineteenth century, the education of African Americans was not a main concern in the United States. The South had strict laws against educating African Americans to protect slavery. The North however did have schools for African Americans but they were inferior to white schools. The buildings were crowded, the teachers were not as experienced and there were not as many courses offered in the curriculum. In the South, most of the education that took place with in churches. By 1834, many Sunday schools had reading as part of the course; this was because they had to be able to read the Bible in order to be a good Christian.","In a picture from 1890, it shows the first school for African Americans built in Winter Park, FL. There are thirty-five colored children and two colored men standing outside a building that appears to be quite small. The boys are dressed in a clean shirts and pants and the girls are wearing clean dresses. Although the conditions of the building were still inferior to the white, it was a huge step for African American education progress in the South.","The nineteenth century was an important period for African American education in the country. The beginning of the century saw little to no schooling available to African Americans and in the end there was the assimilation of public schools. Education for African Americans was not even close to being equal to what the white children was offered. But education was in progress and free public education was a major accomplishment for African Americans."],"display_date":"1865 - 1890","search_date":"1877-12-31","locations":[{"id":1441,"lat":28.7108435556,"lng":-81.3703448213,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":467,"tag":"Black Schools"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":5540,"title":"Teenage School bus Drivers, Black and White, Crash on South Carolina Highway","course_id":91,"status":"P","start_date":"1/20/53","end_date":"1/20/53","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["“W.H. Ridgeway, the 16-year-old driver of the white bus, sobbed in his hospital bed and told his mother over and over how sorry he was the wreck had happened”","The Columbia State, South Carolina’s largest newspaper, reported this pitiful scene on January 21st, 1953, under the front-page headline, “Clarendon School Bus Crash Kills 2”. The State ran no pictures of the crash, but the details the paper includes are vivid and horrific.","A little girl lay on the roadside, with her leg bone protruding through the skin. The interior of the school bus was described as a mass of blood, twisted metal, and schoolchildren’s pocketbooks. 40 children were taken to the hospital for injuries. Willie Lemon, the 18-year old driver of the Negro school bus, and Thomas Harrelson, a 10-year-old passenger on the white school bus both died from the injuries they sustained.","At the time of the accident, schools in South Carolina were not yet shared by black and white children. but the highways used to get to schools were. The crash came at a climactic moment in Clarendon County, South Carolina. The court case Briggs v. Elliot, from the very same school district, ruled that segregated schools were not equal  because of the lack of resources at black school, specifically, they had no buses.","Briggs v. Elliot was combined with 4 other cases in 1954, including Brown v. Board, that were collectively decided by the watershed Supreme Court ruling that segregated schools were inherently unequal. At the time of the 1953 highway crash though, the court-ordered, federally enforced, desegregation of schools in South Carolina hardly seemed clear or imminent in the state’s future.","The teenage bus-drivers involved in the highway crash, were in fact, coming to and from “equalization” schools; the Manning Training School, where Willie Lemon had just dropped off a bus full of black students, was built the same year as the accident. Equalization schools were a massively expensive project undertaken by the State of South Carolina after the Briggs v. Eliot case to avoid the desegregation decision NAACP lawyers were successfully building.","The decision to employ teenage bus-drivers, though one way of cutting costs in the convoluted and costly equalization school project, was beginning to receive scrutiny from the companies that insured South Carolina school buses. The January 21st accident intensified this criticism.","The accident happened because the young and inexperienced drivers collided head on the “pea-soup” fog conditions on the highway that morning. The thick haze that clouded the moment made for treacherous conditions, where the drivers couldn’t see the road ahead of them, and in that spirit perhaps, was the entire moment between the Briggs v. Elliot and Brown v. Board landmarks in South Carolina history."," "],"display_date":"January 20, 1953","search_date":"1953-01-20","locations":[{"id":28318,"lat":33.6657929366,"lng":-80.2164264171,"zoom":9,"place":"Clarendon, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":43,"tag":"Desegregation"},{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":746,"tag":"Supreme Court"},{"id":408,"tag":"Children"},{"id":939,"tag":"Public Schools"},{"id":84,"tag":"Black History"},{"id":467,"tag":"Black Schools"},{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"},{"id":572,"tag":"Buses"}],"course":{"name":"Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":91,"school_id":4}},{"id":6219,"title":"Equality in Education","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-02-01","end_date":"1890-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On February 11, 1890, The Town of Winter Park opened not one, but two schoolhouses: Knowles Public school, for whites, and Public School No.31, for blacks. Public School No. 31 had an especially good turnout, with both white and black in attendance. Mayor Robert White Jr. and Founder of Winter Park, Loring Chase, came out to celebrate this moment promoting education.  Chase boasted that “with this, as with Knowles School for white scholars, Winter Park takes formal possession of the best school building in Orange County for a colored school,” and was arguably the best colored school in the state. This dedication towards supporting education in Winter Park both parallels and contrasts with other southern states during this time period. Unlike the rest of the South, Winter Park allowed its black residents to attend school without the fear of being harmed and with the reassurance that they would be receiving a good education. Similar to the communities in other parts of the country, Winter Park began to put more emphasis into the quality of its education.","The fact that a large segment of the town gathered to support the opening of both  Public School No.31 and Knowles School emphasize the importance of education to the community. While the schools were segregated, the ability for the town to support the safety and education of its black citizens was astonishing in comparison to the rest of the south. During this period white southerners embrace racial restrictions for African Americans. These policies banned blacks from experiencing many of the benefits that whites were able to enjoy. For example, while whites were able to go to school and pursue education, racial segregation forced blacks to rely on inadequate resources in their schools. Black students were often forced to learn in broken-down schoolhouses as well as use outdated textbooks. Additionally, students in the South were often victims of lynchings, school burnings and the like. However, in Winter Park the stakes were much different; students were able to attend school with a feeling of security because the town supported both school openings equally. They were also assured that they would receive an adequate education due to Public School No.31 being considered the best of its kind in the state.","Indeed, after the Civil War Florida began to place more emphasis on the importance of education. The US was investing heavily in the importance of education in the 1890s. By 1890 over 70% of all children attended grammar school. Additionally, the amount of high schools in various states rose from 160 in 1870 to over 6,000 by the end of the century. During this time the amount of explicit and implicit expenditures in the US school system rose from $314 million to $515 million in 1880 and 1890 respectively. Winter Park was not far behind in this process. The opening of Knowles School and Public School No.31 in 1890 proves that the importance of education bled into Florida as much as other parts of the country during this historical period."," "," "],"display_date":"February 1890","search_date":"1890-02-14","locations":[{"id":1444,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2433,"tag":"southern education"},{"id":939,"tag":"Public Schools"},{"id":467,"tag":"Black Schools"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":1336,"tag":"racial equality"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}}]}
