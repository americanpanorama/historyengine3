Hotchkiss had just received news that one of his children had passed away. He longed to be at home with his family, but said, \"It is forbidden of me & it is now too late to reach you before the crisis has passed.\"  He continued to describe for her the most recent skirmish with the Union that happen on March twenty-third, a \"bloody battle…resulting disastrously to our arms.\" He mentioned that Jackson conducted the retreat well and the Confederacy only lost a few miles because of it. Hotchkiss commented that \"'Stonewall' Jackson was deceived as to the number of the enemy when he started,\" and that as it progressed more Union troops joined the fight.","The Fifth Company of Virginia bore the brunt of the battle and slowed the advance of the Union. At the end, the Confederates lost forty soldiers and some three-hundred wounded. Hotchkiss lamented that the Union \"refused to let us bury our dead or bring away our wounded.\" The Confederates did not have their wounded men removed from the battlefield until March twenty-fourth. After transporting their wounded soldiers from the battlefield, the companies met with Jackson who ordered them to retreat.  Hotchkiss wrote that the companies now lay ten miles away from the Union, approximately sixty miles from Staunton, Virginia. He ended his letter extending his thanks to his neighbors at home for helping his wife through the troubling times, and added that his wife address letters to him as  \"Mt. Jackson to be sent to Jedediah Hotchkiss\" because the Augusta Battalion of Virginia potentially could have departed from this area by the time the letter reached her.  ","Hotchkiss's experience was not unlike that of both Confederate and Union soldiers. Many suffered from homesickness. William Marvel wrote about this in, <em>Andersonville: The Last Depot</em>,<em> as </em>something that doctors at Andersonville Prison later termed, \"nostalgia,\" deeming it the first mental depression to be diagnosed. Soldiers' morale also suffered because of the inhumane treatment of the dead and wounded that they experienced out on the battlefields as well as in prisons and hospitals if they were unlucky enough to be there. The Shenandoah Valley was important to the Confederates as a source of provisions and as a route for invading the North. As far as the Federals were concerned, the Valley was not a suitable invasion route; however, it was important that they deny its use to the enemy.

While it is common knowledge that slavery and its spread lead to the conflict; the actual role of African Americans during the Civil War remains widely unexplored. In mid 1861, as news of the war spread, many free black men set out to enlist to join the effort. However, they were not permitted to do so, with officials citing a law from 1792 banning African Americans from the military, and a fear of border-state secession.2 A year into the war, the Union Army was in desperate need of more volunteers. In response, a provision of President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation allowed black men to serve in the U.S. Army. Black regiments from Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Tennessee began to pop up, but not until influential civil leader Frederick Douglass promoted the cause did enlistment intensify.2 Douglass’ call for citizenship through service proved effective. About 200,000 black men served in the Army and Navy during the war, and black women like the notable Harriet Tubman played key roles as well.2  This article from The New York Daily Tribune from March of 1864 provides a first hand glimpse into what life was like for two of these black regiments right here in Central Florida. African Americans fought valiantly in the Civil War; enduring both the horrors of war and widespread discrimination towards them."," ","Despite the fact the African Americans fought alongside the white soldiers of the Union Army, they still faced significant racial intolerance from them. Racism was still firmly ingrained in the minds of many Americans even in the North. The units of soldiers were segregated, often with a white officer commanding an all black regiment. The black soldiers were typically given duties white soldiers refused to perform. In addition, black soldiers were not granted the same wages that their white counterparts received. While white soldiers received $13 per month, enlisted black men only received $10, with an extra $3 deducted for clothing costs. 2 Also, racism made the prospect of being caught as a prisoner of war far worse for a black soldier. Captured black soldiers routinely faced harsher punishment than whites, and sometimes were even brutally executed, which was the case at the 1864 massacre at Fort Pillow, Tennessee.2 Despite many racial obstacles, black soldiers fought with valor in pursuit of freedom."," ","Of the many examples of black courage and valor fighting in the Civil War, the bravery shown at Battle of Olustee in Lake City, Florida stands out as a local Florida milestone. In the spring of 1862, Union Brigadier General Truman Seymour was leading a band of some 5,000 men on raids throughout North and Central Florida, freeing slaves, and attempting to destroy Confederate trade routes.3 Seymour experienced relative success, only needing to engage small bands of militiamen. Without approval from his superiors, Seymour marched his troops further north, where eventually he and his troops ran into a large Confederate brigade commanded by General Joseph Finegan. General Seymour made the fatal error of assuming that he was once again up against a small, inexperienced militia. Relentless cannon blasts and rifle fire inflicted serious damages on the Union troops. The Confederate forces prepared for an offensive charge, and Seymour needed a miracle. Just then, the heroic black reinforcements arrived. An eyewitness explains, “They came at double quick. The 54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts went in first, with a cheer… followed by the 1<sup>st</sup> North Carolina… and charged upon the rebels.”1 The volunteer regiments engaged the Confederates, stopped the charge, and despite casualties, “the two colored regiments had stood in the gap, and saved the army!”1 When the dust settled, “The 54<sup>th</sup> Mass., which, with the 1<sup>st</sup> N.C., may be truly said to have saved the forces from utter rout, lost about 80 men wounded and 12 killed.”1 When they were called upon for duty the black soldiers responded with admirable valor and heroism."," ","This tale of a recklessly ambitious general and his men saved by black volunteers captures the essence of African American involvement in the Civil War. Fighting alongside men who do not believe they deserve equal rights, the black infantrymen battle on regardless, striving for that citizenship Frederick Douglass so eloquently described. The brave men and women who joined in this fight for freedom built the foundation for the American Civil Rights Movement in the generations to come.","“We, the colored soldiers, have fairly won our rights by loyalty and bravery—shall we obtain them? If we are refused now, we shall demand them.”"," ","--Sergeant Major William McCeslin; 29<sup>th</sup> U.S.C.T."," "],"display_date":"May 1862","search_date":"1862-05-16","locations":[{"id":1327,"lat":30.4938122303,"lng":-81.4274627631,"zoom":9,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":116,"tag":"Wounded Soldiers"},{"id":365,"tag":"Emancipation"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":5393,"title":"Armory Square was a military hospital that sprang up in Washington D.C. during the Civil War, from 1862-1865, which recorded unprecedented numbers of soldier casualties and deaths.","course_id":76,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-08-01","end_date":"1865-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["While not the first military hospital to open in Washington D.C. during the Civil War, Armory Square Hospital is known for receiving some of the worst soldier casualties from Virginia’s battlefields. Situated nearest the steamboat landing at the foot of Seventh Street, S.W., and the lines of Washington and Alexandria railroad, Armory Square Hospital was the first and only stop for many Union soldiers as the seriously wounded could not afford to travel any farther, according to Martin G. Murray’s article Traveling with the Wounded: Walt Whitman and Washington’s Civil War Hospitals. The Armory Square Hospital Gazette and The National Republican papers reveal that Armory Square Hospital had an unprecedented number of soldier deaths. Notably, “from August 1861 to January 1865, Armory Square recorded the largest number of deaths of any Washington military hospital, 1,339 out of 18, 291 deaths” as recorded in the February 25, 1865 edition of the Armory Square Hospital Gazette (Murray).<br /><br />Armory Square was one of the six “model” hospitals built in Washington D.C. during 1862. Whereas “barracks” hospitals were converted from unused Army barracks, “model” hospitals like Armory Square were specifically made according to the U.S. Sanitary Commission and their recommendation of a pavilion principle (Murray). There were as many as 56 separate facilities used as hospitals in Washington D.C. during the course of the Civil War, and Murray notes that Armory Square was one of 43 in use when it opened in 1862.<br /><br />The Armory Square Hospital Gazette was first published on January 6, 1864. The opening page of the gazette presents the harsh reality of many a soldier’s gruesome fate--it claimed: “the Hospital is an episode in  soldier’s life--sometimes a painful termination of it, which has many an event worthy of a chronicle. Such we propose this paper to be” (“Salutatory”). While recording the deaths of soldiers who died, the gazette also notes soldiers admitted to Armory, returned to duty, transferred to different hospitals, and discharged. <br /><br />As a large hospital tending to those grievously wounded, Armory Square was frequented by a few notable people. President Abraham Lincoln and poet Walt Whitman visited Armory Square, meeting with many soldiers in the hospital ward (Murray). One of Lincoln’s many visits was recalled and recorded by Armory Square nurse Amanda Akin. Whitman also went to many Washington D.C. hospitals and attended to the soldiers. He wrote copious notes about his visits, and on page 18 of his hospital journal he jots down: “In ward G, H, or I, young man I promised to come in and read to--sick with fever--he cannot read steady himself--his hand swerves--take him the paper” (Whitman). However, Whitman writes that he visited Armory Square most often “because it contains by far the worst cases, most repulsive wounds, has the most suffering and most need of consolation--I go every day without fail, and often at night” (Whitman).<br /><br />Armory Square Hospital captures one side of the Civil War, but reveals volumes about the tragedy of the war through the sheer number of men dying from casualties and the hospital’s prominence through multiple visits by President Lincoln and the poet turned nurse Walt Whitman."],"display_date":"August 1862 - January 1865","search_date":"1863-11-01","locations":[{"id":6079,"lat":39.603674835,"lng":-77.8141711851,"zoom":9,"place":"WASHINGTON, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":1228,"tag":"Military Hospitals"},{"id":116,"tag":"Wounded Soldiers"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"ENGL 305: Literary History and Writing","school":"St. Norbert College","course_id":76,"school_id":44}}]}
