She and this guest, an elderly woman and devoted Baptist, disagreed about slavery. When dinner was ready, Chace asked the woman to sit with the rest of the guests for dinner. Among the dinner party was Charles Lenox Remond, a young person of color and Anti-Slavery orator. “No; I don’t eat with niggers,” the Baptist woman promptly replied. At the end of dinner, Chace again called for the woman to eat, to which she was responded with, \"No; I don’t eat with niggers nor after ‘em.” This bumptious comment certainly did not sit well with her abolitionist hostess, for “Whether she went hungry that day, [Chace] never inquired.”","Chace stemmed from a family with a deep background of abolitionist activism. Growing up in Rhode Island, Elizabeth Buffum Chace became accustomed to her mother rehearsing the story of Morier, a girl stolen from her family and enslaved in the home of her great-grandfather for a large part of her life. Chace’s mother and father, both faithful Quakers, raised their children in a revolutionary household, teaching them there was no bright side of slavery. The paternal grandfather of Chace, William Buffum of Smithfield, was a member of the Rhode Island Society for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery. He would regularly harbor fugitive slaves from New York who sought refuge in Rhode Island, instilling anti-slavery attitudes in his son. Chace’s father, therefore, became an abolitionist in his childhood. As Chace noted, all of her family were abolitionists, allowing her to pursue her activist beliefs early on. Believing in gradual emancipation, Chace and her husband organized a Female Anti-Slavery Society at Fall River in 1835. There, a large number of visitors dined at the Chace’s house. The Chace’s sheltered many refugee slaves, such as one escaped blacksmith whom they dressed in Quaker women’s clothes, bonnet and shawl included. In 1831, Chace began to plan a committee that devised schemes for gradual liberation alongside the formation of her abolitionist New ?England Society, thus allowing her to have a prominent role in the movement for abolition.","Unlike many women of her time, Chace pursued her own interests despite the typical expectations in the nineteenth century. Yet Chace belonged to a specific group of the time: white abolitionist women. These female abolitionists were essentially born and baptized in the anti-slavery and were the heart of political activism. Religion played a prominent role in this movement. Chace, a Quaker, and many women like herself, considered the emancipation of human beings a sacred duty to fulfill. They practiced both privately and publicly to drive emancipation by raising their children in anti-slavery households or creating national societies for the abolition of slavery. Quaker women stepped beyond the bourgeois gender system that categorized women as solely domestic. Rather than subordinating to their husbands, these women partnered with their spouses to create a stronger representation for the abolitionist community. As the campaign for freedom moved forward, activities of these white abolitionist women began to defy the “emerging middle class norms,” thus creating a movement for the liberation of both slaves and white women suppressed by the social ladder. Often times, however, these women continued to be suppressed, for others objected their abolitionist commitment as being primarily domestic. Many letters of abolitionist women state the fact that they were “almost alone in their support the cause.” This, however, did not stop the movement, for white women, like Elizabeth Buffum Chace, continued to use their privilege to campaign for the abolition of slavery."],"display_date":"December 9, 1806 - December 12, 1899","search_date":"1853-06-10","locations":[{"id":53071,"lat":41.9220496,"lng":-71.5495101,"zoom":1,"place":"Smithfield, Rhode Island"},{"id":53070,"lat":41.9067663,"lng":-71.3906119,"zoom":7,"place":"Valley Falls, Rhode Island"}],"tags":[{"id":3357,"tag":"antislavery movements"},{"id":3356,"tag":"Abolitionist women"},{"id":3355,"tag":"Elizabeth Buffum Chace"},{"id":3354,"tag":"Quaker"},{"id":859,"tag":"Nineteenth Century"},{"id":2307,"tag":"antislavery"},{"id":1685,"tag":"Woman"},{"id":2743,"tag":"Abolitionist"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":171,"school_id":11}},{"id":6890,"title":"Women and the 21st Amendment","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"12/18/17","end_date":"12/5/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Women and Prohibition","It is not a new discovery that women have played a significant role in changing the face of America. For example, women pushed desperately to pass the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment (1933) repealing the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment (1919); prohibition. While previous women desperately fought to create the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment, none of them truly sought through the possible consequences its implementation could entail. Hence, a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was sought not long after.","            The initial plan women created, the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment, was in attempt to “take back the home”. What I mean by this is that women believed that alcohol was the cause for their husbands being drawn away from the home all day, only to come home late and do very awful things to her.[1] In addition to this, women who were suffering from drunken husbands teamed up with the groups of religious people such as the National Women’s Christian Temperance Union, and males who could vote.[2] With strong effort they were able to successfully pass the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment. Over the years following, some women continued to celebrate while others began to see a change in light.","            The reason for this is as follows. While alcohol became illegal to sell, it did not prevent people from getting their hands on it and consuming it anyways. Another thing women noticed after the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment was that bars were no longer regulated. This meant they could stay open however late they please and let whom ever they want in. This allowed for the creation of “speak easies” which were basically the old bars but were now being used primarily for illegal actions such as selling black market alcohol. Some other things came from this as well.[3] These included an increase of prostitution, increase in youth drinking, increase in political/government corruption, increase in death, and also did not put an end to most husband’s violent actions.","            Because of these consequences, it was time for action, and action came in the form of a group of strong-willed women. For example, The WONPR, Women’s Organization for National Prohibition Reform, was a women’s organization in support of the soon to be 21<sup>st</sup> amendment. Importantly to note, this organization did not want to segregate political parties or previous movement organizations. Due to this, WONPR claimed over 1.2 million members at the beginning of 1933. One thing this organization campaigned on was “the repeal of the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment is not defeat”.[4] This was in attempt to show 18<sup>th</sup> amendment prohibition supporters that their actions were in good means, and that it is not a loss but rather a creation for a better, safer way.","Another organization of powerful women who played a role in the creation of the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was the Women’s Organization for Prohibition Reform. For example, Ione Nicoll, secretary of WOPR, saw the destruction of the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment and began to look for ways to repeal it. Nicoll frequently brought up that instead of eradicating the evils people faced, prohibition made it worse.[5] To further show her reasonings for why women “should vote wet”, Nicoll explained a study done in 1925 by the Women’s National Republican Club. This study concluded that out of the vast variety of women they surveyed, ninety percent voted to get rid of or make changes to the 18<sup>th</sup> amendment. Not only did she use facts to back up her reasonings for a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment, she also tried to get female Prohibitionists on her side like the WONPR did.","Though some of the Prohibition supporters were scarred by experiences, others began to see a new light that shined on the creation of a 21<sup>st</sup> amendment. Overtime these groups of women were able to gain mass support and became successful at repealing prohibition. With one of the campaign tactics being creating alliances, women in the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment were able to get the government, as well as others, on their side. Once this occurred, rapid changes began and the 21<sup>st</sup> amendment was created."," "," ","Reference List:","Nicoll, Ione. \"Should Women Vote Wet?\" <em>The North American Review</em> 229, no. 5 (1930): 561-65. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org.schreiner.idm.oclc.org/stable/25113543.\">http://www.jstor.org.schreiner.idm.oclc.org/stable/25113543.</a>","Rose, Kenneth D. 1996.
