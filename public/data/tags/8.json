Still attended Oberlin College where he sought a medical degree, but instead left and went to work for W.C.

In 1955, he conducted the New Orleans Philharmonic Orchestra and was the first African American to conduct a major orchestra in the Deep South.  Still was also the first African American to have an opera performed by a major opera company (his opera, Troubled Island was performed in 1949 by the New York City Opera).  In addition, Still was the first African American to have an opera performed on national television, and the first to run his own recoding company, Black Swan Phonograph Company.  &lt;br /&gt;Over the course of his life, Still received two Guggenheim Fellowships, honorary doctorates from Oberlin College, Wilberforce College, Howard Universtiy, Bates College, and the University of Arkansas.

She came of age as a singer when female musicians received little respect.  Her career pinnacled twice: in the 1920s and 1930s, she was one of the top recording artists, and in the 1970s, during which she opened for the Newport Jazz Festival and played at the White House for President Jimmy Carter.

Halma's victory increased morale among Kentuckians because he was the first homebred to claim the Derby title for several years.  Halma was hailed as a great horse, worthy of the victory.  He had never run a mile and a half before, but his superb breeding (Hanover Julia L.) predicted his virtually undeniable victory.  Halma broke at the front of the pack and remained there, something highly unusually in racing, for the entire race.    James Soup Perkins, a 15-year-old African American, piloted Halma to the victory.  Through his win, he joined fellow African American jockey Alonzo Clayton as the youngest winning riders of the event. Perkins, who received his nickname for his love of soup, began riding in 1891 at 11. He won his first race at Kentucky's Latonia racetrack that year. Perkins died in August 1911 while attending the races at Hamilton, Ontario.&lt;br /&gt; Horse racing was in the 1890s and continues to be today, the largest spectator sport in America.

Hailing from Nashville, Tennessee, the Jubilee chorus was composed of four men and seven women who sang traditional black spirituals to raise money for Fisk University, which was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy in the 1860s and 70s.  The majesty of the Singers' harmonies and stately bearing stood in stark contrast to African-American minstrel and burlesque entertainment, such as the Georgia Minstrels, which was also popular in Europe and America at the time.  Advertisements for these types of shows tended to present common white stereotypes of black Americans, including the sexually provocative black female and the Northern black dandy.'  Playing in well-known urban venues, such as Atlanta's DeGive Opera House, and before large and fashionable audiences,' burlesque shows only served to reinforce the caricatures of black America that so many whites had come to accept as fact.  &lt;br /&gt;The Jubilee Singers understood the negative impact acquiescence to white ideas of black culture had on African-American society, and they refused to accept it.  The group's unapologetic and unequivocal refusal to ride segregated trains or stay in segregated hotels (in both Europe and the United States) was an early symbol of the power black education and culture would have in stoking the wounded pride of oppressed black citizens during the Harlem Renaissance and Civil Rights movement.  The Jubilee Singers became the darlings of European royalty and music critics alike, and through their talents raised over 150,000, helping transform a struggling colored' school into the proud university which would help change the face of the American South less than a hundred years later."],"display_date":"July 1, 1873 - March 30, 1878","search_date":"1875-11-14","locations":[{"id":11955,"lat":36.1695702654,"lng":-86.7859142705,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":327,"title":"The Gilded Age published\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-12-01","end_date":"1873-12-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In America nearly every man has his dream, his pet scheme whereby he is to advance himself socially or pecuniarily.  It is this all-pervading speculativeness which we have tried to illustrate in The Gilded Age.'  With these opening sentences to the London edition of his and Charles D. Warner's collaborative effort, Mark Twain summed up the theme of the fictional' book that would soon lend its decadent title to an even more decadent era.  A biting satire marked throughout with Twain's characteristic humor, The Gilded Age mirrored the politics of the 1870s and foreshadowed what was to come in the 1880s and 1890s.  The intense and turbulent changes which followed the Civil War affected the South to an even greater degree than the rest of the nation. &lt;br /&gt;During Reconstruction, corruption at the highest levels of the government, especially the Credit Mobilier Scandal and the Salary Grab, rocked Grant's administration.  The New York Times issued a biting criticism of the Congressional salary grab, raking part-time legislators over the coals for granting themselves a raise while coolly and ungenerously' denying one to humbler' full-time civil servants.'  In the same article, the Times sarcastically wondered, If it is hard for a Senator to be a good Christian on 5000 a year, what are a poor clerk's chances on 1400?'  Like the Times, Twain and Warner saw a governing elite who cared more for lining their pockets than caring for their fellow citizens.&lt;br /&gt;The political and commercial corruption slithering down from Washington, D.C. quickly snaked its way into the offices of state and county bureaucrats across the South and around the nation, causing countless American citizens to echo the Atlanta Constitution's lament that the corruption that pervades every branch of the civil service is becoming monotonous.'   The moral bankruptcy tacitly promoted by the political climate of the day in conjunction with Southern whites' own prejudices and economic needs to produce a declining ethical standard that would eventually abandon freedmen to Jim Crow. One Atlanta newspaper lamented The Gilded Age's honest reflection of the moral vacuum surrounding the biggest hustles and hustlers' of the 1870s, never letting us forget that [g]raft and corruption knew neither race nor party label' in the postwar United States, as integrity took a backseat to solvency."],"display_date":"December 1, 1873 - December 1, 1873","search_date":"1873-12-01","locations":[{"id":7758,"lat":39.4954978662,"lng":-92.0007142233,"zoom":10,"place":"MONROE, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":369,"title":"Sidney Lanier publishes his anti-war novel, Tiger-Lilies","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-10-01","end_date":"1867-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Considered the leading artistic talent of the South after the Civil War, Sidney Lanier published only one novel: Tiger-Lilies.  Born and bred in Macon, Georgia, Lanier graduated from Oglethorpe University in 1860, shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War.  After finishing college, Lanier enlisted in the Confederate Army and was sent to the Virginia/Maryland area, into the heart of the battles.  During this time, he was captured by Union soldiers, imprisoned, and contracted tuberculosis.  All of these events would drastically influence the writings he produced in the years following the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tiger-Lilies is actually a somewhat autobiographical book.  In it, Lanier analyzes the relationship between a Northerner and a Southerner throughout the Civil War.  As a Southerner who had fought for the Confederate army, Lanier had experienced the war firsthand, both on the battlefield and as a prisoner of war.  These experiences are recognizable in the battle scenes especially, which are considered some of the most realistic representations of Civil War combat in literature.  Ultimately, Tiger-Lilies can be interpreted as an anti-war novel and one of Lanier's less successful endeavors in the course of his career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the book is not nearly as revered as Lanier's poetry or musical compositions, it provides a realistic look at the Civil War and how it affected the survivors of the Confederate army.

This event was important not only for being the founding of a new paper, but this event also marked the growing role of Tuscaloosa in Alabama. In fact, the capital had recently been moved from Cahaba to Tuscaloosa and in 1829 the legislature met for the first time in the new capital (Alabama: The History of a Deep South State).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Intelligencer was certainly not the only paper in Alabama. The Cherokee Phoenix and Indians' Advocate reported that there were 11 papers published in Alabama in 1829. This proliferation of Alabama papers is certainly interesting, yet even more interesting is the fact that this proliferation was noted in a Georgia paper. This occurrence evidences the swift exchange of information allowed by having newspapers across the nation. Lastly, this large amount of newspapers was not only due to the growing desire of the populace to be informed, but this abundance of papers was spawned from the advent of the rise of the Jacksonian-Democrats, and the great divisions caused by this whole hearted use of the two party system. Relatively small cities such as Macon, Georgia and Lynchburg, Virginia had at least two papers in 1829 If later trends are to be believed, most likely one party ran one paper, while another party ran the other. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Newspapers were constantly quoting other newspapers during this time period and editors were very interested to hear what other editors were writing.

Having suffered health problems before the Civil War, his death was not unexpected.  Nonetheless, his early death was mourned by many, especially the wife and three children left behind.&lt;br /&gt;Born in Macon, Georgia, Lanier received an education at Oglethorpe University.  He initially followed in his father's footsteps by pursuing a career in law.  Lanier moved to Texas, but, after suffering health problems and facing the threat of consumption, he moved up North, where he remained until the war.  Lanier served in the war and was stationed on the Southern coast and in Petersburg, VA.  After the war, Lanier attempted to practice law a second time, but his poor health rendered the endeavor virtually impossible.  Thus, he turned to poetry as well as the study and teaching of literature.     Combining his literary and musical interests, he centered his poems around music and the South.  Lanier intended for much of his poetry to be set to musica, and he built a reputation upon his unique style of poetry.  Lanier gained instant renown for a poem published across the country, The Centennial Cantata,' which he wrote for the Centennial Celebration .  His most famous poems, however, are the regional Song of the Chattahoochee' and The Marshes of Glynn,' both parts of an unfinished series discussing the marshes of Glynn County, Georgia.  &lt;br /&gt;Lanier died at the age of 39 and left a legacy of poems.  He served as a major contributor of literature to the South, which was criticized by many for its slow progress.  Many lamented his early death for prematurely ending his literary career.  Lake Lanier, located northeast of Atlanta, was named in his memory."],"display_date":"September 7, 1881","search_date":"1881-09-07","locations":[{"id":9731,"lat":35.2792896852,"lng":-82.1696309313,"zoom":10,"place":"POLK, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":412,"title":"Uncle Remus Published\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-01-01","end_date":"1881-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Joel Chandler Harris, an author born in Eatonton County, GA, published Uncle Remus: His Songs and Sayings, his first collection of Uncle Remus stories, in 1881 and found an enormously receptive audience.

The stories featured characters such as Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox, and Tar Baby, and they were instantly popular amongst white and black audiences.  Later, Harris became editor of the <em>Atlanta Constitution</em>. Harris led Southerners in the establishment of a new type of literature for the New South.  He encouraged the South to utilize all available resources, including the blacks.  Though Harris used his Uncle Remus stories to demonstrate that blacks had stories of value within their own valuable culture, his stories still depicted race relations unrealistically by portraying blacks as happy and child-like, which added to the stereotypes instilled by the blackface performances.  Harris was inevitably influenced by the racial attitudes that prevailed in the South, and his writings reflected a local color.

The new volume received mixed reviews.

Stowe did admit that she did not fully understand blacks, but she thought that by applying Christian kindness to them, their situation might be helped.  One shocking thing that Stowe revealed was that she believed that slaves repulsed themselves; she wrote that they thought they were evil because their skin was black.  She did not think that blacks were capable of reaching the same intellectual and moral heights as whites, and she blames that inability on their disgust in themselves.  Southerners were not at all pleased with Stowe's book.  Critics characterized it as having a narrow field of view.  She was accused of making generalizations about Southerners as being unaffected by the plights of slaves.  This bothered critics who felt that Southerners were not deficient in their morality.

Railroads soon became another medium of trade, though not as reliable or as fast as one would have liked. The greatness of employing trains, however, meant that resources and commodities could be found and transported to places within the states that were not on or near a body of water. In 1844, iron was implemented for both railroads and underground railroads. Southern States that bordered water, had previously relied on steam boats and water for essential transportation needs. Now, they had a fast and reliable alternate form of transport. &lt;br /&gt;Railroads provided for more unity within the states, whereby people could travel across the country for leisure.

The Wife of his Youth is a story of a light skinned black man who escapes slavery in Missouri with the aid of his black wife.  In the north he is met with success and social acceptance.  After he becomes engaged to a local widow, the wife of his youth appears.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His ability to depict southern prejudice within the framework of fictional short stories made him an important literary figure.  He successfully deals with the delicate and tragic situation of those who live on the boarder-line of the races'.

In that month, New Orleans's Olympic Club staged three world championship fights.  On September 5, the fights began.  The crowd was very large and varied.  Representatives from every state and nearly every leading power of the world showed up.  Jack McAuliffe and Billy Myer fought in the lightweight championship.  McAuliffe won in the fifteenth round.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On September 6, George Little Chocolate' Dixon, a black, faced off against Jack Skelly in the featherweight championship.  Dixon easily defeated Skelly in the eighth round.  The public reaction to the Dixon-Skelly match demonstrates the white American's racist attitude that prevailed during this time.  The editor of the New Orleans Times-Democrat said that it was a mistake to match a negro and a white man, a mistake to bring the races together on any terms of equality, even in the prize ring.'  After this fight, segregation appeared in the boxing ring.&lt;br /&gt;      &lt;br /&gt;The final, and most anticipated, event was the heavyweight championship on September 7 between James J.

This was only the second time in Sullivan's career as a fighter that he had been knocked down.  James Corbett became the first heavyweight champion under the Marquis of Queensbury rules.

Twain was born in Florida, Missouri and later moved to Hannibal, a town on the Mississippi River much like the towns depicted in his two most famous novels, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twain began work on Huckleberry Finn, a sequel to Tom Sawyer, in an effort to capitalize on the popularity of the earlier novel. However, his new novel took on a more serious character, as Twain focused increasingly on the institution of slavery and the South. In the early 1880s, however, the hopefulness of the post-Civil War years began to fade. Reconstruction, the political program designed to reintegrate the defeated South into the Union as a slavery-free region, began to fail. Concerned about maintaining power, many Southern politicians began an effort to control and oppress black men and women. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the story of a white boy's adventures down the Mississippi River with a run away slave named Jim. Along the way, Huck begins to realize the evils of slavery and find equality in African-Americans, referring to himself at one point as a low down dirty abolitionist'. Although Twain's novel was intended to be purely satirical, it gained a reputation as a somewhat controversial novel, banned in many Southern states for its use of racial vernacular common to the region and derogatory text. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, it is a valuable tool for gaining a broader understanding of race relations and societal standards of the South during the post Civil War Era.

Bell had gradually acquired all the companies that licensed its telephone equipment in what was known as the Bell System; the predominant driving force in telecommunication. In March of 1885, the American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T) was founded under the license of American Bell. AT&T was originally intended to become a long -distance subsidiary of the Bell organization, but when the American Telephone and Telegraph Corporation began to take off bringing in large profits it bought the assets of American Bell, creating a de facto in the American telephone monopoly.&lt;br /&gt;Protected by an unbreakable patent monopoly, AT&T engineers were able to formulate plans to create a system of interconnecting networks across the entire nation. While there were some set backs, such as lack of cooperation and agreement among the owners of the latter companies, vast improvements were made. Many investors didn't even consider the South to hold potential for further communications. Southerners with the necessary skills for maintaining telephone companies and outposts were in short supply due to the lack of education, rural poverty, and small amounts of industrial firms. However, unlike American Bell, AT&T recognized the importance and potential for telecommunications in the South. AT&T established central research and engineering departments, enhancing the technological development of their systems and creating more efficient and succinct means of communication nationwide. &lt;br /&gt;The telephone market was very competitive in the early 20th century. AT&T found untapped resources for business in the South, where it brought cheap service to places deemed unprofitable by Northern phone companies. Many cut throat tactics were used in the late 1800's by telecommunication businesses looking to get ahead. Short cuts and cheap, rudimentary alternatives were often used in less developed and therefore less suspecting regions of the country. Legal ploys and political propaganda caused many companies to sympathize with the South, calling themselves home' institutions who objected to the expensive, Yankee-owned enterprises of the Bell Company. Even AT&T officials spread rumors of loss of profit and poor earnings which caused nervous investors to sell stock in companies contracted to AT&T. AT&T then bought the stock in these companies cheaply, and soon established itself nationwide as the primary provider of telephone service, especially those overlooked in the South. This allowed for the spread of cultural, social, economical, and technological communications nationwide."],"display_date":"March 2, 1885","search_date":"1885-03-02","locations":[{"id":2032,"lat":32.3488842577,"lng":-84.0787347782,"zoom":9,"place":"MACON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1935,"title":"Capturing the Moment\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-12-12","end_date":"1857-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a private letter to her granddaughter, an unnamed woman described a simple scene with such poignant detail that an ordinary moment in history became remarkably touching on paper.

Followed by the report on the construction of the monument was an announcement of a meeting to be held by the Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument Association.The meeting was called to discuss the operations of the organization.A closing paragraph stated that the organization had to move forward at once in the search for funding the monument.The leaders of the organization believed that the raising of such funds would not be a problem.The organization planned to solicit money from all southerners in even the smallest amounts so as to allow even the humblest to say they have some share in this tribute of affection and remembrance to the private soldiers, the unknown heroes of the great Civil war between the States."," The support of the Confederacy remained strong after their defeat in the Civil War.The honoring of Confederate dead shows the enormous respect for the service they gave and the sacrifice they made during the Civil War.Even in defeat, southerners were able to cope by reasoning that they did not lose because they were outfought.However, they lost only because they were overwhelmingly outnumbered and outgunned.This Lost Cause theory enabled supporters of the Confederacy to remain strong to their roots.Southerners used the Lost Cause theory to support their claim that Southern tradition and culture was more respectable than the tradition and culture in the North.The claim was based on the nobility of southern gentlemen, the grace and kindness of southern women and the bravery of there outnumbered army.To ease the burdens of their past, southern conservatives of the port-Reconstruction South remade and rewrote much of it.Hardwick and Hofstra state that They had lost the Civil War, their property, status and a great deal of their self-respect.As they reclaimed these things however, they would skew the teaching of history to glorify their actions.The rejection of the northern interpretation of the war allowed for a renewed southern patriotism to take effect.Slavery suddenly became known as a common ground between blacks and whites.The Lost Cause theory was a corrupt creation that allowed for the reunion of Confederate supporters, especially in Richmond, Virginia."],"display_date":"August 25, 1890","search_date":"1890-08-25","locations":[{"id":13920,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1968,"title":"Sports of the Turf\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1822-05-12","end_date":"1822-05-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In Portsmouth, Virginia the Greens Course hosted a series of horse races on Friday, June 15, 1822. <em>The American Beacon and Commercial Daily </em>posted advertisements for the event starting a month before officials scheduled for it to take place. This allowed time for news to spread throughout the region. It cost 20 dollars to enter a horse into the race, but owners who lived within a 50 miles radius of the racecourse did not have to pay an entrance fee. The horse races held at the Greens Course consisted of two laps around the track per heat. Horse races centered around gambling; a popular activity of southern men at the time."," The horse races at the Portsmouth Greens Course differed from quarter racing; the form of horse racing that Americans in the West created. Quarter horse races were far cheaper and easier to run because they did not require formal tracks. According to historian Earl L. Grinols, the races consisted of quarter mile sprints. The organizers laid the course out on a field or straight stretch of road that almost always ran next to the local tavern. Owners usually raced two horses against each other. This created a large amount of betting between the two owners as well as the crowd of spectators. Breeders crossed English saddle horses and Indian Ponies to create the new breed of quarter horses."," Races on the Portsmouth Greens Course tended to be far more controlled than the quarter horse races of the West. Spectators and contestants at the Portsmouth Greens Course concerned themselves with the rules of racing, while quarter horse races were anything but sedate events. Westerners accompanied quarter horse races with shooting matches, cockfights and boxing bouts. Since quarter horse races took place next to the local tavern, they often turned into very loud events with numerous members of the public under the influence of the local brew. Occasionally the Portsmouth Greens Course experienced the rowdy nature of western quarter horse races. Gamblers sometimes encountered corrupt bookmakers who dominated the betting by shortening their odds. These men disappeared from towns when they lost too heavily, and sometimes got caught bribing trainers and riders. Such events resulted in an uproar among the gamblers at the Portsmouth Greens Course.","Southerners found gambling to be an enjoyable activity while northerners viewed gambling as a vulgar European pastime. The differences in gambling between the South, the West and the North reflected the ways in which different cultures began to develop across America as the country continued to grow."],"display_date":"May 12, 1822 - May 13, 1822","search_date":"1822-05-12","locations":[{"id":14194,"lat":36.6743486041,"lng":-75.9181406429,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCESS ANNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1971,"title":"Celebrating a Leader\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-07-02","end_date":"1890-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The South had not lost its Confederate culture following the end of the Civil War.Those criminalized by the North were made immortal by southerners in the form of monuments.Churchill Gibson Chamberlayne and all six of his family and friends attended the festivities surrounding the laying the cornerstone of the monument for former Confederate President Jefferson Davis on July 2, 1896.The event included a parade that was the finest ever seen in Richmond.The parade was part of the ceremony celebrating the life and achievements of the ex-Confederate leader.In the parade there were between fifteen and twenty thousand Confederate veterans marching.

By 1890, public facilities in Richmond were completely segregated.Restrooms, busses, trains and other public venues were divided into white and black sections.Separate but equal was the battle cry of the politicians but it was well known that most black facilities lagged greatly behind white facilities.In 1896, Plessy vs. Ferguson solidified the presence of segregation in the south.The government of the United States did not protect blacks from this segregation because it was ruled that the government could not prevent private business owners from selecting whom they would allow into their establishments.The fact that the heads of the Y.M.C.A., a Christian establishment, would not allow blacks to attend their function is a testament to the deep roots of segregation in Richmond and in the South in general."],"display_date":"October 2, 1897","search_date":"1897-10-02","locations":[{"id":13920,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2031,"title":"Erastus Brown Encounters Indians on His Way to Texas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-11-15","end_date":"1859-11-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Like many young, adventurous men in the nineteenth century, Erastus Brown decided to explore the new frontier of the United States. Upon returning home from a trip to Texas, he wrote a letter to his sister, Millie, asking her to accompany him on his next trip. In discussing his trip to Texas, Erastus described his encounter with the Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw Indian Nations. He described the Cherokee people and remarked their land was the most lovely country [his] eyes ever beheld. He added that the Cherokee people seemed very well enlightened. However, Erastus did not think so highly of the Creeks. He considered the Creeks to be the most inferior of the three races. Erastus continued his focus on the Creeks, and gave a full account of the traditional Creek dance he witnessed. The Creeks gathered around a pole yelling, singing, and dancing in a manner that reminded [him] of the exact representation made in history of their 'war dances.' He remarked, Only the poor or inferior portions continued such dances. The superior Indian Nations [studied] the art of agriculture. "," Erastus Brown was not alone in wanting to travel to newly settled territories in the United States. In fact, historian Randolph Cambell titled his book, Gone to Texas, to represent the message that appeared on the doors of many abandoned homesteads across the southeastern United States in the mid-nineteenth century. While Erastus did not explicitly state his reasoning for going to Texas, Cambell offers many reasons why people from the southern United States felt comfortable leaving their homes for Texas. First, the U.S. Army established forts and explored the new lands, thus providing the stability needed for people to move into the new territory. Those who went to Texas wrote home about the opportunities the new territory offered -primarily cheap, rich land. Furthermore, like other new territories, slaveholders saw Texas as an opportunity to expand slavery. "," Although Brown did not mention the exact route he traveled on his way to and from Texas, it was likely he traveled through Oklahoma. He stated that he went through the Indian Nations: Cherokee, Creek, and Choctaw. As historian Dallas T. Herndon states, the movement of Americans into the western frontier forced Native Americans to be relocated to reserves in Oklahoma and part of the Texas Panhandle."," Brown noticed the different effects that American expansion and the relocation of Indians had on the tribes he came across. He described the Creeks as being inferior compared to the other Indian Nations. The Creeks continued traditions and rituals from the past such as the war dance. Other superior Indian Nations, moved away from their traditions and [studied] the art of agriculture. Herndon states that the Choctaw - one of the Indian Nations that Erastus encountered - were the most skillful agriculturists of all the Southern tribes, cultivating a greater variety of crops and with better successes. Despite the differing reasons behind Erastus and other young Americans movement into new territories, it was clear that such expansion had significant and varied effects on Indian Nations."],"display_date":"November 15, 1859","search_date":"1859-11-15","locations":[{"id":7764,"lat":38.941532547,"lng":-91.4702376515,"zoom":9,"place":"MONTGOMERY, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2053,"title":"A Gunpowder Plot\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-07-09","end_date":"1881-07-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Teddie and Lud visited the farm of a family friend out in the country.

The boys headed across the broom-straw field for the day's adventure.","Upon arriving, Bat pointed out the hornet's nest, about a foot long and a foot high, hanging from a low tree limb. There was not a hornet in sight. After planting the gunpowder in a small pile beneath the nest, Teddie focused his sunglass on the match. He retreated to the position of his companions. An explosion rocked the hornets' next, setting it ablaze. In half a second, hornets, which hummed like so many Minnie-balls, and came almost as fast, descended upon the trio. Two flew up Teddie's pantaloons. Bat turned to fly, when a hornet, coming straight as a bullet, struck him in the back of his head and lodged there... Lud could not escape the insects either. On the way back, they met Bat's old master, and gained his sympathy. When they finally arrived back home, the cook demanded an explanation for the boys' appearance. 'Hornicks,' replied the crestfallen Bat.","If Teddie, Lud, and Bat were students in Richmond's public school system, Bat would have attended one of the poorer black schools, while Teddie and Lud would have entered one of the better-funded white schools. Despite the racial inequalities found everywhere in the late nineteenth-century South, blacks and whites still interacted in positive ways in their daily lives. Teddie and Lud were excited to befriend someone who knew his way around the country farm; it did not matter to them that Bat's skin was black. Bat's old master responds with sympathy towards the plight of the three boys, and isn't bothered that two whites have a black boy as their companion. Similar interracial interaction occurred throughout the Upper South; in southern Maryland, blacks and whites worked side by side shelling oysters. In Baptist and Methodist churches across Virginia, blacks and whites often worshipped together. While issues of black and white inequality engulfed the political landscape of the South, blacks and whites could still treat each other as humans in their day-to-day interactions."],"display_date":"July 9, 1881","search_date":"1881-07-09","locations":[{"id":13919,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2055,"title":"In Cahoots With the Foxes\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-10-01","end_date":"1878-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Fox-hunting was the most popular sport on the Eastern Shore, especially in the bountiful counties of Talbot, Somerset, and Queen Anne. To preserve and encourage this particularly Southern sport, Hanson Hiss and other Maryland gentlemen founded the Elkridge Fox-Hunting Club in October of 1878. George S. Brown assumed the Presidency, but only on the condition that no bag-fox be used in any hunt. The Elkridge Club trained only the finest hounds, and all the Marylanders knew that Chesapeake Bay Retrievers were the fastest and sharpest of them all. The club bought its dogs and kept its kennel near Baltimore, but they hunted on the Eastern Shore.","Captain Greenbury Holt always joined the Elkridge Club in the chase. Hiss would remember in 1897 that Holt, despite his four score years, is still as enthusiastic a hunter as he was 50 years ago. The men helped Holt into the saddle, but everyone knew the Captain would need little else. With a cry the horses sprung into action, the dogs barking eagerly at the scent, and the men shouting, Hi, there ... At him ... To the scent Hi Hi Hi The fox disappeared over the crest of the hill, and the troop thundered after it. The Captain's horse was a solemn and dignified thoroughbred, who amble[d] at a coon pace. He fell behind the other riders as they entered the trees, but with his vast experience, Holt knew shortcuts and by-paths that brought him closer to his quarry. Just as someone pinned the fox, the Captain burst onto the scene: he [was] usually seen at the death, if there [was] anyone out there to see him. To be so keen at such an age made the man a legend: all the darkies along the shore claim[ed] that the captain [was] in cahoots with the foxes, [he] not only [knew] them, but learn[ed] from them ... [where] they [were] going to run.","Hiss believed that the people of the South have always looked upon every manner of outdoor sport with admiration and encouragement. Marylanders considered the gentlemanly and sophisticated sport of fox-hunting something uniquely appreciated in the South, which is why they founded the Elkridge Club. Hiss wrote several articles about fox-hunting in the Outdoors journal. He noted that fox-hunting is hell without a Southern hound like the Chesapeake Bay dog. He praised the exploits of Captain Holt, a former Confederate officer. He reflected that there have always been in the North ... a class who deprecated fox-hunting... The south is luckily free from men of that ilk.

Christmas was a time to spend with family, both close and distant. Mary Fitzhugh had moved to Richmond almost two months ago, and it was too great a distance for her to make the trip. In a letter, Lizzie Fitzhugh wrote to her sister: So many young cousins are assembling to-getther, at first one house and then the other. Most visitors stayed for many days, since family gatherings happened only a few times each year. Saturday was Christmas, and the celebration began with a visit to the huge Christmas tree outside the Fitzhughs' home. While the adults laughed and talked, the children rushed to the presents underneath the tree. Willie, Oscar, and Edward, Lizzie's brothers, received Roam candles, candy, and nuts. Bessie and Fannie, Lizzie's younger sisters, combed the hair on their new dollbabies. Brother Frank received a little wagon and horse.","Everyone knew that Christmas was truly a celebration of the birth of Jesus. On Sunday night, all of the family listened to Mr. Boggs preach at the church down the street. On Tuesday night, Lizzie went to a dance at the Mr. Moyer's house. She writes, there was such a crowd of strangers that all of us got two of the fiddlers and went in the dining room, where we had a very nice time. The parlor was crowded. But there was a young man who caught her eye, Lizzie tells her sister. She danced with Tom that night, even though she dared not sit with him on the sofa in the parlor.","Christmas was an opportunity for the Fitzhughs to meet and socialize with family and friends who were ordinarily separated by the difficulties of traveling. The distances between family members were not long by modern standards. However, traveling by horse made even these trips impractical unless it was a special occasion. Even though Richmond was less than 70 miles away from the Fitzhugh home, Mary still could not attend the celebrations. Railroads greatly accelerated the speed of travel, but rural areas such as Virginia's Eastern Shore had to depend on horses or private sailing vessels. In fact, the first railroad to reach the Eastern Shore only opened in 1884, running to Cape Charles. For most of the rest of the year, family members could only communicate through letters like those Lizzie wrote to her sister."],"display_date":"December 24, 1888","search_date":"1888-12-24","locations":[{"id":13919,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2057,"title":"In Memory of Patriotism and Valor\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-07-31","end_date":"1886-07-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The camp ground at Marvin Grove was the site for this year's Annual Reunion of Confederate Veterans on the Northern Neck peninsula.

Thomas E. Will explains: The antebellum code of honor demanded, [that] southerners [assert] to themselves and to the Yankees that they had retained their sense of righteousness, honor, and manliness. Southerners built monuments to Confederate leaders and memorials to honor the Confederate dead. Southern papers often printed front-page articles on demonstrations in the South in honor of Mr. Jefferson Davis or reminiscences of the Confederate Leader [Lee]. However, at this Reunion, Union soldiers were also invited. Southerners believed that Civil War veterans followed a mandate of duty when they chose to fight. Thus, there should be no enmity between the fighters on each side. Colonel Mayo's address explained that there was no purpose of maintaining or reviving bitter sectional memories at the celebration. Many southerners looked to the Confederate cause with nostalgia, but many also were anxious for a restored identity within the United States."],"display_date":"July 31, 1886","search_date":"1886-07-31","locations":[{"id":14113,"lat":37.8874061401,"lng":-76.2452646492,"zoom":10,"place":"NORTHUMBERLAND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2058,"title":"Hitting Shore With a Vengeance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Haynie Bradshaw thanked God every time he arrived back on shore. Oystermen were reputed to be daring and unscrupulous men, who regard[ed] neither the laws of God nor the laws of man, but Bradshaw was a devout Methodist who sometimes led services on Sunday. As an oysterman, Bradshaw dredged the Chesapeake Bay aboard one of the infamous bugeye boats. It was a terrible living. Crews received one third of the gross income, with the other two thirds going to boat maintenance and to the captain. Bradshaw helped push a windlass that scraped the bottom of the bay. According to those in the trade, it was like pulling in anchor while the boat was sailing. His shabby clothes froze to his body out in the frigid ocean surf. Bradshaw knew men who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. Others were plagued with oyster hand, an infection that developed if one cut one one's hands while culling oysters.","Crisfield was an oysterman town, and to the town the oystermen bought prosperity as well as debauchery. All the buildings had holes in the floors to toss away emptied shells. The entire town smelled of dead oysters. Girls on the street corner outside Blizzard's were hardly discreet about their employment. The town's residents used guns to disperse the rowdy drunks prowling the streets after dark. While Bradshaw's religious faith was dear to him, the dangers and tension of the oyster season caused him to lapse into drinking. Bradshaw chose Burgess's Saloon, which featured a boxing ring for the customers' enjoyment. Bradshaw wasn't planning on fighting, but then he saw a Virginia waterman who had insulted him earlier, saying, Hey, ain't you one o' them dumb Smith Islanders? In a second they were in the ring. Bradshaw clocked him and the drunken crowd cheered raucously. When the Virginian's friends came to his aid, Bradshaw bloodied them too, one after the other. The saloon in Crisfield was a far cry from his Methodist Church back home.","While the slavery system ended years earlier, the free labor system for both blacks and whites could be awful as well. In each, the living conditions could be atrocious, with poor clothing, poor quarters, and poor food. In each, the work could only be done by forced labor provided by traders. For the oyster industry, the crimps in Baltimore were responsible for delivering the men to the captains, who paid them off for their services and then kept the men at sea for as long as they could. Slaves were usually not paid for their work, and oystermen were sometimes only paid off with the boom: knocked overboard into the freezing waters by the captain at the end of a voyage. Many laborers, such as Bradshaw, looked to alcohol to cope with the dangers. Tough labor conditions were found throughout the South and in many other forms than those in the oyster industry. Both blacks and whites were often exploited by the system of sharecropping, where a farmer worked another man's land in return for a small portion of the crops. Life could be difficult for a working man in the South, even if he was free."],"display_date":1875,"search_date":"1875-07-02","locations":[{"id":6062,"lat":37.9285902233,"lng":-75.8346527629,"zoom":9,"place":"SOMERSET, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2059,"title":"The Gallant Knight of Hereford\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-09-05","end_date":"1878-09-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 5, 1878, Richard Hereford represented Prince George's County in a jousting tournament. The sixteen knights, clad in armor and flashing colors, paraded the streets of Baltimore before the event. Long lines of fancy barouches followed the men and their steeds. A brass band heralded the knights as they passed the judges' stand. Each knight had a preliminary ride, but then the contest began. At stake were a gold watch with chain and a pair of Smith & Wesson's improved revolvers, but the Knight of Hereford rode to win the honor of crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty.","Sir Hereford clipped eight of nine rings during his first three runs, but the riding was particularly strong in this tournament. In the fourth tiebreaking round, the three rings were a mere inch and a quarter wide. As he prepared for his run, Hereford tried to act cavalierly: a knight's demeanor reflected on himself, his county, and his state. The trumpets [blew] out a challenge, the drummer [gave] a scientific trill, and the Chief Marshall called out in a booming voice, Charge Sir Knight The heralds echoed, and Sir Hereford thundered down the 90 yard track. In full gallop, he poised his lance. He neatly clipped the first two rings, but just missed the third. The crowd cheered as the trumpets blared triumphantly. A pair of pages escorted the Knight past the judges. The ladies in the stand waved their handkerchiefs. It was not enough to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, but the joust was still a success for any knight who conducted himself with gallant bearing, majestic mien, and superior horsemanship.","After the Civil War, Maryland's image had deteriorated in the eyes of many southerners, who accused Marylanders of being submissionists to northern oppression. The joust became popular in southern Maryland because many Marylanders wanted to redeem their identity as southerners. In the 1890s, the journalist Hanson Hiss claimed that jousting may be ... the only remaining relic of that romantic and picturesque age which has furnished the bards of centuries with themes. Marylanders linked this romantic image of jousting with their image of the Old South, and through jousting, they renewed their southern identity. Many Maryland knights chose names like the Knight of the Lost Cause, the Knight of the Sunny South, and the Knight in Grey to show their sympathy for the plight of the southern states. Jousts strengthened ties to the South in other ways as well: this joust in Baltimore was used to raise money for yellow fever sufferers in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1878","search_date":"1878-09-05","locations":[{"id":6035,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE GEORGES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2060,"title":"Testimonies at the Turlington Camp\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-08-07","end_date":"1881-08-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Wagons loaded with fried chicken, vegetables, figs, fruits, grapes, cantaloupes, and watermelon crept towards the sea of tents. People also packed carpets, mattresses, plates, bowls, bed linens, lamps, rocking chairs, and even clocks. The annual, week-long, Turlington camp meeting had finally arrived. The big bell tolled, beckoning everyone to the benches. It was quite a congregation: almost 8000 people would attend some portion of the meetings. James Cannon, Jr. from Salisbury, Maryland, sat with this father and listened: the substance of the preaching was the same as ... [his] church back home. There was somewhat more pressure brought to bear upon the church members to bestir themselves to hunt the sinners, and stronger more impassioned appeals to the sinner to forsake their ways and return to God. People jumped and shouted Hallelujah, especially the older white men and blacks who sat in the front of the wooden tabernacle.","The next morning, James rose promptly at 7 a.m. as the big bell clanged. After breakfast, there was a time of prayer. In the two hours of free time that followed, James took the opportunity to meet different families from Virginia's Eastern Shore. At 10, the lovefeast began, with the preacher incessantly calling for another testimony, another testimony James attended religious services at 3 and 7:30. After the little children were tucked in their tents, there was one more evening service. Organ and piano led stirring hymns like Blessed Assurance and What a Friend We Have in Jesus. Despite all the preaching, the camp meetings were a mix of the secular and spiritual. At night, women traded recipes, and young children spent their allowance at the candy stand. Young men and women joined nightly promenades around the grounds. One night, James heard giggling in a girl's tent as he walked by. He entered and found the girls laughing at an old lady in a rocking chair nearby, smoking a pipe. Each time she rocked, her shadow expanded and contracted on the wall of the tent. James wasn't as amused: he explained to the girls that smoking was an evil habit. This was a lecture the girls would not forget for many years.","The original idea of the Turlington Camp Meeting was for Methodists, rich and poor, black and white, to leave the comforts of their normal lives for a time of rededication to Jesus Christ. Early on, there was dramatic revival at the annual meeting. Each year, the meetings grew more and more popular (in 1889, nearly 1,500 people showed up each night). They also became grander, finer, and more institutionalized. In 1876, the church added a wooden tabernacle. In 1891, they added a choir loft. The dresses of the ladies became fancier and fancier, and the expected time for testimonies became shorter and shorter. For the Turlington Camp Methodists, religion became more secular with each passing year. While Christianity declined in spiritual significance for many southerners in the late nineteenth century, other regions of the South still resisted secular influences. In the early years, northern Methodists from Maryland shared in the fellowship at Turlington. While newspapers reported the friendly and brotherly feeling between these groups during the Methodist Centennial Conference in 1884, the situation soured quickly. In 1885, the northern Methodists split from the Turlington Camp, fearing that the original purpose of the meeting had been lost."],"display_date":"August 7, 1881 - August 15, 1881","search_date":"1881-08-11","locations":[{"id":13591,"lat":37.9436744077,"lng":-75.3696408508,"zoom":9,"place":"ACCOMACK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2063,"title":"Fourth of July Oration\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-07-04","end_date":"1831-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was the Fourth of July, 1831.  Francis Scott Key, author of the Star Spangled banner, delivered the oration in the Rotunda of the Capitol of the United States.  He spoke to unite the country and reflect the significance of freedom.  Independence Day was newly designated since the county had only recently gained independence from Great Britain.  Francis Scott Key was aware of the magnitude of this celebration.  He started his speech by stating, The spectacle of a happy people, rejoicing in the thankfulness before God and the world for the blessing of civil liberty, is no vain pageant.  Key went on to speak of the duty of those assembled.  He called it a high and holy duty, stating We have opened the records of time, and read that bright page that proclaimed to the world the solemn purpose of the fathers of our country, and the sacred pledge they gave us for its fulfillment.  The pledge has been redeemed, the purpose is accomplished, and we are here, in the rich possession of what valor has won, and wisdom has preserved for us.  Key addressed the crowd with the hope of reminding citizens, in a time of turmoil, of the purpose and sacrifices of the fathers of our country.  The possession was won and the wisdom preserved, now it is the duty of the citizens to carry on the honor and mission of a free land, he stated. ","Key told of a fear that many Americans at that time derived from a clash between state's power and the power of the national government.  He urged everyone to take hope and courage from the past.  He was able to proclaim with pride, This is my own, my native land.  He ended his oration with the question, Is our country less loved, as it becomes more worthy of our love?    Francis Scott Key used profound and powerful words on the Fourth of July, 1831, to remind the country what the founding fathers fought so hard to obtain, freedom.  ","The oration given by Francis Scott Key was an optimistic attempt to rally citizens on the glorious celebration of the nation's birth.  However, the country was already divided over the issue of slavery.  Key was unaware of the events that would unfold in the remainder of 1831. Nat Turner's infamous rebellion was initially planned for the same day, July 4 1831, but was delayed.  In this same year, William Lloyd Garrison's newspaper, <em>The Liberator,</em> would begin contributing to polarization.  Key described the country as deserving love.  However, at this time the nation was divided.  Donald, Baker, and Holt describe the development of Southernism.  In their book, <em>The Civil War and Reconstruction</em>, they quote Alexander Stephens as saying, The South is my home- my fatherland.  Southerners held their region in the highest esteem and gave it their loyalty first and foremost.  This division, that Key struggled to overcome in his 1831 speech pointed towards the Civil War.

Celebrations like this, focusing on the achievements of the country, were often held in Washington.  The Citizens of Washington wanted to encourage these celebrations and rally support and pride in the nation.  On January 3, 1832, they posted an article for the anniversary celebration.

These patriotic societies were based on the descent from their ancestor's services to the nation.   Many clubs were organized after significant battles.

Therefore, this trip to Washington was a thrill for him. After registering at the Gadsby's Hotel in Washington, Rawlins journeyed down to the capital.  He entered the Rotunda, immediately drawn to four large hanging pictures.  The subjects included, The Declaration of Independence, The Surrender of Cornwallis (1781), The Resignation of Washington (1783), and the Surrender of Burgoyne (1772).  These were so powerful that Rawlins reflected in his journal, They bear such internal evidence of truth that the beholder is almost constrained to forget everything else in looking at them.  A bronze statute of Jefferson, seems to cause a thrill of admiration.  Next he ventured into the Senate.  Again the details of the splendid room stuck his attention.

The Declaration was kept in a mahogany case in the State Department.  Already, some of the signatures were almost illegible due to fading.  The parchment bore evidence of being rolled up tightly.  Viewing documents of such significance sent a chill through Mr. Rawlins body. After viewing these historic documents he ventured to the John Quincy Adams' house, there he presented a letter from Mr. Cranch.  It was shocking how old Adams looked, his head almost entirely bald.  The little hair he did possess was silvery in color.  Afraid of staying too long, Rawlins quickly left.  He continued his day with a visit to the residence of Henry Clay, again to deliver a letter.  This visit delighted Rawlins, as Clay was dignified yet cordial.  His smile was peculiarly placid. Clay was tall and slender, with thin grey hair, small eyes, and a wide mouth, making him appear to possess a constant smile.  As if visiting Adams and Clay was not enough for one day, Rawlins also met with John Calhoun in the Senate.  He ended this day of activity with an evening of feasting at Judge Cranch's.

Henry Clay was John Quincy Adam's Secretary of State during his tenure as President.  As President, Adams envisioned a strong central government.  This only worsened tensions with the South.

The business at hand on June 13th, 1891 for Ex-Confederate veterans of Berkley County, West Virginia was to find homes for ex-confederate veterans who were disabled and aged in need of special care. The need for care was not something unusual for those in the Confederate army. Throughout the civil war, the Confederate army found itself in need of medical care in the forms of hospital buildings and medical staff. It was often seen that many of the wounded soldiers lay sick on the floor, which lent itself to spreading diseases like typhoid, mumps, and pneumonia among the wounded soldiers quite quickly. And so from the very onset of the civil war, the Confederacy found itself lacking in the resources to take care of their wounded soldiers, and nearly 25 years later, those veterans were still struggling to find such resources. ","Also, it was not uncommon during the 1880s and 1890s for ex-Confederates brigades to reunite. It was not until 1889, that the reunions became more organized with the foundation of the United Confederate Veterans. This organization was led by General Gordon. The annual meetings held in New Orleans were host to many ragged confederates, who were usually found without money and sleeping in parks, doorsteps or even on rooftops. It was in these settings that ex-confederates joined together to romanticize and reminisce about the Old South. They told stories of the Southern aristocracy that inhabited the South prior to the Civil War, and re-lived the events of war battles, and soldier's dying words fighting for the Confederacy.","Much of this sentimentality among the ex-Confederate soldiers arose from the South's sense of inferiority and constant need to justify a position in relation to the North. The southerners of this time were reluctant to adopt a New Order which called for assimilation with the North to form a unified country. Instead, they clung to the past, the Old South, recounting old stories and founding organizations like the United Confederate Unions to bolster the solidarity among the South in opposition to the North.

The only systematic activities that occurred within the church were occasional revival meetings, annual meetings of the disciples, and funeral meetings. When these events did occur, people would travel from many miles to attend, which would explain why the members of a church in Hampshire County would come to visit a minister in Hook's Mills, Virginia.

As the letters evolved chronologically, his profession of his undying love for Miss Miller becomes stronger and more prominent in his writing. However, Moats had his concerns that his love for Nela Miller was unrequited and continually questioned the deepness of her love for him. Similarly, Nela had expressed the same concern in that he did not love her as much as he had written, but William Moats adamantly wrote that his love for her runs deep. It seemed that the courtship between the young lovers had not occurred over an extended period of time. Moats remarks in one letter that he hopes that he is not being too fast in this short courtship. ","These love letters exemplify the greater courtship rituals that are prevalent throughout this period in southern history. Most of the suitors met their potential wives at social functions, including parties or church events. The man would visit the women he was courting either at home or when great distances were present through love letters, which is the case with William Moats and Nela Miller. Although it is not known from the love letters, most suitors would get the approval of the father before the couple became engaged, which was followed by a small marriage ceremony usually in the bride's parents house. It seems the antebellum period in the south, status in marriage was not as greatly emphasized as prior to the Civil War partly due to the somewhat quieted political upheaval. ","Also, during this time, the judicial system had its hand in the courtship rituals and consequently the sexual behaviors deemed acceptable at the time. This reflects the overall sense of morality expected of young southerns. Every Southern state during this period prohibited fornication to preserve the sanctity of marriage and not to discourage the act of sexual intercourse itself. Many times convictions were upheld when it threatened the institution of marriage, which arose when sexual relations occurred between a married and non-married person or two non-married people were cohabiting. ","The judicial system, through common law, ruled upon cases of seduction, described as a young man promising marriage to gain sexual intercourse, but later abandoning the young girl. In the case of William Moats, if he was found to be seducing Nela Miller in hopes of sexual intercourse and then later abandoning her, Moats would be expected to pay compensation to the father for shame and mortification and the pain and suffering brought to the family. In some states, even the women were able to sue their seducers, not for the sexual act itself, but for the emotional abuse they sustained causing her to be disgraced. Under criminal law, in the late 19th century, seduction could be penalized if there was proof that the man made intentions of marrying the women, which in the case of William Moats, could be found in his correspondence and love letters. ","The love letters from William Moats to Nela Miller could be an example of the acceptable courtship rituals allowed at the time. If Moats and Miller abstained from sexual intercourse until marriage, and if Moats did not deceive Miller into entering into a sexual relationship, then their actions would not be deemed impermissible and would be free of judicial sanctions. However, once that line was crossed and they entered into a sexual relationship, many times the court would intervene, not to stop sexual behavior, but as a commentary upon the acceptable morality of the time."],"display_date":"April - December 1889","search_date":"1889-08-16","locations":[{"id":14761,"lat":38.6807273925,"lng":-79.3508959054,"zoom":9,"place":"PENDLETON, West Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2097,"title":"The Young Men of Natchez Have Organized an Artillery Company\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-08-25","end_date":"1876-08-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The young artillery company was pressed for funds, and the task of raising them fell to a member of their ranks named H.H. Farnham. In an August 1876 fundraising letter to Stephen Duncan, the former president of the Bank of Mississippi, Farnham, (who signed the correspondence Ch. Com. Of the Gilden Light Artillery) wrote that the young men of Natchez have organized an artillery company, known as the Gilden Light Artillery and are now trying to raise the funds to equip with one or two pieces. Farnham went on to outline the costs of outfitting the new artillery, asking Mr. Duncan to participate by paying a subscription of any amount you may deem it advisable to give so that the young men's artillery might participate in a coming campaign. There is no record of whether Mr. Duncan, already an honorary member of the Natchez Adams Light infantry, accommodated the requests of the Gilden Light Artillery, but it might be presumed that the former Bank president and owner of a sugar and cotton plantation, would have support the young men's efforts in spirit, if not in dollars."," Artillery companies served a unique purpose in the psyche of former Confederate communities. They represented a prouder time and were part of the balm that soothed the southern collective consciousness in the years after their defeat: the Lost Cause ideology, or the idea that the Confederacy had fought nobly and bravely for a superior cause and were defeated only by the sheer force of the federal army. The Lost Cause ideal was first established- or at least first defined in such terms - in a 1866 book of the same name by journalist Edward Pollard, and it gained in popularity throughout the 1870s, mostly through articles written by Former Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal Early, a West Point graduate who emphasized, among other tenets, the nobility of southern military leadership in comparison to the allegedly barbaric behavior on the part of Union troops. As southern historian Rod Andrew, Jr explains, perhaps the most central and enduring element of the Lost Cause was the firm connection in the minds of southerners between martial virtue (courage, patriotism, selflessness, loyalty) and moral rectitude. The image of the valorous soldier as a patriot and model citizen had antebellum roots, but it shaped and drew strength from the legend of the Lost Cause after the Civil War."," The popularity and growth of and esteem commanded by such artillery companies, serve in Andrew's words, as a reminder that militarism was as much as part of southern culture after the Civil War as before. As the young men of Natchez would have been proud to note, their Gilden Light Artillery was part of a phenomenon across the South that was much greater then their own group and its fundraising efforts."],"display_date":"August 25, 1876","search_date":"1876-08-25","locations":[{"id":6928,"lat":31.4831695494,"lng":-91.3531349834,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2100,"title":"The Great Democratic Procession\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-06-26","end_date":"1875-06-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the summer of 1875, Jane Pryor of Vicksburg, Mississippi wrote a warm letter to Caroline Kiger of Warren County in anticipation of the coming week's political events. Encouraging Mrs. Kiger's husband to come to Vicksburg, Pryor wrote: tell him to try and be here 24th in the Great Democratic procession at 6 o'clock in the afternoon that will be tomorrow & we will show him the elegant Democracy of our town. "," Pryor was not alone in her admiration of the growing Democratic party, a group that was evolving during the 1870s into a political class known as Bourbon Democrats for their aristocratic white backgrounds and policies. As historian Ed Ayers notes, Democrats regained control from Radical Republican reconstructionists in 1876, or the election year following Pryor's 1875 letter. Reconstruction was led by a loathed coalition succinctly described by southern political historian Monroe Billington as Yankee carpetbaggers, southern scalawags, and blacks - in other words, former Union soldiers or citizens who had moved South after the war, the former Confederates who cooperated with them, and worst of all, former slaves. "," As its finally regained power, the Democratic party inspired pride in Jane Pryor and many of her position in white society. Ayers alludes to this sense: Many of the Redeemer Democrats bore impressive pedigrees and could claim distinguished service in the Confederacy. In counties and states across the South white veterans with education and property stepped forward to seize the power they considered rightfully theirs. Under democratic rule, they promised, political bloodshed would cease, race relations would calm, the economy would flourish, and honor in government would prevail. These promises struck a chord with whites like Pryor, who tired not only of the shame of being governed by their former military foes and slaves but also of the violent backlash and sense of lawlessness that came from groups outside the electoral process like the Ku Klux Klan. "," These Democrats postured as the defenders of an old South way of life. Democratic politicians called themselves Redeemers, emphasizing their role in reclaiming the South from the humiliation of not only the Civil War, but of the Republican Reconstruction as well. Their background and breeding represented the best, in the minds of many white Southerners, of a genteel and honorable past, and their platform emphasized a return to a way of life longed for by these sort of voters. Jane Pryor wrote gauzily of the elegance of the party, and of the spectacle of the parade. The Mr. Kiger in question- the owner of a substantial Warren County plantation- likely would have been among those white southerners who, out of yearning for a past elevated to near perfection by nostalgia, would have found solace in the Democratic candidates, the Redeemer message, and Great Democratic procession in Vicksburg, Mississippi at 6 o'clock on July 24th, 1875."],"display_date":"June 26, 1875","search_date":"1875-06-26","locations":[{"id":7313,"lat":32.364480123,"lng":-90.8603381835,"zoom":9,"place":"WARREN, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2114,"title":"A Coming Together of the Races\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-01-22","end_date":"1847-01-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 22 1847, a peculiar event took place at the Jonesborough hatter shop. On this occasion, whites and blacks of the town congregated for what was known as a Negro Party. Together, members of both races cast aside racial differences in order to celebrate the coming of the New Year. Every guest, despite their race, took part in the festivities which included feasting and dancing. The merriment lasted until five o'clock in the morning. At this event, white citizens of the town who were often divided on issues of religion and politics, came together in the spirit of solidarity to extend to the African American population of the community the right hand of fellowship. These people believed that, on the ballroom floor, both classes could come together free of distinctions of morals or color. It was expressed that many of the party goers thought that certain distinctions made on account of skin color were of the utmost distaste. Through the elimination of these distinctions, the white citizens of Jonesborough were able to show their devotion to those whom they termed voters of color.","This narrative serves as a reflection of the abolitionist sentiments felt by many East Tennesseans. Local manumission societies were established in a handful of counties in the early 1800's including Washington County, of which Jonesborough served as the county seat. Like the citizens in attendance at the New Years party, members of these societies had sympathetic attitudes towards people of color and pushed for the gradual emancipation the slaves. In 1819, a citizen of Jonesborough began circulating <em>The Manumission Intelligencer</em>, which later became simply <em>The Emancipator</em>. Historian Robert E. Corlew argues that these Tennessee manumission societies were short lived and no longer existed by mid-1830.

The Randolphs of Richmond were one such family. In 1830, William Randolph and his clan maintained several houses and a handful of slaves across the state, living prosperously in the antebellum Virginia. Judging by records left behind, Randolph provided very well for his family, feeding, clothing, and educating them according to the standards of a wealthy southern patriarch.  ","One of Randolph's daughters, Elizabeth, received the same upper-class Southern education given to most wealthy females at the time. While her father was away from home, Elizabeth's schedule was packed with music, drawing, and sewing lessons taught by a private tutor. I have just finished taking my Music lesson, and Mr. Barry thinks I have improved a little, she wrote her father. I have practiced more than usual lately. This routine of music lessons, drawing, and other instruction expected of an antebellum housewife was standard fare for wealthy girls in the process of receiving their training. Rarely did girls get the kind of classical education in philosophy, history, and the sciences that their male counterparts received. Still, at the time Elizabeth wrote in the 1830's, women's education in the South was beginning to undergo a profound change - one that would make her form of schooling obsolete.","     Immediately after the Revolutionary War, female education was valued very highly. Educational reforms at the time favored higher education for women in order to prepare them to become republican mothers and pass on classical schooling to their children. After a time, however, that sentiment began to decline. In the antebellum South, classics and philosophy were increasingly replaced by drawing and embroidery. Higher education for women would not regain its former popularity until the 1850's when a new wave of reform swept over the South. Elizabeth Randolph, forced to study music and sewing instead of Plato, was the product of a Southern culture that failed to see classical education and domestic training as compatible.

If a farmer, city-dweller or plantation owner wanted a little light reading, for example, they could always crack open a book or leaf through the local newspaper. Printing in the years leading up to the Civil War was more advanced than ever, and as a result, printed material began to blanket every corner of the United States.","Even with books, journals, newspapers, and pamphlets encroaching on all aspects of daily life, the most popular literature to roll off the antebellum presses was the almanac. Almanacs were known as the poor man's Bible because of their practicality and widespread use among all classes. Leafing through the latest edition, a farmer could learn just about anything, from how to plant and harvest crops to how to break ill news. Almanacs also contained more civic-minded information, such as a list of the members of the General Assembly and a schedule for sessions of the local and federal courts.","Almanacs included so much useful information that many families kept a copy in their homes at all times (since they never knew when it might be useful). The Watson family of Richmond was no exception. One summer night in 1843, Caroline Watson was at her grandmother's house entertaining a visitor when the light started to fade. As the sun fell below the horizon, word was sent down from the house that grandma had gone to sleep for the night. A family servant told the visitor, Mr. Davis, that it was time for bed and offered to make up a room for him to stay the night. Much to the surprise of Caroline, the young man said he had not intended to stay and was actually planning on riding over to a neighbor's house that night on business. This created a problem because it was pitch dark outside. Mr. Davis suggested that if he waited at the Watsons' until the moon rose, he could find his way along the unlit roads. Immediately, Caroline consulted the family almanac, which said the moon would rise around nine o'clock that night. While they waited for the moon, Caroline and Mr. Davis were frequently interrupted by messages from her tired (and angry) grandmother, who eventually concluded the two were going to stay up all night.","By reading Caroline Watson's account of her family's evening visitor, it is clear just how often and in how many situations the almanac was consulted. Just as families today will use the internet to quickly look up information on any subject, families of the nineteenth century relied on the almanac in the same way - as an all-purpose reference manual for everyday life."],"display_date":"August 19, 1843","search_date":"1843-08-19","locations":[{"id":13915,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2205,"title":"Youthful Misconduct in Celebration of Christmas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-12-24","end_date":"1879-01-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The members of the City Council of Staunton, Virginia voted against the suspension over the Christmas holiday of an ordinance that forbad the use of pop-crackers in the streets.

The performance of the Stonewall Brigade Band of Staunton confirmed the friendship that existed between the two sister cities of the Valley of Virginia, Staunton and Winchester. The Brigade Band performed to the general delight of all present outside the Commercial Hotel in honor of Captain W. L. Clarke, an old citizen of Staunton and the mayor of Winchester. One listener named the band the capstone of the civic virtues, illustrating the pleasure the music gave those in attendance. Mayor Clarke, as well as many other men, responded to the tribute made by the concert with addresses discussing the feelings of friendship existing between the neighboring towns.","  The performance highlighted the value that the inhabitants of Augusta County placed on an amiable alliance between sister towns and the qualities they treasure in their citizens. An attendant of the performance observed that brass was usually recognized as essential to success, and that he did not know any equal number of men who had more brass or knew how to use it better than the Stonewall Brigade Band. His comment highlights not only an appreciation of the skill of the musicians, but also the importance of brass, strength and confidence in a man, which is necessary for him to be triumphant. ","  The time for the South to remain confident came prior to the 1880 election. After the decline in Republican votes in the South in the election of 1878, the Radical Republicans identified a need to change the political distributions to dominate Congress if they were to attempt any government action in the South. Historian James M. McPherson describes how by 1879, they realized that a unified North had to outvote the solid South. While the North sought to show the South that they would no longer dominate the government, the South continued to reinforce the bonds that kept them politically united, furthering McPherson's argument by suggesting the implications of the attempts to form a solid North on the South. The playing of Staunton's Stonewall Brigade Band connected Staunton to her neighboring city of Winchester, strengthening the sisterly feelings that existed between these two cities of the Valley. Communication between cities allowed the sharing of ideas and news, both political and social. When election time arose, it is more likely that these cities would vote similarly because they had a vested interest in one another. It is connections such as these between Staunton and Winchester that formed the solid South, relationships that the North would like to break after the 1878 election.

Its female members, like Mrs. O. A. Parish, directed and managed the self-proclaimed C.L.S.C. diligently and passionately until 1887, only to be replaced thereafter by another intellectual group with many of the same members, The Society of Friends Council. Mrs. O. A. Parish, the secretary for the Circle, kept detailed recordings of their meetings for most of this time period. The preamble for the Circle states that the female members of the C.L.S.C began to meet, for the purpose of mutual improvement, and that its members were uniting because of a mutual recognition of, the value of frequent interchanges of thought and experience. Historian Gail Collins notes that these groups typically functioned as, a sort of informal, do-it-yourself junior college system. The idea of doing something unrelated to their families was an enormous breakthrough. The 1886 C.L.S.C. record book stated that the women studied wide-ranging topics with everything from, the poetry of the Elizabethan Age, and philosophical discussions of, mind and matter to, the formation of coal beds, and the, Geology of the Atlantic Ocean. The women undertook these endeavors earnestly and with enthusiasm, each member presenting a different topic for discussion in any given meeting; Mrs. Tolfree, an active member of the C.L.S.C, for example, would present Current Events, while Mrs. Travers would be prepared to speak on Congressional Proceedings, once particular bills were made law. "," The late nineteenth century gave birth to a new, small triumph for southern women. Across America, pockets of female intellectuals gathered together in order to discuss everything from the most classical works of academia to current affairs. The Queen City Chautauqua Circle was one such gathering. By 1900, there were roughly 5,000 such groups that were part of the General Federation of Women's clubs alone, while hundreds more, like the Queen City Chautauqua Circle formed on their own. Gail Collins suggested that women at this time were, reaching for something beyond the household. In an apparently spontaneous movement, women's study clubs started popping up all over the country. In cities, small towns, and even some rural areas, middle class housewives organized themselves into groups to study current affairs, world history, or English literature. And, indeed, these intellectual support systems for women seemed popular in the South; a roster taken in 1885 by Mrs. O. A. Parish had as many as 23 female members recorded. "," Collins noted that the Civil War was an earlier turning point responsible for this new way of life for southern women. She said that at a time when, southern manhood, 'the mighty oak,' had been, 'hit by lightening,' women began to forge bonds with one another and take on new societal roles like never before. In the late nineteenth century of the Gilded Age, women were showing up in the workplace in both the North and the South, or taking more active roles in their communities while still taking care of their families-which was more often the case in the South."],"display_date":"1885 - 1887","search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":7853,"lat":37.8246035682,"lng":-92.2076649652,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2242,"title":"The St. Louis Brown Stocking Ball Club\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-03-04","end_date":"1895-03-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The New York Times</em> reported that the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs was on the verge of dissolution on Monday March 4, 1895. National League Baseball was founded slightly before Major League Baseball. The Major League was founded in the early 1900s and since then the two leagues have competed in an annual series of games called the World Series. At the time of the reported near-dissolution, the National League was still fairly new and cementing all its policies. On March 4, The New York Times discussed what caused the unrest in southern baseball politics and possible dissolution of the league: President Von der Abe of the St. Louis Brown Stocking Ball Club was outraged by the National League's rules of discipline regarding the players. Fred Pfeffer, a ballplayer for the St. Louis Browns, was fined 500 for an anti-disciplinary action frowned upon by the League's administrators Brush, Freedman, and Byrne (no first names were given). President Von der Abe threatened that, If the same tactics are pursued next season, at least, seven of the twelve clubs will break away from this autocratic domination. Despite the conflict, the St. Louis Browns with all of its twelve players, headed for Little Rock, Arkansas on Tuesday March 5 to kick off the spring training season practice games.","The St. Louis Browns was one of the first southern teams playing in the National League at the beginning of what would become a long and hallowed tradition of American culture. Baseball allowed for northern and southern competition, but in a healthy, non-aggressive way after the Civil War. Fledgling forms of baseball arose in the South, with help from carpet-bagger northerners who traveled to the region during reconstruction and taught the rules of the game to southerners. By the mid-1880s the Southern League was established and for the first time organized baseball quickly became a large interest and addition to southern culture. Baseball politics became a matter of local pride and were important to southern males particularly, for both spectators and players alike. Although only four confederate cities (Richmond, Houston, Atlanta, and Texas) made it into the Major League at this time, baseball was still a large part of southern culture throughout the nineteenth century.","Cities like Little Rock were consistent hosts to minor league teams, not to mention college and industrial ones. The South even manufactured a great majority of the game's bats, including the Louisville Slugger, and since 1886, it has been the site of spring training camps, according to historians Charles Wilson and William Ferris. Regions like Little Rock, Arkansas were ideal for such training camps in the pre-season because of the good weather and general environment, evidence of which could be seen in the fact that the St. Louis Browns traveled there from Missouri every season to train. Missouri, itself, however, was not ideal for baseball. In the early 1900s, two powerful major league owners Connie Mack and Clark Griffith, insisted that the weather in St. Louis, Cincinatti, and Washington sapped the strength of players on their teams even before mid-season. In order to win a game under such conditions, Mack joked that a team, must be twenty-five percent better than any other.

Cable, read selected passages from his various literary works at the Mercantile Library Hall in St. Louis, Missouri. The St. Louis <em>Post-Dispatch</em>, one of the newspapers covering the event, noted that a brilliant audience (about 700 people) turned up to hear the two authors speak. Cable began the evening by reading three excerpts from Dr. Sevier, and also performed, several songs illustrating the music of the creole negroes in New Orleans. The audience gave Cable warm and enthusiastic applause. Mark Twain followed his fellow author's performance with selections from <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>. He also read from <em>The Tragic Tale of the Fishwife</em>, <em>A Lying Situation</em>, and <em>Ghost Story</em>. The St. Louis <em>Post-Dispatch</em> reported that 'Mark Twain' gained the audience over at the start. St. Louis had an obvious admiration of Twain and his fiction. The audience received the reading with roars of laughter, and it was hailed as the most enjoyable entertainment of the kind ever given here. They gave the same reading performance twice during the day of January 10, once in the evening, and read yet again on January 11. ","This part of the book tour was personally important to Twain since he was coming back to his home state, Missouri. Twain commented to his wife that, This visit... you can never imagine the infinite great deeps of pathos that have rolled their tides over me...I have carried my heart in my mouth for twenty-four hours.","By the time Twain arrived in St. Louis, he had begun introducing what has been hailed as one of his greatest literary works on southern life, <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, and it was extremely popular. The St. Louis <em>Daily Globe Democrat</em> reported that audiences were captivated with his peculiar mannerisms, Twain's voice which had, the resonance of a cracked steamboat whistle, and the humorous and lively content of Huck's adventures. The readings that took place in January preceded the publication of the novel as a whole, and served as a teaser for the finished work. The novel was published in Canada on December 10, 1884 by Dawson Brothers, and in London by Chatto and Windus, although the novel did not appear as a published work in America until February 18, 1885. "," But Twain did not just captivate St. Louis, he enchanted audiences all over America and even abroad when the novel was published. In the novel, Twain depicted southern society like no writer had before by highlighting not only its assets, but all its vices. Local-color literature, a style that emerged from 1865 to the end of the century focusing on a specific region's customs, landscapes, and dialects, became very popular through the literary talents of men like Twain in the late 1880s. Historian William J. Cooper described local color writers as writers who, take selective verbal photographs. They stressed things that were peculiar to particular American regions: physical settings and speech, dress, mannerisms, and thought patterns of the people of America's various regions. Twain used a distinct vernacular in his portrayal of the South, and many critiques of the novel praised the revealing power of the book's dialect. Cooper went on to state that above all Mark Twain was the most important local colorists of the South. "," However, Twain's colorful depictions of the South were not always well received. Richard Watson Gilder, who attempted to edit Mark Twain's novel before it came out in 1884, found it rough and borderline shocking. Ron Powers, a biographical author of Twain remarked that, Mark Twain's unprecedented use of vernacular pushed against the limits of public tolerance...[with its] bad grammar, slang, and even indirect references to sex. On the whole, though, Mark Twain was respected and hailed for his inventive genius. He depicted a raw South, giving the North, Canada, and Europe a taste genuine southern life, and giving them a chance to better understand it.

Men of all classes, of all shapes and sizes, employed distinctively bizarre methods of using tobacco. Inhaling dry tobacco powder seems simple enough, but the means to that end varied upon the artistic originality of the southern man. Some gentlemen were quite convulsive, propelling the powder upward into their nostril and shaking their bodies violently as it entered their systems, while others had a polished demeanor, a smooth relaxation marking their snuff-taking. There were those that liked a fast, sharp movement, and those who enjoyed the experience and refinement that accompanied the act. The mode of their consumption depended on what they hoped to gain from the snuff: public attention or tobacco sensation. For all, however, the thread that bound them was that snuff-taking was, or at least appeared to be, one of the more routine and fundamental acts in their daily lives.","Dr. Johnson was a particularly unique snuff-taker. He was of the kind of tobacco user that had a luxuriance of gesture and a lavishness of supply that would often overflow onto his neck cloth. If there are species of snuff-takers, Dr. Johnson was of the long-armed variety. He stretched forth his arm, as a snuff taking elephant might his trunk, having already pinched the powder from his waistcoat, and shook his head, nose, and snuff all at once. His eyebrows even lifted up to clear space for the onset of the mild tobacco effects. Once finished, he straightened himself, proclaiming victory over the precious moment, and let out a great bah for all onlookers to hear.","Hunt's journal entry published in the Jacksonville Courier describes in great detail an old custom of southern men, imported from the French through London as part of a stream of European cultural influences. The larger narrative here, of tobacco consumption in the South and the world, is the story of the founding of this nation. John Rolfe, leader of the Jamestown settlement, was driven by English investors to make a profit on tobacco. The first shipment of the golden weed arrived in England in 1617 and by 1650, one fourth of English people smoked everyday. Sailors enjoyed tobacco because of the mild high it induced and demand exploded across continental Europe.","Supply raced to catch up and tobacco cultivation expanded outward from Jamestown into Virginia and North Carolina. The New World's economy even used the cash crop as currency and record of debt; Emanuel Driggus, a free black farmer in Myne Owne Ground, once sold a horse for 2000 pounds of tobacco and was fined 475 pounds by the county court in 1672. Small farmers and large planters alike grew tobacco and its lasting impact is in the way it fueled the rise of the plantation agriculture system and African slave trade. Although it would be supplanted by King Cotton as the major cash crop of the South in the 1800's, tobacco consumption, and its manifestation in the custom of snuff-taking, was most influential in the establishment of the early southern economy, its trading partners and local barter markets, and the spread of slavery across the region."],"display_date":"January 29, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-29","locations":[{"id":1324,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2259,"title":"Southern Belles and Ladies\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-10-25","end_date":"1873-11-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" A southern belle was a girl who was expected to grow up into a lady. She was supposed to be fragile and flirtatious while also sexually innocent. She was beautiful but risky to touch, like porcelain. Every southern belle was expected to be up-to-date on the latest fashions, which often proved tricky and expensive because fashion was constantly changing throughout the nineteenth century. A true lady embodied the ideals of the South, and was thus hospitable and graceful. Newspapers often took it upon themselves to update their lady readers on the newest fashion trends. The Natchez Weekly Democrat reported on November 22, 1873, that lady readers will be interested to know that spotted short veils are no longer fashionable. Bracelets are now made to twine around the arm and require no clasp. In the new style of hairdressing, called the Josephine, chignons are entirely abolished. The hair is drawn up from the back of the head and piled on the top in thick coils or braids, and loosely frizzled in front. "," By following the newspapers' reports, women had easy access to the information about the changing fashions, but only the wealthiest of them could actually afford to keep up with them. In some families, being overly concerned with the latest fashion was looked down upon because a southern lady was supposed to solely exist to support her husband, raise their children, and submit to God. The Natchez Weekly Democrat also reported on October 25, 1871, that an unnamed woman declared to her husband that she loved another more than she loved him, and was leaving him for the other man. She intended on taking their five children with them and the next day she took up house with her new lover. This woman's acts were disgraceful to the people who upheld the southern ideal that a woman existed to benefit her husband, because she was clearly not faithful to the man she had married and had five children with. "," Southern women possessed the characteristics of much of what the South is known for. They were supposed to be southern belles, who were pure and untouchable until they were married. They were honorable (or supposed to be) in the sense that they were faithful to their husbands, who in return would defend their honor if it was ever challenged. Their loyalty lay with God and their families, but it was also tacitly expected that they were to keep up with the latest fashions of the time to the best of their ability. The presence of southern women and the graceful air that supposedly surrounded them was not only felt in Mississippi, but throughout the entire South and became one of its defining characteristics.

Some were joking and kidding around while others waited seriously with thoughts of their impending studies for the night. Many of the boys clutched baseball bats, gloves, and catcher's masks in anticipation of baseball practice later that afternoon. On the back of the keepsake photograph, someone had scribbled Cluster Springs High School Baseball Team, over the words Cluster Springs Academy. The photograph dates back to the turn of the century, around 1900, when secondary education began to change in the United States, specifically in the state of Virginia.","A pamphlet entitled <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> published in the beginning of the twentieth century told the story of a Virginia preparatory school located a half a mile from Cluster Springs on the Durham Division of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, approximately six miles from South Boston, Virginia. <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> is a brochure that not only discussed the history of the Academy but also marked the school to potential students and their families. Many pages were devoted to discussing the benefits of the 150 wooded acres, the famous mineral springs, and the mild climate; the mild climate makes it possible for the students to indulge in some form of outdoor sport every week in the year. One page of the pamphlet was a testament to the school's athletics reputation especially in the sport of baseball where the record was one of the best among the preparatory schools in the state. In terms of academics, the pamphlet quoted that without any form of testing or examination 75 percent of students continued in schools of higher education. ","Virginia's education system was beginning to make several changes at the end of the nineteenth century including the growth of the secondary education system as a whole, the inclusion of specific educational requirements, and growth in attendance. For example by 1914, in some Virginia counties, such as Halifax County, there were as many as three public high school districts. At the end of the nineteenth century, there were also lists of recommended textbooks, courses, and subjects for public high schools published by several authors. Another important fact was the growth in attendance in secondary schools. Although the growth was not consistent from 1890 to 1900, the number of pupils increased from 9,124 to 11,736. Even though these were numbers and trends for public schools, the private school enrollment was about the same as the public secondary schools. <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> made the claim that Cluster Springs Academy is an example of evolution in the world of education, and the history of Virginia education proved the claim true."],"display_date":1900,"search_date":"1900-07-02","locations":[{"id":13902,"lat":36.7669669152,"lng":-78.9366405787,"zoom":9,"place":"HALIFAX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2273,"title":"Impromptu Balls: They Could Have Danced All Night \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-01-07","end_date":"1842-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 7, 1842, Bennet Barrow went to town to get supplies in his Cab. When he left the cab, two friends, Amanda and Miss Crab of Tennessee, jumped in it and went off without Bonnets only to return one hour later from a nearby swamp. Amused, Barrow got in, turned the cab around, driving his friends to visit a Mrs. Wade. There he met up with six other friends. After piling his friends into two cabs, the group went off in search of more people. Not finding anyone at home, the group went to Barrow's plantation where they sent for the neighbors, ate dinner, and then danced all night by the Piano & Violin. The next day Barrow refused to let any of his friends leave, insisting they instead rest, nap and pla[y] smut until night when the dancing began again. Barrow hired a violin player and the friends danced until twelve o'clock, when their consciences made them refuse to dance any Longer. But Barrow rejected such politeness, and he instead jokingly punished them for it fasten[ing] the doors 'till near two; his guests played with him, pretending to be upset by blowing out candles, trying to escape through the windows, and doing any thing, but dance until they all went to bed at two in the morning. The third day everyone had Long and weary Looking faces; they were all sad that it was Sunday and that the fun of the past two days was over. The events were recorded in Barrow's diary, in which he wrote that he had never enjoyed [himself] as much as at the sudden and so perfectly free [and] easy and happy visit and dance.","In both Southern and Northern society, formal fashionable calls were made during calling hours during daytime and were made between slight acquaintances or people who were part of one's social circle but with whom one was not especially close, while sociable calls, such as the one at Barrow's plantation, were usually informal occasions between friends and relatives that were made during the day and often extended into the night.","Fashionable calls expressed a society in which a network of people-mostly women whose place was the social sphere-had to be maintained among people who did not necessarily know each other very well or even like each other. Calls were made and returned in order to keep in touch with one's neighbors and community. If a person was called upon, than that person was expected to return that call. Fashionable calls could also be used to demonstrate social class and acceptance. If one was not invited to another's house or did not have one's calls returned, then this could be considered a social slight; a social slight usually meant that one was not accepted into polite society. Social slights were sometimes committed against who did not meet the particular standards of manners that a community might have. For example, a young lady of good family and a wealthy background who was raised in the country might be slighted in a city society whose manners were more sophisticated. People whose families caused scandal were the often the subject of gossip; for example a woman whose husband often became drunk in public would cause societal scandal and censure however high up that family may have previously been socially. Slights were also committed against families-again mainly against women by women-because they were considered to be of a low class family background. A girl who married above her social station, or whose mother or grandmother had done so, could still be censured by the society she married into. These fashionable calls expressed a requirement to maintain a polite society and also served as means to let people know their place in the social hierarchy. ","Informal sociable calls, like the one portrayed in Barrow's diary, were much less complicated and much more fun. These calls were made between people who knew each other well enough to carry on long conversations about mutual interests and friends and who liked spending long periods of time in each other's company. Informal calls usually consisted of parties of close friends and family in a non-threatening, relaxed atmosphere; the main goals of these calls were usually pleasure instead of politeness. Many parties were the last moment results of these informal calls with large collections of people being gathered to dance. Some of these dances were arranged on the day when they took place and others were planned far in advance. For both, musicians would be hired to provide music and people would come from far away to attend. In the North, they also had corn huskings, quilt parties and barn raisings that provided opportunities for friends and family to gather together and enjoy each other's company. ","Calls, house parties, balls and other social get-togethers were important in nineteenth-century society because they allowed people to expand beyond their own domestic space. In the South, these visits were especially important because they allowed planters and their families respites from the loneliness and isolation of their plantations. Social occasions were important because they allowed people a chance to get beyond themselves, to meet their neighbors, feel connections to the community, and to have some fun."],"display_date":"January 7, 1842 - January 9, 1842","search_date":"1842-01-08","locations":[{"id":5781,"lat":31.0257853028,"lng":-91.6912544354,"zoom":9,"place":"WEST FELICIANA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2274,"title":"The Surrender House\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-01-01","end_date":"1893-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Stored deep in the attic was a collection of Virginia and Maryland postcards depicting various different historical sites such as the Arlington House, the University of Virginia, the Mariner's Museum, and Monticello. Important enough that it was stored with the Duke family's personal belongings, one postcard from the late nineteenth century displayed a famous Timothy O'Sullivan photograph taken of the McLean family seated on the steps of their home. The postcard told the story of April 9, 1865, where Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant in the house of Wilmer McLean at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. The two Generals met in a room on the left side of the house and drew up the articles of surrender that marked the end of the War Between the States. The interesting part of the Surrender House history was just beginning as shown by the last line on the back of the postcard - This building was torn down to be rebuilt a St. Louis World's Fair.","The discovery of the postcards in the attic added to the history of the Surrender House. In 1867, the McLean family sold the house and moved to Alexandria, Virginia where Wilmer McLean had been born and built his fortune before marrying the widow Virginia Mason and moving to Appomattox County, Virginia. After transferring hands a few times between the Pascoe and Ragland families, M.E. Dunlap of Niagara Falls, New York, who had lofty plans for the property, eventually bought the house. Originally, his zealous plans were to move the house either to St. Louis as stated in the quote of the postcard or to Chicago for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893.","Instead of hiring New York architects and contractors, Dunlap kept the process local and hired a Lynchburg, Virginia contracting company by the name of Hardy and Hancock Contractors to draw up blueprints of the house in order to have it successfully dismantled, moved, and rebuilt in its new location. In February of 1893, C. Hubbard of Hardy and Hancock Contractors made five blueprints of the building: the basement plan and house section, the front porch cornices and columns, the window and mantle details, the first floor plan, and the second floor plan. Unfortunately, the plans to move the house to the World's Fair never materialized, so Dunlap decided to have the house moved to Washington, D.C. where it would be on permanent display. Dunlap ordered for complete dismantlement of the house before running into a shortage of cash and legal problems. Thus, the house sat boxed in Appomattox County for 50 years where the wood rotted and the bricks crumbled.","Either a member of the Duke family bought the postcard at Craighill and Jones, Inc. in Lynchburg, Virginia or someone - a friend or a relative - sent it to the Duke family. The Craighill and Jones, Inc. label affixed to the postcard remained although there was no address present anywhere on it. At the time the McLean House postcard was printed, Appomattox County residents including the Duke family believed the house would not remain at its current location, and only pictures and postcards would serve as reminders of the house's rich history. The Duke family looked into the past, saw the house as a reminder of a moment in their lives, and realized that the Surrender House was a piece of history not only to within Appomattox County and Virginia but nationally as far as Chicago and St. Louis."],"display_date":1893,"search_date":"1893-07-02","locations":[{"id":13631,"lat":37.3722533013,"lng":-78.8121458288,"zoom":9,"place":"APPOMATTOX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2287,"title":"Nat G.

Hutcheson were the minutes of the L.A. Armistead Camp Confederate Veterans of Mecklenburg County as well as several articles regarding the Camp of Confederate Veterans. One of the articles, Ex-Confederates Meet, was a lengthier article that discussed the application for the charter by the L.A. Armistead Camp of Confederate Veterans to the Grand Camp. Named the L.A. Armistead Camp Mecklenburg County's Camp was in honor of General L.A. Armistead who fell while waving his sword on the heights of Gettysburg. There were many Mecklenburgers in Armistead's Brigade. The initial goal of the Camp was to raise enough money to erect a monument in front of the County Courthouse to pay tribute to the fallen heroes of the Lost Cause.","In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Thomas Ellett, the Adjutant-General Grand Camp C.V. of the Department of Virginia, wrote the Instructions About Forming a Camp of Confederate Veterans. It was a specific outline on the proper way to apply for a charter from the Grand Camp, elect officers, and adopt By-Laws and Order of Business. In the missing portion of the pamphlet there were also the Proceedings of the Grand Camp, Charter and By-Laws of the R.E. Lee Camp, No. 1, C.V., Order of Business, Duties of Officials, Uniform, and Rules of Order. The creation of many other Camps of Confederate Veterans used the specific guidelines such as the L.A. Armistead of Mecklenburg County.","The Camps of Confederate Veterans became popular before the turn of the nineteenth century in the South as a way of honoring the 600,000 Confederate veterans who had fought and died in the Civil War. In Mecklenburg County, most of the companies were in the field by September 1861 and the men in these companies comprised about 10% of the Mecklenburg's white population. These camps held reunions for veterans and their families, erected monuments to honor those who died in the war, and provided a support group for the Southerners who had the war fought in their backyards. Since Reconstruction had not fully rebuilt the South both economically and structurally, Southerners still identified with each other through the Confederate cause. Therefore, instituting these Camps of Confederate Veterans was an attempt to fill the void in Southern identity. As in the cases of Robert E. Lee and L.A. Armistead, Confederate Generals and heroes served as names for the Camps. Mecklenburg County began their Camp in 1983, and it continued to be a success as documented in Nat G.

They first traveled by railroad, then steamboat, until arriving at a point twenty miles down the river from the home they were to visit. It looked as though they had a long row ahead f them. But it turned out that their host had sent slaves to pull the boat along the canal. The slaves were put into harnesses like horses and began to drag the boat, canal-boat style, for the first ten miles of the journey. Lisa worried a little about the slaves working and toiling too hard but soon saw that that it was fine fun for them and that there was nothing they enjoyed more. She then lay back to relax and reflected on the beautiful day upon the bayou, enjoying how black moss hung in festoons from the cypress and oak trees, giving one the sense of being beyond [the] reach of a human being.","Lisa's solitude was short-lived, however. Her brother George decided to take the opportunity of a relaxing day on the bayou to engage in alligator hunting. George actually sho[t] and kill[ed] five alligators, the largest of which measure[d] twelve feet George was thus quite distinguished and applauded by his traveling companions. Lisa wrote to her mother in New York that she wished that her little brother had been there to see the excitement. The boat in which Lisa and her brother traveled down the canal on was most likely a keelboat. Keelboats originally were used to transport goods up and downriver, but in the late eighteenth century, planters began to used keelboats as pleasure crafts in coastal areas of the South. These boats usually had pavilions for the planter and his family and were usually oar-propelled or dragged by slaves. The boats were convenient; they could be used in shallow water because they only drew two to three feet when fully loaded. They were also more maneuverable because of their narrow beam and because they could be poled or hauled.","Hunting for sport was popular with both men and women in the South. Although alligator hunting was mostly confined to the lower coastal regions of the South-places such as South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana-other types of hunting flourished all over the South from Maryland and Virginia to Louisiana. Fashionable, less-serious, hunters, both men and women, usually only hunted fox and deer, while more serious hunters preyed on bears, fowl, rabbits, possums, and wild turkeys. Hunting for sport was usually the game of the upper class in the South. Most hunts were conducted on horseback, riding with hounds. When men went alligator hunting, they went on foot, but still brought with them packs of trained dogs. Throughout the South, slavery made possible this culture of upper-class leisure that Lisa and George enjoyed. According to Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, the quality of life that upper class Southerners enjoyed rested upon the labor of servants. The time that upper-class men and women spent reading, visiting friends, going hunting and on other various leisurely activities depended upon the slaves' performing all of the basic house and field work. Historian Walter Johnson says that slavery enabled a white woman [to be able to] skate lightly across the surface of daily exigency, her own composure unscathed by the messy process required to produce the pleasing tableau of her own life. Johnson also points out that the ability to own enough slaves to have this lifestyle is what distinguished the upper class from the lower classes. To be able to afford enough slaves so that one's wife only had to worry about leisure and gentility was something that marked out the class hierarchy and was something that men of wealth often made a point of telling their friends to emphasize personal wealth, wealth based upon the enslavement of other human beings."],"display_date":"March 22, 1845","search_date":"1845-03-22","locations":[{"id":5544,"lat":29.4255371375,"lng":-90.0017454475,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2302,"title":"Son Writes to His Mother from School in Baltimore\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-10-14","end_date":"1878-10-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shirley, going to school in Baltimore, Maryland, wrote his mother about his life in Baltimore and also reflected on how he wished to take care of her. He talked about how he was in the fourth grade, and depending on his examination grades, he would move to the third, second, and first grades. He then mentioned that he could go on to Baltimore College. He liked this idea but he also quickly stated that he wanted to go to work for her as soon as he could because he did not like the way she was living. Although he talked of what he did in Baltimore (like going to the opera and getting his picture taken), he continuously went back to reflecting on his mother's state and his missing her. He mentioned he felt bad that she would not have firewood to burn that winter and said he felt insignificant. He went on to say that in a few years he will be a man and everything will be okay.","Shirley's concern for his mother expressed in his letter is the result of the economic turmoil due to the just recently ended Reconstruction and the changing roles of women. As historians William Cooper and Thomas E. Terrill explain, the income of southern whites fell with the fall of the Confederacy and recovered at a very slow pace. Because of this, there was less money to spend on education and commonly if money was tight, boys were favored to send off to school. Poor white women had to look for work. Southern ideals, however, called for women to stay away from masculine things like politics and work or else they would corrupt their femininity.","Shirley may have held this idea of womanliness, wanting to come home and help her so she would not be ruined by such masculine endeavors. Shirley may also have simply been concerned with the economic state of his mother. While living the life of luxury and comfort in Baltimore-seeing operas and getting his picture taken-he is also staying in contact with his mother. This dual aspect to his life is seen in his letter, as he switches between telling his mother of his successes and experiences and reassuring her he will bring these luxuries to her one day."],"display_date":"October 14, 1878","search_date":"1878-10-14","locations":[{"id":5933,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2346,"title":"B.F.

Porter was an important individual around Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. Not only was he a practicing lawyer, but he owned a large crop of cotton and produced valuable gin. However, someone apparently had a problem with his extracurricular activities. On February 21, 1842, the Mobile Commercial Register reported that Mr. Porter's gin house, along with his entire cotton crop, went up in flames only a few days before. According to the paper, the fire appeared to have been intentionally set. From this article, it is unclear as to whether Mr. Porter was the victim of an enemy seeking revenge or a dogmatist attempting to make a statement for the temperance movement. What is clear about this time period is a great difference of opinion when it came to alcohol consumption. In the antebellum South, Charles Wilson explains that alcohol was a basic part of life in which isolated farmers, as Mr. Porter may have been, utilized distilling to retard spoiling, reduce bulk, and enhance the marketability of their crops. Even though the temperance movement had begun to gain speed in the nineteenth century, it was not yet able to get a foothold in the South. This was due to the economic circumstances of farmers like Mr. Porter and the perceived link between abolitionism and temperance. In Alabama specifically, the temperance movement took form prior to the Civil War but only strengthened along with the other reform movements during the twentieth century.","Nevertheless, the 8 percent of antebellum southerners who did make temperance pledges were adamant and extreme in their views. Alcoholism brought a great number of dangers to southern society, including violence, economic insecurity, and even suicide. Therefore, the temperance movement was able to build a small base of support despite the customary position of alcohol in society. This small percentage was undoubtedly the most radical of the population, and their extreme views led to extreme action. Unfortunately, Mr. Porter may have been a victim of such action."],"display_date":"February 21, 1842","search_date":"1842-02-21","locations":[{"id":383,"lat":33.2726735133,"lng":-87.5297604234,"zoom":8,"place":"TUSCALOOSA, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2359,"title":"A Typical Monday for Mary Austin Holley\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-02-26","end_date":"1838-02-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In her diary Mary Austin Holley jotted down the events of her afternoon with friends. She enjoyed pleasant conversation as well as the beautiful surroundings. She made note of the impressive collection of books, and in particular the various curiosities displayed throughout the parlor. Holley's friends, Mr. and Mrs. Wharton, boasted all sorts of fascinating relics, once owned by famous figures in Mexican history. Holley wrapped up the account of her delightful afternoon by recognizing Mr. Wharton as a cultured gentleman and Mrs. Wharton as all that a lady should be. ","In the early stages of Texas colonization, most of the colonists were like Holley and the Whartons: ladies and gentlemen from the American South. Being southerners, they brought with them several aspects of southern life and culture. One of these was slavery and the way of life it provided. Domestic slaves took the burdens of household work off of slaveholding ladies, supplying them with an abundance of leisure time. Having free time enabled Holley to receive a thorough education. Her education made her interested in rare editions of books and figures in Mexican history. Holley appreciated the finer things in life and put emphasis on the importance of being a gentleman or lady. ","The ladies of the antebellum South revealed an important aspect of southern class hierarchy. In his book Soul by Soul, Walter Johnson describes the white upper class as a society made by slaves. Wives of slaveholders demonstrated this particularly well because the mark of a gentile lady was the leisure time she had to engage in pleasantries. She could not have this leisure time without the help of domestic servants, thus her slaves made her a lady. These women's husbands also benefited from their wives' leisure time. It became a credit to a man's reputation to have a wife that did not work. Enjoying a charming afternoon, like Holley, became a mark of gentility and wealth, and it was slavery that made it possible."],"display_date":"February 26, 1838","search_date":"1838-02-26","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2388,"title":"Diversity in the Houston Saturday Evening Market\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As the sun lay low in the evening sky, the Saturday market in Houston sprang to life with a diverse and vivid collection of venders and products. Lee Hardy described how the area was full of venders alone representing every nationality, Americans being far in the minority. Open from 5 PM to 10 PM in the summer, here German traders, who had often traveled more than twenty miles to be present, set up stands with their fresh produce. A negro market gardener offered turkeys, some ready to cook and others still alive. Hardy walked by a Chinese peddler, who displayed his hand-made creations including fans, teapots and brushes in front of him, while German and Irish women patrolled the rows of vegetable stands. Though the meat market was largely dominated by German butchers, along with a few French and Americans, Italian vendors were also present selling wild game such as squirrels, partridges and prairie-chickens. Black, white, brown, and yellow-- negroes, Americans, Mongolians, Irish, Dutch, French, Germans, Italians, and Spanish-- they are all there, laughing, talking, quarrelling, gesticulating, bargaining, gossiping, staring, keeping appointments and making new ones, being proper or improper, polite or rude, as the case may be, Hardy noted.","In the years leading up to and following the Civil War, Houston, like many cities throughout the South and the nation, experienced a large influx of immigrants. As a consequence, it acquired an increasingly diverse population. Individuals came from all over Europe due to various push and pull factors, including the search for land, freedom and the promise of a better life. Texas saw its population grow 173 percent between the years of 1870 and 1890; this was largely due to a migration of fellow southerners searching for relief from the ruin of other southern states coupled with German immigrants arriving in large numbers. As word spread in Europe of the promising land of the West, Germans quickly became one of the largest ethnic groups in Texas; some estimate that during the 1800s, the populations of Galveston and San Antonio were anywhere from one-third to one-half German.","Cities, especially those in the North, were receiving the bulk of immigrants in the 1890s and early 1900s; however, the crowded conditions, competitive job markets, and even government plans were often incentives for people to move out into more rural areas. Texas saw its population of German and Russian Jewish residents escalate greatly in the early 1900s due to the Galveston Immigration Plan. This program aimed to relieve the crowded conditions in the Jewish ghettos in cities by sending newly-arrived immigrants to be resettled in rural western areas and other interior states. In addition to Europeans, a new wave of Chinese immigrants came to the United States and the West in particular during this time period to work on railroad construction projects.","Post-war southern cities also saw a flood of newly-freed black citizens coming in off of the plantations in neighboring counties. While this caused the actual numbers of black residents to increase in many cities, Texas saw the amount of black residents as a proportion of its population actually decrease as they could not keep up with the rapid influx of white immigrants. Yet, despite the implementation of segregation laws and various forms of discrimination and racism, cities continued to see an increase in their black populations; harsh climate conditions and economic instability seen in the agricultural realm at the end of the 1800s drove people into the cities to find work and augmented the population swell, especially when work became available in the railroad and lumber industries. Despite its reputation as being a lily-white South, the region was actually the site of much diversity and many members of the various groups coexisted in a peaceful, mutually beneficial manner."],"display_date":1890,"search_date":"1890-07-02","locations":[{"id":12839,"lat":29.6873298033,"lng":-94.957827752,"zoom":9,"place":"HARRIS, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2411,"title":"Capturing the Moment\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-12-12","end_date":"1857-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a private letter to her granddaughter, an unnamed woman described a simple scene with such poignant detail that an ordinary moment in history became remarkably touching on paper.

Replete with music fanfares, banners, and daily crowds of over 4,000 people, North Carolina inaugurated its first-ever State Fair in Raleigh on Tuesday, October 18, 1853. Local newspapers hailed the watershed event as a triumph. For North Carolinians, it was as much a matter of state pride as agricultural interest. For years neighboring states had ridiculed North Carolina for its undeveloped agricultural infrastructure. Farmers, merchants, mechanics, entrepreneurs, artists and assorted people converged on the state capital to display and observe livestock, minerals, improved agricultural implements, carriages, and many other exhibitions of North Carolina enterprise. Auctions were held for livestock and implements. The <em>Raleigh Register</em> stated that it had never gloried more in the fact that we were a citizen of North Carolina, than when, on the opening of this Fair, we beheld the evidences of a greatness, prosperity, and progress... North Carolinians congratulated themselves not only with pride in their state's current achievements, but also with the anticipation of progress into a more enlightened future."," The Honorable A.W. Venable imbued the event with its sense of occasion in a well-received address to a large crowd. He began by placing arduous agricultural efforts in the context of Adam's fall from innocence in the Book of Genesis. He further connected farming to a daily awareness of an overruling Providence on whom farmers relied for their produce to grow. The core of the speech addressed the phenomenon of soil depletion and poor land management. In harsh terms, he challenged North Carolinian farmers to take responsibility for replenishing farmland and investing in the quality of their soil. Venable spoke of a growing change in this respect that would move farmers away from unsustainable practices which left base deserts of farms. The process of clearing, exhausting, and abandoning land was denounced. In another challenge to farmers, Venable requested their support for cheap methods of interstate transport that would allow better utilization of North Carolina's resources. "," North Carolina had been pejoratively called the Ireland of America in the earlier nineteenth century as a result of its agricultural under-development. Lacking many basic internal improvements like canals and good roads, farmers devoted considerable portions of their income to merely freighting their produce to markets. People along the coast received goods from Maryland by water less expensively than from the interior of their own state. Furthermore, the soil of the Old South had been depleted by monoculture nutrient-intensive cash crops with little replenishing fertilizer. Avery Craven deems the efforts of Venable's contemporaries as unsuccessful in the long-run. Despite Venable's exhortations, the optimal balance between immediate agricultural profits and soil conservation seems never to have been struck. While North Carolina's first State Fair offered an encouraging sense of economic development, it may not have been as effective in revolutionizing entrenched practices."],"display_date":"October 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-10-18","locations":[{"id":9843,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2463,"title":"Thanksgiving Day\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-11-06","end_date":"1886-11-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The November 6, 1886, edition of the <em>Goodson Gazette</em> of the Virginia Institute for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind ran the announcement by President Grover Cleveland who declared Thursday, November 25 as a day of thanksgiving and prayer.

Two weeks later, the paper ran Governor Fitzhugh Lee's follow-up announcement that concurred with the President's request. Lee told the families in Virginia to render thanks to Almighty God.

This way, the people could view Cleveland as a president who cared for his citizens and the union of the country. He also affirmed Christian ideas in the nation.

People enjoyed a fair opportunity of marking his flight, and of gazing for near an hour, upon the interesting and sublime spectacle. Of the thousands in attendance, it is believed that famous poet and author, Edgar Allen Poe saw Mr. Mills's balloon ascension.   Doug Boulter believes that Poe likely witnessed the launch because his uncle, Henry Herring, built an amphitheater for the crowds to view the ascension of Mr. Mills.  Much of Poes family lived in Baltimore, the city in which Poe spent the later years of his life. Mr. Mills's balloon ascension shows that Baltimore was a city of scientific pursuit and leisure activity.  Mr. Mills flew that day for his own scientific interest and pleasure.

Such interest spread to neighboring cities such as Philadelphia, where Mills ascended in one of the most beautiful balloon ascensions which we have ever witnessed.

Passing by a young lady on the street one fine afternoon, an elderly Alabama politician caught an eyeful. Was she wearing an article of male clothing? The <em>Greeneville Advocate</em> documented the growing women's fashion trend with a sense of urgency: THE BLOOMER IN ALABAMA. The article informed the readership of the so-called Alabama Bill in the December 9, 1896 edition of the Advocate. An unnamed, yet old-fashioned member of the Alabama legislature had drafted the bill in hopes that immediate action would end the growing ladies' fashion trend du jour. The operational definition of bloomer was of particular concern at the time. The Alabama Bill leaves no doubt that it aims at that article especially, and yet a general consensus as to the bloomers' rightful wearer did not exist. Was it, in fact, an article of male clothing or simply inappropriate women's apparel? The Alabama legislator knew for sure that a woman wearing an article of male clothing violated Biblical code and quoted Deuteronomy accordingly: The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to the man; neither the shall a man put on a woman's garment; for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord. "," The mounting concern over the bloomer in Alabama had its root in southern conservatism. Fashion in the South mirrored the southern way of life and changed accordingly to reflect the times. During the antebellum years fashion helped preserve southern values in a time of rapid change and national fragmentation. In a time of southern instability during the Civil War, women played an important role maintaining southern tradition through fashion. The southern woman's clothing became tighter, heavier, and longer in attempts to idealize her heightened morals and purity. Women in both Alabama and the larger Southern culture were seen as a paragon of chastity, piety, and virtue. They were expected to be submissive in all respects to their husbands and lead quiet lives raising the children of the South. However, the arrival of the bloomer in Alabama in the late 1890s brought a change to southern fashion. Social historian Jeanette Lauer notes, The decades following the Civil War witnessed a growing democratization in southern fashion. According to Lauer, this democratization of fashion mitigated against the presumed uniqueness of the southern way of life... In The final decades of the nineteenth century and continuing throughout the twentieth centuries, southern fashion increasingly reflected national trends. The bloomer provides one example of a national phenomenon that extended south and into Alabama. "," The bloomer in Alabama signified societal change in the South. In his appeal to Biblical codes, the old-fashioned Alabama legislator demonstrated his staunch southern conservatism. However, by the late nineteenth century, the link between conservative values and accordingly conservative fashion had significantly weakened. On the other hand, perhaps only southern women felt relief in casting aside the shackles of fashion. After all, for decades women fell prey to the oppressive conservative southern values, which in turn dictated fashion. The unbearable weight of hoop skirts, the excruciating pain of corsets, and the insufferable summer days spent in layered petticoats all contributed to the popularity of the bloomer. The bloomer offered a chance for freedom at the end of an era characterized by male domination. At the end of the nineteenth century, fashion proved a juxtaposition between traditional male conservatism and a new female liberalism.

Using the term, planter aristocracy James and Dorothy Volo explored elite antebellum planters and their perceptions of heritage and prestige. According to the Volos', Americans prized every connection to European nobility and believed that old American families should receive the same prestige as those of European families. "," The wealthy antebellum planters saw themselves and their class as the natural leaders of the community. Southern politics reached a balance by the early nineteenth century when the public order resided on the rule of the elite. Planters invented pseudo mythologies about the blue blood of wealthy southern families. According to the historian Richard Bushman, those seeking to bring European aristocracy into their blood line named their children after English Monarchs, in hopes of securing a better future, increase marriage prospects, and reflecting an image of wealth for their children. When the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em> announced the importation of dried food from Europe, wealthy elites sought to connect themselves to their imaginary noble pasts. The newspaper reported that in Market Bridge, Richmond dry goods from France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and India arrived. Over 150 packages of goods from the country were to be held in the safe storage of the city.

Iron ore became the staple of the area and was crucial in the development of a regional transportation center. The reliance on tobacco, Anne Arundel's traditional major cash crop, lessened through the nineteenth century allowing for blacksmithing to flourish in the area. Despite the high economic profitability of iron ore in the area, blacksmithing was quite a dangerous job. The <em>Pittsburg Sun</em> reported that a spontaneous explosion occurred in a blacksmith shop in Anne Arundel, Maryland that killed one and injured two others in 1844. Auilla Wilmouth, a mere bystander, died instantly in an explosion that involved a canister of powder that was inconspicuously held. "," The craft of blacksmithing, in spite of its dangers, exemplified the traditional Southern values of family and community. Small farmers and plantation owners depended on the works of the blacksmith to create gates, grave markers and kitchen instruments, and other functional objects of daily life. According to the historians Charles Wilson and William Ferris, the dependency of the farmer and the blacksmith created a sense of interconnectedness and a bond. The South's slow transition towards industrialization also helped continue the legacy of blacksmithing in the South and in Maryland despite hazardous accidents, such as the death of Auilla Wilmouth.

More cotton and more efficient technology meant larger production and more variety for shoppers. Clothes were expressive and a status show to the public. The expansion of the railroads also made more in style clothing more readily accessible to people from all areas of the nation. While style began to spread across the nation- the South was not always the most up to date. A letter from student Kathleen Boone Samuels to her mother, Eliza Ann Van Noort Boone, in September of 1860 described her distaste in her wardrobe. She complained of having to wear the same dress for weeks at a time and her shoes not being able to make it through the winter because the soles were so terribly bare. Her concern for her attire is like that of many college age females today. Kathleen wanted her clothing to reflect her. She wanted to be accepted and considered as worldly and well off as her fellow classmates. She begged and pleaded to her mother for another pair of shoes for the winter, reasoning that to resole her current ones would cost just as much. Kathleen was excited that she had finally realized the importance of having an education and was proud that she actively pursued it, but she still longed for more material things like the five dollar red dress. Fashion was not only a means of expression but often showcased one's status in society.","Ayers also quoted Octave Thanet of Arkansas, who once said I used to wonder what became of the unsuccessful adventures in fashions of head gear or wraps, but now I understand. They have gone South Because high fashion's center was in the North, primarily in New York City, updates slowly trickled down, leaving the South often way behind. Ayers also wrote about a girl who traveled from Broom Corn Bottom, Arkansas wearing hand-me-downs from a wealthy woman that lived in her county. They dresses were purchased in New York however as the train stopped at each station, she felt her attire gradually becoming outdated with each successive mile. Everyone she saw was wearing newer and more elegant dresses than she. While still trying to keep up with the times, it was nearly impossible for women of the plantations of the South. ","Most of the fashion found in the South was ill-assorted millinery and over trimmed dresses, laboriously made in the vain effort to adopt the NY fashion plates to the backwoods of VA. Kathleen in the letter to her mother wrote of the high necked dress cut large enough for Aunt Ann and that the lining of her dress fits but the waist is too long. Dresses were often passed down from mother to daughter to cut down on cost. Fashion was not yet an art at this time. While it was beginning to expand- it had not yet developed into the modern mega market of today. ","The railroad facilitated the spread of fashion trends; they carried the commodity of fashion as surely as it carried flour and cotton- though fashion often seemed more perishable. Fashion is ever changing and the South fought to keep up just as they did with industrialization. However, better production meant that people owned more clothes because they were cheaper to make. Hired washer-women's work load increased ten-fold because of the affordable cotton. Trade did eventually evolve into specialization. Stores used to carry everything from cooking ware to satins and silks, but now with more accessible trade, businesses began to sell one category of goods more efficiently. Fashion was fun for those who could financially enjoy it. Clothes were used as another means of power and authority to those who were able to possess it."],"display_date":"September 24, 1860","search_date":"1860-09-24","locations":[{"id":14622,"lat":39.0515239409,"lng":-79.0100149991,"zoom":9,"place":"HARDY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2631,"title":"George Learns to Read\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1815-01-01","end_date":"1815-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Growing up as a slave child, George was fond of hearing people read, but as poor slave, he had little or no thought or aspiration of ever being able to read or spell one word or sentence in any book.

Soon afterwards, he acquired old parts of spelling books, which he mastered with but little difficulty. His brother, excited by this, tried to learn as well, as well as some friends. George was smarter than his brother, and he became a far better reader than he; every Sunday during the year, he would go off by himself and would stammer over the dim syllables in his spelling book, sometimes a piece of one, and then of another. He would scarcely spare the time to return to ordinary meals, being so engaged with the book. Absorbed in his book at night, his face was in a constant state of perspiration, as he had to sit, sweating and smoking, over a bark or brush light, almost exhausted by the heat of the fire and almost suffocated with smoke.

However, George Horton is one of many slaves reported by historian Janet Cornelius to have learned to read. According to her, anti-literacy laws were rarely enforced, and most white Southern slaves were indifferent to the issue of slave literacy. In fact, by permitting slaves to read the Bible and thus providing them a path to salvation, many slave owners may have assuaged their consciences about the harsh ways in which they treated their human properties. Reading and education helped make the slaves feel less like property and more like a human being, and it was the one thing that George could look forward to throughout the week: the chance to sit and learn to read."],"display_date":1815,"search_date":"1815-07-02","locations":[{"id":9326,"lat":35.6998667026,"lng":-79.2543203263,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2636,"title":"Orphaned to Cloud Nine\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-11-08","end_date":"1865-11-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["November 8, 1865, Miss Mary West Jenkins wed Dr. John F. Boynton in a hot air balloon above the clouds. The bride was an orphan, born in Northampton County, Virginia, and adopted by Mrs. J.L. West of St. Louis as an infant. With over 6,000 spectators present, the bridal party left the Fifth Avenue Hotel for Central Park. His sister and the owner of the balloon accompanied the young bride and her fiance for the ceremony. They floated away from the Park, exchanging vows and signing the marriage contract while ballooning through the sky. Such a fairy tale wedding made reality for a young girl who once had no hopes for such a comfortable future. Social status was determined in large part by family and as an orphan she was left in the cold. She had little hope for education, medical care, and would have most likely been forced to work in a factory to support herself even as a teen. She was so lucky to avoid all of that. ","During the years preceding the war, slavery continued to fade away and forced by low profitability of small scale farming, many men were forced to find other means of work. Often these farmers could not produce enough substantial crops to feed their families, much less enough to commercially sell at market. Livestock also required larger treks of land to sustain profitability. Fishing and hunting were often alternate ways that the poor obtained food. Economic expansion created a great struggle between the classes. As lumbering, steel, and iron industries emerged, employers began to look past racial lines, hiring whites and blacks as equals. Many men who saw their skin color as the only valuable asset they possessed were stripped of their pride when forced to work side by side with newly freed African Americans. ","Occupation, residence, religious affiliation, and such too often determined much of one's societal value. The poor worked for minimal wages while the socially elite could afford luxuries such as Mary West's wedding dress made of the richest of poplin, trimmed with rich velvet, with a silk hat and gloves to match. Wealthy southern aristocracy shared many of the same privileges as those of the north, but often gaining their wealth by use of slaves. Many owned plantations, but other chose to invest in industrial endeavors. The Duke and Winston families prospered from the tobacco market in North Carolina and Mary Ann Todd, wife of Abraham Lincoln was from a Kentucky family that made its money from banking. Southern wealth was no longer the result of solely slave labor.","Mary West's marriage to Dr. John Boynton was certainly one of exceptional status. They were both highly educated. She attended Monticello Seminary in Illinois and was quite talented in music and drawing. John graduated from a medical institution and was well known for his lectures in geology. He also at one time held government office. Their wedding was elegant and very original even by today's standards. Her dress was rose in color and the hot air balloon was adorned with lace curtains and tassels in the colors of the American flag. After landing at sunset, they took a train back to the Fifth Avenue Hotel to share their first night as husband and wife. Mary West was fortunately raised by a loving mother that was more than able to give her all the comforts that she would have never experienced as an orphan on the eastern shore of Virginia. While Mary West's economic prosperity did not make her happiness, it was far more promising than the life that she was born into.

Palfrey included the memorial poem in his plantation diary.The poem contrasts the North and the South, the robings of glory (the North) and the gloom of defeat (the South), and the dead and the living.Images of death and the grave beneath the sod and the dew run throughout.The poem also paints the vivid, gory picture of warfare, describing the flow of inland river where the iron fleets had once traversed and the grass beneath which soldiers lie in their graves.The rivers are no longer sullied by the red flow of soldiers' blood, and now flowers bloom around the scenes of battle.The poem shows life after war: it transitions from the gloom of defeat into a sunny spring day full of blossoms blossoming for all.While the seasons change and the weather varies, the Love and tears for the Blue, Tears and love for the Grey remain."," The poem memorializes the soldiers who fought and died for both sides; sentimental poems remember these fallen heroes.Yet, The Blue and the Grey challenges the pointlessness of the war itself, probing, Sadly, but no with upbraiding, The generous deed was done, In the storm of the years are fading, No braves battle was won.To Finch, little honor came from the Civil War, merely death for soldiers fighting for their causes.The poem paradoxically and simultaneously eulogizes and glorifies the Civil War in its pointless destruction and its grandiose battles. In memoriam of these soldiers of both the Union and Confederate armies, Finch paints a picture of common loss, equal splendor, and the remembrance of soldiers by visiting their graves."," Finch's poem was written to honor the universality of mourning in the North and South in the years preceding the war's end.Through the acknowledgment of mutual sympathies, he epitomized the new national tradition of memorializing the soldiers.According to David W. Blight, the poem was published in<em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> in Boston, and was very popular. Recitals of the poem continued for years to come at Decoration Days and Blue-Gray reunions.At these events, men and especially women commemorated the lost soldiers by visiting and decorating gravesites, convening at graveyards, and holding communal memorial services to honor those who fought for either side.Thepoem reflects the emerging reunionism that these events created.By 1866, southerners had founded memorial associations, with a majority of their constituents being women.These Memorial Days, described in detail by Blight, grew in popularity, and the North soon had their own."," Memorialization intertwined with civic life.Blight reveals that the memorial days were a means of coping with Reconstruction and its debilitating consequences on the South.In a different way, memorial days were a small tie to the ideals white southerners had been forced to desert in their defeat and in Reconstruction.Not only had slavery ceased to exist, but also the Confederacy, their nation of four years, faded with Robert E. Lee's 1865 surrender.According to Charles Vincent, the end of the war saw the end of the world as they knew it.Demoralization and social dislocation encompassed many white southerners' post-war lives.Some southerners still held on to their unique southern identity.Blight narrates that in John A. Bilmer claimed, The world had <em>conceded</em> to Southern courage, Southern devotion, Southern skills, and Southern power, as displayed in that war.Southern citizens still lived under the reign of Reconstruction and felt the aftermath and destruction caused by the war.Memorializing dead Rebel soldiers was a way of channeling this grief into a positive source, visiting the graveyards and battlefields in order to move forward, like Finch challenges his readers."," The North, too, began eulogizing the dead Union soldiers in much the same way.According to Blight, in May 1868 and 1869, General John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, asked for all Union veterans to honor the dead soldiers by conducting ceremonies and visiting gravesites.Northern memorials grew to encapsulate fallen southerners as well as black and Union soldiers.Finch's poem was a stepping stone to a reunified nation.","--J.R."],"display_date":"September 14, 1867 - December 31, 1873","search_date":"1870-11-06","locations":[{"id":5519,"lat":32.1808059275,"lng":-91.7158468561,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2725,"title":"Taxes and Their Uses\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-01","end_date":"1895-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" In 1895 Mr. Thomas Brown paid his taxes to S.B.

Taxes were based on every one hundred dollars worth of property. For example, it was thirty cents for state tax, ten cents for state school tax, and fifteen cents for road tax. Mr. Thomas Brown had 945 dollars worth of property, so he paid thirteen dollars in state tax, 3.97 dollars in state school tax, and 5.83 dollars in road tax. The government collected these taxes to pay for education, improvements in the town, and other public expenditures. Even with these taxes, Virginia was deeply in debt. "," The decade before the 1890s, Virginia pushed itself continuously further into debt as the Conservative party refused to stray from the Funding Act, even in spite of the evil name attached to the origins of the Funding Act, according to C.

In the South, the public schools were 1.5 million dollars in debt, which forced many of them not to reopen the following years. By 1890, the monetary expenditure per student had slowly increased to 81 percent from 59.5 percent in 1871. The money expended augmented to about 97 cents, an increase for the South, but was still less than the 2.24 dollars for the country as a whole.

McConnell, 647 black men chose to enlist in the First Arkansas Infantry and their Union patriotism is evident in this song.Black soldiers fought in the same war, and they deserved the same respect.The Song of the First Arkansas recognizes their patriotism, bravery, and desire to end slavery in order to attain rights and equality in their nation."," The enslaved people were eager to end slavery, recognizing that the myth of the patriarchy of slaveholders was false.The song illustrates how incorrect the pro-slavery argument that slaves benefited the most from slavery.The lyrics show white slaveholders' oppression of black emancipation, describing When we heard de proclamation, massa hush it as he will.Yet, these black soldiers took the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 literally and wanted to fight to emancipate the slaves of all the southern slaveholding states.According to McConnell, songs in the Civil War evoked enthusiasm and motivated soldiers to fight.The black soldiers remembered the oppression of their fellow blacks and had even more reason to stand up for the abolitionist cause.According to John O. Allen and Clayton E. Jewett, Arkansas was a state full of both Confederate and Union sympathies.It was, thus, not uncommon to see many blacks, as well as whites, eagerly fighting for the Union army and against their fellow statesmen of the Confederacy.Along the border South, dissension was common."," According to Mary Frances Berry, free and enslaved blacks were not allowed to enlist for the Union Army prior to 1863.Berry states that from 1863 to the end of the Civil War, black troops were heavily recruited and fought courageously.Berry points out that in May 1863, the Special Colored Troops Division was created within the War Department to recruit black soldiers.Berry describes that black troops, however, faced greater risks than white soldiers, as Confederate troops vowed to enslave captured blacks or to kill black soldiers and their officers even if they surrendered.While the First Arkansas Colored Regiment praised Lincoln's proclamation, these soldiers were at risk for their bold participation in battles.Berry notes that black enlistment numbers continued to rise, and Lincoln even commented that if enough blacks enlisted the Union would soon close the contest.Black soldiers, like those in this Arkansas regime, influenced the outcome of the Civil War in a large and symbolic way.Their sheer numbers and dedication to the cause of emancipation improved morale.Symbolically, however, these black soldiers not only sang of their freedom, they fought for their liberty and attained hard-earned respect.","--J.R."],"display_date":"1863 - 1865","search_date":"1864-07-01","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2737,"title":"Mollie Netherland&#39;s Death\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-09-20","end_date":"1872-09-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the afternoon of September 20, 1872, Mollie Netherland, a 22-year-old woman from Hawkins County, Tennessee, rode out from the town of Rogersville with a gentleman friend.

While Netherland managed to cling to the saddle for almost a mile, she was eventually thrown off and instantly killed. An article in the Rogersville, Tennessee, Weekly Reporter stated that Netherland's parents and siblings were devastated by her death, but were hopeful in the belief that Netherland had passed into Heaven because of her Christian beliefs. The article claimed that Netherland was prepared to meet her Lord and that she stood at Heaven's gate, waiting to greet her family and friends when they joined her.

In addition, Netherland's death displays how southern communities depended upon religion for emotional comfort and stability.

The two ladies were invited to spend the night at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Nugent, but declined the offer because the women did not want to inconvenience the family because the Nugents were already hosting many other guests. The women also wanted to travel with their three male friends in order to find a place for them to stay together. After the incident, a citizen of Church Hill circulated a rumor that the women declined the Nugents' hospitable offer because couple lived in a log cabin. A lengthy article ran in the <em>Rogersville Press and Times</em> denouncing the man who spread the rumor and calling him a noodlehead with the innate proclivity to tell lies. The <em>Press and Times</em> defended the women's character, stating that they would never spurn a kindness and then speak ill of those who offered it. The women told the newspaper that Mrs. Nugent's hospitality was the primary subject of their conversation after leaving her home, stating that she was extremely kind and generous.","The supposed insult of a community woman launched a scandal in Hawkins  County, pitting the communities of Church Hill and St. Clair against each other, and prompting a four-column article in the Rogersville newspaper. Thus, the conflict seriously impacted upon the communities in Hawkins  County. The newspaper emphasized that the Church Hill community was an honorable community with good citizens, but argued that the community was beset by the presence of one citizen who spread deceitful rumors about the St. Clair women. The article suggested that many attacks and accusations occurred between the communities, as the conflict set the citizens of St. Clair against the citizens of Church Hill. ","The conflict centered around the supposed violation of female dignity and propriety. The article protected both the respectable and high toned women of St. Clair and the kind lady of Church Hill, Mrs. Nugent. This protection of female dignity supports historian James C. Cobb's argument that white womanhood was a symbolic assertion of white southern manhood in the late nineteenth century. According to Cobb, men sustained their own dignity and manhood by protecting female dignity. Cobb argues that this symbolic protection of dignity stems from the southern man's failure to protect women during the Civil War, leading them to ardently protect female dignity in response to their failure. The newspaper article sought to protect the honor and dignity of the females involved in the conflict, while deriding the honor of the male who spread the rumors against the women's character.

McDowell's plow struck the side of a heavy object and he dug through the ground to discover a burnt clay sepulchre. He pulled a small portion of an arm out of the dirt and waited for a scientist to properly disinter the entire sepulchre. The sepulchre was a long slab, almost seven feet long and four feet wide and the underside held the complete cast of a human body. McDowell surmised that a people group in the distant past had buried the sepulchres in shallow graves, covered the bodies with clay, and piled wood upon them to consume them with fire. As a result, the burnt clay sepulchres became hardened slabs. McDowell found several similar sepulchres several years earlier when he first farmed his land in Macon  County, but he destroyed the relics through plowing his field. Initially, no Native American scholars trusted the authenticity of McDowell's discovery, as they did not believe Native Americans buried their dead in such a manner. Nevertheless, McDowell's discovery of the sepulchres in 1872 proved the validity of his find. ","McDowell acquired his Macon County land in 1821 after Cherokee Indian communities abandoned the region due to white American expansionism. In a letter to the Scientific American, McDowell emphasized the pleasure he experienced when he first acquired his own land, expressing the spirit of romance he felt when pioneering his small farm. McDowell greatly benefited from the removal of the Cherokee natives from North   Carolina and expressed great interest in their practices.","Historian Steven Conn argues that mid to late nineteenth-century historians developed interest in the study of prehistory and formed the belief that Native Americans were living examples of prehistory. The academic scholarship in late nineteenth-century America began to treat Native Americans as objects of anthropological science. However, the late nineteenth-century historical movement concurrently served to write Native Americans out of the romantic narrative of American history. Thus, Native Americans were treasured for their ability to provide glimpses into the deep American past and were simultaneously removed from the American historical future because of their inability to fit into the white majority's view of American identity. McDowell's story supports Conn's view of the dichotomous treatment of Native Americans. McDowell prized the importance of the Indian sepulchres he discovered, and yet, felt blessed by the land he acquired from the Cherokees' migration in the early eighteenth century. McDowell failed to recognize the dichotomy that existed between his passion for ancient Indian artifacts and the personal benefits he obtained through the oppression of Native Americans."],"display_date":"June 16, 1872","search_date":"1872-06-16","locations":[{"id":9598,"lat":35.237570606,"lng":-83.4949345538,"zoom":9,"place":"MACON, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2773,"title":"First Annual Report Issued on the State Industrial and Normal School for Women\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-12-20","end_date":"1892-12-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The North Carolina State Normal and Industrial School for Women in Greensboro, N.C. had been open for four months when President Charles D. McIvers wrote the college's first annual report to the Board of Directors on December 20, 1892. In this document, he discussed the institution's goals, claiming that the main objective was to prepare women for positions in the house, business office, and most importantly, the school room. McIvers then commented on various aspects of the institution, writing about how pleased he was with the multiple economic demographics represented in the first class. He also explained his philosophies on discipline and administration, believing that the female students should be treated as a self-governing body and made responsible for maintaining and upholding various rules such as curfew and study hours. He believed it had been working very well, and was delighted with the outcome. McIvers then discussed the role of religion in the institution, and mentioned that several women have organized a Young Women's Christian Association, and others attend a Bible class once a week. He ended the letter listing various items that the college needed, and suggested that he and the Board of Directors make an appeal to the General Assembly to help finance these objects. ","Charles McIver was part of a large educational reform movement that began in the 1880's when he and his college friends Edwin Alderman and James Yadkin united in their efforts to lead region-wide school reform. As they campaigned for improvements in the quality and number of schools in North Carolina, they also pushed heavily for the establishment of higher educational institutions for women. In 1891, McIver and his supporters joined forces with the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), and a smaller group called the King's Daughters to crusade for a vocational school for white women. It was a success, and the State Normal and Industrial School was built in 1892. Many women who composed the first class of 223 students the first year the institution opened had little economic means, and 25 percent of them were orphans or daughters of widows who were pursuing jobs in order to support themselves or those closest to them. ","While some parents were reluctant to part with their daughters, historian James Lelouids claims that many encouraged them to attend the State Normal and Industrial School.

She noted that the the gentlemen here are very polite and offer their horses and attendance to the women. However, Mary did not develop as fond of an opinion for Warrenton's women.  She expressed a specific dislike for a young woman by the name of Clara, whose social conduct she perceived as being distasteful, not only to herself but to others as well. At the first of two dances Mary attended while visiting, Clara, in one of her mischievous acts, put her head out an open window and mingled her 'snorings' with the sweet sounds of twilight dews.  To this, she said the gentlemen at the party burst out laughing and retreated to another room soon after.  As a visitor, she hoped that the gentlemen would not relate Clara's poor conduct to her. Mary concluded that Clara was as wild as an untamed deer and would hesitate at nothing for attention. Mary's account of Warrenton's social life only gives a glimpse at what Virginia social life was like at the time, though it does show that strict standards of social conduct were held.  While Mary's perceptions of Warrenton's men go along with the longstanding stereotype of the 'Virginia Gentlemen', her comments about Clara do not portray the stereotypical 'southern belle'. Clara irritated the social order, which is why Mary was so aware of her conduct and the men left the room shortly thereafter. In the antebellum South, women's actions were evaluated according to unique standards for each class, race, and gender.  Being that Mary and the others at the party were probably all within the same social class they would have had similar social standards.  When Clara did not adhere to these standards a conflict arose between her and the others, who were abiding to them. Clara's conduct could also be attributed to an unwillingness to conform to the rules of society, rather than a lack of social prowess.

The Michigan fields are being heavily drawn upon, while the crop in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin is eminently encouraging, thus relieving fears of an ice shortage. This was especially good news for Mr. Beasly of Crystal Springs, Mississippi, who ten years earlier had build an ice-house in his town in order to supply his neighbors with ice. Beasly had recognized that the ice trade was not only extremely important to warmer climate areas, such as Mississippi and much of the South, but also could be very profitable.","By the 1800s, of ice harvesting had been around for centuries. According to world-renown ice-historian Mariana Gosnell, the so-called ice craze really started in Boston, when a man named Frederick Tudor, in the manner of a drug pusher, set out [in 1805] to create a taste for cold that would get customers hooked. Over the next few decades, Tudor and his foreman Nathaniel Wyeth succeeded in refining the mass cultivation and shipping processes of ice. Harvesting the ice from the fields, which were, in fact, very, very much more than frozen over lakes and ponds, became an intricate and precisely designed process. According to Gosnell, once a thick layer of ice formed over a field, it would be scraped clean, shined, and then carved into a checker pattern of large ice blocks with a single bladed plow. Using saws the blocks were cut free and then, using large pike poles, floated through a carved out channel to a collection area. Although one might think this process would eventually dry out the lake or pond being used, the process apparently removed from a 400-square-foot ice field...each year [an amount of water that is] less than the total amount of water that evaporates from the surface of the very same lake during a single hot summer day. Much less. ","Thus, despite the ice machine's invention as early as 1850 and emergence of ice plants, neither of which were in widespread usage (religious skepticism being one of the reasons against), Tudor and others that had caught on began to sell ice in massive quantities literally all over the world. In fact, according to Gosnell, for years [in the nineteenth century] ice was America's second-biggest crop by weight to be transported by trains and ships, with the first being cotton. Much of that weight undoubtedly went through the South, not only for the preservation of foods, but also because no self respecting Southerner would drink his bourbon warm or her Dom Perignon above the temperature of 38 degrees Farenheit, excepting, perhaps, Jill Masterson.","Upon receiving a shipment of ice, a southern city or town would store it in pits, caves, or trenches underground; in cavities mostly underground but with roofs, or entry structures above ground; or entirely above ground, in insulated houses. Judging by the blurb in the Crystal Springs Monitor, Mr. Beasly's construction was most likely the latter, and was probably painted white to reflect sunlight and to make it look more like an igloo. Between its outer and inner walls there would be some type of insulation, be it tanners, bark, charcoal, sawdust, hay, straw, [or] shavings. With the proper construction, Beasly would be able to maintain approximately 70-90 percent of his stored ice, sometimes for many years. Nevertheless, as the 1890 Clarion Ledger blurb referred to a possible ice famine in the summer, Beasly and the area his business supplied were most likely in want of a fresh shipment."],"display_date":"March 13, 1890 - December 31, 1890","search_date":"1890-08-06","locations":[{"id":7008,"lat":31.8692302776,"lng":-90.4488242966,"zoom":9,"place":"COPIAH, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2897,"title":"The Exasperated Bourbon\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-01-19","end_date":"1878-01-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The editor of The Washington Post could not believe what he was reading. A staff member had just handed him a vicious letter from a reader that, in no uncertain terms, castigated his paper for being so brazen as to refer to black people as Mr. and Mrs. in its articles and stories. The man claimed to be one of the Bourbon Democrats, those who would spill the last drop of their blood rather than apply such titles to such a degraded, worthless, inferior race... The editor could only think that in this day and age, almost 13 years after the war that had ended the institution of slavery in the U.S., it was the man who had sent this letter who was being brazen. The author of the letter, a Mr. Henry T. Earnest, was actually claiming to write on behalf of all Southerners. The editor's first hope was that there was no truth to that claim, after the progress the nation had made; his second thought was how deeply unfortunate it was that Mr. Earnest believed the whole South shared his extreme opinion. That he even still felt there to be a South with its own identity and opinions so alien to those of the rest of the nation was a barrier to all that had been fought over so recently. "," He chose to publish the letter in the paper- accompanied by a rebuttal. He picked up his pen and began to draft the response. He would address this letter to every reader of The Post who might be wondering what stand the paper would take on such a relevant and sensitive issue. He wrote, So long as colored people are permitted to vote, we will feel constrained to address them as human beings...The gentleman who addresses us should have shed his blood during the late war. When the letters ran in the January 19th issue, he hoped that every reader would know that the paper stood behind progress, not racism."," The letter written to the editor of The Post by Mr. Earnest typifies the definition of the Bourbon Democrats as Willie D. Halsell describes it: ...a ruling group, once dethroned but now returned to power, who stubbornly hold to the past and refuse to adapt themselves to a changing world about them. Despite the fact that the war had resolved the issues of slavery and secession of the South, there were clearly those who felt no such resolution. As Miss Halsell explains, the Bourbons only represented a small subset of the Democratic party; however, their ideas would proliferate widely as the nation continued to struggle with the issue of racial equality. These ultra-conservative Democrats preached white supremacy, and fought privately and publicly (as is evidenced by this letter in the news) to defend what they believed to be white Americans' superiority over black Americans. However, though there were many like Mr. Earnest who made their racist views known during the post-Reconstruction period, there were also those like the editor of The Washington Post who openly accepted and stood up for the black man's right to citizenship and the respect which that citizenship demands for every American."],"display_date":"January 19, 1878","search_date":"1878-01-19","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2903,"title":"The Sale of James Miles&#39; Library\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-03-08","end_date":"1854-03-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One criterion for personal enlightenment in Charleston during the 1850s was the acquisition of a personal library. Such a library could be large-Charlestonians Thomas Smyth and William Gilmore Simms owned 20,000 and 12,000 volumes, respectively, in the 1850s-or much smaller. Regardless, it was important to have the newest book on your shelf, a collection of the classics, or at least a few books relating to one's field of study. ","By March 1854, James Warley Miles had built up such a collection, and the sale of his personal library would certainly have surprised his closest friends. This is especially true since Miles was a well-known figure around Charleston, known for being quite fond of books in general, his books in particular. Indeed, his love of books was enough to cause Francis Lieber in an 1853 letter to George Ticknor to comment, This Rev. Mr. Miles feels very unhappy at Charleston, and all his ardent soul longs for is to have a humble place in some library, for which by the way he would fit most admirably. Miles subsequently held the librarian post at the College of Charleston from 1857 until 1865.","But before this, Miles served as a pastor and as a professor of Ancient Languages at the College of Charleston. A theological liberal and philosophical idealist, religious and linguistic works dominated Miles' library, covering over 30 languages and coming from places as far off as Ghent and Calcutta. A catalogue created for its sale notes works on oriental languages (including Turkish, Sanskrit, Georgian, Persian, and Armenian) and classical literature, as well as works written in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Latin. For Miles to part with such a collection was personally devastating. The need to raise funds for a trip to Europe (on doctor's orders) to recover his health, though, was more pressing. So on March 8, 1854, the books went on sale. ","Much to Miles' surprise, however, the library was purchased in whole (probably by William Gilmore Simms, himself, though no one was certain). In turn, Miles requested the entire collection be turned over to the College of Charleston. He explained his rationale for doing so in his first report as Librarian in 1857, saying, I do not know better how to respond to the feelings of those who have manifested such noble, generous and appreciative sympathy for the pursuits of a humble student than by endeavoring to extend in the most feasible manner to all students in our community whatever advantages may be derived from the consultation of a collection preserved from dissipation by an act as noble and praiseworthy as it is generous and unusual. ","This episode shows the academic nature of the Southern elite in the mid-1800s. Men (at least those with sufficient means) in Charleston were wont to dabble in a wide variety of endeavors, and there was no better place to start one's journey than to read and create a private library. Miles', in particular, sheds light on the talents of educated men at this time, and the extent to which they were able to cover the world in search of books. Moreover, this episode demonstrates the scholarly nature of Charleston, one of the South's cultural leaders. Historian Michael O'Brien agrees: Charleston made it possible for these eruditions (that is, a library like Miles') to be realized. Such a realization was crucial in upholding Charleston's place as a Southern capital for learning."],"display_date":"March 8, 1854","search_date":"1854-03-08","locations":[{"id":11456,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2909,"title":"The Creation of the South Carolina Historical Society\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-06-02","end_date":"1855-06-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the 1850s, Charleston, South Carolina, was home to a vibrant intellectual life, Renaissance men, and a host of debating and literary societies. The diversity of these intellectual societies is astounding, often catering to a single ethnic group. In Charleston during the mid-1800s, one could find the St. Andrew's Society for Scotch-Irish, the Hibernian Society or the St. Patrick Society for Catholic Irish (not to be confused with the Catholic French, who had the French Benevolent Society), the Hebrew Harmonic Society for Jews, the South Carolina Society for Huguenots, and the German Friendly Society for Germans. And for a while, even free blacks could participate in their own Clionian Debating Society. ","Still, white, Protestant males dominated the intellectual life in nineteenth century Charleston, often forming their own exclusive societies. One example was the Charleston Conversation Club. Founded in 1800, the club met in private homes during the season (typically November through May) where one member would make a speech, followed by a two-hour discussion, and concluding with a dinner. All the popular political and social issues were discussed, as well as the occasional foray into literature or history. For example, the first six topics in the 1854-1855 season were Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici, poetry (written by a Society member), Parish Representation, political representation, Grayson's The Hireling and the Slave, and the destiny of negroes in the South. ","Such was the framework in 1855 when an accidental meeting of several gentleman, at one of those old homesteads, in the vicinity of Charleston occurred. The result, on June 2, was the creation of the South Carolina Historical Society and the approval of a constitution drafted by Dr. James Moultrie and Professors W. J. Rivers and F. A. Porcher. In 1856, the state of South Carolina incorporated the Society, and by 1857, the Society had secured the means to publish the first volume of The Collections of the Historical Society of South Carolina. The first volume was innocuous enough, including rather harmless topics like an address to the Society by Professor Porcher, a College of Charleston history professor. Yet by 1859 the conversations had changed drastically. In a May 19 oration to the Society-a speech reprinted in the third volume of the Collections-Second Vice President William Trescot took the opportunity to make a few remarks on the institution of slavery. Trescot's message was in line with most Southern thinkers of the day. Slavery was the great leveler, making a society of equals, by elevating all citizens of the State to the condition of a privileged class. It was an institution that knit together its members in their various conditions into one harmonious whole and made South Carolinians a grave, earnest, resolute, just people. ","This episode is important in highlighting the origins of ideas in the nineteenth century South: ordinary citizens, typical Charleston residents discussing typical Charleston issues among peers. In the words of historian Michael O'Brien, they were an urbane intelligentsia, not a workshop of experts. Their ideas were their own, though those often trickled down through newspapers and day-to-day conversation to ultimately reflect-as Trescot's did-opinions held by society at large. Ideas like his on the justness of slavery ultimately dominated the debates in all the aforementioned societies in Charleston during this time, and succeeded in casting a shadow over subsequent literary discussion."],"display_date":"June 2, 1855","search_date":"1855-06-02","locations":[{"id":11456,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2918,"title":"A Polite Education\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1828-09-18","end_date":"1828-09-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Education for women in the Antebellum South played a key role in defining and regulating social status. Many Southerners did not see education as a way to enlighten women, but rather to refine and polish them, and make them more suitable for marriage. In the Argus newspaper, published in Savannah, Georgia, an advertisement appeared in September of 1828. It announced Mr. Phillips's new school for young ladies, where they will be instructed in every branch of a polite and finished Education. Mr. Phillips's ad attempted to present his school as safe and innocuous. He called the subjects he would be teaching, polite and finished despite the fact that the formidable list of subjects he planned to teach was 11 topics long and included Writing, Astronomy, Rhetoric, and French. This attempt to make the school sound safe made sense given the tenuous position women's education had in the minds of southerners. "," The education of women in the South was both frightening to white men and necessary to the structure of southern society. In the male dominated South, men acted as heads of the household, and relied on domination of their wives and daughters as much as they relied on domination of their slaves to hold their position in society. An educated woman posed a threat to this domination by setting herself on an equal plane with white men. Education, however, also was a hallmark of the middle and upper classes in the South and a southern woman could not hope to be accepted into higher class society without a minimal education. If a woman was educated it meant that her family had had enough labor in the form of slaves or servants so that she did not have to work to help the family but instead could devote her time to studying. This concept of leisure time for women was intricately connected to the concepts of class and education. Mr. Phillips's advertisement perfectly demonstrates these tensions between male dominated society and the preservation of existing class structures by publicizing a school that he presents as both harmless and impressive at the same time. Anything else would have flown in the face of male supremacy or upper class ideals."],"display_date":"September 18, 1828","search_date":"1828-09-18","locations":[{"id":1628,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2919,"title":"Military Inspection and Celebration in Panola \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-09-27","end_date":"1889-09-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 27, 1889, General Bonham came to the Panola Academy to do his inspection of Clarendon's cavalry, consisting of the Hampton Light Dragoons commanded by Captain D.W. Brailsford and the Connor Mounted Rifles led by Captain A.L. Lesesne. By 11 o'clock in the morning, the decorated Panola Academy building was filled with lovely maidens and friends of the company who had come to watch the event. The Academy had hired Mrs. Edwards, an experienced caterer, and the Sumter String Band, a popular, soul stirring group, to commemorate the special occasion. The companies were arranged in the grove in front of the Academy and General Bonham entered the grounds in the company of Colonel B.M. Badger of the Governor's staff, Lieutenant Appelt, of the Manning Guards, and Lieutenant Deschamps, of the Dragoons. The cavalry was in regulation uniforms, armed with Winchester rifles, and standing in such great form as to elicit a complement from General Bonham. Following their inspection, First Lieutenant R.F. Weeks of the Connor Mounted Rifles, having moved to Colleton County, gave a brief speech of his eight years of happiness in the company and gratitude to his peers. He thanked them for electing him as one of their commissioned officers and then tendered his resignation. Orderly Sergeant A.J. Richberg then spoke for the company when he expressed his gratitude to Lieutenant Weeks for his dedication and articulated their unwillingness to part with such a fine officer, asking the Lieutenant Weeks to withdraw his motion to resign or at least visit them as often as he could. Following the ceremony, both guests and company members filed into the Academy as the men engaged their sweethearts in dance until sunset.","This narrative is important because it shows the reestablishment of a Southern cavalry after the Civil War with a renewed sense of pride in their company. Following the Civil War, much of the South's army was completely obliterated, not to mention distraught. This episode demonstrates the change of attitude that took place in the South in the 1880s following the desertion of the Union soldiers to the South. The South was left to rebuild itself again. While the years following the War were particularly distressful, the South was gradually able to overcome their loss and begin to move forward with their lives.","This narrative also shows the nature of social gatherings in the Southern society as the soldiers and their sweethearts engaged in dance throughout the day. As the South began to take on a new identity and nature of its own following the War, women played an integral role in helping men to move on with their lives. Historian Angela Boswell exemplified this in her study of women as she explained how wives of ex-Confederate soldiers helped bolster a new feeling of nationalism in their husbands again following the War.

During the summer months, it was common for families of all races to travel throughout the country for vacation and receive such hospitalities as refreshments and other accommodations. The businesses of the area would often provide services to people regardless of color or previous condition of servitude. However, this norm was altered on July 13, 1895. Robert Holland ventured into a private establishment of James F. Angle in Baltimore and requested service, dinner in particular. He was denied twice on the grounds of his color. An attendant stated, We don't serve colored people in here. An important aspect of the article is that they place Mr. Holland in high regard. The article mentions that he was a good looking colored man...of fine intelligence. So the action to deny service was not because the man seemed dangerous, but due to the fact that this particular owner had negative feelings toward members of the opposite race. Helping his cause, Mr. Holland did not react harshly, but exited quietly and immediately confer with a lawyer. This helps to demonstrate that social-cultural developments are still hindered by a superiority attitude of a few. The aggressive nature is making life in the new south an extremely difficult transition","Mr. Holland's experience on that day is a microcosm of the stereotypical South. Traveling was an integral part for it was a way from people to meet and connect with people from different places. All types from married blacks to educated and successful whites would converge at a city and be forced to interact and try to put aside their social and economic differences and be civil. However, it is ideal to assume that this could happen free from an occasional disturbance. Human emotions are entangled in Southern race relations, consisting of friendship and hatred. This mixture adds constant pressure on society. For the restaurant to deny service to Mr. Holland demonstrates how stress can lead to blatant acts of discrimination. Something so simple that we now take for granite was only privilege for some. Wilson noticed that the average black man at the time would have taken matters in his own hand. Thus, I believe that Wilson would commend Holland's decision not to take drastic measures but to seek a more formal complaint method. Allowing society to dwell on the discriminatory action and see the error in their ways. Though it will take at least 60 more years, the actions that faithful day laid the ground works for a civil movement towards equality for all."],"display_date":"August 3, 1895","search_date":"1895-08-03","locations":[{"id":5959,"lat":39.5630818599,"lng":-77.022719603,"zoom":9,"place":"CARROLL, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2944,"title":"They Danced &#39;til Dawn\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-05-26","end_date":"1866-05-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Entertainment was a little-known pursuit in the South in the years during and after the Civil War. However, for those white Southerners who did not lose everything, maintaining some of their old traditions was of the utmost importance. In May 1866, W.D. Cabell of Nelson County, Virginia, wrote to his wife Mary in Philadelphia of a large party which he had recently attended. He tells her that he went with 25 young gentlemen from the school of which he is principal. The party quickly evolved into a dance, which was quite entertaining for the young people. Cabell left the dance at 1 a.m., but it was apparently still going on at that time. He tells his wife that I hear they danced 8 sets after day light by the best music, violins and piano. They are coming in now looking quite broken down. ","Far from adopting the disapproving tone expected of a teacher and authority figure, Cabell seems to take comfort in the young people's revelry.

Parties, dances, picnics, tournaments, hunting, fishing, baseball, lectures, plays and tableaux were all popular amusements...In the background, generally avoided, were the men in blue, the Federal occupation forces. In addition to the presence of the Federal troops, Virginians had to deal with loss of property and money, yet even in the face of financial ruin Virginians attempted to maintain a vibrant culture and society.

They prescribed all sorts of medicines: Castor oil salts, elixirs, chocolates, chicken broth, snake root, and creamor tartar.  She took magnesia, took Emitics, took cathartics.

Friedman notes in <em>The Enclosed Garden </em>how the participation in evangelical communities prevented antebellum Southern women from forming any sort of collective identity.  The extended neighborhood kinship groups and the evangelical emphasis on the nuclear family bound women in their sexual roles.  The issue of death was formative in the community since, in the evangelical context, death was the first step in joining a supernatural community.

The newspaper encouraged Athenians to attend saying that Andreiu was well received in Charleston and Augusta where he had been performing. The announcement also told Athenians that the accompanist would, give imitations of the great Prima Donnas of the age, as Parodi and Jenny Lind, the latter a popular singer known as the Swedish Nightingale. ","The types of musicians who performed in Southern cities changed over the course of the antebellum period. Before the 1800's most concerts were giving by local amateurs. In the 1820's more professional musicians began to travel to the South and by the later decades of the period many famous international musicians came to the South. We know that Monsieur Andrieu was one of many traveling European artists to perform during the decades leading up to the Civil War.","The presence of international musicians in the South can help us to understand the culture of the antebellum South. Northerners had a tendency to believe that rich, white southerners could not be cultured because they were corrupted by slavery, did not value hard work, and generally lived a backwards life. We can see, however, that southerners valued being cultured. As Richard Bushman describes in his book <em>The Refinement of America</em>, southern plantations had much evidence of what he refers to as refinements in their taste and culture. This included extensive libraries of literature and Greek revival houses. In part, this was because the plantation owners were overseers and did not take part in the labor, so they had abundant leisure time that they could spend becoming cultured. The fact that this announcement was placed in public view in the Athens <em>Southern Banner</em> indicates that the concert was not specifically targeted to the plantation-owning class. The theater was a location where many classes, from the wealthy to the slaves, came together for entertainment. ","Thinking about the interest in culture and the presence of international culture in the South can help round out our picture of the antebellum period. Though economically the South revolved around plantations and agriculture, the cities were important places as well for the other things they had to offer.

The significance of this episode lies in how it illustrates the isolated character of the sect, the parameters of their interactions, and their conflicts with the established order and the community?s reactions. The Adventists in the south at this time focused their efforts in creating rural and self-sufficient communities in east Tennessee. One of the tenets of the Adventists is that they do not engage in evangelical efforts with members of other religious organizations. And, it was not uncommon for Adventists to run into trouble with the law because, unlike other common religious groups, they worshipped on Saturday and needed to pursue their work on Sunday. Despite the fact that the people of Rhea County most likely did not have much contact-social or religious- with the members of the Adventist community, the jailed men were treated well. The reason for clemency in the situation was probably related to the tie of Evangelical Christianity between the Adventists and those people inflicting judgment and punishment on them.

The celebration started out with an appropriate hymn and oration from the speaker of the day, Mr. Bossard, who was escorted to the steps of the church by the corps of local Riflemen. The crowd was lead in prayer by the Reverend Mr. Cook. Mr. Bossard read the Declaration of Independence, a national anthem was sung, and the entire crowd retired to a feast at the church.","At the banquet a number of toasts were given. The first was drunk to the anniversary of freedom, and to the honorary veterans and hope for their long and happy livelihoods. Further toasts were given to George Washington, Congress, the Americans, and the Revolutionists of '76. Toasts were given to the prosperity of militia and the national army and navy. The press was also toasted, in the hopes that it would always be as clean and free from obscenities as it was useful to democracy. Andrew Jackson was referred to as the hero of the age, and James Madison was called our enlightened and independent statesman, and hope for a dignified and peaceful retirement for him was expressed. The state of South Carolina was also specifically honored, and the hope was expressed that she will never desert the post of danger, when the rights of freemen are invaded. Approximately 20 such toasts were given to celebrate the Fourth of July, each one diligently recorded in the next week's newspaper.","    The July celebration cited in this South Carolina newspaper is typical of the types of celebrations completed during the early nineteenth century in commemoration of the young nation's independence movement. The individual toasts recorded give a more intimate view of some of the current events and topics of concern in both upstate South Carolina and the nation as a whole. Andrew Jackson had recently risen to national fame after defeating the British in New Orleans in the War of 1812 but was also well liked as a local hero because he was born and raised in Waxhaw, in Union County, another upstate district. The reference to James Madison was due to James Monroe's inauguration a year before, and Madison's resulting retirement from public office. Monroe proceeded to appoint South Carolinian John C. Calhoun as Secretary of War, a decision that clearly made him popular in the South and shaped political tensions for decades to come. Overall, the impression given by this episode is one of political and social union between South Carolina and the rest of the nation, with little evidence of the coming conflicts. The only indication of any type of trouble in South Carolina is the single toast given to the state itself, which gives historians a small window's view into the loyalty and determination of South Carolina's citizens that would be clearly exhibited in the next few decades."],"display_date":"July 18, 1818","search_date":"1818-07-18","locations":[{"id":11577,"lat":33.9290712834,"lng":-81.2531457905,"zoom":9,"place":"LEXINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3057,"title":"Yacht Me\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1894-06-07","end_date":"1894-06-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Yachting, in all of its splendor, has finally reached the mid-Atlantic and has spread quickly throughout the region in the late nineteenth century. The Baltimore Yacht Club, tracing its origins to 1891, was formed in Baltimore City where it is situated on Sue Island. To commence the building of a new yacht for Mr. J.D. Mallory, John Farlow, Percy Donaldson, and other members of the club, the B.Y.C. is holding a regatta and cruise from June 23 to June 30. The social gathering will include the Philadelphia and Corinthian Yacht Club of Philadelphia. Getting ready for the event, many members are already sending their yachts to the clubhouse. Mr. Mallory sent his 25 foot, 35 pounds papier mache shell that was stationed at the University of Pennsylvania to the boat house. The growth of the Baltimore Yacht Club helped to garner the attention of many social elites in the area and abroad. Indicative of this is addition of Mon. Commines de Masilly as a member. Mon. Masilly was the first secretary of the French embassy in Washington D.C., and to commemorate his membership, he purchased a new steam launch.","The regatta, cruises, and luncheons held during that particular week will dominate Baltimore, Maryland. This is due mostly to the growth of the sport of yachting in America. Although organized yachting in America began with the founding of the New York Yacht Club in 1884 and continued with the establishment of such clubs as the Boston Yacht Club (1865), Chicago Yacht Club (1875), and the Larchmont Yacht Club (1880), it was not until 1885 that the Chesapeake Yacht Club on the eastern shore [was founded]. It is increasingly evident, that yachting was a Northern sport until the founding the Chesapeake Yacht Club nearly 20 years later. Yacht clubs, serve as a very important social outlet. Though, participating was reserved for the aristocratic members of society, the club served a socializing function for its ability to bring people together and experience a race on the river on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. The club was intended for fellowship and discussion, and admission was reserved for the well off of society. Members would attend the clubhouse for drinks and conversation with fellow yachters or owners of other marine vessels, and discuss matters of the day before taking the family out for lunch aboard the boat. Besides functioning a social and familial role, yacht clubs were means of recreation. Similar to parks, or baseball teams, yacht clubs were competitive. Mr. Mallory bought a new engine, boiler, shaft, and deed and air pump, for one of his ships, solely for this specific event. Winning has a strong correlation to honor, thus owners were not shy in contributing money if it was attributed to their individual reputation, and the reputation of the club.

The slaves put much effort into the night to make it the happiest of times. Slaves on the plantation looked forward to the ball each year. This year the ball fell on a beautiful night. The Fearns were the last to leave for the ball. As they followed the path to get there, a large slave armed with knives approached Mr. Fearn. This slave had run away three months before to avoid the harsh demands of the sugar-grinding season. The plantation owner ordered the slave to put down his weapons. Out of respect for Mr. Fearns authority the slave fell to the owner's feet and begged to go to the ball. The master agreed to allow him to attend the ball, but warned he would be subject to the punishment by the other slaves. Upon entering the ball he was severely beaten by his fellow slaves and dragged from the ball.","Oftentimes runaway slaves were not punished directly by their owners. Many owners thought that runaways were just an inevitable part of slaveholding. Although slave escapes were a common occurrence, they did not cause much excitement. In fact an owner did not advertise that he had a runaway until that slave had been missing for several weeks. This composure about runaways was due to the fact that most slaves returned to the plantation because they could not bear to leave their families. It was assumed that a successful runaway would never return to the plantation he or she left and would leave his family forever. ","Family was one of the most treasured aspects of life for slaves. The Christmas season was the best time of the year for slaves because it enabled slaves to spend time with their families. Slaves were permitted to take a break from their grueling work to enjoy the holidays. On sugar plantations throughout Louisiana this leisure period was often pushed back until the end of January - after the grinding season. It was common that a dinner and a ball were held in honor of the slaves. Dancing was the most popular activity for the slaves. They danced long into the night. Fellow slaves played music and were sometimes able to make money doing so. Masters often gave their slaves gifts during the Christmas season and may have even given them passes to go where they pleased, within a certain distance, during the rest of their break.

This excerpt, though very brief, is packed with information about women who lived in the Reconstruction era South.  Most striking at first is that Luc Lucas was a Miss, that she was an unmarried woman who was operating a plantation.  The fact that Lu was not married could have multiple explanations, but most likely Lu had inherited the estate from her father.  It is possible that her father died a natural death at home, but it is also likely that he was killed or injured while fighting in the Civil War.  As George C. Rable writes of Jane Turner Censer's book The Reconstruction of White Southern Womanhood, 1865-1895, After the war, women increasingly inherited real property and served as executors of men's estates.  So many Southern men had died during the Civil War, or were unable to manage a plantation when they returned home, so women were often responsible for taking over their families' estates.  Rable goes on to include that Censer asserts in her work how  marriage prospects declined for Southern women after the war, emphasizing that more young women apparently chose to remain single during this time.  Whether Lu could not find a husband, or if she decided not to marry is not specified.  However, it can be concluded that simply her ability to function in such a role of high status (that of operating an estate) proves that women in the South were beginning to step outside the lines that they had been previously been defined within.  "," The inclusion of Lu's short, simple biography in Harper's also reveals that her lifestyle was accepted.  Before the war, white Southern women were often confined to domestic chores and occupations; but with Lu's story, it seems that women's lives were expanding in that they were now recognized as capable of running an estate.  That this position was socially acknowledged shows that the role of women in the south was changing dramatically after the Civil War.   "," Lastly, the mention of Lu's ability to spend a lot of time riding horses reveals that although she was managing a large estate, she still had a great deal of spare time.  That Lu owned horses for sport and pleasure means that not only was she the proprietor of her own land, but also that she was wealthy and active enough to partake in leisurely entertainment venues.  "," Even though the larger details of Lu's life are unknown, the information found in this short passage and its broader implications show a great deal about how women's positions and roles in society were changing during Reconstruction.  Along with many other members of their society, women were experimenting with their notions of self during Reconstruction."],"display_date":"September 20, 1884","search_date":"1884-09-20","locations":[{"id":5578,"lat":32.147356423,"lng":-91.0322487665,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3069,"title":"Commencement at the College of South Carolina\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-12-03","end_date":"1816-12-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Commencement for the Class of 1816 at the College of South Carolina was completed at 10 am on Monday, December 2.

At the Capitol several members of the state legislature joined the parade, and the entire procession continued to the college chapel, where the ceremony took place. The president of the college welcomed the crowd for the special occasion, and led a prayer before the exercises of the day were completed.

At the fiftieth anniversary of its establishment, the founders proclaimed that the goal of the university had been reached, however some criticized the school for holding a monopoly on political opportunities in the state. In the first 50 years of operation, the college's alumni provided approximately half of South Carolina's elected officials.

In the South, as in many other societies, church and state substantially reinforced the prevalent forms of male dominance. In the South, women's involvement in social committees and aid societies, like the Soldiers Aid Society, was largely an attempt to create their own sphere, separate from that of their husbands. While women in the higher, slaveholding class held more power and control over their day to day activities than lower class women, they were still in need of outside organizations to occupy them and solidify their say in society. Southern society discouraged involvement in these groups that were not connected to the church, for the most part, southern women did their charitable work individually, selectively, and close to home, if not with in their own households. The Soldiers Aid Society that Mrs. Kimball was a part of is a rare example of southern women stepping out of the male dominated worlds of their homes and churches and gathering to help their newly formed country. With so many southern plantation owners helping in the war effort societies and organizations were more likely to be formed. The men that for the most part governed the activities of women were now busy elsewhere and the women were left with time and freedom on their hands.

"," A Richmond newspaper spoke of baseball as, thoroughly democratic; leveling all ranks, and all social differences are forgotten, and sure enough, blacks and whites flocked to the game as both players and fans. In the 1880's games and grandstands were very much interracial; however, this phenomenon would quickly disappear in the 1890's. Along with other forms of discrimination sweeping the South during this decade, white teams no longer found it honorable to play black teams, leading the game to the segregation that it would finally overcome in the mid-twentieth century. The South's acceptance of baseball, the national game, very much paralleled its integration into the rest of the country; however, sports teams also gave apparently harmless expressions of Southern pride and identity, and [would] provide yet another demeaning distinction between the races.On July 26, 1884, though, few Norfolk fans second-guessed the societal implications of their game, for celebration swept the field--their team had won."],"display_date":"July 26, 1884","search_date":"1884-07-26","locations":[{"id":14411,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3250,"title":"Youthful Misconduct in Celebration of Christmas\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-12-24","end_date":"1879-01-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["  The members of the City Council of Staunton, Virginia voted against the suspension over the Christmas holiday of an ordinance that forbad the use of pop-crackers in the streets. Christmas was to be celebrated in a joyful, yet quiet manner, not with the use of small explosives, which are noisy and might interfere with private celebrations. On the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth of December, a serenade of horns and pop-crackers outside their doors interrupted the holiday jubilations of those City Council members who voted in favor of the ordinance. The boys of the city celebrated Christmas as usual with the sharp bang of the small pop-crackers and the deeper boom of a cannon-cracker, but the spirit of the noise had changed from religious merriment to civic disobedience.","  The council members accepted the protests in good spirits at first and all in the city enjoyed the Christmas festivities. The police were wholly unable to determine the source of the exploded firecrackers, though they tried faithfully.

Staunton's city council formed a special committee to investigate the negligence and efficiency of the police force in fulfilling its sworn duty. The actions of the boys, though likely simply a desire for youthful activity, demonstrated a disrespect for the law which the community could not tolerate. ","  The noise and dazzle of fireworks has been a traditional way for Southerners to celebrate Christmas since the French in Louisiana first fired their rifles and set off firecrackers in honor of the holiday.

Though not an egregious example of law breaking, the City Council chose to elevate the incident with its investigation of the conduct of the police force. In the periods of Reconstruction following the Civil War, it was necessary for city officials to assert the authority of the law. Many of the rules governing past Southern behavior had changed, especially regarding slavery; consequently, tradition was no longer an adequate justification for disobedience.

Levi kept a careful diary in which he would write the day to day activities he participated in and observed.

Until well after the Civil War grain was very hard and expensive to process and only the wealthiest of plantation owners dared to eat it on a regular basis. Corn Bread was the main bread of the South, because of its flexibility and ease of processing. Lots of southerners would eat hoe bread which was corn bread baked over a fire on top of a farmers hoe. Because corn bread did not keep very well the southern tradition of warm bread at meals began to develop. Southern farms and plantations were often ransacked by Union troops traveling through the land; they would often take food and supplies for themselves. It is not surprising given the poverty of the time and the threat of Union soldiers that Mrs. Pitman would want to save her food stores for her family. Southern women were often willing to help confederate soldiers, though, if provided the supplies to do so. In later years grain production spread throughout the west and processing became cheaper prices of grain also fell, allowing poorer farmers to enjoy wheat bread like the elite.

Of course, there is the occasional magical story written by a third grade class that appears every once a week in the Arts and Entertainment section of the paper, but for the most part, fictional stories of real substance are not published in newspapers anymore. This was not the case in the 1800's. Appearing in The Valley Star each week was a selected tale, including topics ranging from a loveless marriage to an alcoholic father. Though the language is not quite timeless, the themes certainly are, and are as relevant today as they were then.","The Lonely Wife follows Susan Morris and her daily life and loveless marriage. In the majority of her four-year marriage, she has been left at home with her son while her husband is either working or drinking. She begs him to spend time with her, but in his mind, giving her money and responsibility to run the house is enough. As time goes by, Susan is so worn by her inner demons that her physical appearance changes and she begins to encounter medical problems, but the doctor only suggests that she go to her prior home and spend time in the country. Her countenance cannot allow her to tell her husband the real reason she is so ill, so she gradually drifts away, knowing that she is not strong enough to save herself. ","The Temperance Cause was a story submitted by the American Temperance Recorder in an attempt to advertise for the temperance movement. Mary Edwards is a young woman who lives alone with her father. Ever since her mother died, her father has grown less and less responsible; he lost his job, his house, and now he spends most of his time drinking. One night, when he arrives at his local bar, there is a temperance movement speaker causing a raucous. With much encouragement, the stranger stands on a table and begins to sings. A sweet song comes from his lips about all that he lost when he started drinking. The father is so touched by the music that he rushes home to his daughter and vows to turn his life around. This story appeared in the paper in the hope that one could see the power of music and of stories and would take initiative to change his lot in life.","The newspaper showed the effects of heavy drinking through these two stories and warned its readers against following this path. In the antebellum South, and in Virginia in particular, many prominent men were involved in the temperance movement, including John Hartwell Cocke. Cocke was a good friend of Thomas Jefferson's and a supporter of the University of Virginia. The movement started mainly in Protestant churches. The M.E. Church, South, sent out a report saying that a very large proportion of human misery, including poverty, disease, and crime, is induced by the use of alcohol.

It was a crusade for self-improvement and the industrial work ethic. One man from nearby Washington, N.C., only identified as 'A Free Drinker,' felt he had to speak up. In a letter to the editor, the writer reminded the reading public that there were two sides to the issue, and the logic of the temperance movement was flawed on many accounts. Not all those who drank were sordid drunks, as the temperance societies believed. These societies opposed the drinking of all liquor, never mind how good the quality or how small the quantity. Drinking was not an idle habit, but rather a stimulating social activity. Jovial parties and pleasant games went well with a glass of the best. The temperance societies would use the money from alcohol on things like clothing and education for the children, but the writer noted that dressing up children only corrupts them and makes them arrogant. He went on, And as to giving children an education, I am inclined to think the policy of it rather doubtful... You have no doubt heard, sir, of the great number of forgeries that have been made of late years on banks and merchants. Now if these guilty persons had never learned to read and write, could they have committed these forgeries? The rhetoric of sarcasm veiled his disregard for these moral reformers. He went on to reveal that his wife nearly forced him to join one of these temperance societies, but a friend informed him that pledging to join was a sin - and he could not commit a known sin As if to perfectly demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the temperance societies in east North Carolina, the same friend quipped, There was a great deal of liquor in town that had to be drank by somebody.","Temperance societies emerged around the same time in the North and the South, in the 1830s. Yet the issue did not seem to resonate with many Southerners, especially the wealthy population of the Carolina coast. Many historians believe the movement lagged behind in the South because its citizens feared that the cause of temperance was tied to the cause of abolitionism. The temperance unions that did form in the South always made their proslavery opinions publicly known. Yet, as Ian Tyrell notes, this notion does not explain the whole issue. Many southern slaveholders joined the temperance reformers, voicing concerns about the public drunkenness of slaves and free blacks. In fact, what the South lacked that the North possessed was a growing immigrant population and a social environment of urbanization. The people that supported the temperance movements in the South were not the farmers and planters: they were the artisans and merchants, the laboring middle class. These urban occupations were not as socially prominent in South. For the majority, the drunkards being discussed in the <em>Newbern Spectator</em> were more like fictional characters than everyday reality. Without an economic transformation, the South maintained much of its pre-industrial character that deterred modern social reforms from gaining a momentum."],"display_date":"February 19, 1842","search_date":"1842-02-19","locations":[{"id":9860,"lat":35.9347277088,"lng":-76.3834640216,"zoom":10,"place":"WASHINGTON, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3334,"title":"Mummy Visits Charleston\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-01-31","end_date":"1824-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Lady of Thebes Mummy was exhibited in Charleston and described in the Charleston Courier on January 31, 1824.

Second, the South was not defeated but had been overwhelmed by greater numbers and resources. Third, the antebellum South was more concerned with honor and duty than financial success. The theory, in general, argued that racial harmony existed prior to the Civil War and the North was to blame for stirring up racial tensions. In order to make sure that this interpretation lived on, southern states created works, such as monuments, that portrayed Confederate soldiers as heroes. The monument erected in Fairfax cemetery speaks of soldiers whom death could not terrify and whom defeat could not dishonor.

Irish Linens, Silk, beaver, & horsekin [sic] gloves, Mandarine Robes, Italian Crepes and Shawls, these specialty items and over a hundred more were available on the shelves of Cochran & Co. By 1828, the affluent residents of Albemarle could help themselves to the crime of London fashion together with a variety of other articles; comprising a general assortment of Spring and Summer goods.","High fashion in Virginia emulated European models. This had long been the case, but now the seasonal trends could mimic London more closely than had been possible in the past. The first two dozen items listed in the catalog were cloths and various kinds of other raw textiles; the rest of items tended to be manufactured accessories. Albemarle households at this time made their clothes or had them tailored. Cochran did not list any pants, dresses, or socks, but rather non-vital accessories like parasols, silk shoes, and beaver hats. It is intuitive to expect that plantation-owning families were the principal consumers of this kind of consumer good. In a study of middle-class consumerism in New England, Catherine Kelly describes how typical rural families patterned their consumption on that of their urban acquaintances, yet maintained distinctive social culture. Especially before the elite plantation gentry identity crystallized in southern states, non-elite but economically comfortable free families likely participated in the kind of consumption Cochran?s store made possible.","Cochran's offerings reflect contemporary developments in the American economy. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Southern ports imported comparable volumes of goods from Europe as did cities in the North. In 1806, for instance, Charlestown was home to over forty importation companies. It would be decades before the Erie canal made New York an entrepot for a huge northeastern hinterland. As the nineteenth century continued, the role of cities like Richmond and Charleston as direct importers declined, even though their exports, which exceeded the contemporary North, continued to increase. Many southerners blamed this phenomenon on federal trade policies, such as the tariff and the Bank of the United States that disproportionately benefited northern states. Albemarle, on the outer edge of the slave economy, depended more on consumer trade with northern cities than it did to the capital of the South, Charleston. Northern cities at this time still depended strongly on European manufacture. Urban industrialization was well underway in the North, but it was not the strong international competitor it developed into later in the century."],"display_date":"May 20, 1826","search_date":"1826-05-20","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3465,"title":"A Country Wedding in 1846\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-11-01","end_date":"1846-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["One November afternoon, Eliza Moore Chinn McHatten Ripley and her brother Dick set off for a farm not too far outside of their home in New Orleans. This short journey became a longer one as transportation troubles and creek flooding slowed them down. Eventually, Eliza and Dick found a place to stay over for a night before continuing on their way the following morning. "," They finally reached the farm to find the place in a state of chaos. Their reason for visiting was to attend a wedding, but theirs was not the only late arrival. People were having difficulty bypassing the flooded creek that gave Eliza and Dick so much trouble just a day earlier, and even the preacher from New Orleans had missed the train The family continued to set the table with a plethora of homemade treats, including ice cream that was seasoned by boiling a whole vanilla bean in the milk; it was frozen in a huge cylinder without any inside fixtures to stir the mixture; it was whirled in the ice tub by hand-and a stout one at that-and required at least one hour, constant labor, to freeze the cream - while the bride fretted and wrung her hands in an upstairs room.","After the carriage had waited and waited at the station for the preacher to arrive, something had to be done. Although Mr. Jahleel Woodbridge, the missing minister, was a dear family friend, guests were getting fidgety and the poor bride was beside herself. General McCausland, the father of the bride and master of the house, took matters into his house and sent someone to fetch a neighboring Methodist preacher. This replacement wasted no time; he came straight from plowing his fields and presided over the ceremonies in his farm clothes. After the successful completion of the wedding rites, he congratulated her on her 'escape from the quicksands and shoals of celibacy' and headed back to his crops. Only moments after the hero of the day had taken his leave, Mr. Woodbridge came riding up to the house."," In the countryside right outside a bustling New Orleans, weddings were the large social affairs of the year. As indicated by Eliza and Dick's trials along their way to the ceremony, southerners were willing to go to great lengths to see their neighbors, friends and family members married. These same people also came, sometimes from great distances, to assist with the necessary wedding preparations. "," Weddings were an expected rite of passage for young southern men and women. Girls were considered to be of marrying age once they were approximately 16 or 17 and had learned the necessary domestic skills it took to run an entire household.

According to the Wellsburg Herald, the black population of Wellsburg had been meeting nightly at societies or parties at the residences of other free blacks. But on this particular night something went wrong, or as the local white-owned newspaper mused, [the party] appears...to have been diverted from its legitimate object - affording an opportunity for the younger classes to meet, court, and sport together. The -'green-eyed monster' jealousy was of course not idle. A young free black man by the name of Thomas Groves was in town briefly as an employee on the steamer Miami and attended the party. When he left the house in the company of a local black woman, he got into an altercation with a group of local black men over his relationship with the woman. In the ensuing quarrel a member of the group pulled out a pistol and killed Groves. Though the identity of the actual killer was not known at press time, six of the men had been arrested on charge of being concerned in the riot. A hearing was scheduled for that afternoon.","Western Virginia, soon to become the new state of West Virginia, did not secede from the Union, and thus became a haven for free black men and escaped slaves during and after the Civil War. The border between West Virginia and Virginia was an important escape route from the Confederate states to the Upper South. Many former slaves were drawn to the area by the promise of a large number of high-paying jobs created by the burgeoning mining and timber industries. But in some cases, the influx of newly-free blacks was scarcely tolerated by the whites of the northern Border States. In an area that had traditionally had few blacks because of the lack of demand for slaves, the immigration of African Americans heightened tensions between the two races. The high tensions sometimes led to violence. In this case, however, the violence was limited to the black race, and so was looked on more as a diversion rather than cause for alarm.","Many of these escaped slaves became useful members of the Union Army, and some even became soldiers after conscription of African-Americans was approved in 1863. However, white attitudes toward free blacks in the South would remain a problem well into the 20th century, and soon black-on-black crime would be relatively ignored by many local southern authorities. Though the men in this case were arrested and perhaps even given a trial, this attitude of disdain among the whites would only increase during Reconstruction, and eventually transform into the codified racism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With the displacement of large groups of slaves during the Civil War and the sudden complete emancipation of the 14th Amendment, blacks and whites would be forced to deal with each other on grounds unfamiliar to both races.

Because of the nature of the gale that had blown ashore that blustery Charleston day, all five were presumed dead. The slaves were: Jefferson and George, property of Mr. J. Jeannerett, Ned of Mr. Mellichamp, William of Mrs. C. Macbeth, and a slave boy, Issac, of Mrs. Hughes. Although other had occupied a boat a short distance ahead of them, it, too, was in a dangerous situation and could not come to the rescue of the slaves' vessel. The storm that took place that windy August day caused many additional losses. Because the tide rose to an unprecedented height, most of the Charleston's wharves were covered in water. In addition, many streets were submerged on the Western side of the city. Some residents had to be rescued from their homes by boat. ","The influence of the weather on the antebellum South was a great one. Many of the city's slave owners chose rice as their main crop. If rice fields, some of which were located in close proximity to the city, became too flooded, then the harvest that year would be abominable. In addition, storms like these sometimes caused some of Charleston's more precious architectural resources to be destroyed. So much of Southern history can be and has been lost in events of Mother Nature. Environmental constraints pressured the inhabitants of a city like Charleston to adapt to different ways of life depending on the natural disaster.","Another important issue brought up by this newspaper clipping, which was clipped from a newspaper and placed in the Journal of Charles Heyward, a Charleston resident, concerns the relative freedom that Charleston slaves possessed. Slaves were permitted to be hired out by their owners to others, allowing bondsmen to diversify their skills. Because they could accept earnings for their services, sometimes they were able to buy their freedom. Slaves were also permitted to attend church services with their master. In addition, they were allowed to participate in other leisurely activities, such as fishing, because many did not live on their master's property. Those who did usually lived in separate quarters, so they could come and go with relative ease. Many Charlestonian masters allowed these activities, especially around this time period, in order to appear like benevolent Christian masters in an effort to suppress the idea that slavery was a cruel institution. However, others felt that allowing slaves this much freedom would cause insubordination and deterioration of the institution of slavery, as shown by historian David R. Goldfield. He also contradicts Bernard E. Power's book, <em>Black Charlestonians</em>, by noting that even though some slaves were able to diversify their skills through this freedom, many had skill levels that remained low, even lower than slaves on working rice and cotton plantations. This newspaper article shows that, although the situation of slave freedom ended perilously for the poor men in a boat, slaves in the greater Charleston city area enjoyed many more opportunities than those in other areas."],"display_date":"August 1, 1842","search_date":"1842-08-01","locations":[{"id":11455,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3531,"title":"The Great Fire of Charleston and its Cultural Awakening\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-04-27","end_date":"1838-04-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 27, 1838, an enormous fire broke out in Charleston, South Carolina, around 9:00 pm. It raged until noon the next day, damaging over 1,000 buildings. It ruined many businesses, a new hotel, several churches, a new theater, and the entire market except for the fish section. Many houses were burnt to the ground. In efforts to put the fire out, all the water in the city pumps was used. In addition, several people died in the flames. Most famously, Charleston's Trinity Church was burned. Another important building that fell victim was the new hotel that had been recently built. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. The fire rendered penniless many who were wealthy. The total monetary loss amounted to about 3,000,000, a sum even more significant in nineteenth century Charleston than today. ","A newspaper article mentioned that several slaves died in the fire, but declined to name them, unlike the many white victims who were named. This reflected the social hierarchy. A long obituary was even given for Colonel Charles John Steedman, a Naval Officer stationed in Charleston, on account of his exemplary citizenship both before and during the fire. Additionally, several prominent store owners are listed as having died attempting to save their stores. Ironically, the fire did not cause Charleston's demise. Rather, it caused a great cultural awakening as many homes and business were rebuilt or repaired. ","The Great Fire of 1838 had a far-reaching impact on the city of Charleston. In many ways, it helped to put Charleston on the map as a great cultural and architectural center. Although previous to the fire only a few homes were styled in the Greek Revival, many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued and made Charleston one of the foremost places to view Greek Revival architecture. The Gothic Revival also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion. This may have also represented an effort to portray the slaveholders who were attending these churches are benevolent, Christian men and women. Gothic was not used for state buildings, however, as James Patrick confirms in his article Ecclesiological Gothic in the Antebellum South. In addition to being used for religious buildings in Charleston, the use of the Gothic, according to Patrick, reflected an attempt to portray Southern locales such as Charleston in the most romantic light possible. Southerners were fighting to keep their culture alive, especially in state like South Carolina, where there was constantly talk of nullification and states rights after the Nullification Crisis. All in all, the art and architecture of Charleston had great implications for a city rebuilt after a horrific fire."],"display_date":"April 27, 1838","search_date":"1838-04-27","locations":[{"id":11454,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3565,"title":"Mid-Autumn Musters\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-01-01","end_date":"1821-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On consecutive weekends in October 1821, two companies of Albemarle militia held their yearly musters. On the first Saturday of the month, a company of artillery headed by Captain F.B. Dyers gathered at an old field in the countryside. This muster was the first ever of Dyer's troop. At the session, matters of moment pertaining to the company as a whole were submitted to the men. A week later, at a different field, a full meeting of the troop [was] requested of men enrolled in a cavalry company theretofore headed by a Captain Perry. Like the muster of Dyer's company, this meeting also had a purpose above simply drilling. The men elected a new captain to succeed Perry.","Volunteer militia participated in all of the United States' military conflicts between the French and Indian and Civil Wars. An understanding of militia as noble and proficient fighters - the myth of the citizen soldier - became an entrenched American image in the wake of war, after the Revolution and Jackson-era conflicts especially. In spite of this image, in reality militias were almost never outstanding military units, and fought much more inconsistently than trained infantry units. The presence of militia in an army often vexed the efforts of the officers and organized units that they were attached to. Additionally, militias were notoriously poorly-armed. In 1820, less than one half of militia members in the United States owned any gun, let alone a well-maintained musket. Less than one fifth of white men owned a gun. Before the firearm industry developed in the United States, bringing down the cost of guns and ammunition, to own, maintain, and practice with a gun was a very expensive and impractical proposition for the vast majority of Americans. Playing with a gun was too expensive for people who worked all day. Dedicated farming provided food much more reliable than tromping around the woods on a hunt. While the first U.S. Militia Act in 1792 mandated that militia members arm themselves, very few American men actually complied. In consequence, successive national acts through 1808 shifted the financial responsibility of armament to states and the federal government.","Southern militia envisioned themselves as symbolic inheritors either of a Revolution tradition, or of a composite English tradition formed from images of refined gentry, mounted Cavaliers, and staunch Normans. Practically speaking, militia musters at this time were not particularly military affairs. Musters were often extremely social events that entailed more alcohol than target-practice (which some militias in southern states abandoned because it was too embarrassing). The defense of states rights against an aggressive national government was a key reason that militia had been preserved since the founding of the United States. While militia in southern states seized upon this purpose when war against the North erupted in the 1860s, the possibility of deployment against fellow Americans was nowhere near the front of Virginians' minds at this time. Conflict with Indians, British, Spaniards, and Mexicans were much fresher possibilities to the memory in the early 1820s."],"display_date":1821,"search_date":"1821-07-02","locations":[{"id":13594,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3573,"title":"E.W.

Hubard of Washington, D.C. wrote a letter to his nephew, James L. Hubard, of Buckingham County, Virginia. James was a young man at the time, still in the formative stages of his life, and it appears that he and his uncle corresponded regularly about education, family life, and women in central and northern Virginia. E.W. began the letter by acknowledging his receipt of James' last dispatch, dated the twentieth of January; during the mid-nineteenth century, parcel mail was still transported largely by horse-drawn carriage, so a three-week delivery period from Buckingham to Washington would not have been out of the ordinary. In the subsequent paragraphs, James' uncle addressed several aspects of the affluent, civilized lifestyle he led and advises his young nephew on the values of a southern gentleman. ","First, E.W. praised James for reading the new books that he sent to his nephew. James was very studious and intelligent, qualities evidenced by the fact that he finished the books very quickly and impressed his uncle with his voracious appetite for learning. E.W. could only hope, he wrote, that William, Robert, and Edmund (James' little brothers) follow in [his] good example and engage in reading and learning new literature. Next, the well heeled gentleman from the capitol city shared in his nephew's excitement over the success of his hunting and fishing expeditions. Although James wrote that he was a proficient shooter, he also expressed his dissatisfaction with his attempts at trapping. His uncle responded by offering his opinion on the two methods of hunting game, praising the virtues of trapping animals when he stated, It takes more sense and skill to out-wit and catch them, than to take your gun and shoot them. Trapping, he declared, is accomplished by tact and skill while hunting with a rifle depends on the force of powder and shot; this emphasis on guile and cunning is a recurring theme of E.W. Hubard's letter. Lastly, E.W. encouraged James to develop his musical talent, expressing his belief that those who are gifted with a particular acumen for singing or playing an instrument should nurture those talents and develop their abilities to fruition. In closing, James' benevolent uncle requested that he pass on his love to the rest of the family, including his younger brothers, and to tell them that he wishes he could one day correspond with them in the same manner as he and James did then. ","E.W. Hubard's letter to his nephew embodies several facets of southern gentlemanliness and reveals a great deal about the education and upbringing of affluent young men in central Virginia. E.W. urged his nephew to read as much as he can, not only in an effort to enhance his intrinsic worth, but also to uphold the tradition of the family of scholarly appearance and reputation. He repeatedly moralized the values of cleverness, exemplified in his lecture on the desirability of the crafty entrapment of game animals rather than the brute force method of shooting from afar. According to E. Brooks Holifield's <em>The Gentlemen Theologians</em>, Among the goals of piety, in relation to the ideal of southern gentlemanliness, were introspective watchfulness, purity of intention, strenuous inner discipline, and self-control. E.W. Hubard echoed these qualities in his letter to his nephew when he claimed that gentlemanly behavior develops from a keen intellect, quick wit, a rapacious desire for reading, and the ability to excel at music and dance. These characteristics and high aspirations colored the various political, social, and economic interactions of southern white gentlemen during the mid-nineteenth century in central Virginia as well as the American South as a whole."],"display_date":"February 9, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-09","locations":[{"id":13689,"lat":37.5453300062,"lng":-78.5815976608,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3574,"title":"Another Train Wreck\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-04-30","end_date":"1890-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Rather than going to bed early Sunday night after a long day of church and family time, the city of Staunton spent the evening putting out a fire, only to then have a serious train wreck in the early hours of Monday, April 28, 1890. The No. 2 train on the C&O line from Cincinnati had cars derail after losing air power to the brakes. The train picked up even more speed because there is a descent into the Staunton station. Along with the increased speed, the engineer had to maneuver the train along the curves of the rail. The engineer managed to prevent the whole train from jumping track and saved many lives. The derailed sleeper car caused the most damage by destroying the 6-inch iron columns lining the platform. As this was a night train, there were many people sleeping in this car and they suffered the most injuries. The wreck caused the death of a young girl of the Pearl of Pekin Company, a Dramatic Corps. Her body, on which there was the silver cross of the King's Daughters Organization, was taken to a local funeral home and prepared for the journey to Jackson County, Missouri. The other townspeople took the injured to two residences and the Virginia Hotel. "," This article was not the front-page headline of the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>of Augusta County. Instead, it ran as the longest column under the headline A Night Horror on the second page with mostly local events. Oddly, the news writer did not comment about the lack of a hospital. A group of local women, the King's Daughters Organization, did note this absence and started a campaign to build the first hospital in Staunton. "," This one train wreck illumines so many new themes of life in the 1890's. There is the strong danger of railroads. From 1890 to 1900, there were over 6,000 accidents involving mail-carrying trains and the <em>Staunton Spectator </em>listed train accidents and wrecks frequently. Alfred D. Chandler has explained how railroads drastically changed life in the United States. Small Staunton connected to greater America and her almost 200,000 miles of operating line in a way that horses and boats never could have. These railroad connections created opportunities for the citizens. The trains delivered mail demonstrably faster and more efficiently, and kept people who moved (increasingly because of trains) connected. There were new economic opportunities for builders, operators, and those who wanted to sell products to other cities. The grain of Staunton had a new market that enabled farmers to produce and sell more than ever. Railroads also represented the possibility of mobility. People could travel and see cities the average person twenty years before never would have and people could simply travel quicker. The girl who died originally had been a telegraph operator, another important development of the nineteenth century. The young girl imagined a greater life for herself and railroads provided the means of pursuit. She left a steady job in the Midwest and moved to New York City to become a star, as so many people continue to do so today.

The economy was thriving and Florida used the surplus to fund new legislation that involved creating an arsenal of state troops, restricting child labor, building good railroads, and proposing to remove all current black residents inhabiting the United States and forcibly removing them to a new colony in Africa. Subsequently, Florida's bustling economy led not to a new African-American colony but instead to an increase in leisurely activities for whites such as golf. ","Florida has certainly not been a stranger to golf and continues to hosts thousands of resorts and courses. In 1900, the state claimed at least 10 competitive courses in Palm County, Florida.

The school gave awards for many different subjects, including Latin, French, German, Faithful Practice on Piano, and English composition. Seven young women received diplomas for Music and Book-keeping."," <em>The Staunton Spectator</em>, the Augusta County weekly newspaper, ran the article as the lead local article. The paper reported the programme for each day's celebration and all participants' names. For the concert section, the names were given in a standard formal formula of Misses M Bingham, C Woodard, A Wine.... For the awards section, there was a less formal tone. The professors and instructors had titles, but the paper did not list the young women's names with Miss and some were in their common form, such as Annie instead of Anne and Lizzie instead of Elizabeth. "," Some young women attended Augusta Female Seminary for health reasons, but there were women attending because they had families who believed Catharine Beecher's principle that women needed a practical education to be successful mothers and wives and, eventually, she believed, have a profession. For the expanding middle class created by industrialization and urbanization in America, there began a trend to send young women to schools because the importance of women's work grew. According to Janet James, the question of to what extent women should be educated was entertained by everyone and in magazines, novels, plays and books. Three young women received diplomas in Music, but four young women received diplomas in Book-keeping, an economically and domestically practical education. Baldwin had been a pupil at the school and her tenure as principal led to the name change to Mary Baldwin College, also reflecting the more public role of women as leaders in education in the second half of the nineteenth century and fulfilling Beecher's desire. That the young women came from so many different states indicates the new connectivity that Staunton experienced because of the railroads."],"display_date":"May 28, 1886 - June 1, 1886","search_date":"1886-05-30","locations":[{"id":13641,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3595,"title":"Uncle Tom\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1840-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["At some point in the early 1830's-all the author knows is before 1840-the <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, a county historical record, relate the death of a free black man who lived in Staunton, Virginia.

He never forgot that he was 'a hero of the Revolution,' and therefore never laughed and rarely smiled. Wadell goes on to point out that Tom liked to use big words. His main claim to celebrity though, came from his propensity to wear his Revolutionary War uniform-cocked-hat, coat, and red short-breeches- on the 4th of July. He promenaded the streets to the public amusement and his own profit in the way of small coin levied by him on patriotic citizens. In Wadell's words, it is possible to hear a hint of ugliness that is reminiscent of the way free blacks were upbraided in Franklin, Pennsylvania in Edward Ayers',<em> In the Presence of mine Enemies</em>. The free blacks were denigrated as saucy and were chided for being too confident in the presence of whites. The same sense of perceived threat can be seen in Wadell's words as well. Tom seemed to hold himself with the respect of a white man for having taken part in the Revolutionary war and so he is called Very pompous and is made fun of for using long words.

Led by Sergeants Hollinburger and Guy, the force of 12 men barged into the building only to find that the suspects had fled in the nick of time.         ","What they left behind in their haste to escape confirmed the Sergeants' suspicions: there was indeed a game of faro being played at the residence, and it probably was a regular occurrence that involved gambling of the most notorious, disgraceful kind. Among the evidence that had been left strewn before them, the officers found and confiscated very valuable and expensive items including fine alcohol, exquisite furniture, and the intricate game pieces themselves.         ","As luck would have it, not more than one month later, the police raided the E Street hideout again - this time, the gamblers were caught unawares.

Though only 6 was found on the table with the chips and cards, Jewell had 465 on his person, all of which he alleged to have received from his patients. Whether Jewell spoke the truth or not, the gamblers had been caught red-handed and the police confiscated everything at the crime scene, including the house itself.

First, many forms of vice proliferated in the United States, and certain regions were notorious for certain vices, like the West and the South were for gambling. Second, Dolan notes, official police forces in the United States were just gaining ground, generally having been instituted around only 50 years prior to this raid in D.C. Therefore, since social reform was becoming a major concern and crime was rampant, it is easy to understand Sergeant Hollinburger's dogged persistence in catching the secret party of gamblers."],"display_date":"December 19, 1877 - January 18, 1878","search_date":"1878-01-03","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3607,"title":"Spring of 1888 in the Diary of Miss Jennie Barker\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-03-31","end_date":"1888-03-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Miss Jennie Barker made note of each day of her life in the year 1888 by writing inside a diary given to her as a gift by her cousins on New Year's Day of that year. On March 31st, Jennie wrote, she and her friend Clara took a trip to the market in Washington, D.C. where they lived.  After marveling at the flowers and other wares, they decided to attend a nearby women's rights meeting. Jennie was not very impressed, despite being entertained by the goings on. She couldn't understand how women's lives and the state of things would be improved if women were given the right to vote. Not really very bothered, she and Clara finished their day with a trip to the dentist and dinner with family and friends.  ","Despite her nonchalance about the idea of women's suffrage, as viewed in this moment in her life, Jennie was an extremely self-empowered young woman. Her dedication to living a life full of education, religion, and social activities and events of all kinds is evident throughout her diary. As an upper-middle class young woman in Washington D.C., Jennie made a point to stay current on fashion, read novels such as '<em>Silas Marner'</em> or '<em>The Last of the Mohicans</em>' regularly, study and teach lessons for Sunday School, attend church and Christian Legion meetings, and do her domestic duties all at the same time.         ","Jennie's disinterest in the women's suffrage movement may then seem peculiar. However, Jennie was a Southerner, and the South was emerging from the Reconstruction Era in 1888. As the historian Louise M. Young explains, there was bitter resentment engendered in the South by the Reconstruction policies: a resentment that hardened into an emotional block against enfranchising women that was never resolved. Jennie enjoyed her life tremendously, from what she wrote in her diary, and enfranchisement wasn't going to add anything to her life that she felt she needed. In fact, the South felt that all the effort that had put forth in enfranchising black Americans during Reconstruction had created far more harm than good. Jennie was not alone in her ambivalence toward suffrage; many Southerners, in fact, <em>actively</em> targeted the suffragist groups for stirring up more controversy in a nation that was still recovering from the last."],"display_date":"March 31, 1888","search_date":"1888-03-31","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3609,"title":"The Truth About Mormonism\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-04-03","end_date":"1880-04-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was April 3rd, 1880. Ellen E. Dickinson was about to record the official statement of Mrs. Matilda Spaulding McKinstry's, describing her understanding of the connection between her father's Manuscript Found and the infamous Joseph Smith's Mormon Bible. The connection between the old romantic manuscript and the piece of religious writing was about to expose the real, and far less celestial, origins of the Mormon religion. This story could potentially blow the lid off of the mysterious genesis of Mormonism; Ellen was about to get the interview that would finally show that Joseph Smith's Mormon religion had its roots in an old, unpublished story written by an Ohio gentleman in 1812, and most certainly <em>not</em> in some gold plates divinely revealed to Mr. Smith.   ","Mrs. M. S. McKinstry was the daughter of one Reverend Solomon Spaulding, who happened to be Ellen's great-uncle. Naturally, Ellen's interest in her family's potential link to what was looking to be like a religious conspiracy was great. Rev. Spaulding created the Manuscript Found after discovering bones and relics in some mounds of earth behind their Conneaut, Ohio home when McKinstry was just a girl. As Ellen interviewed Mrs. McKinstry and recorded her statement, the events that began with the creation of the fantastical Manuscript Found by Rev. Spaulding and ultimately led to the creation of the Mormon Bible by Joseph Smith started to become clear; Mrs. McKinstry's account confirmed that family and friends who had heard the manuscript read aloud as a fictional narrative in 1812 noticed the gross similarities between it and the Mormon Bible.  Mrs. McKinstry affirmed that her father had lent the manuscript to a publisher for some time, at which point it could have been copied or replicated. Whatever the case, McKinstry was asserting that many who knew of the contents of the manuscript would swear it was the source of the Mormon Bible. Ellen had recorded the words that would end the debate on the validity of Mormonism for good. ","Ellen Dickinson's interview was extremely significant to the religious dynamic of the South in the late 19th century. Historians David F. Boone and David Buice explain that Mormonism never became mainstream in the South, and Mormons were persecuted for their unique religion which promoted scripture outside the Bible and espoused other departures from the Christian faith. The Mormons had migrated West in the 1830s due to persecution from Christians who felt threatened by their doctrine, but they began to conduct missionary work in the South after the Civil War. They were fairly successful in spreading the Mormon faith, and because of that success, they were persecuted even more violently than before. It was in this environment that Ellen Dickinson chronicled an interview that she hoped would invalidate Mormonism and eradicate the threat she believed it posed on Southern life."],"display_date":"April 3, 1880","search_date":"1880-04-03","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3642,"title":"The Marquis de Lafayette Visits Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1824-10-19","end_date":"1824-10-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Although a Frenchmen, the Marquis de Lafayette was a man dear to the hearts of many Americans in the early nineteenth century. He led American troops into battle during the Revolution, had sustained a wound at the Battle of Brandywine, and was instrumental in encouraging the participation of the French forces in the siege of Yorktown which led to the surrender of the British in 1781. Lafayette was not the only foreign officer to serve in the Continental Army, but he was revered for his generosity, friendliness, bravery, and genuine love for America, his adopted country. "," It is no wonder then that when in October of 1824 the Marquis, now quite an old man, landed in the city of Norfolk a great reception awaited him. The <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em> reported the spectacle awaiting Lafayette upon his landing which included an artillery salute, a triumphal arch erected in his honor, ranks of local militia, the assembled Corporate Societies of the Borough, and large groups of school children including those of the Female Orphan Society. All this made for what the Herald described as a truly animating picture. Additionally, the Herald reported that in the evening the businesses and dwellings of the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth were brilliantly illuminated, the latter municipality lighting 42 bonfires on the shores in honor of the Marquis. Sometime during his stay, a trip across the river to the city of Portsmouth was planned in order that Lafayette might pay a visit to the United States Naval Yard there. Louisa Emmerson, a life-long Portsmouth native wrote that the Trustees of Portsmouth welcomed him to their town, and with military honors conducted him to Crawford Street, where at its intersection with High, a fine triumphal arch had been erected in the General's honor. The arch itself was finely constructed and decorated with American flags, evergreen boughs, and flowers. Mrs. Emmerson wrote that before continuing to the Naval Yard, the procession stopped so that some school children of the city could recite a poem for the distinguished guest. "," Clearly, the Marquis' visit was quite an event for the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth. It certainly was not everyday that a small city was graced with the presence of one of the most venerated heroes of the Revolution, a man that Louisa Emerson described as second only to Washington. For more than a month, the Herald reported on the receptions of the Nation's Guest as he toured the cities of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Richmond, and Williamsburg. Day after day, near full pages of newsprint was spent describing his stay in each city with particular detail. The visit of the Marquis de Lafayette was perhaps the event of a lifetime. Norfolk was only one of many stops on Lafayette's Farewell Tour of America. From 1824 to 1825, Lafayette visited all twenty-four states in the Union. Along the way he was treated to numerous dinners and balls in his honor. He listened to speeches, he attended plays, he visited Revolutionary War veterans, and he laid the cornerstones to several monuments to the American Revolution including the Bunker Hill monument. No expense was spared in celebrating the return of the hero. "," The year 1824 was the perfect moment for Lafayette to make his return. America was experiencing a prosperous and peaceful period in its history. Cities were growing and industry was beginning to develop. The occasion of Lafayette's visit was a chance for the burgeoning American glass, printing, and pottery industries to flex their muscles as they churned out a variety of commemorative items emblazoned with the image of Lafayette. But why was all this attention and money being spent on an aging war hero that was not even a native citizen? Quite simply, Lafayette was one of the last remaining founding fathers. In celebrating Lafayette the man, the people of the United States were not just celebrating the accomplishments of the man but also the American ideals of liberty. Furthermore, the very fact that Lafayette was not a native son endeared him to the American people because he risked his life not to protect his native land, but out of a genuine love for freedom and democracy. Lafayette's visit was a chance for the American people to once again remember the sacrifices of the past and the ultimate triumph of democratic ideals."],"display_date":"October 19, 1824 - October 27, 1824","search_date":"1824-10-23","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3645,"title":"Steamship Lines of Norfolk, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1823-12-11","end_date":"1823-12-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The American Beacon and Norfolk and Portsmouth Daily Advertiser</em> of Thursday, December 11, 1823 contained two advertisements that concerned a new technology that would greatly change the speed with which Americans traveled their vast continent. Both advertisements concerned the establishment of steamship lines from Norfolk to important cities in the Chesapeake Bay region. The first of the two ads described the services available from the Baltimore Steam Boat Line which operated two ships, the Virginia and the Norfolk. The two ships offered voyages from Norfolk to Baltimore twice a week. The other advertisement of note in the Beacon concerned the weekly voyages of the steamship Potomac. This vessel plied a Chesapeake circuit, beginning in Washington, D.C. and stopping at Alexandria, Virginia before heading south to Norfolk. After stopping in Norfolk, the ship continued up the James River to harbors at City Point and Richmond, Virginia. The whole circuit took exactly one week, but the passenger could choose to ride any portion of it he or she desired, each segment of the trip of costing a different price. The fares ranged from 4 to 11 and included food and drink during the voyage. Although the price may have been a bit steep for the average Norfolk resident, steam travel made the voyage from Washington to Norfolk last only a little over a day.","The 1820s saw the emergence of steamboat travel on the Chesapeake Bay. Although in the early part of the decade, steamboats did little to affect the business of packet ships, they certainly attracted the attention of the citizens of port cities who noted both the curious sight of the little boats with their steam-belching smokestacks as well as the regularity with which the infant steam lines were able to provide services. Steamers such as the Virginia, the Norfolk, and the Potomac constituted this first wave of passenger steamers that began to appear all over the Chesapeake in the first few years of the 1820s. Slowly but surely, stubborn Chesapeake planters also began to realize the value of this mode of transportation that could be depended upon to get their harvests to port within one day in a variety of weather conditions. ","Technological advances like steamship travel and the later advent of rail travel in the 1830s contributed to the emergence of American tourism and the formulation of a distinct American culture. By the 1820s and 1830s, these advancements combined with a growing interest in America's natural attractions and a wealthy population resulted in the growth of American tourism. The construction of turnpikes led to more comfortable and faster stagecoach services, while steamboat travel made water routes both a faster and more reliable option. However, the price of travel in the early nineteenth century often deterred all but the wealthy. "," Tourism also changed how Americans viewed their relationship to the land. The formation of an American culture was greatly tied to American's perceptions of the landscape. Sears writes that from the beginning Americans had sought their identity in their relationship to the land they had settled. In the 1820s and 1830s, tourist attractions helped the young nation cultivate a sense of national culture in a country without the centuries-long traditions of Europe. In essence, tourism provided a means of defining America as a place and taking pride in the special features of its landscape."],"display_date":"December 11, 1823","search_date":"1823-12-11","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3678,"title":"Raising the Stakes in Southern Culture\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-08-12","end_date":"1839-08-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gambling has played a significant role in southern culture since the colonial period and still is an important part of our society today. During the 1830s and 1840s in central Virginia, betting and gambling were indicators of social status within the community. Those who bet on card games and dice were seen a part of the wealthy class. They had much more money and therefore were able to toss it around in different games of chance without worry. "," Games such as cards, backgammon and billiards were fun, but the real money lay in horse racing. On August 12, 1839, John W Cocke, a Virginia resident, wrote a letter to his friend Joseph Cabell from Nelson County concerning the business of horses. Mr. Cocke bought a breed mare from his friend Peyton for 250. The mare was nine years old, of pure blood, and was in much more superior form than the last mare Cocke had bought. It was descended from a distinguished group of racing horses, of which were very good breeders. In this letter Mr. Cocke offered this new mare to Cabell as a better bargain than one he had offered him before. Cocke also mentioned a colt by the side of the mare which was expected to be worth 125. Therefore, the purchase of the mare with the colt by her side would total at 375. Cocke encouraged Cabell to take him up on this offer and that one of his servants could come and pick them up whenever he liked. "," After the introduction of thoroughbreds in the mid-eighteenth century, the sport of horse racing took off in the South, especially in the farm country such as Central Virginia. With it came a whole new meaning of gambling. The stakes were higher as the men betting at the race track were seen as the best of the best among the wealthy plantation owners. It was no longer a game of chance, for horses could be bought, trained and bread into champions that rolled in the money for the southern owners. They took pride in their winnings as the races created competition among them and their fellow wealthy class citizens. John Cocke's letter gives insight into the personality and lifestyle of the plantation owners in central Virginia. Horse racing was seen as a sport only for gentleman. The letter demonstrates how important the idea of social status was to the people in Virginia and how through gambling southerners could exemplify their status to the rest of the community."],"display_date":"August 12, 1839","search_date":"1839-08-12","locations":[{"id":14081,"lat":37.7873885597,"lng":-78.8867512571,"zoom":9,"place":"NELSON, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3713,"title":"A Local Hero\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-11-22","end_date":"1891-11-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" In 1891, a little over one hundred years after the death of Staunton's founder, John Lewis, the city decided they should build a monument to their leader.  The paper gave no description of the desired monument, but gave bountiful detail of the great deeds and history of John Lewis and his family.  Lewis came from Ireland, and, according to tradition, brought red clover to the continent.  The Indians attributed this red color to the blood that the Lewis family spilled from the Indians they frequently fought.  The article expounded Lewis's heroism, durability, and courage.  Lewis had a simple tombstone that proclaimed him a true patriot, especially for producing five sons who fought in the Revolutionary War.  The proposed monument, according to the article, would serve as his resting place in Gypsy Hill Park.  The article concentrated on Lewis, but also provided many details of his father's and grandfather's roles in Europe.  Because Lewis had such a large family, the paper suggested that surviving direct descendants would gather for the ceremonies.  ","    <em>The Washington Post </em>ran this article with the subheading of The Romance of a Virginian, surely catching the eye of the readers.  This piece is filled with history, romance, war, and action.  A reader wanting a trip into the past or out of the city and into the country could find it in this article.  A reader also wanting to know of heroes before the Civil War would find this article less taxing. The fact that the paper does not describe the monument at all suggests that the monument is either very unattractive or boring, or that there were no plans yet for it. ","    After the United States had settled down to a degree from the Civil War, commemorative statutes and memorials building occurred. Kirk Savage has noted an that during the nineteenth century, people increasingly built commemorative monuments to preserve and possibly redefine memories and the past.  He argues that people felt the need to control the past and memories, and thus built monuments to portray what they believed and felt, even if the perceptions were not fully truthful.  The Staunton people wanted the correct and proper portrayal of the story for the founding of their city.  Though John Lewis had died long before, he had lived his life fighting for what he had believed and had descendants who fought for their rights.  Lewis was the type of hero that Augusta County wanted.  Having died long before the Civil War meant the County did not have to deal with the pain of the Civil War and task of properly honoring a man who fell in a war that defeated the South.  There was no problem of strong emotional ties or recent wounds.  Anyone in the North or the South could be proud of this man because they had no need to tie him to the present.  Building a monument to John Lewis and not one of the many Augusta County soldiers who died gave the County a past they could all respect and upon which they could agree. There would be no debate on whether Lewis was a Democrat or Republican, secessionist or Unionist.  John Lewis was a man for America and that was all the County needed.

It was not enough to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, but the joust was still a success for any knight who conducted himself with gallant bearing, majestic mien, and superior horsemanship.","After the Civil War, Maryland's image had deteriorated in the eyes of many southerners, who accused Marylanders of being submissionists to northern oppression. The joust became popular in southern Maryland because many Marylanders wanted to redeem their identity as southerners. In the 1890s, the journalist Hanson Hiss claimed that jousting may be ... the only remaining relic of that romantic and picturesque age which has furnished the bards of centuries with themes. Marylanders linked this romantic image of jousting with their image of the Old South, and through jousting, they renewed their southern identity. Many Maryland knights chose names like the Knight of the Lost Cause, the Knight of the Sunny South, and the Knight in Grey to show their sympathy for the plight of the southern states. Jousts strengthened ties to the South in other ways as well: this joust in Baltimore was used to raise money for yellow fever sufferers in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1878","search_date":"1878-09-05","locations":[{"id":6035,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE GEORGES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3745,"title":"A Great City\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-12-04","end_date":"1886-12-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By 1900, Staunton had a population of 7,289, and in 1886, the city already boasted of its greatness. <em>The Goodson Gazette</em>, a small circulation paper, ran a few lines devoted to the city's attractive characteristics. Not only did the city have electricity, but also they had streetlights on some of the main streets. They had a telegraph since the 1850's, but did not mention it, nor did they mention their railroad connections. Not only did the citizens of Staunton enjoy these technological advances, they had a strong arts program. The citizens enjoyed the finest Opera House in the State of Virginia and the largest and best band of music in the South. A troupe from New York even traveled to Staunton to perform, and during travel one of its members met her death in a train accident in the city and the show was cancelled. "," The newspaper featuring this article was not widely circulated and a news wire would not have any reason to pick up this story and publish it nationally. There were plenty of other cities just like Staunton in the United States and nothing special about the technology there, but the arts might have been. They had the telephone and failed to mention their railroad connections, but it had been there since the 1850's and had become such a part of everyday life in so many other areas that it was not unique to Staunton. They did not have to boast of their railroad because it was assumed that a great city like theirs would have a railroad. Space in the paper might have limited the lauding of the city, or there was nothing left to praise. The article mattered to the inhabitants though and could only have fostered their sense of accomplishment. "," Edward Ayers has noted Augusta County's position as a border state before the Civil War. Its position in the Great Valley created connections in the North and in the South. The Valley Turnpike provided direct access northward for everything. After the War, Augusta had the same geographic location, but a different mindset because the country held a different attitude. It enjoyed the economic prosperity that the railroads and other technology had brought, but the city was a Southern city at heart. The citizens had a relationship with the South and its customs but there was a constant exchange of ideas, people, and products with the North, too. They could not ignore the stories of Northern events in their newspapers or the information a traveler on the B&O brought from Cincinnati. The Northern influence was strong, but so was that of the South. The Virginia Central Railroad connected the cities in Virginia and strengthened the Southern hold. It is important to note that in the late 1880's when the North and South were separating culturally, the city boasted of their opera house and band in relation to the South. This statement was a sign to the readers that the citizens of Staunton still firmly held their connection to the South, even if they used technological inventions that held greater prominence in the North.

The day was filled with an atmosphere of goodwill and entertainment.  According to the local newspaper, <em>The Spectator</em>, upon arrival at the excursion's destination \"[t]he day was pleasantly spent in amusements and games of different kinds-ten pins, croquet, dancing, &c.\"  Such activity was a relatively common feature of the temperance movement in the American South after the Civil War.  The main goal of this movement was to eliminate, or at least reduce, alcohol consumption among the populace.  According to historian Thomas Pegram, the movement was filled largely with women who often engaged in public, grassroots activities to spread their message.  Lacking the right to vote and often appealing to the idea that they were the moral authority on the domestic scene, such women saw public action as an important way to express their ideals.","      Other broad trends in the post-Civil War South contributed to increased emphasis on temperance.  Historian Jack Blocker Jr. has noted that, especially in areas where economic growth was more rapid and the idea of the \"New South\" held sway, people began to realize that traditional drinking patterns were not compatible with the new culture of economic progress and productivity.  Many saw temperance as a step toward advancing the South into modernity.  In this context one can understand the positive manner in which <em>The</em> <em>Spectator</em> described the local temperance excursion: \"Many persons will remember the temperance excursion to Millboro with a great deal of pleasure so long as they shall live, and we hope they may all live to enjoy many more such occasions of joy and hilarity.\"  In using such words as \"pleasure,\" \"joy,\" and \"hilarity\" to describe this event, the editors of the Staunton<em> Spectator</em> displayed a sense of approval for what these temperance organizations were doing."],"display_date":"July 11, 1876","search_date":"1876-07-11","locations":[{"id":13640,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3868,"title":"Ad in Charleston Mercury Offers Ladies Benefits of an Academy Education\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-11-17","end_date":"1832-11-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Saturday, November 17, 1832 an ad appeared in the <em>Charleston Mercury</em> for a \"Young Ladies' French and English Academy\" which had just opened in Philadelphia. Such ads for girl's academies were not uncommon in the 1830s, for over the span of the early 1800s there was a growing trend for families to send their daughters to one of these schools if they could afford it. The popularity of these academies is best explained by the belief in the early 1800s that a good education was instrumental in preparing an upper class woman for her role in society and at home. Among the courses offered in the ad were \"French and English Languages, Sacred and Profane History, Ancient and Modern Geography, Mythology, and all the various types of Fancy and Ornamental Needlework.\" Such fields of study were common among these academies, although there were variances from school to school. The inclusion of needle work in the curriculum, however, is a bit uncommon, for although it was an important skill for most women in the antebellum period it was only taught in about thirty-percent of academies. In addition, courses in music and dance were offered in the ad but at an extra cost. This highlighted a common trend in the academy movement. While these fields were thought to be an important part of creating a lady, they lost value with a newer emphasis on more academic courses which had previously been for males only. Christie Farnham, in her <em>Educating the Southern Belle</em>, argues that this change occurred because of the changing ideas of the capacities of women. Because women were now thought to be just as capable as men they too could receive the same benefits of a liberal arts education as men did. And this was the main point of a woman's education, to make her a better person for her role in society. Thus, the knowledge gained in schooling was important in creating what was thought to be a proper lady."," In addition to the knowledge gained, a proper education was pivotal in creating a charming and sophisticated lady. And this highlighted an important role of a woman's education, as a sign of class distinction. One of the most prominent ways in which the upper-class distinguished itself from lower classes was with the refinement and knowledge gained from these institutions. It reinforced the idea that they were better than the people in these other groups by virtue of their knowledge and ability to interact in proper society. Such an ideal is played upon in the ad as when it states, \"Advantage will be taken of every opportunity to cultivate their minds, and qualify them for refined and polite society.\" Thus, in many respects a young ladies education was a defining symbol of her class status. Also, an education became a sign of class rank simply because of its immense cost. Tuitions were usually around 200 annually but could range much higher,  the ad's tuition is listed at the exorbitant price of 500, and this did not include other expenses such as clothing, transportation, extra classes, and so on. A woman's education was an expensive investment that could only be provided by those with high incomes. Therefore, women of high social status attended these academies in large numbers for it had become an integral part of their class rank and social status to do so.

A leather-bound book as tall as a man's forearm with robin's egg blue pages was then opened reverently, and a man's voice read aloud the last meeting's minutes.  After he finished, his hand held a pen poised above the first line of a new page, ready to record in flowing script the minutes of the newest meeting of the Philosophian Society.  ","The Society met to discuss important philosophical, historical, and contemporary issues.  During a typical meeting the members decided on a small question to discuss immediately and another question to more seriously and thoroughly debate at a later time.  For the postponed debate, specific members - often teams of two or more - were assigned positions in favor or against and given several weeks to prepare.","The March 22, 1861 meeting exemplifies the Philosophian Society's typical blend of topics.  The immediate discussion questioned whether Joan of Arc was an enthusiast or imposter.  For official debate, the men considered if \"a man [was] justified in obeying a law of his country which he [felt] to be morally wrong?\"  While the Philosophian Society covered both ancient and current issues, the minutes reveal that its members felt the latter to be more important because of the ratio of time and effort spent on each.  At the conclusion of the debate on April 5, 1861, the secretary recorded the Philosophian Society's decision: a man was <em>not</em> justified in obeying laws he felt morally wrong.  The Society's emphasis on contemporary issues also included the admittance of free  states into the Southern Confederacy, the taking of Fort Sumter immediately following secession, and the prohibition of the slave trade in the Southern Confederacy's constitution.  ","Furman's Philosophian Society mirrored the larger trend by addressing the divisive and emotionally charged topics of religion, politics, and war.  According to Jonathan Daniel Wells, debate was not limited to collegiate societies, like those at Furman or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but spread into the wider southern population.  Southerners established literary and debating societies to open dialogues in which they willingly and safely discussed such controversial issues for both education and entertainment.  Stephen Ash's depiction of John Robertson illustrates the importance of a safe forum.  John Robertson, an East  Tennessean who supported the Confederacy in a largely Unionist area, experienced violent and destructive persecution because of his beliefs.  Wells suggests that debating societies allowed people of different opinions to present their contradicting views in a civil manner without fear of retribution.","These southern societies applied their northern predecessors' models of organization and operation even as the gap widened between northern and southern states.  They grew in number and popularity as the middle class enlarged, serving an important centralizing and community-building function in a south divided by limited transportation systems and scattered populations.

He proposed the construction of a huge public park that would \"be enjoyed by thousands of all classes, without distinction.\"  The ideals of Romanticism and the Republican view of the importance of nature were at a peak among educated Americans at this time and this commentator proposed a way to manifest these ideals.  New York City, being the largest city as well as the informational center, certainly had many who supported the idea that nature should be valued and used respectfully to enrich one's mind and refresh one's spirit.  From these beliefs arose the idea for the creation of a huge park to be enjoyed by all the citizens of New York City.  This journalist, in <u>The Horticulturist, and Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste</u>, was one of the first to publish his opinions on the issue and explain the beginnings of such a park.  He criticized New York for not having enough open public spaces, and emphasized the Republican idea that nature is closely linked with virtue and comparing New York to cities in Europe, most of which had public parks.  The mayor of New York at the time, Ambrose Kingsland, had recently proposed 160 acres for a park.  This proposal was the first of its kind in America for park of such large scale, but the writer condemned this as being too small.  He suggested a 500 acre plot of land between the Harlem River and 39th, land that is in fact today part of Central Park.   Although this author's passionate essay on the importance of establishing a large park brought no immediate action, it marked the beginning of a huge public interest in such an endeavor.  Two years later, in 1853, there were still only 143 acres out of New York's 14,000 dedicated to public spaces, including cemeteries.  Many later authors continued the journalist's argument; one enumerated the reasons why such a park was a necessity for the city, being a haven for health, recreation, and driving and riding.  The park's approval and design finally took form in the late 1850's.  The proposal for Central Park had a huge impact on New York City as well as the patterns of urban development across the country."],"display_date":1851,"search_date":"1851-07-02","locations":[{"id":8924,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3902,"title":"Edwin Alderman and the Importance of History\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-03-07","end_date":"1892-03-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 7, 1893 Edwin Alderman gave a speech in Greensboro, North Carolina regarding the importance of history and historical records.

Although slavery instituted household demands on a pre-war plantation wife that were very different from that of a post-war southern wife, women were still expected to fill the same role within the family with or without the duties of managing a contingent of household slaves. Slavery provided southern white women an opportunity to embody certain leisurely ideals from a public view. The southern lady's ultimate accomplishment was to appear to be leading a quiet and leisurely lifestyle while discreetly managing and commanding the household, all without appearing to be bossy or controlling.

Over two hundred listeners gathered for a picnic at the local Fisher's Hill one July morning in 1888.  The event was relaxed with picnic food, a speech, and a Woodstock Cornet Band for entertainment.  Yet it focused on an issue of substantial importance: temperance.  As the local <em>Strasburg Weekly Dots</em> paper reported, the theme of the picnic was \"Liquor Traffic is a Crime\" and Virginians gathered in their common belief that alcohol was unnecessary and unjust.  ","The idea of temperance that the people of Shenandoah County promoted was not isolated to their area. Beginning around the 1830s, many Southerners, especially women, started to worry about the negative aspects of alcohol consumption.  One of the most important temperance organizations was the Women's Christian Temperance Union, created in 1874.  Other local temperance efforts, such as this picnic, occurred throughout the nineteenth century.  ","Religious and racial tensions plagued many temperance efforts. Most of the temperance women were evangelical Protestants who often criticized the Irish Catholics and Germans frequently associated with alcohol consumption and production.  Discord also existed between blacks and whites, as some white women claimed that black men were especially a danger with alcohol.  Although these apprehensions existed, for the most part the temperance movement was successful in incorporating women of various \"socio-economic, racial, religious, and national identities.\" Many women used the Bible to justify temperance; they claimed that it was God's plan for women to help the men and \"most commonly likened women...to Christ's apostles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dots</em> does not mention the demographic or religious background of the picnic's guests having had any effect; in fact, it says there \"was no disorder.\" This furthers the idea that locals were unified by a common aspiration. ","Although temperance is traditionally associated with women against alcohol consumption, at the time, it was just as important in promoting white women's overall equality.  For example, the WCTU helped educate women \"to take on public personas because the nineteenth century offered [them] limited formal education in rhetoric.\"  Often, people saw the strive for equality as radical.  Thus, as historian Carol Mattingly writes, \"newspaper reporting focused largely on issues of gender rather than on the subject of temperance\" which she says \"reflects a general discomfort with women's changing roles.\"  The <em>Strasburg Weekly Dot</em>s, on the other hand, presents an article focused on the issue of temperance as opposed to gender.  This is likely because the focus of their gathering was \"not yet Congress, Legislature, Judge, Jury, Church or state;...but the Rum Traffic, was the prisoner at the bar.\" Long-term changes for women, such as the Nineteenth Amendment, would not occur for some time. Still, the nineteenth-century temperance movement fueled the steps towards gender equality.  Events such as the Shenandoah County Temperance Picnic, although small, represented a larger movement that took place throughout the South."],"display_date":"June 28, 1888","search_date":"1888-06-28","locations":[{"id":14271,"lat":38.8584536791,"lng":-78.5704125087,"zoom":9,"place":"SHENANDOAH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3965,"title":"Education by Gender\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-03-01","end_date":"1856-03-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Charleston Mercury</em> ran an advertisement in March 1856 for the creation of a \"Preparatory Military School\" in Yorkville, South Carolina. Though the school was set to open nine years later, in 1865, the headmasters were thinking far ahead. The basic courseload for the school had arithmetic, history, geography, and grammar, while the advanced lessons included surveying, mythology, French, and, interestingly enough, brawling. The military instruction encompassed the command of squad and company as well. Ironically, the school seemed well prepared to deliver its students into the \"Military Institutions of the state,\" even though the administrators certainly had no way of knowing that a bloody and brutal war would be nearly over by the time the school was scheduled to open.","Though the advertisement specified ages for its pupils - between twelve and eighteen - there was no gender requirement. It is obvious that the students intended for this sort of education were male, since females were not allowed to fight in the army. Although the majority of Southern students - and therefore Southern schools - were male, there also existed a rather large number of female educational institutions. These schools were very rarely co-ed; young men and women were taught separately and, for much of the nineteenth century, different subjects. Women learned the French style of education, which focused primarily on needlework, the French language, and other ladylike occupations, but as times changed, both men and women at higher educational levels pushed for the same training for young women as was already in place for young men. Though military prep schools certainly remained an exception, women began to learn arithmetic, geography, grammar, and other liberal arts topics, instead of the French topics. Even if men were still the main focus of Southern educational systems, the instruction of women was not far behind. Indeed, Southerners who could afford an education were denied nothing based simply on gender.

General Robert E. Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia surrendered to the Union and effectively destroyed any chance of her beloved Confederacy succeeding in its war effort and becoming a separate and distinct nation. For Emma, the only highlight of the month appeared in the assassination of President Lincoln: \"After all the heaviness and gloom of yesterday this blow to our enemies comes like a gleam of light.\" A common, unfortunate theme throughout her April diary entries was the rationing of food and a severe lack of funds available for more than the basic necessities. Though wearing homespun versus store-bought clothing items was a minor disturbance compared to the lack of food, her accustomed wealthy way of life was ruined. LeConte tried to keep some of her former lifestyle of leisure by trading French lessons for German coaching with a family friend, but as she realized that her usual \"Old South\" lifestyle was gone forever, her desperation set in.","The Confederate surrender would be the start of only harder times for South Carolinians like the LeConte family as well as other Southerners. Lee's formal surrender at Appomattox brought down the Confederacy in one written swoop. Economic times were already tough in the South, as most white men had mobilized with the Confederate armies and were unable to keep a steady eye on their farms at home; meanwhile, slaves voluntarily freed themselves from bondage without their masters' watch. Most women were powerless to run family businesses. The combination of these situations dropped the South into destitution even before the Civil War ended. Unpaid debts between Southerners and annihilated commercial centers such as Charleston and Columbia added further to the South's woes. Impoverishment became the rule - not the exception - in the ex-Confederate states, a situation that remained until the twentieth century.

Though her concern for her father's ill health was quite natural, it was quite surprising to learn of her distaste for such a grand and important Southern city such as Charleston and her accompanying lack of \"any desire to visit town.\" Her large amount of leisure time, however, exposes Mrs. Huger's status as an elite white Southern woman. This detail is further expanded when she asked Mrs. Lowndes to buy her some material the next time she went to town \"for my gown, which I cannot finish\" without the proper material. ","Mrs. Huger's time for leisure in Southern society is hardly a surprise. Though rich white women were by far the minority of their gender in the antebellum South, they are the main subjects of the majority of modern books, movies, and even textbooks on the region. Though not all of their activities were leisurely - planter-class women did have to manage house slaves and all home duties - they did have a good deal of time available to devote to visiting friends, correspondence, and political campaigns. The elevated role of rich white women took a devastating turn, however, after the collapse of the Confederacy and the emancipation of slaves. As plummeting cotton prices forced the South into economic destitution, many women did not have the option of maintaining their work-free Southern womanhood and survived solely because they helped their husbands in the fields. Labor would have been considered absolutely improper for elite women before the war. Not only were the former Southern belles working in the fields, but Southern women were also responsible for the upkeep of the family home - this time without the help of slaves. Domestic black help could then not be obtained without the white women paying  decent wages and understanding that their former demands for complete submission by their workers would not be acknowledged.

Johnston's photograph gallery in Wytheville, Virginia. Her portrait, like the other nine in the 1881 collection of photographs from western Virginia was taken as a solo frame and was presented as a \"carte-de-visite,\" or postcard.  Although the portrait did not reveal anything about Stella Haas except her hometown, the image implied much about Southern life after 1877. Reconstruction brought many changes to those who lived below the Mason-Dixon line and the influence of Northern culture and ideals was quite apparent in this portrait of Ms. Haas. ","    Stella's photo was taken a few years after Reconstruction and there was obvious Northern influence in what she chose to wear. On the day of her sitting, Stella was dressed in a tailored pin-stripe jacket with a slim fitting floor-length skirt. This outfit, almost the opposite of what Southern women wore in the antebellum South, reflected how the North influenced life after the Civil War. Ms. Haas was not dressed in a hoop skirt with excessive amounts of lace and embellishment, typical of most Southern women in the antebellum South. Rather, her outfit was more demure and humble, and though the photograph was taken in black and white, her ensemble did not appear to be very colorful.","    Southern women were expected to be pure, graceful, and delicate, while these social standards of Southern femininity may have continued into the late nineteenth century, Stella Haas represented very few of them. Her face was expressionless, but this was more reflected in her modest and harsh visage.  Although these characteristics suggest that Stella was not of affluent means, this was probably not the case. Photography was a developing medium in the late nineteenth century and not many people could afford to spend money on the material activity except for middle class and relatively wealthy. Fashion often characterized a culture and the elite South prior to 1877 was defined by an emphasis on extravagance and adornment, especially in peoples' dress. Stella Haas' portrait exemplified none of these antebellum qualities and it appears that the Northern emphasis on practicality and modesty became more prevalent in the South after Reconstruction.

In Hampden-Sidney College's yearly publication, The Kaleidoscope, students shared stories of pranks, sports victories, and rigorous course loads that could easily have been written by a college student today.  However, the influence of Greek life was much greater in the nineteenth century.  Especially at all-male schools, like many of the best were, fraternities were not an option, they were a way of life.","    The first collegiate society bearing Greek letters was founded at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia in 1776.  This fraternity, Phi Beta Kappa, was founded as a secret organization with the express purpose of exploring and discussing literature with the other members of the society.  Phi Beta Kappa remained the only Greek letter organization on the collegiate scene until the founding of Chi Delta Theta at Yale in 1821.  Chi Delta Theta had a similar philosophy to Phi Beta Kappa, but was generally too large to encourage bonding and brotherhood amongst members.  The first fraternity that bore any resemblance to the modern social fraternity was Kappa Alpha, founded at Union College in 1825.  In 1827, Union was also the cradle for the creation of Sigma Phi and Delta Phi.  These three organizations became known as the Union Triad and were the models for other Greek letter organizations to follow.","    The first social fraternity to charter in the South was known as the Mystical Seven, and was founded at Emory College in 1841 and at Franklin College, later known as the University of Georgia, in 1844.  However, the first distinctively \"southern\" fraternity, WWW, was founded at the University of Mississippi in 1842.  The second fraternity to be deemed southern in nature was Sigma Alpha Epsilon, founded at the University of Alabama in 1856.  The dichotomy between southern and northern fraternities became clear during the Civil War.  Collegiate activity was largely suspended during the war, and although no new fraternities were founded, national pride became instilled in the brotherhoods.  After the war, many southern schools refused to re-charter fraternities that were founded in the North, and even went so far as to establish the Southern and Northern Orders of the Kappa Alpha Fraternity. ","    Fraternal rivalries existed not only between northern and southern fraternities, but also between fraternities at individual colleges.  As the Kaleidoscope shows, Hampden-Sidney chose to form a Pan-Hellenic council with representatives from each fraternity to ameliorate feuds between the young men.  The \"spirit of Pan-Hellenism\" at Hampden-Sidney was preserved through this council, and Pan-Hellenic councils still exists at many Universities today.  ","    In the grand scheme of American history, fraternities have played a much larger role than that any other collegiate social clubs have.  During the nineteenth century, the southern fraternity grew from a simple social organization to an institution used to perpetuate southern ideals and lifestyles.  Some of these ideals are very positive, such as honor, scholastic achievement, and brotherhood.  However, the southern fraternity has also become a vehicle to preserve less progressive ideals, such as racism, classism, and geographic discrimination.

Upon Elizabeth's move to Maysville, Kentucky, in hopes of a more prosperous life for her family, Victoria and Elizabeth agreed they would write to one another and stay in touch over the years.  Victoria and Elizabeth had been raised with similar influences and therefore shared views on how their children should be raised.  Proper manners, religion, and an English education were a must.  As Elizabeth's children grew older, she had to take on the role of a teacher, and she strove to provide her children all the important amenities of a thorough English education.

In the early 1800s American found reassurance in widely shared perceptions of manhood and womanhood. According to historian Jeanne Boydston,  \"in the tenets of manhood were the promises of an orderly political life, and economic stability, and of the material welfare of the family.  The perceptions of womanhood, on the other hand, promised private morality and sentiment and the coherent transmission of culture from parent to child.\"  This \"republican\" system of polarities was a comforting way of conceiving secular society. As the principals of republicanism rose in importance, American society increasingly came to support the idea that women needed to understand clearly and embrace these values because they were responsible for passing them on to their children.  Women were fully responsible for teaching children but values and academic subjects that were not learned from helping their fathers around the farm.

In the song <em>North Carolina: A Call to Arms,</em> the author called for the \"sons of Carolina...to wake from [their] dreaming,\" and insisted that they could not procrastinate as the \"minions of Lincoln\" streamed down upon them.

Reports from colonels and generals of battles did not include much about soldiers who deserted or retreated from battle; instead, most of the reports idolized the heroics of the soldiers as a unit, and showed their solidarity and cohesion in the face of a brutal war.  Encouragement for the war was necessary for Confederate troops with all of the horrors that come along with war.  Dissent was looked down upon and rarely reported to ensure that it would not spread through the ranks and cause an internal collapse.

Lincoln's motives were to first save the nation from dismemberment, and secondly to rid the nation of the great social ill of slavery.

Douglass had gone to the White House to discuss discrimination that black soldiers faced during the Civil War. Lincoln had acknowledged that the unequal pay black soldiers received warranted some anguish, but Lincoln believed that equality for black soldiers had to come gradually.

The treaty, or rather collective of three treaties signed at Medicine Lodge, Kansas in October of 1867, was a comprehensive peace settlement between the U.S. government and the Plains Nations of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.  Major provisions in the treaty were that the nations would move onto reservations in the Indian Territory and that the United States would help them become \"civilized,\" providing them with necessary supplies and instruction.","            At Medicine Lodge, most of the Native American nations wanted peace, but did not agree with the constrained reservation system that limited autonomy and pushed white civilization upon them.  Among the more outstanding spokesmen of Medicine Lodge were Chiefs Ten Bears and Satanta, who represented two of the most prominent nations, the Comanche and Kiowa, respectively.  Their two voices well addressed specific problems with the proposed reservations, but also addressed broader issues of Native American identity, prospects, and the nature of their relations with whites.","            Satanta, one of the major figures in the armed conflicts leading up to Medicine Lodge, argued very emotionally and emphatically: \"I love the land and the buffalo and will not part with it. I want you to understand well what I say.  Write it on paper.\"  Satanta argued that the land, the hunt, and the independence from \"medicine lodges\"-the churches and schools advocated by whites-were essential elements of his culture, his means for happiness.  Secluded from this lifestyle, he said, \"We grow pale and die.\"  He also emphasized the way in which whites interacted with Native Americans, saying that while he was open and honest with the commissioners, they were deceitful and unreliable.  Yet far worse for Satanta were the U.S. troops who, he said, \"cut down my timber; they kill my buffalo.\"","            Ten Bears was more ready for peace and as such his speech was gentler in tone, beginning with an expression of warm feelings towards the commissioners.  Yet he too blamed the United States for a great deal, saying that it was they who started the conflict: \"There has been trouble on the line between us...but it was...you who sent out the first soldier and we who sent out the second.\"  Ten Bears also broadly criticized the plans of the commissioners, rejecting the reservation scheme with houses and medicine lodges.  He stressed the freedom and happiness of life in the prairie and contrasted it with living and dying as the whites suggested, hemmed in by \"walls\" and \"enclosures.\"  ","            Ten Bears reiterated Satanta's consideration of culture, saying: \"I lived like my fathers before me, and like them, I lived happily.\" He further defended his right to this life based on the promise made by the \"Great White Father\" (the President), which guaranteed the permanence of land rights as they then stood.  Finally, Ten Bears argued that far from removing his people to a better location, the proposed reservation site was \"too small\" and that the Texans had taken away the land and timber that best supported prosperity.  The final words of his speech summarized the plight of Native Americans in powerful, fatalistic terms, saying, \"The white man has the country which we loved, and we only wish to wander on the prairie until we die.\" ","            Though not actually faced with extinction, the nations of Medicine Lodge were in the midst of such upheaval that the period could justifiably be called the end of an age for their peoples.  Arguments like those of Satanta and Ten Bears at Medicine Lodge were not new; Native Americans had long defended their essential rights, sovereignty, and freedom-political rhetoric that is itself very telling as it specifically caters to Western ideology.  Yet the virtue of these values were not enough to protect Native Americans in a seemingly intractable clash of cultures, wherein they were opposed by both U.S. governmental policy and the very real \"shock of civilization\" that saw the buffalo hunted almost to extinction while frontier settlements swept across Native Americans' lands, dominating them in trade and constantly fighting with them.  In the twenty years after Medicine Lodge, Native American sovereignty and their free, unsettled lifestyle, as espoused by Satanta and Ten Bears, were both rejected by the United States.  The two major blows came in the shape of a Congressional act in 1871 that ended treaty-making with Native Americans, and the Dawes Severalty Act in 1887, which divided up the communal land into individual allotments and made Native Americans U.S. citizens."],"display_date":"October 19, 1867 - October 20, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-19","locations":[{"id":4553,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Unorganized, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4107,"title":"Making Their Own Way \n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-02-28","end_date":"1849-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["       In 1849 a law was passed in the state of Delaware that threatened to sell free blacks into a year of servitude if they were \"idle and poor\" and remained unemployed.

Peale's Philadelphia Museum of 1804. The Museum was one of the first of its kind and had been founded in 1785. Through a series of seven different rooms, a visitor was greeted with hours of entertainment and knowledge. By entering the \"Long Room,\" one was dazzled by hundreds of different birds arranged in glass cases. In the \"Quadruped Room,\" the most remarkable of the hundreds of stuffed animals were the buffalo, the grizzly bear, the ant-eater, and the orangutan. According to the first hand account of an unknown author of an article in The Literary Magazine and American Register, the Philadelphia Museum in this respect was worthy of comparison with the \"most celebrated\" similar institutions of Europe. The author also described how the institution was one of \"highest degree\" and wrote adoringly about each little detail the museum had to offer. These details consisted of pamphlets that described the famous Mammoth skeleton, wax figures dressed in clothing from various Indian tribes, casts of famous statues from antiquity (such as the Apollo de Belvidere), painted backgrounds for the animals displayed, paintings of \"distinguished personages,\" an organ for visitors to play, and even a personal souvenir of drawn profiles for visitors. The author made it clear through the entire article that this institution was one meant to be taken seriously as a model for other institutions. ","    Similar to the views expressed by this author, historians agreed that C.W. Peale's contributions to the museum world greatly inspired the field. Peale did not only collect and present the objects, he thought of new ways to display them. He was one of the first to use artificial lighting mixed with natural light inside a museum, organize glass cases a certain way, and learn taxidermy practices that were not common place. The preservation of hundreds of different organisms and species by Peale's own invention was another testament of his genius as a curator and museum owner.  By creating a smoothly run museum, Peale took the initiative of creating a public space that would provide education to the people and entice them to return again and again. Every action Peale took was a way to bring visitors into his museum and by having attractions like the Mammoth skeleton, the public's loyalty to the museum was guaranteed. ","    The Mammoth skeleton was excavated by Peale from the Hudson River Valley in 1801 and it caused quite the stir among local residents. Since the bones of the skeleton were of a size unseen before, a mystery surrounded them. Some naturalists speculated that the mastodon skeleton was evidence that there could be more of these creatures living in the American West. Others believed that the creatures had disappeared from America as a blessing from God upon the new nation. In the minds of some people, the mastodon was a physical representation of the conquering, powerful American spirit. The discovery of these bones sparked a race for the rest of the nation to search for more archeological finds. Feverishly, Americans tried to create their own spirit through the objects found in their land. Obviously, because of all this mystery and hype surrounding the mastodon bones, the exhibit was widely popular in Peale's museum. In fact, Peale used this mystery to heighten the suspense and drama in his own exhibit. According to historical sources, Peale would introduce people to the mastodon skeleton as, \"huge as the frowning precipice, cruel as the bloody panther, swift as the descending eagle, and terrible as the Angel of Night.\" Pamphlets were also distributed in the museum that disregarded the more mythical portion of the mastodon skeleton and delivered what scientific facts they had about the skeleton.  As information over time changed, the mastodon skeleton of the Philadelphia Museum continued to fascinate viewers throughout the ages with its mystery and proportions. By creating a museum where the visitor could gain a sense of American pride, nationality and a sense of education, Peale founded an institution that could be looked at for inspiration throughout the centuries.

The Ocklawaha River flows north from Central Florida, ending near Palatka, Florida. The river stretches over 100 miles, flowing into several large lakes in the Central Florida region. In the 1860s, the Ocklawaha River was cleared to provide a steamboat transportation route to Silver Springs, Florida, the end of a popular tourist journey (especially for Northerners) on the river. Many of the people who describe the entrancing nature of Ocklawaha River traveled it by steamboat. Once the railroad arrived in Silver Springs, however, the Ocklawaha River steamboat route was abandoned.","            The exotic nature and beauty of the Ocklawaha  River inspired one notable poet, Robert Paine Hudson, who wrote lyrics about the river in a poem titled \"Ocklawaha\". The lyrics were published on May 25, 1881 in Sanford, Florida and later published into a book of poetry titled <em><u>Love, Home, and the Southland</u></em>. The lyrics describe the people who traveled the river, such as the Indians who \" 'Gainst the white man here rebelled\", and Hudson writes about how the white man pushed the Indians to vacate their land. Again and again, Hudson reiterates the beauty of the Ocklawaha, \"What though we bade young Spring adieu, there's left a still more glorious hue\".

The statement is only one of many Hardy presents in his 1887 book, <em><u>Oranges and Alligators</u></em>, that illustrates the verbal abuse other U.S. regions heaped on Florida. In defense of the state, Hardy wrote about the exotic nature and beauty of Florida that he discovered on his own journeys through the area. ","            Hardy relays an interesting personal story in this document about the assumption that Florida was malaria ridden. While Hardy was traveling in Orlando, one man in his group fell ill with a high fever and aching pains. The group assumed he had contracted malaria. In response one gentleman said, \"Malaria?...He can't have malarial fever, for there is no malaria here-Unless, he has been imprudent enough to be out-of-doors after sunset.\" ","            Insurance companies were as particular then as they are now. To the Hardy group's dismay, they discovered that because of the risk of malaria, most insurance companies declined to provide life insurance below a latitude line of 30° south. At that time the group was traveling considerably below 29° south. The rumor that malaria was rampant in Florida was not entirely false. Gordon Patterson's scientific journal stated that mosquitoes bred well in the many bodies of water covering the state. It took a yellow fever epidemic in 1888, one year after the publication of Hardy's book, for the government of Florida to develop a board of health for disease control. ","            Alligators were a big attraction for Florida tourists in 1887, just as they are today. While Hardy was traveling by Lake Maitland, a young man in his group heard of an alligator that had been spotted by the bank of a lake near a neighborhood. The young man, thinking it was dangerous, found it, shot it, and brought it home to display. Soon after, a resident wrote him a letter, saying he had, in fact, slaughtered a pet alligator the resident had raised from a baby. Hardy's description of the whole scene includes the observation that at the time, alligators were popular domestic pets in South Florida. Hardy also states that it was possible to mail an alligator to the North (alive, unless it died in the process); all it took was a box to put it in. Promoters pushed alligators as ideal domestic pets; they only needed to be fed once a week."],"display_date":1887,"search_date":"1887-07-02","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"United States History to 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":9,"school_id":5}},{"id":4216,"title":"War Poetry Lives On in Song\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-01-01","end_date":"1867-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Many Southerners before the Civil War viewed the Northerners as tyrants similar to King George III.

To Mrs. Virginia Clay, wife of Senator Clement Clay of Alabama, the fifty-five year old Houston was a \"Senatorial Hercules\" and a \"roughish old hero\".  In her book, <em>A Belle of the 50's</em>, Mrs. Clay explains Houston's whittling habit saying that \"a seemingly inexhaustible supply of soft wood was always kept in his desk [in the Senate] and out of it he whittled stars and hearts and other fanciful shapes.\"  One day, she received an envelope while she watched in the gallery of the Senate and \"within a tiny, shiny, freshly whittled wooden heart, on which the roguish old hero had inscribed, 'Lady I send thee my heart Sam Houston'\" (99).  She further mentioned his youthful nature as she explained that \"nothing amused him more than to reduce to a confused silence those who surrounded him, by suddenly addressing them in all sorts of unknown words\" in a number of Indian dialects (100).  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Sam Houston to Mrs. Clay she found in his attire as \"he wore a leopard-skin vest, with a voluminous scarlet neck-tie, and over his bushy grey locks rested an immense sombrero... wrapped around his broad shoulders he wore a gaily coloured Mexican <em>serape</em>, in which scarlet predominated\" (98- 99). ","Numerous reasons explain why Sam Houston would wear a serape as Marion Wisehart in <em>Sam Houston: American Giant</em> wrote, \"Senator Houston wore a bright Mexican serape to protect his back and chest from drafts\" (497).  Or perhaps with the time he spent near Mexico, Senator Houston became more comfortable in that clothing style.  Regardless, the same man that Mrs. Clay describes seems very different than the General who led an army of Texans to victory at San Jacinto.  Sam Houston acted as statesman, politician, and soldier.  He fought in the War of 1812, governed Tennessee and later Texas as Governor of two different states, became elected twice as the President of the Republic of Texas, and worked as a Senator for Texas fighting against succession (though a slaveowner himself).  Wisehart describes another aspect of Houston as \"he could talk extemporaneously for two or three hours and hold his audience in thrall.  After sleeping all night on the cold, damp ground, he could sit on a log and write powerful appeals to stimulate patriotic ardor or eloquent petitions in his own defense\" (vii).  As explained in <em>The Autobiography of Sam Houston,</em> \"It is of such violent contrasts that an epic figure is made\" (xv).  The diversity in the behavior of Sam Houston can not be separated.

A few men stand at ready to insert the cannonballs before a misty field that would later be covered with smoke.  Despite the gritty quality, the focus on the soldiers faces is striking.  One can clearly see even the expressions of the men.

","Perhaps Southerners felt as if they had nothing to celebrate.  Divisions were hidden away, simmering just below the surface in honor of the occasion.  Republicans feared that every Southern Democrat was a traitor. Southern Democrats feared that every Republican wanted to remake the South in a subservient Northern model.  Some Southerners were still without full political rights and James G. Blaine aggravated the problem by proposing Jefferson Davis' exclusion from the Amnesty Bill.  The Civil War had not put an end to racial conflicts, especially in the South.  While the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan fought openly and violently against all efforts toward racial integration, the Union League pushed newly freed slaves and other blacks into political office, employing black militias for protection.

By 1876, the United States proved it would last as a nation, despite the Civil War.  Public education was on the rise, and the World Fair showcased American ingenuity and increased world interest in the nation.  Scholar John Gladstone claimed that \"the grand Centennial Exposition of 1876 [in Philadelphia] managed to divert the attention of the country away from the 'moral collapse in business and government.'\"  Other Northern celebrations were devoted to industrial progress, education, and humanitarianism, to show the greatness of America's becoming.  For newly liberated blacks, the Centennial provided the first opportunity to prove to the nation their extreme importance in its formation.

Davis of Gadsden,  South Carolina had to do some calculations.  While planning for his trip he took out his 1838 edition of <em>Mitchell's Traveller's Guide through the United States</em>.  The brown three by five inch book contained the mileage for all common stagecoach routes in the country as well as information on the few established railroads and canals.  The book was published in Philadelphia and lists the routes in an interesting order.  Rather than going alphabetically by state, the guide started in the Northeast, traveled down the coast to the Southeast, then moved North into the old Northwest.  In the back was a fragile foldout map of the Eastern United States. While generally accurate, there are several geographical defects in a Midwest scattered with the names of relocated Indian tribes.  Additionally, since the book was written in 1836, but not printed until 1838, Texas was included as a part of Mexico even though it was considered and independent country by the publication date.  Jonathan used the blank pages inside of the cover to work out travel plans and decided the best route was to go through Branchville, Augusta and Warrenton.  Doing some quick math, he found that the 149 miles to Warrenton would cost him 6 cents per mile or 7.94.  He then added the 7.40 it would cost for the 74 miles from Warrenton to Milledgeville, bringing Jonathan's journey to a total of 15.34 for a 223 miles.","            As the United States grew larger and more interconnected, transportation systems also grew more elaborate.  In 1838 the main mode of transit was the stagecoach, but canals and railroads were also beginning to transport both people and goods on more regular schedules.  By the 1830s travel for the sake of enjoyment or adventure was available due to lowering stage coach fees. Travel guides promoted exploration by offering descriptions of different areas along with practical information such as the mileage between routes.  Despite the varying lengths of stagecoach routes, it was customary to leave at four or five in the morning before the sun came up because at the start of a journey neither passengers nor stagecoach driver knew exactly what they would find on the road or how long the journey would take.  Weather conditions alone could change a short, quick journey into hours of jostling down a rutty, muddy road on the verge of flooding, and it was not rare for stagecoaches to flip if they encountered deep water.","            On multi-day journeys travelers like Jonathan stayed overnight at taverns along the way when there were no friends or family in the area.  Along with distances and fares, Jonathan also used the margins of his travel guide to jot down the names of acquaintances with which he might stay, as well as the names and rates of some friendly local taverns.  Many of the largest and best furnished taverns in the South had been standing for over a century, and specific locations might be known by travelers for particularly good food or rum.  Taverns fed and lodged visitors of all kinds.  They served as a unique venue where famous statesmen and ordinary men might share a newspaper (those unable to read pretending to understand), dine together, and enjoy the same entertainment in the taproom for a night.

Simms believed that generations to follow would remember the triumph of the women who exemplified the best qualities of both men and women.","            The Civil War years offered women in both the North and the South new ways to participate in society.  A small number disguised themselves as men and snuck onto the battlefield, others became nurses, and still more stayed at home to sew uniforms and pack provisions.  From the start of the war in 1861, magazines such as <em>Harper's Weekly</em> encouraged women to sacrifice their resources, time, and families for their nation.  After kissing their husbands and sons farewell, women set up domestic labor groups to fulfill their patriotic duties and show courage even while far removed from the battlefield.  This courage demanded that women suffer emotional wounds sometimes considered more harmful than the physical wounds suffered by the men they loved.","            As the war progressed, resources in the South grew slim and women became impatient.  As more sons and husbands died, women began to question their role in society without a man - should they devote themselves wholeheartedly to the war or fight for their own freedom?  The elite women's dresses grew dingy while the lower classes struggled to find bread and coffee for each night's meal.  Over time sewing groups turned into political discussions, and the boldest women began writing letters to government officials and army officers beseeching them to bring the men home.  Others wrote poems and prayers published in magazines, trying to impress the magnitude of their suffering.  Letters to their husbands begged them to come home to protect their families.  Southern women feared God was no longer on their side.  As they debated whether it might be easier on the battlefield than at home, they tried to find the balance between gentleness and valor required of them.

Furman delivered a speech for opening convocation on the anniversary of Johnson Female Seminary in August of 1850.  He addressed the crowd of students with the words, \"women's sphere lies within the limits of private life. Home is the true scene of her influence.\"  He stressed the meaning of women as mothers, mistresses, advisors, physicians, judges, and educators.  James Furman advised the women of the college to take full advantage of their education at the seminary in order to become better mothers for the future generation. He also, mentioned his fears of women in the public sphere of a man's world.  He believed women did not belong in places like an autonomy class or the rough atmosphere of poll boxes around voting time.  Religion was applied generously to the advice he gave women on their duties. He challenged women to use the Bible as, \"the true Lady's Book,\" to maintain virtue and honesty, instead of finding merit in aesthetic assets, like beauty and the comforts of luxury.  James encouraged the students to \"cultivate habits of neatness and order,\" so that it would better the skill sets they would require for God's design.  He finished his speech by reminding the young woman of the seminary to use the influence of a woman to demonstrate the goodness of God and to set Christian examples for their future husbands. ","        James C. Furman's address to the students of Johnson Female Seminary indicated the view of women in the mid-nineteenth century as a companion to men and a devoted mother.  J.M.C. Breaker, another minister in the neighboring county of Greenville agreed, when he addressed the domesticity of the home and the role of women as \"angels of mercy\" in his speech for the Greenville Baptist Female College in 1858. Christianity provided the foundations of this concept as the secular world became a place for men to leave the home and pursue occupations separate from home life.  Women were to carry the ideology of goodness, purity, and the humanity of men, by their behavior in private and public life.  ","      When Furman mentions the Bible as a \"lady's book\" he is associating God's word to a lady's journal.  Popular in the day, women's magazines were used to demonstrate correct manners, give advice on child rearing, and to guide women through their daily chores as caretaker and submissive companions.  Lady's journals, like <em>Godey's Lady Book</em> provided women with stories of romance and duty, much like the bible would provide the spiritual guidance women needed.  Rev. Furman implies that even though beauty and dress is important, the basic values of goodness are better.","      In the speech, Furman states that he would be shocked to discover a woman in a classroom or in any realm of public life.  A year earlier, in 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the first woman in the United States to graduate from medical school.  By August in 1850, several revolutionary women had taken steps to improve education and missionary work.  Public opinion circulating during this time deemed the pursuit of a career by a woman was an act of aggression. Intellectual training was ill suited for the poor, frail mental and physical design of a woman.  ","      Even though, the aim of altering women's education toward better intellectual standards was slowly evolving in the United States, the students of Johnson Female Seminary were being groomed for the life of a plantaintion mistress.

A celebration of American victory and freedom, this particular Fourth of July promised to be grander than all its predecessors. The year was 1876, and America was turning one-hundred years old. Of no exception to this national excitement was the up and coming southern town of Atlanta, Georgia where the citizens excitedly prepared for the centennial celebration.  The Atlanta Constitution documented this significant event in the history of the country as it took place in a small southern city, offering a glimpse not only into the patriotic celebrations of the nineteenth century but also into the development of American nationalism in the post-bellum South.  ","A town experiencing much change and growth in 1876, Atlanta had begun to recover from the obscurity of its ante-bellum existence and the destruction wrecked upon it during the Civil War. Assuming a more prominent role in the South, Atlanta had begun to become a hub of commerce and information due mostly to the railroad expansion and development in the area. By 1876, the Atlanta Constitution had earned a considerable reputation by acquiring several new editors including Henry Grady who would later propel the city into the national spotlight. In addition to the tangible changes Atlanta had experienced was the ideological development of a southern town towards the end of Reconstruction. Worthy of note is Franklin Garret's description in his book on Atlanta about how the town was still jaded by the Civil War, an emotion that complicated the city's attitude towards national holidays. Despite this sentiment and not wanting to be outdone, the Constitution describes how the citizens of Atlanta formed committees to plan parties and organize a celebration of memorable proportions for the centennial Fourth of July.","As the momentous day of jubilee approached and anticipation began to grow around the country, congress passed a resolution encouraging widespread festivity for the Fourth of July. Setting the tone for a nation wide celebration, this resolution was sent to all the different states, including Georgia. Governor Smith received the resolution which was subsequently printed in the Constitution on April 26, 1876. The fact that such a resolution was published in the Constitution and that it set the tone for the celebrations to come speaks of Atlanta's changing sentiment towards American nationalism and mirrors its growth from a small southern town into a national city. ","The tempo set and the parties planned, Atlanta was ready to celebrate.  According to the Atlanta Constitution, a large party was planned to be held at the Irish Literary Association building which was located at the intersection of Whitehall and Peters Street. The paper calls for the general public to \"lend their help toward making this celebration of this centennial Fourth a memorable occasion.\" According to the Constitution of July 6, the party was such a success that \"several hundred had to turn away\" because there was not enough room. The decorations were \"beautiful\" and extravagant, and all in all the tone and atmosphere of the occasion was one of national unity. To that end, a portrait of George Washington was prominently displayed along with an exhibit of arms that symbolized peace and unity between the North and the South in post-Civil War America. Not only was the celebration in Atlanta a huge hit that drew large numbers and extensive news coverage, it was also a success in that it was a celebration of national unity in a region that had recently undergone great turmoil and destruction."],"display_date":"July 4, 1876","search_date":"1876-07-04","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4282,"title":"Albert Spalding and Baseball&#39;s World Tour\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-10-01","end_date":"1889-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Packing their bats, balls and bags, a group of courageous men set out upon a journey of unprecedented nature and purpose. The year was 1888, and Albert G. Spalding had organized a group of all-star baseball players for the purpose of taking the game of baseball on a tour around the world.  A former baseball player himself, Spalding saw this tour as an opportunity to spread the national pastime over the entire globe while simultaneously advancing the interests of his new sporting goods chain.  From Chicago clear around the globe, baseball's finest players took America's pastime as ambassadors to new and spellbound audiences. According to Thomas Zeiler, who wrote a book dedicated to the subject, not only was the tour a sign of baseball's growing popularity, it also signified America's growing interest in global expansion and imperialism. Not only were the players ambassadors of baseball, they were ambassadors of the American way.","The Boston Globe called Spalding's idea one that, \"for boldness and scope, tops anything ever before attempted in the world of sports.\" Consisting of the top talent from around the country, the two teams, the All-America team and Chicago team, set out from Chicago under the direction of Spalding in October of 1888.  Crossing the American west with sweeping success, the tour arrived in San Francisco where it embarked upon the trans-pacific segment of its journey.  Stopping off briefly in Hawaii, the tour landed in Australia and met with an audience accustomed to the game of cricket. After indulging their audiences with exhibition games against the cricket teams of the country, the tour wowed the onlookers with a game of baseball that was highly applauded. The Globe describes how Spalding, achieving this success, then determined to take the tour through Europe and subsequently signed a contract for a European segment of the tour. Its path mapped out, the tour again set sail, crossing the Indian Ocean and heading into Egypt via the Suez Canal. From there the tour crossed Europe with its final destination being the British Isles. Here the two teams battled against each other and against the country's cricket teams all across England, Scotland, and Ireland. Finally returning to the states, Zeiler describes how Spalding received \"applause once near New York harbor\" and how the tour was met with great welcome and banquets almost every place it went.  After playing several games in the east, including a surprisingly lukewarm welcome in Washington D. C., the tour finally came to rest in Chicago where it played its last game. ","The impact of this world tour was soon seen. Returning in the spring of 1889, Spalding quickly made good on his marketing scheme.  In a deal that the New York Times called \"one of the biggest sporting deals of the season,\" Spalding bought out the company of A. J. Reach Company and established \"world control of the sporting goods line.\" Just as a baseball player gloriously rounds the bases after a homerun, so did America's pastime circle the world as a result of Spalding's \"homerun\" of an idea. Not only had the tour given the world a glimpse of America and its game, it had forever solidified baseball as an American institution and the national pastime."],"display_date":"October 1, 1888 - May 30, 1889","search_date":"1889-01-29","locations":[{"id":2541,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"COOK, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4283,"title":"Distinguished Savages\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-01-01","end_date":"1834-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["We all know the stereotype: the screaming, bloodthirsty savage with scalp in hand, terrorizing the civilized world and using the land without virtue.   Yet there are some people who differ, like Benjamin B. Thatcher.  ","In his <em>Indian Biography</em>, Thatcher argued that the Native American was not resigned to such a savage state, but that there existed among them great \"patriots, orators, warriors, and statesmen\" who merely \"ruled over barbarian communities.\"  Indeed, Thatcher ventured to say that we and our fathers owed much to the Native Americans.  Thatcher details the lives and deeds of several notable Native American leaders, such as Philip.  Thatcher gives an account of Philip during Philip's War, and how he displayed a \"courage as noble as his intellect.\"  According to this account, Philip did not mistreat his captives, he saved the life of a man named James Brown, and he gave kindness and protection to the Leonard Family of Raynham.  In battle, Philip was noble and strong, displaying the likeness of a lion.  This is in great contrast to the colonists' treatment of Philip.  They paraded his head around the colony and sold his nine year old son into slavery.  ","Fairchild's <em>The Noble Savages</em> argues that there was a connection between the idea of the \"noble savage\" and romantic naturalism, or a return to nature.  Romantic naturalism was of growing interest during the 19th century.  She says, \"To me, a Noble Savage is any free and wild being who draws directly from nature virtues which raise doubts as to the value of civilization.\"  This view of the Indians runs in steep contrast to the racist and stereotypically hostile view of many Americans.  Barnett's <em>The Ignoble Savage </em>tells us the colonists often regarded the Indians as \" 'aesthetical, proud, wild, barbarous, bruitish (in one word) diabolicall creatures.'\"","The conclusion we can gather from Thatcher, Fairchild, and Barnett is that during the 19th century there was a sort of growing sense of romantic naturalism associated with the Indian, and that the view of the Indian was indeed dynamic, although there was still a considerable force of prejudice and racism to be reckoned with.

Walker finally catches his opponent, and leaps at his chest to try and bring him down.  In the fall, Walker's chest is crushed by the Midshipman, and he is unable to rise.  His comrades race to his side and pump his lungs until he regains consciousness, and the cadet eventually stands to his feet and continues to play.  ","This scene unfolded at the first athletic competition, a football game, between the United  States Military Academy and the United  States Naval Academy in West   Point, New York.  In the course of the game, Cadet Walker was knocked senseless an amazing four different times.  He never gave up, however, and as the New York Times reported, \"He was knocked out four times, and yet he fought as long as consciousness lasted.\"  When the final gun sounded, the visiting Midshipmen were declared the winners by a score of 32 -0.  ","The game was the beginning of a century-long rivalry that has seen numerous close games and great competition between the nation's premier military academies.  Not only did the game serve as a source of entertainment for the cadets and midshipmen of the two academies, it also served a greater national purpose.  According to Steven W. Pope, these soldier-athletes that were created in the first football game served as an inspiration to young men across the United States, giving them something to pull for and aspire to.    ","After the Spanish - American War, the Navy instituted a policy that focused on the health of its crews, and this goal was accomplished mainly through athletics.  Athletics became a central part of academy life, as the platform of sports provided the soldiers with excellent relief from the monotony of structured military life, and served to instill the values of hard work and physical fitness in soldiers as well.  In addition to creating a better trained and more focused soldier, sports, and especially rivalries such as this one, gave the country a sense of nationalism.  Athletic events, particularly those between the country's soldiers, served to repair class divisions, restore social order, and create a sense of patriotism throughout the United States, uniting a country torn apart by suffering and war.

Godey's enormously successful <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> set the standard for the American magazine and monthlie publishers throughout the mid 19th century.  His ingenious marketing techniques as noted by historian John Tebbel set the standard for magazines by 1850.  The market appeal of <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> contributed to the rising realization that women were a marketable audience and Louis Godey's brainchild spurned the rise of a wave of impersonators such as <em>Peterson's Ladies</em> and <em>Ladies' Wreath</em>.  The magazines greatest contribution was to the evolution of fashion and its careful documentation of the latest styles.  As a result of increased subscriptions, the transformation of the monthlie to the magazine took place in order to sell more copies and increase profit; Godey's Lady's Book was one of the last to convert into a true magazine as Louis Godey preferred his original creation to the new low quality productions.  The method of payment for contributors was also unique to Godey's enterprise at first; Godey would not pay undistinguished writers for their contributions as his magazine would likely launch an unknown into fame.  Godey would then pay well known authors such as Nathaniel Willis a hefty paycheck to write regular entries that readers came to expect.  Another cost cutting revolution that Godey exploited was the use of advertisements which served two purposes; the initial being that he had a subsidized product, and his readers had a seemingly \"larger\" magazine to read.  As one of the first magazines to use advertisements, Godey risked making his publishment appear to be cheap; but by not lowering the price it made the magazine keep its' glamorous appeal.  The <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> employed the same strategy as well for several years prior to the Civil War.","                Not only did the structure of the modern magazine gain inspiration from Godey but so too did the content matter.  The most important subject piece that historian look to now for insight into the period are the hand tinted fashion plates that accompanied each issue of the magazine.  Carefully detailed and researched, these plates were to provide an image to the reader of how she should look in the latest fashionable dress.  Godey claimed in 1850 that he had 150 women working out of their homes to paint by hand these fashion plates, and the color was often left to the artists' decision.  This played off well for Godey by explaining that then readers should compare each others' fashion plates and decide then what color would be best for the clothing.  By comparing the fashion plates over the years, the evolution of women's dress can be traced throughout the 18th century from <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em>.  Additionally the fashion plates became more expansive through the decades, indicating more interest in fashion due to cheaper and more readily available clothing to buy.  ","The subjects contained in Godey's Lady's Book were also revolutionary in its inclusion of fiction in the form of short stories.  Authors such as Edgar Allen Poe got early starts in their early careers by writing short pieces for Godey's Lady's Book and reached a large audience.  Louis Godey realized as well that a magazine was not just a literary journal and as such should provide the reader a diverse array of subject material.  As a result women across the country were provided the latest monthly updates on music, dance, politics, and art; each copy complete with engravings, paintings, and eventually photos.  The use of artwork and pictures to compliment the literature was a transformative concept that became the norm for magazines by 1850.  Such techniques caused Godey's Lady's Book to become so successful that Godey copyrighted the magazine in 1845 in an attempt to prevent duplications.  ","                The Civil War marked the decline of the magazine market for several years simply due to the loss of consumers; the South made up the majority of Godey's customers.  By the time of Godey's death in 1878, his namesake was nearly in the same condition.  Even copying other magazines \"ten cent\" strategy in 1893 worked to no avail and the magazine finally ceased to exist in 1898.  <em>Godey's Lady's Book</em> impact on the magazine industry helped to transform pleasure reading in 19th century America by establishing the standard format for magazines."],"display_date":"January 1, 1830 - January 30, 1898","search_date":"1864-01-16","locations":[{"id":11227,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4324,"title":"Still Life in Camp: Union Soldiers Waiting for Action\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-02-16","end_date":"1863-03-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            Life as a Civil War soldier involved fighting and immense amounts of sitting and waiting. Soldiers from both sides of the war wrote letters home to loved ones describing the daily events and occurrences in camp life.  Life as a soldier required patience. Many soldiers recounted the long periods of time spent sitting in camp waiting for their chance to fight. At camps soldiers could actually hear the sounds of war and battle from nearby and became restless and wanted to fight, to see some action. ","            One soldier wrote under the pseudonym Timber Doodle; in his letter home on February 16, 1863. He detailed the lull in camp life plagued by a lack of action. He expressed wishes to see Richmond because his time in the Army soon expired and without fighting the men would see nothing. The tone of his letter is diluted from the monotony of camp life; yet his language and spirit are not completely dulled. He used humor and wit to discuss problems within the Army. Not only are the men sitting and waiting, but they are not getting paid; Doodle wrote, \"We have been out over six months, and not a cent of pay yet; nor do I think we will get any till our time is up.\" Timber Doodle portrayed his experience in the war as repetitive and droning; he expresses the desire to fight by writing, \"Our time is getting short...we had better be up and doing.\"","            Another soldier, the self-proclaimed Omega, wrote a letter home on March 17, 1863. In his letter to loved ones he also discusses his experience with camp life. Like Timber Doodle, he had yet to see action, but he can hear battles in the near distance. He discussed the high spirits of the Army and the readiness of all the men to fly into action at a moment's notice. Unlike Timber Doodle his camp life is portrayed as fun and entertaining. Omega detailed his experience with Irish soldiers and their celebration of St. Patrick's Day. His description of the games and drinking shows a new side of camp life not seen in Timber Doodle's experience. One interesting story he told detailed the death of fellow soldiers. The soldier did not die in battle, but rather in a competition. Omega wrote, \"The third was a general race, trying the elastic powers of the officer's horses by leaping ditches nine feet and the same breadth. One man was killed by his falling into the ditch.\" Unfortunately the droning of camp life and perhaps the high mortality rates from war and disease seem to have dulled Omega's sense of compassion and concern for life.","            Many soldiers shared a similar experience with camp life and these details of monotonous inaction are not irregular. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw expressed a similar sentiment in a letter home to a loved one, Anna, as he wrote, \"The days & weeks pass very quickly tho' they never vary excepting when we go on guard...\" Bell Irvin Wiley, a historian, compared the beginning of the war and camp life to a picnic. He discussed how for many of the soldiers traveling South by train and boat was an adventure; he wrote, \"The battlefield if given a thought seemed remote, and a lack of martial experience made its horrors incomprehensible.\" He pointed out that for many Union soldiers life in camp was no worse than life at home; many younger, rural soldiers were in fact surprised by the wealth of material items which the Union Army could afford. ","            Like Omega and Timber Doodle, Wiley discussed a broad spectrum of sentiments from utter enthusiasm to outright detest for the war which grew within the soldiers as a result of the idleness and monotony of camp life. Wiley wrote, \"Battle is the ultimate of soldiering. All else in warfare is but incidental to the vital closing of opposing forces in conflict.... In the Civil War, however, fighting was an intimate, elemental thing.... Some Billy Yanks went into battle very soon after enlisting...Others waited many months for the fiery ideal. One battle comprised the entire fighting experience of some, while many faced the jaws of death repeatedly.\" ","           Wiley's description of small bursts of action and long periods of inaction seems to accurately portray the sentiments of both Omega and Timber Doodle. These elements of the Civil defined the experience of many Union soldiers who sat reluctantly in camp waiting for their time to fight. These three soldiers, Omega, Timber Doodle, and Shaw, experienced different aspects of camp life during the war in varying parts of Virginia, but there is one thing they share. They are soldiers and they are fighting for the same cause."],"display_date":"February 16, 1863 - March 17, 1863","search_date":"1863-03-02","locations":[{"id":14210,"lat":38.6845288469,"lng":-78.1593262248,"zoom":10,"place":"RAPPAHANNOCK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4336,"title":"Civil War Christmas Memory\n","course_id":4,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-12-25","end_date":"11/10/37","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["           During the Civil War, holidays and festivities did not enshroud the lives of families and soldiers throughout America. Soldiers usually sat in camp waiting for action as the winter months did not involve tremendous amounts of fighting. Second Lieutenant Robert Gould Shaw wrote home many times to his mother but also on Christmas Day 1861. His description of camp life and the lack of festivities for soldiers is just one example of the diluted Christmas spirit. This lack of elaborate celebration was a common experience for many Southerners such as both a soldier and his wife.","            Shaw told his mother that Christmas Eve and Day were just like any day within the last six months. There was little action and little reason to be joyous and celebrate. Other than a little snow at midnight the holiday just did not seem to be like a typical Christmas; there were no stockings hung, no songs sung, and Santa was nowhere to be seen. Shaw's account of Christmas and camp life seemed somber and relaxed. He seemed to be in good spirit and does talk of Santa cheerfully, but Shaw quickly softens this emotion with a somber observation; this remark is about the reality of war and the restrictions associated with life as a soldier. Shaw wrote, \"...I suppose no one ever had a better chance of seeing \"Santa Claus\"; but as I had my stockings on, he probably thought it not worth his while to come down to the guard-tent. I didn't see any of the guard's stockings pinned up outside their tent, and indeed it is contrary to army regulations for them to divest themselves of any part of their clothing during the twenty-four hour period.\" ","            Southern soldiers and their family life on Southern plantations also did not resemble the typical holiday atmosphere.  Although desperation and ersatz ruled the Confederacy during the Civil War, especially during holidays, a complete dissolution of the Christmas spirit did not occur. There are always exceptions; some families could afford the expensive gifts and meals while other soldiers and their families simply looked past the war-torn nation and found a brighter outlook with things that they could be thankful for. In an interview Ida Baker, commented on her recollection of Christmas during the war. She recalled the lack of luxuries, but remembered the spirit which kept themselves and their soldiers going; she said, referring to the women of the era, \"They never gave up and they never stopped making much with nothing.\" The woman always strived to keep their men happy both away during combat and at home following a tour of duty.

Thompson served in the 4th Georgian Infantry, and served in the Confederate army throughout the War.","His poem, \"The High Tide at Gettysburg\" is different from poems of wars from previous authors, as it is of an \"elegiac strain.\" The poem is definitely in tune with the mid-nineteenth-century \"preoccupation with mortality and morality,\" which makes sense as Will Henry would have been very young when he joined up, and still young when he wrote and published this work in 1888. It begins with the much repeated lines, \"a cloud possessed the hollow field, the gathering battle's smoky shield. Athwart the gloom the lightning flashed, and through the cloud some horsemen dashed, and from the heights the thunder pealed.\" From this verse, the poem could be about any battle, or even any of the many Gettysburg battles, but it is not much later that Thompson mentions Pickett, and \"leading grandly down,\" implying that this poem is about Pickett's Charge, the final surge of the Confederacy and Lee to push north. As we know, Lee failed and in the process many thousands died at the Battle of Gettysburg.","It is written without poetic flourish, and fluffy language; Thompson created a smoke filled atmosphere with guns and flashes and death surrounding it all. The reader of this poem is taken to Pickett's Charge, and shown in no uncertain terms that the war was gruesome and horrific, that men died, and for leaders who had almost forgotten the original cause. Thompson compared the fight to the fiery losses of the British at Waterloo, and shows how straggled the Confederates are by 1863, by discussing the colours or the battle flags. He writes \"Virginia heard her comrade [Tennessee] say: 'Close round this rent and riddled rag',\" and a little later, he says the \"tattered standards of the South,\" both double entendres, as they don't just mean the actual flags are torn and full of holes, but the Confederates and the South as a whole, is tattered and torn, and full of holes.","The famous lines \"they smote and stood, who held the hope of nations on that slippery slope,\" has been attributed the first use of Slippery Slope, by language specialists and the surprise is that here it is literally slippery from blood, but now means something different. The last verse is beautiful, with Thompson changing tack slightly, using love as a reason to stop fighting, and finishing with the image of a mother \"lamenting all her fallen sons\" This is possibly why Colonel Will Henry Thompson was commissioned to prepare \"proper wording\" for Edgar Allen Poe's mother's epitaph. He wrote similar words of a mother leaving someone very special behind. Not exactly unusual for a young son, who has seen other young sons fall in huge numbers."],"display_date":1888,"search_date":"1888-07-01","locations":[{"id":11366,"lat":39.9199204801,"lng":-76.7265166341,"zoom":9,"place":"YORK, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4440,"title":"French Opera House Destroyed in Flames\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"12/4/19","end_date":"12/4/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" On December 4, 1919, hundreds of New Orleans's high society watched as their social gathering spot was engulfed in flames.  A writer at the time, Andre Lafargue, recounted the deep emotion embedded within the French Opera House, and the mourning that took place upon its historic loss to flames.  The French Opera House, located on the corner of Bourbon and Toulouse Streets in the French Quarter, served as one of the centers of social activity.  It was a place for the wealthy to assemble, mingle, and display their prestigious life, and became a mark of social class in New Orleans.  Being one of the earliest opera houses in North America, the building enhanced the French Quarter with its architecture, design, and French culture and customs.  The Opera House served not only as a place for theatrical performances, but also as a venue for the elite to gather socially, politically, and historically.  Countless galas, political rallies, debutante balls, receptions, and concerts were held in the massive as well.  ","            The Fire occurred just one year after the opera house was reopened after being closed for a period during WWI.  The building was said to be in one of its prime states and was thought to have a bright future in the New Orleans culture.  Lafargue and many other prominent members of society advocated strongly for reconstruction of the original Greek Revival-style building that so defined the Creole faÇade, as well as the culture of the French Quarter.  Efforts were delayed by a multitude of political actions and feelings such as loss and hopelessness, which ultimately resulted in a relegation of the opera culture in the city.  The French Opera House disaster became a component in a weakened period in the Louisiana opera society and put a damper on the social seasons and traditions.   ","Today, the Inn on Bourbon sits on the site of the original French Opera House at the corner of Bourbon and Toulouse Streets.  Although the original building was destroyed by fire and a new building was built, one feature of the Old French Opera House remains that is a reminder of the social elite's presence.  There is an indentation on Bourbon Street that leads to the entrance of the hotel.  This indentation served as the parking area for the aristocrats to exit their carriages and make an elegant, grand entrance.  In a sense, the area is still used for the same purpose. It is here that people staying at the luxurious, historical Inn on Bourbon make their \"grand entrance\" into the hotel lobby creating a modern social elite statement that mirrors statements and gatherings of the past."],"display_date":"December 4, 1919","search_date":"1919-12-04","locations":[{"id":16884,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"Orleans, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4443,"title":"The Thirteen Sisters of Julia Street\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1833-01-01","end_date":"1833-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"Y","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The thirteen sisters of Julia Street started a new trend.  These \"sisters\" were a row of thirteen side-hall style town houses that spanned the 600 block of Julia Street in New Orleans.  Upon their construction by the New Orleans Building Company in 1833, they were among first rows constructed in the side-hall, or London-plan, manner most commonly seen in Philadelphia and Baltimore.  The exteriors combined traditional Creole features with emerging Greek revival design aspects to create a transitional style later mimicked by similar rows of houses.  Each doorframe consisted of a unique design of elaborate fanlights above the doors, ionic columns, and neoclassical infusions that created a unique look for each dwelling place amid the sea of red brick. Additionally, the Julia Street town houses were sold with a blank interior that attracted the wealthy who desired the flexibility to modify their own homes to best suite their needs and display their affluence.","Row houses provided one of most efficient housing solutions for urban areas like New Orleans because they maximized land use by utilizing a narrow lot.  The side-hall style offered a front gallery that joined the two main rooms and rear passageways that connected to narrower servants' quarters.  Such a design for the service wing offered a convenient housing solution for servants while maintaining the privacy of the homeowner.  Before the introduction of the row house, flat and raised French Creole cottages and cabins dominated the architecture of New Orleans, making the emergence of a new style desirable among the affluent who desired innovation.  Typical town houses consisted of between two and six units, giving the thirteen houses of Julia Row a distinctive architectural flair.  Each of the homes sold quickly at an auction in 1833 to members of the high society of New Orleans.  One home went to Henry Howard, the notable architect of the Howard Library and another to architect Henry Hobson Richardson.   The use of row houses continued to spread through New Orleans as a favorable residential plan, including famous rows like the Pontalba Apartments built in the 1850s.","Over time the sisters' glory faded as residential areas moved away from the American central business district and southwest into the Garden District.  Julia Row no longer offered the prestige and innovation desired by the elites and the homes were wrought with architecturally careless \"improvements\" made by neglectful owners who turned them into cheap boarding houses.  Cracks spanned across the face of the buildings, the servants' quarters deteriorated from lack of upkeep and one eventually collapsed entirely.  Recently, efforts have been made to restore what had become subpar property and create a high-end, artistic community teeming with art galleries and young energy.  The New Orleans City Planning Commission has been leading the gentrification endeavors to transform what had become the warehouse district into a neighborhood of museums and galleries to appeal to young artists, tourists, and history buffs.  The first to be revamped was at the corner of Julia and Camp Street, and the others quickly followed.  The Riverfront Streetcar also runs through the area booster visitation through providing easy access for both locals and tourists.  Although the demographic has shifted with time, Julia Row persists as a trendy destination for the culturally inclined."],"display_date":1833,"search_date":"1833-07-02","locations":[{"id":5596,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":44,"tag":"Town Home"},{"id":46,"tag":"gentrification"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":35,"tag":"Architecture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4445,"title":" A New Hero Rises: Andrew Jackson and the Battle of New Orleans\n","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1828-01-01","end_date":"1828-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When an individual's legacy spawns something as seemingly minute as a musical composition to be written in their honor, a new level of greatness has been achieved.  Andrew Jackson was no stranger to this after growing into one of the most popular personas in America in his day and age.  James Hewitt (1770-1827), a local composer that left England as a young man to begin his own American dream in the port cities of the Northeast, wrote the piece \"President Jackson's Grand March\" in 1828 to honor the man whom many attribute as helping to define the modern, free United States of America.  This arrangement helped to immortalize Jackson in song as the new hero of the US.  ","Nearly two weeks after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed to end the War of 1812, with the unprecedented victory of the American militia over the far-superior British Navy on January 8, 1815 at New Orleans, the glory of the victory spread rapidly across the nation, never straying far from the name of Andrew Jackson.  An early 1815 issue of the <em>Niles' Weekly Register</em>, a publication based in Baltimore, proclaimed: \"Glory be to God that the barbarians have been defeated.  Glory to Jackson…Glory to the militia…Sons of freedom…benefactors of your country…all hail\"  Alas, the United   States had fully claimed its sovereignty and removed any speculation as to the longevity of its existence.

The cartoon entitled \"Compromise With the South\" was one of his most powerful and effective cartoons, and one of his personal favorites that he dedicated to the Democratic Chicago Convention in particular. Harper's Weekly, the first periodical to achieve national circulation, featured the cartoon on its front page on September 3, 1864. Nast's staunch Unionist stance, including those of the Republican editor and owner of Harper's, helped to earn the periodical its reputation in the North and earning him threatening letters from the South. One admirer declared: \"Nast would have been burned at the stake had he been captured on one of his visits to the front.\"","    The cartoon itself depicts a possible grim outcome from the Democratic convention. Nast paints the Democratic convention as a betrayal against the principles for which Union soldiers fought. On the left, a defeated and disabled Union soldier, his face hidden in shame, extends a feeble hand of surrender to a triumphant Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy. Davis stands with one boot disrespectfully on the grave of another Union soldier, while Columbia kneels mournfully. In the upper-left, the American flag is hung upside down as a sign of distress. Nast's point in his cartoon was that if there was going to be a compromise with the Confederacy, Union soldiers will have died and served and lost limbs for nothing. He also believed the Democratic platform would return blacks to slavery, as there is a despairing black Union soldier in the cartoon. Overall, the cartoon made a statement against the peace wing of the Democratic party (who were also known as Copperheads).","    The 1864 campaigns and convention was the event that helped Nast earn his national reputation. For up to twenty years after \"Compromise With the South\" was put to print in Harper's Weekly, Nast exerted a tremendous influence on the political life of the United States. He always held a principal interest in politics. His crusading ardor can be attributed to his upbringing: his father fled from Europe rather than be faced with compromising his political ideals and carried from that a sense of conscience rather than a spirit of compromise which was the dominant thought pattern in the country in the Civil War era."],"display_date":"September 3, 1864","search_date":"1864-09-03","locations":[{"id":2539,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"COOK, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4494,"title":"Post-Colonial Art Development\n","course_id":20,"status":"P","start_date":"1790-01-01","end_date":"1800-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"They [Americans] are depreciate, unprincipled inciters having ruined themselves through proliferation and debauchery of every kind,\" ranted a scathing excerpt from an English editorial. \"The whole nation is thrown [itself] in contention... Such has been the degeneracy of modern patriotism, that they would expunge every word from our dictionary, or frame [canvas].\" Through the eyes of the British, the Americans, even thirty years after the revolutionary war, were uncultured and ill-mannered. But as the fledgling country struggled to establish a stable socioeconomic status, its culture blossomed, making strides in the aesthetics.","Perhaps the most intriguing artistic achievement was political cartooning. Coupled with the printing press, although it may not seem an artist's medium, it was in fact the greatest mode of spreading American aesthetics. Political cartoons were pivotal to swaying the general public to adopt a way of thinking, implement a social trend, or show fault with a particular person or regime. This was important because a large majority of the populace was illiterate; caricatures and stereotypes allowed them to understand a specific message or movement. The political cartoon was also a good mode of humor to make poor political judgments of the era somewhat humorous and palliative.","Another art form that caught on late in the postcolonial period was the realism movement. Up until the Revolutionary War, Americans had very little desire to create a painted medium. Instead, metallurgy and ceramics were more popular. The few painters who did in fact continue their trade largely focused on landscapes and architecture. As the war ended, the focus shifted to human portrait and candid rural settings. The figures in these pictures were very realistic: the bodies were well proportioned, light was focalized, and objects seemed dimensional instead of flat; the facial features, however, were greatly exaggerated, taking an almost egg-like look, which may account for the name \"egg-head.\"","Art Historian Wayne Craven argues that the painting movement was a late enterprise likely resulting from perhaps the scarcity of resources; for example, paint required oil, turpentine, and pigment. All of these goods had to be directly traded from foreign ports, which was difficult due to bad relations with other countries. Lead-based paints, while not as popular as oils, were also very hard to get, mostly because they required lead powder and paint thinner in the form of linseed oil, neither native to America. Other artists turned to alternative means of painting; using egg whites as thinner (commonly known as Tempera), pine resin, tar pitch, and even meat fat. A small contribution to the painting industry was the indigo plant from South Carolina, commonly used to make a deep blue dye, in the place of cerulean, which had to be imported from South America.  While the aesthetics had no prolific institutions in American society until the early twentieth century the ideas, creativity, and expressions of early folk art retained immensely popular amongst the general public and even the social elite for centuries.

","Though the banquet took place deep in Virginia during the Civil War, and with a naval blockade of Confederate ports established, the officers were not found wanting amongst the bounty of food and beverages. The festivities had loosened the tongue of many a commander, and debate soon turned to what should be the national hymn of the Confederacy. Though the songs <em>Dixie's land</em>, and <em>Maryland, My Maryland</em> were popular items amongst the soldiers, they did not capture the whole of the Confederate cause, as it was reasoned by General Van Dorn during this debate.

It is ironic that McMahon plays as the black pieces against the white pieces. The rule stands in Chess that the first player to move is always the player using the white pieces.

Zora attended school in Eatonville until only 13 years old, when she traveled to New York City with a traveling theatre company. In the city that never sleeps, Zora would develop her creative mind and make her mark on history. Hurston seized the tremendous opportunity of living in New York during the Harlem Renaissance, a period of blossoming of African American culture through music, poetry, dance and other forms of media. First, she obtained three degrees from illustrious learning institutions including Columbia University and Howard University. Soon after, she was blessed with a shot to work with Langston Hughes, arguably the most famous black writer in American History, on a play entitled, “Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life in Three Acts.” Hurston went on to publish books such as the 1934 work “Jonah’s Gourd Vine,” detailing African American life in the deep-south and bringing it to the forefront of society. Through her life’s work and experiences, Zora Neale Hurston exposed the masses to African American life and folklore, broke racial boundaries, and inspired change here in Central Florida and across the nation.","Growing up in Eatonville, Hurston was fully immersed in African American culture and folklore. She specialized in theatre and comedy decided to pursue her interests further at Columbia. During her academic years, she conducted extensive field studies throughout the American South, becoming an expert in the field. Here at Rollins College, interest in American folklore was mounting. In a letter from October 29<sup>th</sup>1932, Professor W.R. Wunsch pleads with school President Dr. Hamilton Holt to allow an African American folk performance in the Annie Russell Theatre. Wunsch challenges the President to “break the ground as it were: to make the students sensitive to the lyric beauty of swamp and citrus grove, […] find the drama in the life of fisherfolk and sponge divers, […] to get the students to ‘dip their nets where they are.’” He goes on to specifically request Hurston, insisting that he “can think of no better way to introduce the students to the honest-to-the-soil material at their own doorsteps than to present to them in a program of folk songs and dancers a group of Eatonville negroes, headed by Zora Hurston. Zora, a national authority on negro ways, has won an enviable place for herself in American dramatics.” Clearly, there was desire for Zora’s expertise and creativity in the field local folklore here at Rollins, but the President was somewhat apprehensive to approve because of the well established racial boundaries of the time.","These pre-existing racial boundaries were tremendously difficult for African Americans to overcome, as the Jim Crow laws of segregation were still widely in effect. Dr. Holt illustrates this in his response to Mr. Wunsch’s letter. He allows the performance to take place, however, he adds, “Of course we cannot have negroes in the audience unless there is a separate place segregated for them.” Holt continues by hinting that he fears the judgment of others, warning, “I do not think I would advertise it very much outside our own faculty and students.” This mentality held widely throughout the south was a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to overcome. Hurston did an incredible job of shrinking the barriers by thrusting the lives and cultures of African Americans into mainstream society. Her first book, entitled “Jonah’s Gourd Vine,” was critically acclaimed as something totally new and fresh. Additionally, her academic success provided opportunity and paved the way for many African American women to follow.","The Harlem Renaissance set the stage for real progress in America. The timeless works of Hurston, Hughes, and countless other intellectuals, artists, poets and entertainers provided the building blocks for the Civil Rights Movement. This cultural movement shined the African-American experience in the spotlight, and in turn changed how African Americans were perceived. As rural, southern blacks moved north to larger cities, they developed a new image, one of urban sophistication. The idea of the black identity was forming, and antiquated, racist laws could no longer suppress it. In his response letter, Dr. Holt acknowledges that he is in favor of racial progress, telling the courageous Mr. Wunsch, “I am glad you are doing this as it is one of the best steps in the right direction.”","Zora Neale Hurston achieved incredible things in her lifetime.

the loneliness of the area was both health-giving and soul-cheering.  This image spoke of American culture and society, as it moved toward urban and consumer life and away from the natural world.  Citizens of cities in nineteenth century America would have been unable to survive in the mountains of northern New York, even though in reality going from the city to the country should be from a more complex life to simplicity.  As Henry David Thoreau wrote in his book, Walden, “…as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less complex.”"],"display_date":1854,"search_date":"1854-07-02","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5030,"title":"Vogue:  Women’s Nineteenth Century Fashion","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The changing role of nineteenth century women from a worker on the farm to a woman of society was reflected in fashion transformations, with fashion magazines that spoke directly to women, stating that “every lady loves it.”  Magazine stressed the novelty and desirability of the clothing pictured.  MME Demorest’s Illustrated Portfolio of the Fashions was a popular biannual women’s magazine, costing individuals ten cents.  Directions were given in the magazine for measurements and the type and amount of fabric; patterns were then sent from New York City for ten to thirty cents each.   The magazine was delivered all over the country, directly from the nation’s fashion capital, New York City.  The 1875 spring and summer edition of the magazine pictured items such as demitrain skirts, overskirts, basques, polonaises, bonnets, and aprons.  The fashions showed women what was “in” and what to wear, what was “useful, practical, and reliable information.”  All styles were elegant, meant for high society women; women pictured were standing, acting prim and proper.  The magazine illustrated the fact that appearing well-dressed was very important to people in the nineteenth century; many were willing to have inferior homes and diets to wear symbols of supposed status and success in society.  The creation of fashion styles demonstrated the more general change in America to a consumer culture and market society.","Even as early as the 1830s in America, \"the lady of fashion had arrived.\"  As women moved from the fields to the home, attire accommodated to the new expectations of the female gender.  Many women had acquired a new aversion to working and managing household affairs, creating terrible wives, as this was the expectation of women at this time.  All of the styles and suggested materials were heavy, even though the styles were for the spring and summer; this revealed that fashion was to make a statement, not to be comfortable or practical.  The specific magazine was sold in Greenville, South Carolina residents, and while the fashions may have made sense for New York City, they may not have been as applicable to Southern or rural women.  The magazine did not show the distinct differences between city and country that were very apparent in the nineteenth century, only picturing the styles of the nation's fashion capital.  Also, fashion styles for girls even under the age of ten were elegant and unreasonable, if more jaunty than the women’s styles.  The magazine illustrated that women had a new role in society:  to be seen and not to work or be on the same intellectual or political level as men.  In nineteenth century society, women were to be, “the graces of purity, gentleness, kindness, modesty, constancy, sincerity, resignation, and of a meek and quiet spirit are your bright ornaments.”  American women's fashion also depicted the wider changes in nineteenth century society from the ideal of republican simplicity to aristocratic decadence."],"display_date":1875,"search_date":"1875-07-02","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5037,"title":"<strong>Musical Patriotism of the Civil War</strong>","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-01","end_date":"1861-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Two flags overlap on the cover of the Bonnie Blue Flag sheet music that has passed through many hands and sat atop many pianos in its lifetime.  The blue flag bearing a single star, given consideration as the Texas symbol of secession, and Harry Macarthy’s patriotic tune encompassed some of the southern sentiment at the start of the Civil War.  The song’s lyrics cried out to ban together brother’s who had toiled alongside one another and now felt that their rights were being threatened.  The song describes how the southerners were just and fair as long as the Union was, “but now, when Northern treachery attempts our rights to mar, We hoist on high the Bonnie Blue Flag, that bears a Single Star.”  Songs such as these were immensely popular among both Confederate and Union soldiers, they were viewed as being just as important as military strategy. Robert E. Lee himself believed that an army could not truly exist without music.  A Bible and a songbook were the most popular texts carried by soldiers, and it was songs such as these that helped pass the long warring period. ","Not only did music serve as a way to pass the time and link people supporting a common cause, but soldiers from both sides were joined together in their shared appreciation of music. One afternoon in December of 1862, in Fredericksburg, Virginia on either side of the Rappahannock River soldiers of the Confederacy and the Union were encamped.  The Union soldiers began the festivities, playing their favorites for their Federal.  The Confederate soldiers quickly joined the crowd to listen from the other side.  The band threw in a few of the popular rebel songs they knew

issues, events, and ideas were spread and divided among many American journals, newspapers, and periodicals, but in June of 1850 Harper & Brothers of New York sought to “remedy this evil” and provide all of this information in one place for anyone who wished to read it.  The firm introduced Harper’s New Monthly Magazine as the first general interest magazine in America.  They prefaced the issue with a quick word to their readers, explaining the reasoning and need for such a magazine in the United States.  The idea was to “place within the reach of the great mass of the American people the unbounded treasures of the Periodical Literature of the present day.”  They wished to bring the most current works of the most brilliant and innovative minds into the lives of as many as possible, offering their magazine monthly for only three dollars a year.  This was an attempt to keep minds fresh and informed in an age when so many things seemed to be happening and changing so quickly.","Great Britain and France had been in the practice of publishing periodicals for years, with growing popularity.  Harper & Brothers was trying to keep America up to date.  All of the brightest minds and all of their greatest works had been enriching European culture for years and Americans wanted the same for themselves.  Harper’s was a rather liberal arts publication, covering “varied intellectual movements of this most stirring and productive age.”  Scientific discoveries, political activity, and mechanical inventions were to be found among its pages with the fine art and literature, a regular Renaissance magazine. ","Harper & Brothers included the most recent information, not only from America, but from Europe, too.  It was an innovative concept and a way to advance and improve American culture and society.  By catering to “any class of readers…for any kind of reading,” the firm was able to deliver a magazine with a value “so much beyond its price…into the hands or the family circle of every intelligent citizen of the United States.”  Every copy of the issue in June sold and half a year later there were up to 50,000 readers.","Initial issues quickly shifted from the notable European works to the fresh American pieces.  Writers such as Horace Greeley, Horatio Alger, Stephen Douglas, and Mark Twain put forth their ideas for America.  During the 1850s the country was enjoying the access to printed materials that the printing press allowed and the spread of railroads assisted.  Culture was becoming a possible investment, rather than the bare necessities of yesteryears.  Many authors and artists were working to accelerate this process, and Harper’s New Monthly Magazine offered a brilliant and accessible means of doing so."],"display_date":"June

there were many presidential pets before him, Laddie Boy was the first celebrity White House pet.  Few people realize that Laddie Boy, President Warren G. Harding’s Airedale terrier, was the first to receive regular coverage from newspaper reporters. Presidential pets had to receive the same scrutiny as their distinguished masters.  Whether providing companionship or humanizing the President’s political image, Laddie Boy did his job well.   Laddie Boy was included in the everyday happenings in the White House during Harding’s 1921-1923 administration.","Laddie Boy came to the White House on March 5, 1921, the day after Harding took office, he was 7 months old.    He had been born on July 26, 1920 at Caswell Kennels in Toledo, Ohio.  President Harding told his staff to let him know when the dog arrived, so they did, even though there was a cabinet meeting going on.  President Harding was so happy to get Laddie Boy that he brought him right into the meeting.  After this, Laddie Boy went to most cabinet meetings where he had his very own hand-carved chair to sit on.  Laddie Boy was both photogenic and the perfect representation of Harding’s campaign slogan “Return to Normalcy.”  Harding loved dogs and he used Laddie Boy to demonstrate his connection to the average person.","Laddie Boy certainly knew how to steal the spotlight.  His popularity with reporters was so great they often quoted him in pretend interviews.  Laddie Boy accompanied Harding while he golfed, had his own birthday parties, greeted official delegates and once hosted the annual Easter egg roll.  Harding so loved Laddie Boy and the attention he received, that he commissioned one thousand bronze miniatures of Laddie Boy, which Harding gave to supporters. With all this attention, Laddie Boy was named the official presidential pet.  He was treated like a king and even had his own caregiver who gave the dog daily baths.","Laddie Boy was so beloved nationwide that the Newsboys’ Association asked every newspaper delivery boy in the country to donate one penny to a special fund to build a statue of Laddie Boy.  In all, nineteen thousand one hundred thirty-four pennies were collected and melted down.  Laddie Boy’s likeness, made from the copper in the pennies, still stands in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C."],"display_date":"March 5, 1921","search_date":"1921-03-05","locations":[{"id":21755,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5795,"title":"<strong>TO OPEN GARDNER PALACE - </strong><strong>Public Will See Famous Fenway Court To-day</strong>","course_id":114,"status":"P","start_date":"2/22/03","end_date":"2/22/03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 22, 1903, an article appeared in the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer </em>describing the opening of an opulent new estate and museum in Boston. Admission tickets were sold out well before opening day of the museum. Described in the article from the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer </em>was the overwhelming magnitude of Fenway Court and the abundance of specifically styled rooms created to display Isabella Stewart Gardner's private art collection. Fenway Court was the name of the palace that was created and maintained both as the personal home and museum of Isabella Stewart Gardner. The building was a personal representation of Isabella Stewart Gardner's architectural and artistic desires. She was the daughter of a wealthy businessman, and her marriage to the wealthy John L. Gardner helped her rise to the same social status as her husband. Spending money was not a problem for the wealthy members of society like the Gardners, who built elaborate homes and other representations of their wealth. The public enjoyed reading about these activities since this provided a form of entertainment, whether one could visit the new building or not. It was astonishing for the public to read about such personal extravagance. During the Gilded Age, some wealthy Americans were enjoying their freedom to spend money on whatever they chose, as there were no boundaries on spending money for those that had it to spend. Historian Walter Lord commented, \"The privileged poured their money into projects that amused or interested them.\" Everything was done in very grand style and the more noticeable the better.","One could not help but notice Fenway Court. Isabella Stewart Gardner not only oversaw the construction details of her palace, but she lived in it as well. She also assisted in the painting of the walls in the palace, especially if she did not like the color being applied. If she did not like someone's workmanship or performance on the construction site, they were fired on sight. She insisted on supervising every job. Writer Nelson Lansdale stated that \"She almost literally supervised the laying of every brick.\" Her palace included a music room, a stage for theatrical productions, an extensive garden courtyard and many works of art. Isabella Stewart Gardner hired her own architect to design her palace. Author Robert L. Reid wrote that she \"worked with the architect Willard T. Sears to create a unique setting for her private collection.\" The courtyard was exquisite with a gigantic skylight that made the objects in the courtyard beautiful to be seen at any time of day. The palace appeared to be three stories tall with multiple balconies at every level overlooking the courtyard. In the United States, many wealthy Americans turned toward Europe for housing and design ideas. Writer Robert G. Athearn stated that, \"the socially prominent still looked to Europe and fawned upon its nobility.\" Isabella Stewart Gardner was a perfect example of one who admired European architecture. She was ahead of her time by the way she displayed her artwork with special lighting and a room design to help enhance the artwork and the time period it was meant to be shown in.","Isabella Stewart Gardner immersed herself in the arts and really spent little time thinking about anything else. Nelson Lansdale commented, \"Isabella once brooded so much on Cleopatra that she completely forgot it was Christmas Eve.\" She was also very involved with the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Some would consider her to have been a bit eccentric, but her complexities made her an extraordinary woman. She lived an extravagant lifestyle and was known to have quite a temper that she was not afraid to show. Nelson Lansdale commented that Isabella Stewart Gardner was, \"no prude\" and \"she like to tell risque jokes.\" She preferred the company of men over women and loved to tell jokes that were rather shocking to some. She loved to wear gowns and expensive jewelry. Isabella Stewart Gardner often retained her own writers, musicians and actors for her theatrical events. Her love of artwork seemed to come naturally for her. Isabella Stewart Gardner frequently traveled abroad to collect her artworks. Her frequent travel companion to Europe was an artist by the name of John Singer Sargent. Besides painting a self-portrait of Isabella Stewart Gardner, there was some speculation that romance existed between the two. The husband of Isabella Stewart Gardner seemed to ignore such speculation and was content to follow along and continue to support his wife's lifestyle. She always traveled in style and preferred her carriage, with footmen and coachmen readily available. She loved her role in high society and found it amusing when people would talk about her. At times, it seemed as though she enjoyed being the center of attraction and entertainer herself. Her daily adventures in Boston and travels to Europe were written about often in newspapers such as the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer.</em> She certainly was of interest to the public, for her lifestyle was never boring.","The private opening of Isabella Stewart Gardner's palace occurred on New Year's night 1903 and was attended by special invitation only. However, Isabella Stewart Gardner had a vision for her palace to be publically enjoyed. In February of 1903, Isabella Stewart Gardner's museum opened to the public, as the article in the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer </em>noted. She wanted the public to be educated and share in her appreciation and enjoyment of the arts. It was Isabella Stewart Gardner's wish for Fenway Court to remain untouched and as Nelson Lansdale stated, \"as her will directed, remains almost exactly as she left it forever in 1924.\""," "," "],"display_date":"February 22, 1903","search_date":"1903-02-22","locations":[{"id":49632,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":10,"place":"Suffolk, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1504,"tag":"Gilded Age"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":5955,"title":"1933 Photograph Outside Delray Theater","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/33","end_date":"12/31/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Two women dressed in traditional Hungarian attire stand on either side of a Hungarian film poster one day in 1933 when someone snaps their photo.

The show, hosted by Dick Clark, debuted nationally on August 5 as a product of the American Broadcast Company (ABC). In J.P. Shanley’s <em>New York Times</em> review of <em>American Bandstand</em>’s premiere from August 6, 1957, he stated that “Viewers who are beyond voting age are not likely to derive much pleasure from ‘American Bandstand’ the disk jockey show that began yesterday.” Shanley gave clear reasons why older viewers would dislike the show. He explained what the “attractive group of youngsters” wore: “pretty gowns” for the girls and for the boys, “there were no motorcycle jackets and hardly a sideburn in the crowd.”  He criticized the dancing on the show and Dick Clark’s hosting. Shanley was not impressed by <em>American Bandstand</em> and called it “almost identical to that of a show that has been conducted in here over Channel 9” as a warning to adults in the area to stay away. The <em>Times</em> portrayed <em>American Bandstand</em> as a mediocre show entirely directed at a teenage audience.","By bringing<em> Bandstand</em> to a national network and advertising show-themed products to more viewers, Dick Clark became a popular television figure in the already forming teenage consumer culture of the 1950s. One of the leading historians of <em>American Bandstand</em>, Matthew Delmont, in his book, <em>The Nicest Kids in Town,</em> claimed, “<em>American Bandstand’s</em> daily images encouraged teenagers to imagine themselves as a part of a national audience enjoying the same music and dances at the same time.” Delmont also explained: “by representing the show’s teenagers consuming all of these products, <em>American Bandstand</em> constructed a national youth culture centered on simultaneous consumption” that imitated the larger consumer culture of America in 1957.","When asked by author Michael Shore about <em>Bandstand</em> going national, one of the regular dancers from the show, Justine Carrelli, responded, “That first network show had to be the first, last, and only time I can recall ever seeing Dick Clark acting the least bit nervous.” It was one of the only days when Dick Clark and show producer Tony Mammarella had to hand over control of <em>Bandstand</em> to network producers. The show lost much of its local flavor when ABC producers changed the interior design to a generic, national backdrop by adding a United States map and discarded local high school pennants. Delmont said, “When ABC decided to take <em>Bandstand</em> national in 1957, dozens of local markets had or would soon start their own teen dance shows.” It was those changes ABC made when debuting nationally that caused teenagers to tune into <em>American Bandstand</em> instead of their local programs. Even though the show displeased critics like Shanley, ABC guaranteed that <em>Bandstand</em> became a facet of American popular culture until the show finished in 1989 because it created a mainstream teenage culture in the United States and popularized television shows created for a specific youth audience."],"display_date":"August 5, 1957","search_date":"1957-08-05","locations":[{"id":30458,"lat":39.878712355,"lng":-75.2036894677,"zoom":10,"place":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":2197,"tag":"Television"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":123,"school_id":3}},{"id":6081,"title":"<strong>Violence Erupts at Altamont Free Concert</strong>","course_id":123,"status":"P","start_date":"12/6/69","end_date":"12/6/69","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones took the stage at Altamont Speedway the atmosphere was already intense. While the sun went down the Rolling Stones began their fateful set at a concert that was the culmination of their 1969 US tour, and by far the most violent. What promoters had advertised as a free concert for one and all featuring the immensely popular Rolling Stones, quickly degenerated into a violent, intimidating, and frightening scene in the northern California countryside.","The Rolling Stones’ US tour manager Sam Cutler had hired the San Francisco chapter of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club to provide security for the concert. According to Bill Wyman, former bassist of the Rolling Stones, the Hell’s Angels agreed to protect the generators and stage from the crowd. They agreed to be paid with $500 worth of beer. Wyman recalls in his book <em>Rolling With the Stones</em> that by the time the Stones began the third song of their set the crowd had become unruly and close to completely out of control.","In the documentary film <em>Gimme Shelter</em>, which focuses on the 1969 Rolling Stones tour, Mick Jagger can be seen and heard pleading with the crowd to, “Just calm down in the front there. Cool it man.” Jagger was speaking in response to a series of brawls that had broken out directly in front of the stage, between Hell’s Angels members and concert-goers. It was here, in front of the stage, that eighteen year-old Meredith Hunter was stabbed to death by a Hells Angel. As seen in <em>Gimme Shelter</em> it is clear that Hunter revealed and began brandishing a revolver in the midst of the crowd, when Hells Angel Alan Passaro drew a knife and charged Hunter, stabbing him to death. The concert ended there, as the situation had gone beyond the control of the band. Later proceedings found that Passaro acted in self-defense, with the documentary footage providing the key evidence, along with the police report that the deceased Hunter had been under the influence of methamphetamines at the time of his death.","Although the Rolling Stones cannot be directly blamed for the violence at Altamont, their music incited movement and action, and represented the counter-culture of the sixties and seventies. However, people like Meredith Hunter, and the Hells Angels, were drawn to the Rolling Stones because their music addressed social problems, promised freedom from the banality of everyday life, and glorified drug use and other illegal activity."],"display_date":"December 6, 1969","search_date":"1969-12-06","locations":[{"id":33268,"lat":37.7659991545,"lng":-122.286458807,"zoom":9,"place":"Alameda, California"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":123,"school_id":3}}]}
