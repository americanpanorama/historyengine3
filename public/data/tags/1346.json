There was a lot of anticipation that led up to this march, as it was a long walk and a big mission. Although Dr. King was not able to attend, the people still assembled at Brown Chapel in Selma, Alabama with high hopes and a lot of optimism. During this time, brutality from police and white supremacists was not uncommon, but it had never reached the point of a war-like scenario because of their constant attempt at nonviolent protests. What these people were walking in to, they would end up running out of.","Although violent opposition from white police forces and activist’s wasn’t uncommon, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. still believed that having a nonviolent approach the only way to be successful. King wrote in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, “I have earnestly worked and preached against violent tension, but there is a type of constructive nonviolent tension that is necessary for growth.” King was a constant advocate for the idea of a nonviolent march and protest against this civil injustice, and he often spoke on behalf of large groups of people on how to be adamant for freedom, but respectful of resentment.Historian Peter J. Ling reflects on King’s determination to maintain a nonviolent approach by saying, “King undoubtedly spoke to, and for, African Americans, and their mounting challenge to white oppression sprang from hearing his non-violent call to arms.” This defends the ideas that while King was constantly rallying allies and making plans to further this movement for racial equality, he was still doing it in a peaceful way.","Though Dr. King thought this demonstration was best pursued with nonviolence, it didn’t mean that his opposing forces had the same ideas. As history makes very clear in this march from Selma, peace and nonviolence were not at all important to the white activists and state troopers who were present on the Pettus bridge, or to the man who eventually shot and killed Dr. King himself.  Ling says, “Movement activists, particularly militant black separatists, never saw King as their one great leader” which shows that even some African American’s didn’t agree with King’s tactics. He goes on to say, “privately, King's supporters knew that non-violence was not an outlook everyone shared.”","The fact that The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed by President Johnson after Bloody Sunday took place seems a little ironic. As much as King tried to maintain that nonviolence was the best solution, it took a violent day to strike the nerve of many Americans, and even the president. Ling recalls that, “when he [King] died, the non-violent movement seemed unable to continue without him.” which deepened the impression that he was the central leader behind those ideals and that without him, they were impossible to maintain. It took a violent act, to pass a peaceful one."],"display_date":"March 1965","search_date":"1965-03-16","locations":[{"id":32444,"lat":32.3258382723,"lng":-87.106506935,"zoom":9,"place":"Dallas, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":1333,"tag":"Martin Luther King Jr."},{"id":1346,"tag":"Voting Rights Act of 1965"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":84,"school_id":10}},{"id":5712,"title":"Voting Rights Prove to be a Hard Sell in Alabama","course_id":110,"status":"P","start_date":"3/7/65","end_date":"8/6/65","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Bernice Daffron, a black resident of St. Clair County, Alabama, did not understand why the country was suddenly so concerned with the issue of voter registration among blacks.  Daffron stated in an editorial printed in <em>The Birmingham News</em> that she had “always been encouraged to vote,” and that this was the case “in many other counties.”  According to Daffron, the national attention drawn to Alabama following “Bloody Sunday” painted an erroneous picture of voting rights in her state.","The events of Bloody Sunday, the infamous march on March 7, 1965 from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, Alabama shocked the nation.  The peaceful protestors, marching to draw attention to voter registration issues among blacks, were subjected to terrible police brutality, and it is no surprise that images from this incident captivated the nation’s eye; however, some citizens like Daffron did not believe that this march and the subsequent coverage of Alabama were fairly recorded.  She was of the opinion that national political figures were distorting the events of Bloody Sunday to fulfill political ambitions, and that voter registration practices were not a substantial problem in Alabama.","<em>The Birmingham News</em>, which had been covering events both from a national perspective as well as from a local perspective, supported a similar position to Daffron's.  The <em>News</em> did not believe federal intervention in voter registration practices was necessary, and that the issue at hand “is not a matter of “giving” the Negro the vote.  It is a matter of affirming the right that is already there.”  While the <em>News</em> was correct in its assessment that the right to vote already existed, it was clear that simply acknowledging this right did not translate to its enforcement.","In Alabama in 1965, 69.2 percent of eligible whites were registered to vote compared with only 19.3 percent of eligible blacks.  That is a shocking disparity of 49.9 percent between the races, and it is unrealistic to assume that such a large gap could be closed by simply “affirming the right” that blacks were legally able to vote.  There were other underlying issues which the <em>News</em> subtly accounted for and supported.","The <em>News</em> supported not only an affirmation of the right to vote, but also the necessity of qualifiers for the right to vote.  The right to vote should not necessarily be racially determined, but it should be regulated by “more than just the fact of drawing breath.”  The <em>News</em> did not feel that there was a need to pass voting rights legislation, since it would be redundantly addressing rights already afforded to citizens in this country.  In spite of attempts by Daffron and the <em>News</em> to minimize the problems concerning voter registration, the events of Bloody Sunday did draw national attention to the issue of voting rights.","The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law by President Johnson on August 6, 1965, largely in response to the Bloody Sunday march.  Over time, the Act dramatically reduced racial disparity in voter registration.  As of 2004, 73.8 percent of eligible whites were registered to vote in Alabama, while 72.9 percent of eligible blacks were registered, closing the gap to just 0.9 percent.  Regardless of the opinions of Daffron and the <em>News</em>, the attention garnered by Bloody Sunday was both important and necessary, and led to a dramatic and positive change in the ability of blacks to register to vote throughout both Alabama and the nation."],"display_date":"March 7, 1965 - August 6, 1965","search_date":"1965-05-22","locations":[{"id":32444,"lat":32.3258382723,"lng":-87.106506935,"zoom":9,"place":"Dallas, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":1346,"tag":"Voting Rights Act of 1965"},{"id":1345,"tag":"Selma"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}}]}
