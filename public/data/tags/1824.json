Blackford explained his troops had made progress on the line despite the lack of engagement from the Union. Not far from Blackford’s soldiers, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson’s troops had implemented a vital military mission to destroy the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad lines. “Burning bridges and tearing up tracks retard the movements of the enemy,” commented the lieutenant, “but not burning up a depot, or the houses of the railroad employees.” The lieutenant explained that although the majority of citizens working in the railroad depots were Union, the men remained silent while the army destroyed the railroad lines.","Railroads, for northern and southern states, provided an expansive consumer market that was not available with wagons. Rail lines like the Baltimore and Ohio were originally laid to economically connect the valley lands with rail lines that were already laid in the North in order to provide a reliable shipping industry. According to historian James McPherson, “With the cash from sale of [crops, customers] bought food and clothing and hardware previously made locally or by themselves but now grown, processed, or manufactured elsewhere and shipped in by canal or rail.” In conjunction to connecting the areas, the rates for shipping by rail was cheaper than shipping by wagon; many citizens used wagons to haul their excess merchandise (crops, clothing, etc.) to rail stations and then shipped the merchandise on rail lines.","The destruction of a segment of the Baltimore and Ohio railroad had military and symbolic importance to the Confederate Army. McPherson wrote, “President John W. Garrett of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was a firm unionist and offered the railroad’s facilities to carry troops and supplies from the west.” During raids of the railroad systems, the Confederate Army often gained railroad equipment for their own damaged lines; what could not be carried, the Confederate troops destroyed and burned to ensure the Union could not refurbish the damaged pieces. The decimation of railroad systems, like the Baltimore and Ohio, would deprive Union troops of vital sources of supplies (ammunition, medical provisions, and extra clothing resources) and, most imperative to the health of the Union army, food rations for soldiers."],"display_date":"October 21, 1862","search_date":"1862-10-21","locations":[{"id":14533,"lat":39.4640522698,"lng":-78.0275332326,"zoom":9,"place":"BERKELEY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"},{"id":1822,"tag":"Stonewall Jackson"},{"id":1823,"tag":"B&amp;O Railroad"},{"id":1824,"tag":"Railroads"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5820,"title":"Pennsylvania Train Crash Leaves Several Dead","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-09-01","end_date":"1871-09-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Democratic Watchman </em>of Bellefonte, PA reported on an accident that occurred on the P & E rail line (Pennsylvania and Erie Railroad). The accident resulted in six passengers and crewmembers dead, as well as many others injured. The train was travelling at an excessive speed and the conductor lost control, which resulted in the train running off the tracks. The issue reported is centered on what should be done and who bore responsibility for the loss of lives from crashes as described in the article.","The argument that the <em>Democratic Watchman </em>is trying to make is that there needed to be some kind of means to protect these lower class workers in the north and the south. The newspaper is also trying to help put the blame when a on the railroad company owners when accidents occur because they are the people that were benefitting primarily from the railroads. An interesting statement from the articles says, “…there are engineers who can neither read nor write, and whose written orders have to read to them by a second party.”","The development of the railroad, in during Reconstruction had a significant impact on the United States and economic growth. The Railroads opened up the west to development and it helped the south grow its industrial economy. Historian Eric Foner states, “…the railroad, like the war itself, acted as a nationalizing force, sharply reducing transportation costs and establishing a vast national market that laid the foundation for the explosive growth that, within a quarter century would make the United States the world’s preeminent industrial nation.” Foner’s words emphasize the impact that the railroad had on the country and economy.","The railroads attracted many working class citizens to employment because railroads jobs were nearly always available, according to historian Michael Fitzgerald.","The railroads did benefit the country’s economy in many positive ways, but the negatives highlighted in the article showed that the issues were not something that were talked about, or regulated properly throughout. Jobs were widely available, but the lack of worker protection and education also was an issue in the growing industrial economy."],"display_date":"September 1, 1871","search_date":"1871-09-01","locations":[{"id":11010,"lat":42.1560237395,"lng":-80.1032079004,"zoom":9,"place":"ERIE, Pennsylvania"},{"id":10918,"lat":40.9190359343,"lng":-77.8196278227,"zoom":9,"place":"CENTRE, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1824,"tag":"Railroads"},{"id":1880,"tag":"Reconstuction"},{"id":1881,"tag":"Industrialization"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6194,"title":"The Once Compact City: Opelika, AL and Industrial Redevelopment","course_id":127,"status":"P","start_date":"7/1/49","end_date":"7/31/49","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1949, the Sanborn Map Company updated its detailed survey of Opelika, Alabama. This map contains a wealth of detail, including all major and minor structures within the city limits, and detailed information about their function. Sanborn published this map (and others like it) for the benefit of insurance companies, who used them to estimate the fire risk for different structures in the town. For example, a house located next to the higly flammable Alabama Oil and Guano Company would likely be assessed a higher insurance rate than one further away. Although the Sanborn maps had a narrow purpose at the time they were published, historians have realized that the information they contain is useful for a wide variety of purposes. The maps show where specific homes, businesses, and other important buildings were located relative to other structures. They also show how communities developed over time, as the company published updated maps every few years. In the case of Opelika, the map also shows how certain patterns of development can make it difficult for cities to adapt to economic realignment.\tOpelika in 1949 had a very compact city structure, with little wasted space. The city radiates out from a central rail hub, where the Central of Georgia and Western of Alabama railroads converge. The Lee County Court House and City Hall are only a few blocks away, and many businesses and homes are tightly clustered around them. Opelika is not a densely populated area, but it makes efficient use of the available space anyway. Despite having many facilities for the maintenance and sale of automobiles, the city lends itself to easy walking. Homes and businesses are located close to each other. It is important to note, however, that Opelika would have been subject to the same Jim Crow segregation rules as the rest of South during this time period. The school for black children is located on the edge of the city, far away from many amenities. \tAfter 1949, Opelika’s pattern of economic development began to change rapidly. New businesses, such as textile mills and the Uniroyal tire factory, arose outside of the city limits. Other businesses went into decline and closed, including the passenger rail station. As a result, Opelika moved towards a pattern of “suburbanizing” industry away from traditional city centers.","This was a pattern in many American cities in the latter half of the twentieth century. Thomas Sugrue’s <em>The Origins of the Urban Crisis</em> explains this phenomenon in detail, using the city of Detroit as his chief example. As industries fled inner cities all across America, those areas rapidly deteriorated. It is still proving difficult to redevelop those former industrial areas for useful purposes, with Opelika a prime example of this."],"display_date":"July 1949","search_date":"1949-07-16","locations":[{"id":27023,"lat":32.6011777617,"lng":-85.3556271043,"zoom":10,"place":"Lee, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":2402,"tag":"Economic History"},{"id":2401,"tag":"City Planning"},{"id":2400,"tag":"Redevelopment"},{"id":1824,"tag":"Railroads"},{"id":2335,"tag":"Industrial History"},{"id":2334,"tag":"Opelika, Alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Fundamentals of Environmental History","school":"Auburn University","course_id":127,"school_id":73}},{"id":6849,"title":"The Tragic Death of President Pierce's Son in a Railroad Accident","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-06","end_date":"1853-01-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Franklin Pierce rode the Boston and Maine Railroad with his wife, Jane, and only son, Bennie, on their return trip from Jane’s uncle’s funeral in January of 1853. Pierce won the presidential election against Winfield Scott the previous year and was preparing for his inauguration in two months. Approximately five minutes into the trip, the train entered the first bend in the line near Andover. Suddenly, an axel on the rail car broke in two, causing the car to be thrown from the tracks at forty miles per hour, careen down a twenty-foot embankment and land in a pile of wreckage. <em>The Huntington </em><em>Globe </em>reported that the car was “crushed to atoms.” Bennie, age eleven, was thrown from his seat on impact and killed in front of his onlooking parents. Both Pierce and Jane were severely bruised, and several other passengers in the car sustained serious injuries although there were no other fatalities reported. According to White House historians, the event traumatized Pierce and his wife for the remainder of their lives, and many believe that it had a profound effect on Pierce’s presidency.","Just a few months earlier, Franklin Pierce won the presidential election in a landslide electoral college vote. Debates in the 1852 presidential election focused on slavery, with Pierce drawing a significant portion of southern support for his position to act in favor of states’ rights to retain slavery where it already existed. Historian James McPherson says that this support was necessary to draw a two-thirds majority for the Democratic bid and then to sweep the Whigs’ Winfield Scott in the election.","Pierce’s political victory was short lived with the tragedy that befell his son. Pierce continued to grieve even on the day of his inauguration, evident in the opening line of his speech: “It [is] a relief to feel that no heart but my own can know the personal regret and bitter sorrow over which I have been borne to a position so suitable for others rather than desirable for myself.” Pierce thus became President of the United States “nervously exhausted,” according to White House historians. In addition, his wife Jane was so heartbroken that she did not attend the ceremony and stayed at home in New Hampshire. She remained a reclusive first lady for the duration of Pierce’s presidency.","The train wreck became a metaphor for the remainder of Pierce’s time in office. His negligent leadership through multiple conflicts of his presidency helped to polarize the country. It saw the repeal of the Missouri Compromise through the enactment of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and set the stage for outright fighting between free-soilers and pro-slavery supporters in Kansas, known as “Bloody Kansas.” Meanwhile slavery debate in the House of Representatives lead pro-slavery Preston Brooks to beat abolitionist Charles Sumner with a cane which the situation. Pierce’s refusal to send federal troops to Kansas to put down the violence was heavily criticized by Democrats, loosing him the Democratic nomination in the 1856 presidential election."],"display_date":"January 6, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-06","locations":[{"id":53178,"lat":42.162902127816,"lng":-75.118826455943,"zoom":8,"place":"Essex County Massachusetts USA"}],"tags":[{"id":1824,"tag":"Railroads"},{"id":1864,"tag":"The Civil War"},{"id":3653,"tag":"Franklin Pierce"},{"id":3654,"tag":"Bloody Kansas"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6850,"title":"Completion of the Blue Ridge Tunnel","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-01-01","end_date":"1857-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The completion of the Blue Ridge Tunnel was the pinnacle of American railroad engineering in the late 1850s. At 4,273 feet long, the tunnel was the longest ever constructed in the United States in 1858. Using funds from the Commonwealth of Virginia, the Central Virginia Railroad hired famous engineer Claudius Crozet for the project. He then found several contractors to do the work. The laborers consisted primarily of Irish-born immigrants fleeing the famine of 1845-1852, and enslaved African Americans. The Irish were tasked with boring the tunnel itself. These workers slowly hammered away at the extraction of solid rock—50,000 cubic yards—with hand chisels and black powder (the precursor to dynamite). Progress went slowly and inconsistently throughout the eight years that they chipped away at the mountain. In 1851, the Irishmen averaged nineteen feet on the east side and seventy-two feet on the west side per month according to the Blue Ridge Tunnel Foundation. African Americans slaves who numbered about fifty for the duration of the project repaired the worn railroad grades, broke apart and removed ballast, and spread it, because they were not trusted with the use of black powder. ","Furthering the impeded progress of the tunnel was the Cholera outbreak of 1854, which plagued the workers. Because the tunnel is seventy feet higher on the western side, spring water flowed into the tunnel and was a natural source for workers to wash their hands after relieving themselves during their long shifts. Contamination of the water was inevitable. Sickness was a major issue for Crozet. He wrote, “Yesterday young Downey attended the funeral of his father, and on his way back was taken sick and was himself buried to-day. Another Harrington also died in a few hours—in all 11 in about a week.” With workers becoming deathly ill and attending funerals, the progress ground to a near standstill in 1854. ","Upon completion, the project allowed materials to be transported through the Blue Ridge Mountains into the Shenandoah Valley, which previously had been a much more labor-intensive process that had included the use of roadways and canals of over 400 miles. The series of tunnels—the largest of which was the Blue Ridge—accomplished this feat in seventeen miles according the Blue Ridge Tunnel Foundation. With the tunnel completed, goods could then enter the Shenandoah Valley efficiently, and the western part of Virginia could be settled more easily. Completion of the railroad line using the tunnel was stalled by the onset of the Civil War. However, the project did serve a military significance when it was used by Stonewall Jackson’s troops to efficiently move through the mountains, helping to earn them the nickname of “foot cavalry”. The amount of effort put into constructing the tunnel is a testament to the importance of railroads for the time period. The efficient movement of goods allowed industry to flourish on a scale that eventually became known as the American Industrial Revolution.
