Young International Airport).  Later, in the 1990s, the city decided that there should be a buffer between the airport’s runways and the neighborhood that now existed right next to the airport.  The disappearing houses are largely thanks to a 1994 plan by the Detroit City Council to buy out around five hundred neighborhood residents in order to create this buffer, called the French Road Mini-Take.  Assured that the project would only take 18 months and they would not be left in a no-man’s land, the residents agreed to it.  Twenty years later, however, the project has still not been completed.  Several mayors have since promised to finish it, but the lack of funds available to the city have resulted in 100-150 occupied homes still remaining in a sort of limbo amid the empty lots— there are homes, but the neighborhood has been stripped away."],"display_date":"1981 - 1997","search_date":"1989-07-02","locations":[{"id":37726,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2018,"tag":"aerial photograph"},{"id":2017,"tag":"French Road"},{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":1933,"tag":"Detroit City Airport"},{"id":1935,"tag":"Nortown, Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5984,"title":"Downzoning on the Mt.

Elliott St. in Northeast Detroit depicts somber remnants of a thriving past.  It takes you along a desolate street with few stores; the only buildings are small warehouses, repair shops, junkyards, and a few small parts stores.  Traveling along the corridor, empty lots and abandoned buildings line the streets, remnants of a once-bustling business district.  Many of the buildings— both abandoned and those that are still in use— are covered in graffiti, with weeds growing up around the storefronts and the windows of empty buildings broken or missing and boarded up.  The Grand Trunk Rail Line, established in the area in the 1870s by P.W. Norris, which brings freight to the area, now carries much less freight traffic than it did at the height of the auto industry.","For much of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Mt. Elliott corridor was full of thriving industry.  The Grand Trunk brought raw materials to the small businesses along Mt. Elliott and Sherwood, which runs parallel to Mt. Elliott along the tracks.  Most of the businesses were feeder plants that supplied parts and steel to Detroit auto factories like the Packard Plant, River Rouge facility, and the Highland Park Plant.  In the late 1970s, however, the auto industry began to move south to take advantage of the lower labor costs ensured by right-to-work laws in those states, and these feeder plants became less necessary.  Much like the rest of the city, the businesses experienced a general decline that matched that of the car companies.  Many areas were designated as partially contaminated brownfields, and taxes were lowered on the land.  As a response, Mt. Elliott was downzoned from “heavy” to “restricted” industrial, and many of the businesses that could move in were ones that required little startup capital and were not heavily industrialized— the junkyards and repair shops that are there now."],"display_date":"1977 - 1999","search_date":"1988-07-01","locations":[{"id":35437,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1970,"tag":"zoning"},{"id":1935,"tag":"Nortown, Detroit"},{"id":2109,"tag":"Mt.

Philetus W. Norris was central in the development of the land that would later become North East Detroit.  From 1865 to 1877 he burned the candle at both ends by constantly selling property while facilitating the expansion of the railroad into the territory he was helping to settle.  Norris impressed potential buyers with his eloquent speech, military background, and wide-ranging personal interests.  He labored intensively as a real estate agent and speculator, and evidence of his work can be found in the numerous records of sales recorded in the Register’s office, which are still available through the archives of the <em>Detroit Free Press</em>.","P.W. Norris worked tirelessly to bolster his village, as well as his pocketbook. His efforts included extensive advertising for the settlement, even to the point of dishonesty in embellishing his undertakings for the settlement’s success.","Norris' biographer posits that P.W. Norris eventually left Michigan due to “an insufficient number of new Detroiters to buy lots in his village.”  But Norris’ son, E.A. Norris, continued his father’s legacy, as seen in the numerous accounts of real estate sales in E.A. Norris’ name.  When Philetus died in 1885, Edward took on the role of managing the entire business; but he was not blessed with his father’s charisma and was prosecuted many times in petty lawsuits.  It has been speculated that the area’s name was changed from “Norris” to “North Detroit” due to Edward’s contentious nature, although no formal explanation for the change was ever given.","Edward, and the rest of Col. Norris’ immediate family, died in 1929.  The village no longer bore his name, and most of the original houses have since been destroyed or marred by fire.  As such, Col. Norris slipped into the recesses of historical memory.  His own house, which he built himself, still stands on its original location at 17815 Mt. Elliott Ave.  But it too has been terribly tarnished by arson.  The Nortown Community Development Corporation owns the property and has plans to restore it, but lack of funding has delayed the project for years.  The house seems doomed to stay in its current dilapidated state, unless someone can harness the energy of Philetus Norris and breathe new life into the long stalled project."],"display_date":1885,"search_date":"1885-07-02","locations":[{"id":6598,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1935,"tag":"Nortown, Detroit"},{"id":1915,"tag":"Norris"},{"id":2151,"tag":"Real Estate"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
