Grant.  Rather than withdrawing north past the Rapidian and Rappahannock Rivers after major actions in the Wilderness subsided, the Army of the Potomac continued to march south.  Nonetheless, the battlefield account of Colonel Nelsen Penfield provides a greater understanding of front line experiences that shaped future engagements along the Po River, the “Bloody Angle,” and the Battle of Spotsylvania."],"display_date":"May 3, 1864 - August 8, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-20","locations":[{"id":14293,"lat":38.1882210605,"lng":-77.65248979,"zoom":9,"place":"SPOTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":352,"tag":"\"Wilderness, Battle of\""},{"id":353,"tag":"\"Union Army\""},{"id":354,"tag":"\"Penfield, Nelson\""},{"id":357,"tag":"\"125th New York Infantry\""}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}}]}
