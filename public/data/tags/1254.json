These places of worship were the hub of not only religion, but community, politics, and commerce as well. Palaces like the Notre Dame cathedral served as the heart and soul of the town and its people. In modern times, the center of commerce and congregation has shifted far away from the church and landed on the temples of retail, the department store. Much like the church did in medieval times the department store offers people living in modern villages the chance to gather together, connect, and socialize with people from their community. One of the best examples of this can be seen in the landmark that is Macy’s. Macy’s of New York first opened its doors on October 28, 1858. This iconic New York landmark serves as not only a department store but a tourist attraction as well. Like their famous advertisement says, “If you haven’t seen Macy’s, you haven’t seen New York.”","Historians like Vincent Miller argue that retail is the new religion of the modern age. People go to their local temple and worship the gods that are wealth, status, and luxury. They claim that socioeconomic status has become the new measure of a person in Western society. Some go as far as to say that people have become walking billboards for various brands by sporting logos and trademarks on everything from their shirt to their shoes. Department stores and other various retail outlets have been vilified for everything from sales practices to profit margins.","In his book, <em>The Practice of Everyday, Life</em> the French author Michel de Certeau poses a very different argument. He suggests that the “ordinary man” is the one who is in control. Certeau uses the poetic example of maps and walking down a city street. A city, like New York, finds its heartbeat in its inhabitants. While walking down the street all of the sights, sounds, and smells you encounter are completely subjective. This is also true for a walk through a department store like Macy’s. He goes on to say that maps exist as a way for people to pin down a cityscape, a feat that can never really be accomplished because it is composed of the people who are ever changing. Certeau argues that executives, leaders, and even academics are disconnected from the city by their offices that are high above the rest of the world. Therefore, they are virtually powerless over the public who use various tactics like alteration and mobility to process the world around them in a unique and unknowable way.","In either case, Macy’s has managed to become and remain an iconic American institution for over 150 years. Whether it be in films, commercials, or the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the “magic of Macy’s” will continue to bewitch the American public for generations to come."],"display_date":"1859 - 1876","search_date":"1868-01-01","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1254,"tag":"Macy's"},{"id":1255,"tag":"consumerism"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5413,"title":"The Magic of Macy's","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-01-01","end_date":"1858-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Over the years New York City has become known for various different attractions: the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, Broadway, etc. One of New York’s oldest and most famous landmarks is Macy’s. Like one of their vintage advertisements says, “If you haven’t seen Macy’s you haven’t seen New York.” Macy’s department store has become a fixture of American culture. This iconic retailer takes its name from founder R. H. Macy. Located in the heart of Manhattan, Macy’s flagship store has been attracting shoppers and tourists alike for over 150 years.","Macy’s, like many department stores, is a major destination during the holiday season. Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade as well as the Christmas shopping rush have become just as ingrained in American culture as the store itself. A famous article appeared in the December 1948 edition of <em>Life</em> that offered a glimpse into the world of Macy’s. This article details the massive shopping frenzy that occurs between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. An average of 250,000 shoppers flooded the store every day looking for everything form pearls and fur to imported foods and wine. A team of 14,000 employees worked feverishly from opening to close selling roughly one million dollars worth of merchandise per day. This was an astronomical figure at the time especially when you consider that Macy’s was a cash and carry store during this period.","The popularity of the department store is something that exploded during the post World War II era. This was the time when the economy was on the rise and the very fabric of shopping changed. Larger retailers like Macy’s were expanding and becoming increasingly popular. The United States began to move away form small mom and pop shops and towards larger chain stores. This was extremely beneficial for Macy’s because it ushered in a period of expansion and profit.","Macy’s has a legacy that stretches over many generations. The “magic of Macy’s” is referenced in everything from books and movies to television shows and magazines. Macy’s has become and will remain an iconic part of American culture. So the next time you’re out shopping remember immortal words of Lucille Ball, “I found a lot of cute things at Macy’s.”"],"display_date":1858,"search_date":"1858-07-02","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1254,"tag":"Macy's"},{"id":1256,"tag":"Christmas"},{"id":1257,"tag":"Thanksgiving"},{"id":1258,"tag":"Shopping"},{"id":1259,"tag":"Holidays"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}}]}
