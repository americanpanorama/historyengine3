Dylan explains Zimmerman’s disappearance was due to a motorcycle accident in 1964. In the place of Bobby, Andrew Muchin believes, Bob Dylan began his career by “re-animating tradition-laden folk music with original, topical songs.” Bob Dylan found success with this in his songs such as “Blowin’ in the Wind,” “Masters of War” and “Like A Rolling Stone.” As Dylan notes he became labeled the conscience of a generation but really, he felt he “…was only a musician.”  In Muchin’s article Dylan’s Jewish Identity is questioned and the feeling is “There’s a sense of Jewishness, especially culturally, but also an overriding feeling that ‘you’re an American.’”"],"display_date":1961,"search_date":"1961-07-02","locations":[{"id":33199,"lat":40.5763036462,"lng":-74.2034374021,"zoom":11,"place":"Richmond, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":300,"tag":"Bob Dlyan"},{"id":301,"tag":"Dylan"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":26,"school_id":3}}]}
