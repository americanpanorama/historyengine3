He was traveling by bus from Charleston, South Carolina which made a stop in Augusta, Georgia. He got off to stretch his legs and as soon as he took his seat again the driver told him to get off without giving him an explanation. The soldier proceeded to the driver what the problem was and the driver replied by telling him “for blowing your top you will be leaving on the next bus at one-fifteen in the morning.” At that point two military policemen walked up and he asked one why he could not ride on that particular bus. One responded in a nice manner and the other insultingly. The officer who responded rudely replied to his comrade, “you let a nigger talk to you like that,” and told the soldier if he didn’t like the way things were then he would send him back to Charleston and he ought to arrest him.","A similar case occurred in 1946, when Isaac Woodard was returning home to South Carolina. At a stop on the way he had an altercation with the driver over permission to use the restroom.  After using the restroom he returned to his seat without any problems but at the next stop the driver called Sherriff Linwood Shull, who removed Isaac Woodard from the bus. Shull demanded to see Woodward's discharge papers and a group of officers led him to an alleyway and beat him with nightsticks. Woodard was then taken to jail and charged with disorderly conduct and took more beatings and jabs throughout the night. As a result both of his eyes ruptured and he suffered partial amnesia. He was found guilty and fined fifty dollars by a local judge still not knowing where he was. He received substandard care and it took ten days before his family located him. President Truman was outraged when news reached him and he ordered the Attorney General to investigate. Sherriff Shull admitted to blinding Woodard and was acquitted after 30 minutes of deliberation.","Incidents and cases like this were common for African American soldiers. Reports like this that made to President Harry Truman’s desk angered him because United States soldiers were being treated so disrespectfully. It was not just the enlisted soldiers but also the veterans. The constant mistreatment of black soldiers on and off the battlefield led to President Truman establishing by executive order the President’s Committee on Civil Rights on December 5, 1946. They were instructed to investigate the status of Civil Rights in the United States and propose measures to strengthen and protect the rights of American citizens. These incidents and the cruel treatment issued to African American soldiers raised a need to issue Executive Order 9981 on July 26, 1946, banning segregation in the Armed Forces."," "],"display_date":"July 21, 1943","search_date":"1943-07-21","locations":[{"id":27255,"lat":34.3540813642,"lng":-83.4974029355,"zoom":10,"place":"Banks, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1733,"tag":"Racism, South, soldiers"},{"id":1734,"tag":"WWII, African Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}},{"id":5729,"title":"Army Segregation Problem","course_id":110,"status":"P","start_date":"3/13/44","end_date":"3/13/47","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Private Bert B. Babero, was an African American soldier enlisted in the United States Army during World War II. While stationed at an army base in Pennsylvania, he was surprised to find that segregation was practiced that far north. Although African Americans and Caucasians were fighting in the same war for the same cause, Private Babero still experienced racial injustice. Out of the four movie theaters on post only one was allowed to be used by black soldiers. Having strong emotions of injustice and social inequality Private Babero wrote to attorney Truman Gibson numerous time of the segregation on the army base, not in the hopes that he would file a claim against the base, but rather in hopes that he and other like him would realize that what was happening was wrong and would one day have the courage to do something to change it.","As with the Great War black soldiers returned from WWII as champions of democracy to a society that still treated them as second class citizens. During the 1920s the older generation pushed a civil rights agenda but with little success. World War II bought about irreversible change. The defense jobs that were held by African Americans at the time rose from 3 to 8 percent. A new sense of mission was forged and black Americans joined by some white allies began to express resistance to passive acceptance of the pre-war status quo. The number of registered voters in the south increased to 12 percent by 1947, led by black soldiers.","At this time in American history the practice of Jim Crow laws and segregation was a common thing throughout the country. While training and fighting on the war front there was still fighting going on the home front even in different military divisions. While fighting in Europe African American soldiers returned home with a new sense of pride and accomplishment. They had this militaristic attitude that they were not going to return home to the same segregated theaters, dinners and restaurants, transportation, or being banned from voting."," "],"display_date":"March 13, 1944 - March 13, 1947","search_date":"1945-09-11","locations":[{"id":28078,"lat":41.3021722403,"lng":-80.2577161025,"zoom":9,"place":"Mercer, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1734,"tag":"WWII, African Americans"},{"id":1735,"tag":"World War II, Racism"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}}]}
