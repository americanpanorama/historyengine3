They stayed until the wee hours of the morning to assure that blacks were not out past their curfews during the race riots in Detroit. The photo was captioned with “U.S. Army Airborne Infantry stopped cars in violation of the curfew at a French Road intersection on Detroit's East Side.”","The summer of 1967 was an important historical moment created by the city of Detroit’s black residence. They caused an outburst of conflicts around the country. For five days in July, Detroit, Michigan sprung into complete chaos. Proceeding, an economic boom from the auto industry created jobs, and urban renewal projects built new infrastructure in the city, but blacks were left out of this upward mobility. As a result, in a city with majority black residency, this caused a major problem. New plans were destroying black neighborhoods, and economic opportunities were scarce for black residents and the riots were just one show of reactions to these battles that they were facing as a community."," "," "],"display_date":"July 27, 1967","search_date":"1967-07-27","locations":[{"id":33546,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":175,"tag":"African American Sufferage"},{"id":2003,"tag":"Nortown"},{"id":2017,"tag":"French Road"},{"id":1055,"tag":"Race riot,"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5963,"title":"Sojourner Truth Homes Controversy","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/41","end_date":"12/31/42","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The two photographs show very conflicting images.  One is a flyer distributed by local white residents requesting assistance from other white people outside their neighborhood to help keep black Detroiters from moving into the newly-completed public housing project just north of Hamtramck and on the eastern boundary of Nortown. It encourages people to “Help the White People to keep this district white” and “don’t be YELLOW— come out we need every WHITE MAN.”  The other flyer, distributed by outraged black inner city residents, calls for “Negroes [to] Unite for Justice and Democracy!!!” to “PROTEST LOSS OF SOJOURNER TRUTH HOMES” at a “GIGANTIC” mass meeting at a local church.  It then lists several facts about the Sojourner Truth Homes, telling people that they were built for black defense workers, then that a Congressman and a real estate company successfully lobbied to have black residents prohibited from living in the neighborhood.","These flyers represent the two sides of the huge conflict over the building of homes to house black defense workers that previously lived in inner city slums.  When the U.S. increased its involvement in WW2, the amount of production in Detroit increased as well.  With this industrial boom came large numbers of new workers, many of them black.  Most of these workers ended up in the already crowded slums of the downtown black neighborhoods in Detroit.  City leaders and the NAACP then called for new homes to be built using federal dollars to house these workers, and a neighborhood at the corner of Nevada and Fenelon was selected and named the Sojourner Truth Housing Project.  However, white residents of the area were extremely angry that blacks would soon be moving into homes near theirs, and blacks were just as furious when Congressman Rudolph Tenerowicz led a movement to instead allow only whites to live in the neighborhood.  A major clash ensued on February 28, 1942 when several black families attempted to move into homes they’d been paying rent on for two months and were harassed by white militants.  Two months later, the original plan came to partial fruition when city and state police officers and Michigan National Guard troops guarded 168 black residents as they moved into the Sojourner Truth Homes."],"display_date":"1941 - 1942","search_date":"1941-12-31","locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2021,"tag":"African American history"},{"id":1969,"tag":"Public housing"},{"id":2003,"tag":"Nortown"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5987,"title":"Two New State Prisons Rise in Northeast Detroit","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"10/3/88","end_date":"10/3/88","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["African American migrants who came to cities like Detroit with ambitious dreams about prosperity in the North, were sadly disappointed during times of recession in the city when there were not enough jobs available for them. As a consequence of the thousands of jobless, homeless, poorly educated and starving African-Americans in Detroit crime was high and upward mobility was low. Rather than address the underlying issues of racial discrimination, poor housing, and lack of jobs, in 1988 the Michigan Department of Corrections announced plans to build \"two new state prisons for men being built on the northeast side of Detroit.\" This massive project in the heart of Nortown, already struggling with economic decline and flight to the suburbs, was attended by strongly differing views among the community.","The new prisons, and a new police precinct station neighboring the prisons, lay directly south of several residential neighborhoods. Mildred Stallings, chairperson of the citizens' group working with the state on the project, noted that \"the flight (from the neighborhoods) has not occurred\" as had been feared when the project was announced. But critics pointed out that people had few options about where to go if they didn’t want to live next to a state prison, and the ongoing lack of resources available for the struggling community.","In response to these concerns, the state required that 15 percent of the labor involved in building the prisons go to minorities and 5 percent to women. The project was supposed to provide an estimated 350 to 500 construction jobs. Bill Richardson, a partner with the management company on the construction of the project, said the project provided an excellent opportunity for minorities, but he said there aren't enough minorities in the industry to take advantage of the situation. Minorities \"have a hard time getting into the trade unions….Because they are not in the unions, it will be difficult for them to be representative in the work force\" on the project. So, although the intentions of the state and other officials seemed amenable to compromise, the results still left African Americans in Detroit with the \"short end of the stick.\""],"display_date":"October 3, 1988","search_date":"1988-10-03","locations":[{"id":37726,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1962,"tag":"African-American history"},{"id":2112,"tag":"Prison system"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":2003,"tag":"Nortown"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
