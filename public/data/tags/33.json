The end of slavery in the United States all but destroyed the agrarian economy of the southern states, and even with the constitutional abolition of slavery racial hostility ran high throughout the country. Yet as the country attempted to rebuild from the Civil War, a new kind of warfare emerged. This new battleground resulted from the rise of Industrialism, as resentment between laborers and employers intensified. New Orleans is a fascinating example of an intriguing storyline that followed. That is, where issues of racial equality collided with the clash of blue collar labor and managerial control. These two clashes, whose members at times overlapped, created an implausible framework where labor rights astonishingly overran racial tensions. This diverse composition of people, in terms of race, class, and age, is visibly evident in George Augustus Sala's 1883 illustration of the New Orleans levee. There are groups of children playing and wealthy well-dressed couples about, as longshoreman and other waterfront laborers of varying ages and ethnicities go about their business. In Sala's portrayal of the levee it is apparent that by the 1880s the New Orleans waterfront had not only evolved into a place of bustling commerce, but in addition an arena of relative brotherhood. ","            As a direct result of New Orleans' proximity to the Mississippi River, it quickly established itself as one of the most influential ports in the entire country. Consequently, the waterfront became the eminent employer of the city's labor force. By the 1870's a culture of ethnic cooperation, unheard of in almost all areas of the country and certainly the south, had naturally developed. This phenomenon was especially peculiar as it followed the racial tension fueled by the Civil War. The technological advances of the late nineteenth century and economic pushes for maximizing productivity and output put laborers and employers at odds. This battle for control was not isolated to New Orleans. Throughout the United States skilled and unskilled laborers alike combated this push by unionizing. While labor struggles were not isolated to New Orleans, this culture of ethnic harmony was. Union leaders, black and white, soon discovered that a racially unified union force was far more powerful than one divided. The nature of waterfront work in particular provided a platform for interracial cooperation in this city, whereas such an arena may not have been present in other American cities. This fact is due in part to the immense need for unskilled labor on the waterfront. Yet, as the ebb and flow of the industrial cycle began to turn at the end of the 1880's, the flicker of ethnic cooperation and racial equality in nineteenth century New Orleans proved to be no more than a compromise to battle white collar control. It would be nearly another 75 years before the issues of racial subjugation were addressed on a national level with the Civil Rights Movement.

The roundhouse caught fire.  Over one hundred locomotives belonging to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company were destroyed.  It was a wild night.\"  ","            According to historian Eric Foner, the \"Great Strike,\" which led to that \"wild night\" in Pittsburgh, began in Martinsburg, West Virginia on July 16, 1877.  In their book, <em>Constructing the American Past,</em> Elliot Gorn, Randy Roberts and Terry D. Bilhartz wrote that the workers began the strike when the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad \"announced a 10 percent wage cut for all employees,\" the second such cut in eight months and part of a policy for railroads across the country.  The strikers proceeded to shut down all train traffic through Martinsburg and move all the engines into the roundhouse.  Gorn et. al. wrote that the \"incidents begun in Martinsburg were repeated across the county,\" as workers from \"various industries refused to accept low wages.\"","            The conflagration that occurred in the Pittsburgh rail yards was, according to Gorn, the climax of the \"Great Strike.\"  Gorn et. al. wrote that three days after the strike began in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania Railroad managers angered the Pittsburgh workers by ordering \"that all trains running east from Pittsburgh be 'double headers.'  \"Double headers\" are trains with two engines that pull twice as many cars, and cause twice as much work and danger for the workers. Gorn et. al. wrote that once the Railroad workers walked off the job, they were joined by incensed workers from other industries.","            According to Gorn et. al. the state militia was called into Pittsburgh to control the strike, but many of the militia men sympathized with the strikers. One officer, as quoted by Gorn et al. said, \"the sympathy of the people, the sympathy of the troops, my own sympathy, was with the strikers proper.  We all felt that those men were not receiving enough wages.\"  Instead of controlling the strike, Gorn et. al. contended that many of the soldier put down their weapons and \"fraternized with the strikers.\"","            According to Gorn et. al., the clash between the militia and strikers began when 600 militiamen arrived from Philadelphia.  They noted that the small force of Philadelphia militiamen was faced by an angry mob of nearly 6,000 people.  The angry crowd of strikers included women  and children who jeered and threw rocks at the Philadelphia militiamen.  Foner wrote that because of this, the militia \"fired on the crowds that had seized railroad switches, killing twenty people.\"  According to historian Troy Rondinone, after the militia fired into the strikers they retreated into the roundhouse at the train yards. The strikers reacted to the shooting with outrage and in Rondinone's words \"it seemed as though the striking railroad workers had become a massed army.\"  Gorn et. al. described how the strikers armed themselves and attacked the militia men in the roundhouse by setting fire to it.  The strikers then proceeded to burn and in other ways destroy the train yard.  ","According to Gorn et. al., the rioting resulted in the destruction of 2,000 railroad cars and 100 engines.  \"The resulting fires,\" Rondinone wrote, \"could be seen at a distance of seven miles.\"  The incident in Pittsburgh is just one of the many events of 1877 that according to Gorn et.al., showed that a deep chasm divided and would continue to divide the rich and the poor in America.  In her memoirs \"Mother\" Jones blamed the rioting on and the fires on \"hoodlums backed by the business men of Pittsburgh who for a long time had felt that the Railroad Company discriminated against the city on the matter of rates.\"  However Gorn et. al. noted that Jones was a \"socialist known for her militant oratory,\" so it is likely that her beliefs, and the fact that she wrote her memoirs fifty years after the strikes, led her to believe that the strikers were innocent.  Innocent or guilty, according to Gorn et. al., the strikers were involved in the climax of the largest strike America had witnessed up until that point in her history."],"display_date":"July 19, 1877 - July 23, 1877","search_date":"1877-07-21","locations":[{"id":10817,"lat":40.468833638,"lng":-79.9812076782,"zoom":9,"place":"ALLEGHENY, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":156,"tag":"Labor Strike"},{"id":33,"tag":"Labor Union"},{"id":67,"tag":"Militia"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":5234,"title":"Infiltration of the Molly Maguires","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1894 McClures Magazine published a piece by Cleveland Moffett on the infiltration and the eventual downfall of the Molly Maguires, a violent and secretive Irish labor union accused of terrorizing Pennslyvania coal country. The heroes of the piece were wealthy mine owner Frankilin B. Gowen and Pinkerton detective James McCparland both according to Mclure were instrumental in toppling the Molly Maguires . The Mollies in contrast were depicted by McClures as villains who “killed men and women with whom they had no dealings, against whom they had no personal grievances, and from whose death they had nothing to gain, except, perhaps, the price of a few rounds of whiskey”.","According Moffet, in 1873 Franklin B. Gowen, President of the Reading Railroad, was fed up with the Molly Maguires. The Molly Maguires had been terrorizing the coal mines owned by Gowen and killing many officials who ran the mines. To finally rid himself of the Mollies Gowen enlisted the help of the Pinkerton detectives. Allen Pinkerton, head of the detectives, assigned James McParland to Mollie case. Pinkerton ordered McParland “to remain in the field until every cut-throat has paid with his life for the lives taken”.  A few weeks later McParland assumed the cover name McKenna and entered bar frequented by Mollies. In the bar McParland was accused of cheating in a card game and as a result found himself in a fight with a large Mollie named Frazier. McParland knocked out the much larger Frazier and became an instant sensation among Mollies, making it much easier for him to infiltrate the group. Soon McParland was inducted as a full fledged member of the Mollies and even became a secretary of the Shenandoah division. Afterwards McParland began traveling throughout the divisions of secret labor union, all the while gathering evidence Maguires against the Mollies.","Moffett’s sensationalized story on  Gowen and McPardland’s victory over the evil Molly Maguires is an interesting look into public opinion of the Mollies during that time; however many modern historians believe the situation was more complicated.  Historian Wayne Broehl, for example, asserts that Gowen conjured up the specter of the Molly in Pennsylvania to demonize labor unions. Broehl claims that Gowen was having problems with the labor union within his mines and after being unable to subdue the union “decided to break the struggling labor organization by painting it with the brush of Molly Maguireism.” Broehl’s argument does not seem implausible, but it does not explain the murdered mine officials. In any case Gowen’s idea of sending a man inside the Molly Maguires was successful.","McParland spent two and a half years under cover before there was sufficient evidence to bring down the Mollies. The evidence eventually led to the arrest of many suspected Mollies, nineteen of them for the crime of murder. All nineteen of these men were hanged and McParland’s evidence was vital to the cases."],"display_date":"1873 - 1875","search_date":"1874-07-02","locations":[{"id":11213,"lat":40.8520278753,"lng":-76.7091102455,"zoom":9,"place":"NORTHUMBERLAND, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":962,"tag":"Mines"},{"id":33,"tag":"Labor Union"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5236,"title":"Turncoat at the Mollie Trials","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-09-03","end_date":"1876-03-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1876 the New York Times published an article describing the murder trial of John P. Jones , a mine boss of the Lehigh and Wilkesbarre Coal Company. It was widely believed that Jones murderers were members of the secretive and violent Irish labor union called the Molly Maguires. During this time stories of the Mollies murdering mine bosses that crossed the group were very common.","A very interesting point the article made is that the prosecution actually had a witness that was close to the Mollies. James Kerrigan, a former member of the Mollies, was the prosecution’s star witness in the case. This was an anomaly because the Molly Maguires were such a secretive group, even its supposed own members did not acknowledge that the labor union existed. So the prosecution finding someone who was associated with the Mollies that was willing to testify against them was extremely powerful evidence. Kerrigan’s testimony implicated three alleged Mollies in the murders of Jones and a policeman named Yost.","Throughout the 1860s and 1870s Molly Maguires dominated the coal mines of Pennsylvania. It was difficult for authorities to stop the organization because there was very little evidence of the Mollies crimes or that they even existed. Kerrigan, an admitted member of the Mollies, testifying against other members was largely damaging to the organization. Historian Arthur Lewis describes Kerrigan as unremorseful while he testified against his former brethren. According to Lewis Kerrigan “ answered all questions cheerfully… and after seven hours on the stand, retired to his seat with the modest air of a good man who has just performed a citizen’s duty for which he expects no reward.”","According to the article Kerrigan’s testimony was hugely important. In the case that the piece focused on the evidence from Kerrigan helped solved two murders.  The article also claims that Kerrigan’s confessions “enabled the Police to reach some of the leaders and completely break up the gang.” Kerrigan’s testimony, according to the piece, was hugely responsible for toppling the Molly Maguires."],"display_date":"September 3, 1875 - March 26, 1876","search_date":"1875-12-14","locations":[{"id":10908,"lat":40.9182274637,"lng":-75.7088377722,"zoom":9,"place":"CARBON, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":33,"tag":"Labor Union"},{"id":91,"tag":"Murder"},{"id":956,"tag":"Trial"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5853,"title":"Pullman Strikers in Delray","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1894-07-05","end_date":"1894-07-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The July, 1894 conflict between the workers who made up the American Railway Union and their employers at the Pullman Company developed into a nationwide strike that affected emerging urban centers across the country. While the strike was originally centered in Pullman, Illinois, its effects quickly spread to the cities connected to Chicago by rail. On JUly 5, 1894, for instance, the normally uneventful voyage of a Wabash train from Chicago to Detroit's Union Station was interrupted when strikers decided to board it. The strikers took over the train, and according to the Chicago Tribune reporter assigned to the story \"threw\" the engineer and fireman off into the river. The writer characterizes their actions as \"violent\" and describes them as being part of a long series of protests against trains coming from Chicago into Detroit. The strikers' impressive turnout was augmented when they were joined by the deputies who had originally been tasked with stopping them from boarding the train. The author hints that while the strikers had impressive turnout, the Deputies were not outnumbered but rather were simply in support of, or in \"sympathy\" with the strikers.","Detroit was an important site for the massive Pullman strike, and it is clear that the workers were adamant about the improvement of their labor conditions. This early labor strike is particularly interesting in light of the enormous influence Detroit workers would have on the American labor movement throughout the twentieth century. At the time, historians, lawyers, and most importantly businessmen saw the strikers as a wild and “wicked” group tearing down a respectable business. Over time, however, popular perceptions of labor shifted from “unfavorable” to “favorable” and the interests of owners and workers came into greater conflict. The Pullman Strike offers a great entrée into issues of civil action, labor environment, and industry and how the city of Detroit has dealt with each of these dynamics."],"display_date":"July 5, 1894","search_date":"1894-07-05","locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":2175,"tag":"Pullman Strike"},{"id":33,"tag":"Labor Union"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}]}
