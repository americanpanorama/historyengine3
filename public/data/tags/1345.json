From a poor family, Marie dropped out of high school to get married, and had three children. She eventually went to a junior college and became a dental hygienist. Foster became more involved in the voting rights movement because of her outrage over the racial inequality and injustice that she was constantly witnessing.","It’s often thought that men were the ring-leaders of the Civil Rights Movement and they often received all of the credit for any progress made. According to historian Vicki Crawford, “major civil rights organizations idolized their leaders, all of whom are men.” Other historians have discovered that, “sexism and authoritarian views of leadership prevented women from assuming command.” Marie Foster, however, defied these ideas. She became a dominant figure in her community as a voting rights activist, and she was also one of the first eight members of the Dallas County Voters League. She worked with Dr. King and other leaders to bring Selma to the center of a national struggle. She later became known as the “mother of the voting rights movement.” Although some women were marginalized in the Civil Rights Movement, historians have found that many women were “spontaneous leaders and dedicated participants who exerted enormous influence.” Marie Foster was one such woman who was not afraid to rebel against the social norms, whether it be speaking out against racial inequality or speaking up in a room of men.","A very strong woman, Marie Foster withstood multiple death threats from the Ku Klux Klan, as well as being clubbed by a trooper in the Selma marches. This supports Crawford’s observation that, “despite the exclusion of black women from top positions in movement organizations and the little recognition they received from either blacks or whites for their contributions, the accounts of black women activists suggest that the movement gave women a sense of empowerment.” Foster is the epitome of an empowered woman motivated by justice. When a Dallas County Circuit Judge issued a law stating three or more blacks couldn’t meet together to discuss civil rights, she and her colleagues continued to meet in secret and discuss the future of racial equality. Marie even hosted a few meetings in her home as a direct defiance against the ruling.","Marie worked closely with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, and other major civil rights organizations that were run by men. However, one of her greatest times of success came when President Johnson made a national appearance announcing the Voting Rights bill on television. In her living room sat King and other male activists who are reported to have wept. While this was a huge turning point for the movement, it was also a major accomplishment for women of that day.","There is no doubt that Marie Foster is truly a hero and strong black woman. She’s referred to that by many people who knew her, and even some who didn’t. After passing in 2003, Marie Foster’s legacy is still known as a courageous one that will “never quit.”"," "],"display_date":"March 1965","search_date":"1965-03-16","locations":[{"id":32444,"lat":32.3258382723,"lng":-87.106506935,"zoom":9,"place":"Dallas, Alabama"},{"id":31382,"lat":31.9892499285,"lng":-87.3082084281,"zoom":9,"place":"Wilcox, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1345,"tag":"Selma"},{"id":1344,"tag":"Voting Rights Act"},{"id":1343,"tag":"Mary Foster"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":84,"school_id":10}},{"id":5711,"title":"Concerned White Citizens of Alabama Help Promote Rights for Blacks","course_id":110,"status":"P","start_date":"3/6/65","end_date":"3/6/65","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 6, 1965, Eileen Walbert, Helen Baer, Mary Young Gonzalez, and many more concerned white citizens began a controversial march in protest of voter registration issues in Selma, Alabama.  As Gonzalez recounts, Selma “had jeeps stacked with rifles outside the courthouse as a threat to the black people who had been trying to go in to register to vote.”  To compound matters, Baer remembers that “Only a registered voter could take you in to vote and most of the registered voters were white.”  For black citizens residing in Selma, Alabama, these circumstances made it virtually impossible for them to have the opportunity to register to vote.  For Walbert, Baer and Gonzalez, both hearing about and seeing the atrocities occurring in Selma weighed heavily on them, and eventually led them to take action.  Those three brave women along with other members of the Concerned White Citizens of Alabama crossed racial barriers and lent white support to the voting rights cause.","The right to vote, one taken for granted by so many white citizens, was a right routinely being denied to the majority of black citizens, particularly in the South.  As members of the Concerned White Citizens of Alabama, Walbert, Baer and Gonzalez helped to organize and participate in a nonviolent protest march meant to highlight voter registration struggles in Selma.  According to Burke Marshall, former head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, “on February 4, 1965 . . . only 383 Negroes [in Dallas County] were registered out of a voting age population of over 15,000.”  Clearly the intimidation and discriminatory practices employed in Selma were effectively preventing blacks from registering to vote.  It was clear to Walbert, Baer and Gonzalez that the difficulties afflicting blacks could no longer remain a purely local problem.  It was time to draw national attention to the discriminatory practices affecting voter registration in Selma.","By organizing a protest march in Selma from a black church to the main courthouse, white activists like Walbert, Baer and Gonzalez helped focus the national spotlight on Alabama.  This concentration on voting discrimination in Selma was significant because following the protests, the issue of voting rights was addressed federally with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  Through the nonviolent protests of Walbert, Baer, and Gonzalez, as well as the subsequent “Bloody Sunday” march on March 7, 1965, change was effected at the national level.  As Dr. Joseph E. Luders mentions in his analysis of the success of protests during the civil rights movement, “it cannot be forgotten that it was ultimately the demands of civil rights supporters and their willingness to brave violent crowds and hostile police that generated the reactions necessary to win local and national victories.”  Walbert, Baer and Gonzalez were three such supporters who did “brave violent crowds and hostile police” to help draw the eye of the nation to voter discrimination in Selma, Alabama, which eventually resulted in a national victory with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965."],"display_date":"March 6, 1965","search_date":"1965-03-06","locations":[{"id":32444,"lat":32.3258382723,"lng":-87.106506935,"zoom":9,"place":"Dallas, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":1710,"tag":"Voting Rights"},{"id":1345,"tag":"Selma"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}},{"id":5712,"title":"Voting Rights Prove to be a Hard Sell in Alabama","course_id":110,"status":"P","start_date":"3/7/65","end_date":"8/6/65","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Bernice Daffron, a black resident of St. Clair County, Alabama, did not understand why the country was suddenly so concerned with the issue of voter registration among blacks.  Daffron stated in an editorial printed in <em>The Birmingham News</em> that she had “always been encouraged to vote,” and that this was the case “in many other counties.”  According to Daffron, the national attention drawn to Alabama following “Bloody Sunday” painted an erroneous picture of voting rights in her state.","The events of Bloody Sunday, the infamous march on March 7, 1965 from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, Alabama shocked the nation.  The peaceful protestors, marching to draw attention to voter registration issues among blacks, were subjected to terrible police brutality, and it is no surprise that images from this incident captivated the nation’s eye; however, some citizens like Daffron did not believe that this march and the subsequent coverage of Alabama were fairly recorded.  She was of the opinion that national political figures were distorting the events of Bloody Sunday to fulfill political ambitions, and that voter registration practices were not a substantial problem in Alabama.","<em>The Birmingham News</em>, which had been covering events both from a national perspective as well as from a local perspective, supported a similar position to Daffron's.  The <em>News</em> did not believe federal intervention in voter registration practices was necessary, and that the issue at hand “is not a matter of “giving” the Negro the vote.  It is a matter of affirming the right that is already there.”  While the <em>News</em> was correct in its assessment that the right to vote already existed, it was clear that simply acknowledging this right did not translate to its enforcement.","In Alabama in 1965, 69.2 percent of eligible whites were registered to vote compared with only 19.3 percent of eligible blacks.  That is a shocking disparity of 49.9 percent between the races, and it is unrealistic to assume that such a large gap could be closed by simply “affirming the right” that blacks were legally able to vote.  There were other underlying issues which the <em>News</em> subtly accounted for and supported.","The <em>News</em> supported not only an affirmation of the right to vote, but also the necessity of qualifiers for the right to vote.  The right to vote should not necessarily be racially determined, but it should be regulated by “more than just the fact of drawing breath.”  The <em>News</em> did not feel that there was a need to pass voting rights legislation, since it would be redundantly addressing rights already afforded to citizens in this country.  In spite of attempts by Daffron and the <em>News</em> to minimize the problems concerning voter registration, the events of Bloody Sunday did draw national attention to the issue of voting rights.","The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was signed into law by President Johnson on August 6, 1965, largely in response to the Bloody Sunday march.  Over time, the Act dramatically reduced racial disparity in voter registration.  As of 2004, 73.8 percent of eligible whites were registered to vote in Alabama, while 72.9 percent of eligible blacks were registered, closing the gap to just 0.9 percent.  Regardless of the opinions of Daffron and the <em>News</em>, the attention garnered by Bloody Sunday was both important and necessary, and led to a dramatic and positive change in the ability of blacks to register to vote throughout both Alabama and the nation."],"display_date":"March 7, 1965 - August 6, 1965","search_date":"1965-05-22","locations":[{"id":32444,"lat":32.3258382723,"lng":-87.106506935,"zoom":9,"place":"Dallas, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":1346,"tag":"Voting Rights Act of 1965"},{"id":1345,"tag":"Selma"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}}]}
