a letter to his brother-in-law, Daniel Bryan, on December 7, 1830, James Barbour discussed his life and retirement from politics. Barbour had been a member of the House of Delegates in Virginia from 1793 to 1804 and again from 1808 to 1812, the governor of Virginia from 1812 to 1815, a Virginia senator from 1815 to 1825, and the U.S. Secretary of War from 1825 to 1828. Writing to Bryan, Barbour talked about political life absorbing his every moment, and wrote I am sick of politics. At this time, Barbour was going through a contested election to the House of Delegates in Virginia, which no doubt was a source of much of his frustration with politics. Barbour had served the state and his nation well, and as he said, political life had so absorbed my time that he had been able to think scarcely of anything else. He complained that politics had changed, and that violence was the only way now to gain popularity (amongst the voters). Finally, Barbour thanked Bryan for his support, and states his desire to hear more from Bryan as his political career has ended."," Barbour wrote this letter from Richmond - the city where a great deal of his political life was spent, from the House of Delegates to the Governor of Virginia. Richmond was the capital of Virginia, a political center for the South, as it would later become the capital of the Confederacy. Thus, in this city Barbour was surrounded by political life (which had had been a central figure in. The harshness of this life shows from his attitude of a tired politician. The political parties of America had reorganized in the mid-1820s during John Adams' presidency, and at the end of this Barbour was a National Republican (opposing the Democrats). With this allegiance, he opposed the man occupying the presidency after Adams, Andrew Jackson. When Jackson was elected president in 1828, after a long and passionate campaign, the National Republican party came to a stand-still for the a short period, and it was during this period that Barbour decided he had taken enough of the political world. It seems that the campaign for president in 1828 (and the overall struggle for power among parties) had been too rough on Barbour. He, as many other Republicans, was disheartened by the election of Jackson. Instead of continuing the struggle against the Democrats, Barbour chose to retire from public life."],"display_date":"December 7, 1830","search_date":"1830-12-07","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1951,"title":"Senator Lewis F.

As a doctor early in his life, Linn had seen thousands of cases of dysentery, malaria and other diseases that resulted from life along the Mississippi river. In low-water seasons, the outbreak of diseases increased as blockages in the river forced white and blacks alike to suffer with stagnation and mosquitoes; limited transport along the tributary waterways prevented medicine from reaching affected areas. The blockages accumulated during the low-water seasons of 1839-1843 described by Linn were so great as to render navigation not only dangerous in extreme to commerce but hazardous to the health.","Lewis Linn strove to make changes for his patients' health as well as his own after a series of illnesses he suffered in 1839. With the sudden death of the Missouri senator, Linn would realize his goal when nominated to the position. Linn realized, however, that to garner appropriations to clear out sandbars, large bulk and swampland from major waterways needed a stronger base than health-care reports. Linn worked alongside fifteen hundred St. Louis-area executives and presented a petition to Congress to battle those appropriations that were always strenuously, and sometimes successfully opposed, and the objects intended to be accomplished were never more than half accomplished.","Lewis Linn's work with executives strengthened his argument of the need for change, in both mercantilism and the health of those along the Mississippi. Linn cited the total loss of 3 million dollars in goods and boats along these waterways which were vital to much of the southern-and indirectly northern-trade and commerce. The enormous economic losses for the South and other ports nationwide sparked movement within Congress. As Linn fought to secure money, he created a promising outlook for a large-scale river project. Unfortunately, Linn's sudden death while in office in 1843 left his own efforts unrewarded when legislators failed to garner enough votes for appropriations. "," Yet, his legacy to push for better economic conditions carried to the next group of southern congressional representatives. Businessmen and legislators alike realized the importance of re-tooling the environmental and economic congressional committees not only for the health of their constituents-and their consumer base-but to facilitate faster, more efficient shipping nationwide. Whether or not the government granted appropriations to clear the river ways ultimately affected more than just transportation; the health of the rivers in large part created the success or failure of commerce for the national economy."],"display_date":"January 17, 1843","search_date":"1843-01-17","locations":[{"id":7916,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1952,"title":"Birth Control Practices in Missouri and the Abortion Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-01","end_date":"1835-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["By the early half of the nineteenth century, Victorian views of sexuality in the South dictated that women and men remain virginal until marriage. Others held the view that sex after marriage had procreative purpose only. However, many so-called free thinkers such as Charles Knowlton, Abner Kneeland, and Samuel Thompson recognized that Victorian ideals clashed with the reality of everyday life. Many unmarried women who found themselves pregnant used abortion as commonplace birth control practice. ","Abortion practices were not always safe. Local doctors replaced local midwives who had previously performed abortion procedures. However, little actual gynecological medical training or practice complicated the procedure. Many in new medical professional groups pushed for greater autonomy and influence of highly trained medical practitioners to replace the backward practices of quacks who advocated abortion. In Missouri and throughout the South, this growing influence created a greater movement towards white professional doctors. The effect led to the passage of the 1835 St. Louis, Missouri abortion statute, a full twenty years before many states passed similar laws. However, this law hardly stopped sex among unmarried couples or hindered adulterous relationships. Women and men circumvented the law by turning to the work of the free-thinkers, who published and distributed pamphlets on sexual and reproductive health and contraceptive methods. In the South alone, liberal literature included topics about contraceptive methods and sexual advice. This literature circulated to more than 200 agents by 1836, many of whom operated near St. Louis and along the Mississippi river. One popular example included Knowlton's Fruits of Philosophy, which made it to third edition within three years of its original publication in 1830. Popular mail-order items in Missouri-among other states nationwide-included condoms, feminine cleansing products, and abortifacients. Though free-thought groups flourished nationwide, they often kept semi-private for fear of being thought liberal and infidel in their causes. More readily available and cheaper contraceptive devices for men-a dozen condoms sold for three dollars in 1850-allowed couples to engage in sexual relationships, although secret, with fewer consequences.","Many kept their sexual freedoms covert in Missouri and the South not only because of the abortion law, but also because of the issue of interracial sexual relationships. As Nathan Stormer notes, reproductive control for early opponents represented a cacophonous...threatening assault on the status quo of gender, family and class relations. Many feared that if fear of pregnancy were removed from sexual intercourse, wives' sexual faithfulness could not be assured, legitimate children might not so easily be distinguished from illegitimate children, and bloodlines and inheritance might, in consequence, be jeopardized. Because inheritance often dictated property rights in the South, the case of illegitimate-and perhaps mulatto-children produced from an adulterous relationship made easier with birth control brought this issue to the regional and national forefront."],"display_date":1835,"search_date":"1835-07-02","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1953,"title":"Catholicism&#39;s Impact on Religion and Politics in St. Louis\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-12-17","end_date":"1835-12-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["While American historians often focus on the millions of immigrants that moved through Ellis Island, many of these same people traveled west and ended up in St. Louis. The city became a locus of immigrant activity, both religious and cultural. However, negative changes often accompanied positive ones with the large influx of immigrants. The greater influence of Catholicism, the dominant immigrant religion, affected the already strained religious and political tensions between the South's religious mixes: Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians and Presbyterians. As the St. Louis Observer stated, although southerners recognized the Founding Fathers' guarantees to every individual in our land, the free exercise of his religion, political Nativists feared that the Papacy as both a religious and political power would interfere with American government."," In their letter to the Observer, a Nativist wrote that Catholicism was not just a religion but a political organization that recruited members to draw funds from the American people to aid them in universalizing. In this manner, many whites in St. Louis and throughout the South felt Catholicism endangered the white Southern religious sects. Nativists felt that Catholicism in the form of millions of immigrants was a forewarning of an American St. Bartholomew's Day-the foreign seed will, like dragon's teeth which Cadmus sowed in a field, produce an assembly of armed men. Xenophobia of Catholic immigrants was not limited to the South, however. In places such as New York and Chicago where large immigrant groups flocked, whites felt the need to push for control over those alien to their existing and dominant role in the social order. Whites faced a population of black Africans and few laws in place for immigrant migration regulation. Although whites as a collective group still held control of government and other public institutes nationwide, immigrants placed an increasing social and economic demand on the United States. Poor Catholic immigrant groups spoke many different languages and educated themselves in parochial schools rather than American public schools. American Nativists feared Catholics not just because of their religious affiliation but also for their ability (unlike black Africans) to largely and successfully exist outside of the dominant white southern culture."],"display_date":"December 17, 1835","search_date":"1835-12-17","locations":[{"id":7915,"lat":38.640154406,"lng":-90.4208185466,"zoom":9,"place":"ST LOUIS, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1956,"title":"The Honey War Boundary Dispute\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-12-02","end_date":"1839-12-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Colonel John C. Sullivan established the borders of pre-statehood Missouri and marked what he thought would be the northern boundary of Missouri. Unfortunately, Sullivan made a major error in his plans, which caused a discrepancy in the boundary line. This mistake made one part of the border more than four miles larger than the other. By 1833 when many people had settled in the area and were applying for Iowa statehood, this unnoticed error came to the forefront as the boundary line came into question. Missouri officials sent surveyor Joseph Brown to re-survey the Sullivan line in 1837. However, the vague description of the line's supposed origin outlined in the Missouri Constitution at the rapids of the river Des Moines, created another problem. The difference between the two survey lines was more than 2,500 acres and created a vast expanse of land that officials from both Missouri and Iowa claimed state ownership. By 1839 however, the conflict increased when Missouri sheriffs attempted tax collection in the disputed strip of land. Iowa governor Robert Lucas warned Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs that the Missouri sheriffs would not be permitted to do this, but Boggs threatened militia action to ensure the taxes were collected. Missouri once again attempted to collect taxes in December of 1839, but Iowa officials arrested the Missouri sheriff. Both Missouri and Iowa called on their local militias to gather at the disputed strip of land. In the process, soldiers destroyed several profit-turning honey trees causing further upheaval between the states. A poem published by satirist John L. Campell entitled The Honey War mirrored the popular criticism of the two governors, giving the dispute its unofficial name.","With militias poised to fire, Clark County, Missouri formed a committee to deal with the issue. On December 24, 1839, peace talks led to the adoption of resolutions...requesting the two governors to submit the boundary question to Congress and suspend military operations. Governors Boggs and Lucas remained on poor terms while the line dispute remained unsettled. The Supreme Court finally settled the dispute in 1851, which established the Sullivan line as the official northern boundary of the state of Missouri. While the boundary dispute between Missouri and Iowa resolved itself fairly quickly, other southern land disputes at the time did not. United States governmental interactions with indigenous Native American populations led to conflict over land rights, especially when they removed Cherokees from their land in Georgia in the late 1830s. Later known as the Trail of Tears, U.S. government officials claimed tribal lands to accommodate whites who journeyed into the South to claim gold rumored hidden within the Georgia hills. The United States moved Native Americans to reservations throughout the mid-nineteenth century as a commonplace practice. Native Americans had limited negotiation power with the United States and reduced their autonomy to little consequence when they tried to settle land and boundary disputes."],"display_date":"December 2, 1839 - December 24, 1839","search_date":"1839-12-13","locations":[{"id":8031,"lat":38.288627243,"lng":-94.3452200361,"zoom":9,"place":"VAN BUREN, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1964,"title":"A Clash of Views over Indian Removal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-08-12","end_date":"1829-08-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> of Easton, Maryland published an article on August 12, 1829 regarding Indian removal. The Easton article responded to the essay written by William Penn published in <em>The National Intelligencer of Washington </em>on July 17, 1829. Penn's essay discussed the need to exterminate the Indians in order to allow for expansion into the West. The article in the Easton newspaper stated that while there seems to be such a prevalent disposition south and west of us to exterminate the aborigines of this land, we feel it our duty to raise our voice and use every exertion to stay that band of power from sweeping them from the face of the earth. The article published in <em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> asserted that we stand for the bitter detestation and abhorrence of tyranny and oppression of the aborigines of this land. Additionally, in response to William Penn's essay promoting Indian extermination, the article in the Easton newspaper paper claimed that we occasionally meet with traits of Indian character so humane and generous as to produce in the civilized mind mingled emotions of astonishment and delight. "," <em>The Republican Star and General Advertiser</em> article exemplified the tensions between anti-expansionist Americans, and those who supported expansion into the West and Indian removal. Southerners generally supported expansion and Indian removal while northerners tended to disapprove of such action. A significant turning point occurred in 1828 with the election of Andrew Jackson to power as president. Jackson, a prominent figure in the South, led the campaign for Indian removal. Jackson often publicly stated that in order to rescue Indians from the destructive vices of civilization, Indians must be removed and placed farther into the West. Historian William Brandon claims that northerners tended to disagree with this statement. Northerners believed that Jackson's genuine motive for Indian removal resulted from his desire to allow southerners to secure themselves land in the territory that opened up in the West. "," According to Brandon, southerners felt threatened by nationalism. Southerners found refuge in an aggressive assertion of both states rights and sectional economic interests. With the support of Jackson, southerners believed they needed to fulfill their 'destiny' to own and farm the land possessed by Indians all the way from Georgia to the Mississippi River. Thus, southerners found it particularly displeasing that northerners tried to prevent them from fulfilling this 'destiny. The issue of Indian removal significantly added to the tensions between the North and the South as southern anxieties continued to mount that the North threatened their rights to liberty."],"display_date":"August 12, 1829 - August 13, 1829","search_date":"1829-08-12","locations":[{"id":6066,"lat":38.702724259,"lng":-76.2699764629,"zoom":9,"place":"TALBOT, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1982,"title":"Dirty Elections\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-23","end_date":"1890-01-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 23, 1890, a small county newspaper printed in Lexington, Virginia published an article discussing the corruption of the election process with the memory of the prior year's November election fresh in the mind.

In fact, election fraud became such a problem that Virginia elections were challenged no less than sixteen times between the years of 1874 and 1900. The Democratic Party even appealed to the Southern white man's fear of the newly freed, enfranchised black American by calling Republican rule Negro rule. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, however, voters were becoming more and more disillusioned by the political process, and by the 1890's, the Democratic Party, so confident in the Solid South faced huge problems of voter apathy. Voter participation was around 40 percent in some areas as the South toward the end of the nineteenth century and in some years it even fell below that.

With the decline of the economy following Grover Cleveland's election and his repealing of the Sherman Silver Purchase act, his Democratic base began to falter, and the Populist Party support of the free coinage of silver began to invade much of the Democratic Party. An article written on January 16, 1895, in Clarke County, Virginia's, Clarke Courier attacked these Democrats, who have more love for populist teachings than a wise and economic administration of public affairs. The newspaper recognized the great threat that these party dissidents posed to the security of the Party, writing that though the group is a minority, they still have the power to cause the majority to yield to its dictation. The paper holds that this new free silver coinage party will fail just as the greenbackers had decades before. "," The hard-line Democratic loyalists, that is, the Democrats loyal to Cleveland, claimed that Cleveland is the subject of ridicule and criticism due to his unshakable belief in the gold standard. They couldn't believe the idea that some of their own Party members would believe that a free silver coinage system would work; they believed that the United States was too big a place in the world to adopt such a financial policy. What the paper failed to recognize, however, was the extent of the power free-silver Democrats and of the Populist Party. Perhaps the political writers of the paper were in denial, or perhaps they genuinely didn't see it coming. However, in the election of the following year, the Democratic Party (as predicted by the article) yielded to the free silver Democrats under William Jennings Bryan, but fell to the Republican's solid gold standard in part due to the confusion that the Party's platform created in attempting to cater to hard-line Democrats, free-silver Democrats, and even Populists. This confusion and split in the Party affected even the 1894 Congressional election, where Democratic Party fell to the Republicans' 150,000 vote majority. As the split between the Democratic Party widened and the Populist Party remained a threat, the strife between the sections only worsened and the Republican victory in 1896 was virtually assured.","Date: January 16, 1895","Location: Berryville, Clarke County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Economy, Government, Law, Politics","Episode Scope: Local, Regional, National","Clarke Courier, January 16, 1895.

The convention was meant to be statewide and one delegate from each county was expected to attend; thus the event was of statewide significant importance, most especially to farmers and industrialists who wanted to get their materials across the state more efficiently. Furthermore, everyone interested in improving the state's roads was invited. The article goes on to explain that the State Good Roads Association had been very active in improving the infrastructure of the state, and that citizens of the state have every reason to feel satisfied and encouraged with the results of the association's work. The paper estimated (though the accuracy of this statement cannot truly be determined) that some 90% of the population believes in the importance of good roads.

The burgeoning iron, steel, mining, and timber industries of the South called for better roads for transportations, to accommodate the moving of goods and the travel of northern prospectors and investors. Better roads needed to be built to transport raw materials to the newly built industrial centers located now in the South, unlike prior to the industrialization of the South where materials were either shipped overseas or sent north. Improving the infrastructure of the South (through roads and railroads) was crucial to the development of the quickly growing Southern economy and its important industries.","Date: August 23, 1895","Location: Christianburg, Montgomery County, Virginia","Episode Keywords: Politics, Government, Economy, Migration/Transportation, Urban Life/Boosterism","Episode Scope: Local, State, Regional, National","Montgomery Messenger, August 23, 1895.

Though Democrats such as the writer of this article may have disillusioned themselves into believing that the Alliance movement was not a threat, the Democrats' apathy toward the Alliances cause coupled with the Democrats' outright electoral corruption (the ballot-stuffing, the bribery, the assaults) forced the emergence of the Populist party, which occurred with the downfall of the Alliance, but changed the Democratic Party's political inner workings significantly. Thus, though the Democrats chose to ignore them, the Alliance posed as a serious threat to the stability of the Democratic Party in the White House and to a degree, in the South.

Brown of Tennessee spoke at a benefit for an orphan's asylum in Nashville, Tennessee. During his speech at Odd Fellow's Hall, he addressed the recent progress of the United States in regarding the escalating question of slavery. Governor Brown expressed the feelings of many southerners who felt threatened by the anti-slavery rhetoric in the North. The Governor also vividly exposed the hypocrisy of northerners in their efforts to end slavery, yet contain the African American population to the South. ","Governor Brown first questioned the constitutionality of northern sentiment to alter the institution of slavery. He specifically referred to the three-fifths clause in the Constitution that compared a slave's status to that of the white man. Brown asked if the Connecticut of today was unwilling to stand to the compact ratified by the Connecticut of 1787? In the eyes of Governor Brown any breakdown or change within the Constitution would lead to the breakdown of the Union. The South wished to stand by the compact made in 1787, while the North, whether directly or indirectly, wanted to break it. The Governor realized how much northern communities feared the infiltration of African Americans. Throughout the South, African Americans lacked equality to whites and lived under brutal oppression. But African Americans lived directly along side whites on a day to day basis. Slave women participated in raising their master's children, and some slave men acted as overseers and managed important aspects of the plantations on which they lived. Northerners did not live in close quarters with African Americans. They did not embrace them as part of their families as did many southerners. Governor Brown exemplified this point to his audience at Odd Fellow's Hall. He declared that once the North ensured African American's their escape from bondage, where shall they go? Who will receive them? Will the North? Never"," Governor Brown acknowledged, like many other southerners, that northerners did not feel a moral obligation to end slavery. Northerners sought to end slavery in order to better provide for themselves. According to Frederick Law Olmsted, northerners did not detest slavery, it is simply the negro competition and the monopoly of the opportunities to make money by negroe owners. Governor Brown and his fellow southerners knew that northerners wanted nothing to do with freed slaves and the competition for cheap labor they might create with a mass migration to the North. Poor, non-slaveholding whites in the South reaffirmed this fear for northerners. Frederick Law Olmstead suggests that poor white people were usually far better off in the free states, than in the slave.

In a letter to Reuben Lindsay Gordon, an attorney from Louisa County, Virginia, Lyons asserted, I am watching eagerly and anxiously to see Louisa roll up a majority for Daniel and yourself.  You must get as big a majority as you can . . . I do hope you will win by a big vote.  Lyons was referring to the 1881 race between Democrat John Warwick Daniel and William Evan Cameron, the Readjuster candidate, for the position of Governor of Virginia.  The new Readjuster party of Virginia consisted of politicians who represented the interests of poor blacks and whites throughout the state.  Lyons's hopes for a Democratic win did not come to fruition; Cameron won the election, although only 53 percent of Virginians, a slim majority, voted in his favor.  As a result of the shifts in political power that occurred in the early 1880s and hopes for political reform, voters expressed newfound interest in elections.  Constituents from each political party harbored the hope that newly elected officials from their party would win and affect positive change in Virginia politics.","Politicians like Daniel in Central Virginia exerted major efforts during the 1880s and 1890s, not only to ensure that as many eligible citizens as possible would vote, but to also convince voters to vote for the right party.  Lyons articulated his understanding of the importance of every individual vote.  Democrats throughout Virginia worried about growing voter apathy and indifference at this time.  In <em>The Promise of the New South</em>, Edward Ayers points out that many voters in Virginia assumed, and rightly so, that elected officials acted as the puppets of a small number of wealthy, powerful men who made all of the political decisions from a distance.  As party leaders in Virginia knew that a difference of a few votes could determine the outcome of a race, some resorted to bribes, including monetary compensation and promises of appointment, to guarantee as many votes as possible.           ","Lyons had good reason to be excited about the Virginia gubernatorial election in 1881; at that time Virginia political parties battled fiercely for political power and positions in the state government.  The early 1880s witnessed a great deal of change in terms of the prominence of political parties in Virginia.  Republicans gained strength during this time; Democrats lost public support, as voters grew disillusioned over the inaction of the Democrats who had been elected to office, according to Ayers.  The Democrats who controlled the state government after the economic depression of the 1870s had failed to improve the state's debt.  Democrats like James Lyons who expressed strong support for their party in the 1870s and early 1880s quickly lost hope.  Few politicians pressed volatile issues or attempted to draw attention to problems that their party would rather ignore during the 1880s and 1890s.

Following the Union capture of Little Rock, Colonel C.C. Andrews wrote a letter to President Abraham Lincoln regarding Union sentiment in Arkansas. On October 29, 1863 he wrote, The loyal sentiment of the people [was] gaining, though slowly. Andrews wrote that Union officials would hold a meeting in Little Rock for the first time, though he seemed doubtful that much would result from the gathering. He said that many respectable and rather influential men were reluctant to take on an active role for the Union side because of their political and social relations with leading rebels. Andrews did not sound too discouraged, stating that decisive military victories would aid in these people taking a more active role. Furthermore, it was important that the people of Arkansas were not actively against [them]. Despite the number of guerillas still in Arkansas, Andrews declared his confidence that a great number of people supported the Union cause. Andrews then went on to describe specific news about his soldiers and other common news around Little Rock."," The main message Andrews wanted to send to President Lincoln was clear: there was a considerable amount of Union sentiment in Little Rock. While he openly acknowledged the split loyalties among the people of Arkansas, he could hardly think it [could] be said the people [were] actively against [them]. It [was] rather the opposite. This was important considering Arkansas was a Confederate state and its location just south of Missouri made it a border state. Because of the state's geographical location, Arkansas faced great pressure from both sides of the conflict. Colonel Andrews openly acknowledged the split in sentiment among the people of Arkansas. Despite the continued presence of guerillas in Arkansas, Andrews exclaimed, the loyal sentiment of the people [was] gaining. This split in loyalties was not exclusive to Arkansas. In fact, historian Robert Henry claims that the North, the border states, and even the states that had first seceded were all unhappily torn between loyalties. "," Even though the Union controlled Little Rock and Andrews referred to many respectable and rather influential men supporting the Union, he detected reluctance among many men to take an active role in serving the Union. Andrews thought these men looked for an excuse from taking an active part on the Union side because they feared being reproached by the rebels. According to Henry, it was common for two sides within a state to openly oppose each other. There were even instances in which brothers within the same family, divided over the issue to remain in the Union or to secede, literally fought on opposite sides of the battlefield. However much the issue of slavery played in the division of the nation into Union and Confederate states, the sentiment for secession was by no means unified within each state. Colonel Andrews acknowledged the importance of Union sentiment in Arkansas and expressed his optimism that future military success would give Union supporters the confidence they needed to take an active hand in reestablishing the Union."],"display_date":"October 29, 1863","search_date":"1863-10-29","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2026,"title":"Missourians Invade a Kansas Territory Election \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-01-04","end_date":"1855-01-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Reactions to the Kansas-Nebraska Act filled newspapers across the nation. <em>National Era</em>, an African-American newspaper based in Washington D.C. commented on the movement of pro-slavery people from Missouri into the Kansas territory. A letter from Governor Reeder of the Kansas territory, printed January 4, 1855, condemned the first election in the district for a delegate to Congress. Reeder stated that the majority of the people at the election meeting were not citizens of Kansas, but rather Missourians. These people rushed into the new territory only to return to their homes later that evening. Angry that Kansans were not making the decisions for the territory, he argued that the law guaranteed them the right to manage their own affairs. In a different article, a writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun </em>was quoted as saying, If the thing [was] to be repeated, however, at every election in Kansas, it [would] ultimately lead to bloodshed. He went on to suggest that the Missourians were organized in separate parties...[each] designed to operate at specified locations. Members of such parties stood by the ballot box, asked to see people's ballots, and intimidated any person who did not support slavery."," Governor Reeder estimated that on that day anywhere from 200 to 400 Missourians came by ferry and horseback to vote in Kansas. Missourians reacted in response to the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Under this act, popular sovereignty decided the issue of slavery in new territories. This meant newly forming states in the West had the right to vote whether they would be a slave state or free state. Reeder acknowledged his frustration that the people who lived in Kansas were not the ones who ultimately made the decisions. Historian David Potter states any resident could vote, however recently he arrived. Reeder recalled one man whose only attempt at a residence in Kansas [consisted] of a card nailed to a tree upon ground long since occupied by other settlers. "," Both Reeder and the writer of the letter to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> stated that the Missourians who invaded the new territory supported slavery. Historian John B. Boles suggests there were as many as 5,000 fraudulent votes from border ruffians who wanted to ensure a pro-slavery candidate would be elected. The writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> stated that an extensive scheme [was] on foot to make Kansas a slave state. Historian Clayton E. Jewett's argues that southerners used the annexation of western territories as a means of spreading slavery and gaining pro-slavery support in Congress. "," Tension mounted between the North and South as both sides struggled to control the future of slavery in new territories. Historian David Potter argues, Such friction was not unusual in frontier situations, and it often led to controversy, lawlessness, and violence. The writer to the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> mentioned that the proslavery Missourians threatened and intimidated the judges, violently drove off all those who were suspected of being in favor of any other candidate than their own, and pointed revolvers as some cast their vote.

The Republicans of Missouri, taught by a sublime religion, remember that while to err is human, to forgive is divine. The Civil War had been over for over five years, but former rebels in Missouri still could not fully participate in the state government. Members of the State Republican Committee released this address on the eve of an election to fix the political character of the state. The announcement declared it was time to propose an amendment to the state constitution, granting the right of suffrage to those lately in rebellion. The last General Assembly decided by a respectable majority that the people at large would use a direct vote to resolve the question at hand. It was in the opinion of the State Republican Committee that civil privileges should be given back to those who rebelled. On August 12, 1870, the time [had] come when without danger to the state, full forgiveness and restoration to civil rights [could] be unconditionally given to those justly disfranchised."," At the conclusion of the Civil War, Radical Republicans in Missouri wanted to limit civil liberties to those people whose principles led directly to the recognition of universal manhood and universal freedom, with no paralyzing distinction of caste or of color. In order to ensure these ideals, the state government revoked the civil liberties of those who rebelled against the Union. Not all whites welcomed the North's victory in the war. Missouri was a border state and had citizens who pledged loyalty to each side of the conflict. Historians Eric Foner and Olivia Mahoney state that many southern whites reacted to military defeat and emancipation with dismay. These whites passed black codes denying blacks the right to vote and establishing what appeared to be a system of slavery without the name. To help prevent such measures, Radical Republicans in Missouri dissolved the current state government and created new state governments where rebels were excluded from power. In protecting the new rights of African Americans, the Republican Party thought the rebels were justly disfranchised. "," Missouri was not the only state that revoked the civil liberties of those who rebelled. The national government also played an active role preventing former rebels from obstructing the integration of African Americans into southern society. According to Foner and Mahoney, Andrew Johnson's Presidential Reconstruction, offered a pardon to all Southern Whites, except Confederate leaders and wealthy planters, who took an oath of allegiance."," The time it took for rebels in Missouri to regain their right to vote and participate in the state government closely mirrored that of the rest of the country. In America's Reconstruction, Eric Foner claims that by 1870 all the former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union and that the rebels' regained their rights quickly thereafter. It took over five years, but by August 12, 1870, the State Republican Committee announced the state was ready to restore the civil rights to former supporters of the Confederacy."],"display_date":"April 12, 1870","search_date":"1870-04-12","locations":[{"id":7919,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST.

One son spent years in Europe; another took to the hills of the Blue Ridge; Jake Hammond lived as far west as San Francisco, California. General J. N. Hammond and his wife, the heads of the family, moved to a plantation in southwestern South Carolina. Still, as far apart as the family became geographically, the sons kept in touch with their parents through occasional letters. Though Jake Hammond and his brothers had all grown up in Georgia, they now lived very different lives. In one letter to his mother Emmie, Jake discusses a sharp disagreement with his brother's new political alignment.","Jake's brother Jule, still living in Orangeburgh, has recently cast in his lot with the American (Know Nothing) party, a nativist group with a moderate and slowly growing membership in South Carolina in the 1850s. This step, Jake argues, pushed Jule further from his family that Jake could ever physically travel. Jake loathed the Know Nothings. Living in San Francisco, he has made friends with more than a few foreigners. Jule, isolated in South Carolina, may not have much exposure to the true actions of the Know Nothings, but Jake had seen them in action. Because of this, he feared that they may do evil and drag Jule along with them. Jake was ashamed that [Jule] would have been caught in such company. Personal objections aside, Jake expresses his worry about the effects Jule's decision would have on Jule's future in politics. Jule, as his brother knew, had long coveted a career in politics. To Jake, Jule's history with the Know Nothings would become a millstone about his neck when he finally decided to pursue this career.","     The Hammond family's political split derived from the drastically different lives the brothers lived in different parts of America. Jake's first-hand experience with foreigners had given him a cosmopolitan outlook that stands in stark contrast to Jule's isolationism. Since the creation of the United States writers have commented on clear regional distinctiveness. The Hammonds' disagreements, while personal, were at least party exacerbated by the differing cultures and lifestyles of the areas in which they lived.","     Southern politicians, coming from a land where labor was always in high demand, generally advocated open immigration. Jule Hammond, son of an elite family in South Carolina and member of the American party, demonstrates that this attitude was far from universal. As Rowland Berthoff argued in Southern Attitudes Toward Immigration, 1865-1914, Southern attitudes toward foreigners oscillated between desperation for labor and isolationism.

John Barker turned and sprinted towards his house, but the Indians were too quick. They overtook him, stabbing and killing him instantly. Caleb Lyndon Brayton, frontier neighbor to Barker, stood there stunned. He had just conversed with the Indian party on the road to Captain Gattis' house, seeing nothing unusual in their appearance. How could this have happened? The adrenaline flew through his veins: no time to think, get to the boats Brayton, Captain Gattis, and Colonel Russell flew down the hill towards the shore and pushed off just as the Indians, having doubled to eight, loaded their rifles. The first volley ripped through the shirt of a Negro man in the boat, but by the time they reloaded, the frontiersmen were out of range.","Brayton now had time to absorb what he just witnessed and plan a course of action. The men needed weapons, but, upon returning from obtaining Brayton's Colt 8 shooters, the Indians were no where to be found. The land lay in ruins. Houses were plundered and set ablaze and cattle floated lifelessly in the river. Colonel Russell's family was gone. The following day Brayton came upon the most distressing scene of his life: Here were a parcel of helpless women and children, bare footed and bare headed, and almost naked. The children crying and screaming for water and food, having been two days without anything to eat... They had found Russell's family downriver, but the horror of the past two days could not be escaped.","This was the scene Brayton described to his wife, Marian, who remained in Augusta, Georgia with their family while he settled the frontier of Florida. The Indians he refers to are Seminoles, and the attack and murder of John Barker was part of a larger reemergence of hostilities known as the Crisis of 1849. The Second Seminole War had been over for seven years, but a group of young Seminoles conducted raids up and down both Florida coasts in the summer of 1849. United States Troops mobilized and threatened attack but Chief Billy Bowlegs, who has been described as a great peacemaker, averted conflict by claiming the raiders were outsiders and defiant warriors. He delivered three prisoners and the severed hand of a fourth.","Scattered episodes of violence were not uncommon across the South wherever whites intruded into historic Indian territory, but the Crisis of 1849 was temporally concentrated and particularly horrific. Intricate racial interactions in Florida were augmented by the influx of settlers after 1842 and the peace that followed the Second Seminole War. Specifically, the Armed Occupation Act allowed prospective settlers to claim land and feel safer doing it; Caleb Brayton himself had claimed 160 acres in 1843 under this act. After 1849, however, many settlers did not return to this area and others. Billy Bowlegs had prevented a third Seminole war, but lasting damage had been done to the relationship between frontier settlers and the indigenous Seminoles.

In 1837, 3,500 dollars was a lot of money. Converting the sum to real 2005 terms, it would yield almost 69,000 dollars. The Panic of 1837 rendered every penny worthless. Judge Thomas Douglas of the Florida Supreme Court had been one of the wealthy class sponsoring the flurry of charters that brought unstable banks into existence, and now their failure meant financial ruin for the entire region. Douglas had bought stock in the Southern Life Insurance and Trust Company, established on February 14, 1835 in St. Augustine. His investment seemed safe enough and he was excited about the prospects of his return; the bank could loan to planters cultivating large unused Spanish land tracts, thus multiplying his wealth, that of the bank, and the agricultural production of the frontier. The Second Seminole War broke out and brought these hopes crashing down.","Investment in Florida stopped, outside capital dried up. Potential cotton plantations became dangerous battlefields. Foreign investors in the bank wanted their money to go to work, so loans were made to firms in New York City, much of which was ultimately lost. In less than two years, all the capital of the bank was scattered to the four winds. Judge Douglas lost a great deal of his fortune and Florida entered into its darkest hour as a territory.","In his autobiography, Douglas mentions his personal monetary loss, but the mechanisms of the larger force, the Panic of 1837, were both national and local in scope, draining the wealth out of every segment of the population. On the national level, President Andrew Jackson was engaged in the Bank War against Nicholas Biddle and the Bank of the United States. Jackson denied its re-chartering and removed 10 million dollars in deposits from its vaults, distributing the money to state banks. On the state and local level, charters for banks were approved by state legislatures with little safeguard or restriction, and the inflation of credit expanded to meet the capital needs of planters on the frontier. Cotton prices dropped, contraction of credit was extreme, and, on May 10, 1837, the Bank of New York suspended specie payments. Florida banks followed suit and bank deposits, with nothing to back them up, vanished in a matter of seconds. ","The entire South sunk into a long depression. Cotton prices fell forty percent in two years, and slave prices, derived from cotton, mirrored the fall. Banks in Florida came under investigation, and anti-bank sentiment exploded as the institution was seen as an endeavor of the ruling class. Judge Douglas and his planter friends commissioned banks, ran them, gave loans to, and inflated the property value of other planters. David Levy Yulee, the most prominent politician of Territorial Florida, seized on the resentment of inherited privilege and monopolies to enact legislation and build bank restrictions into the state constitution as Florida gained statehood. Better monitoring mechanisms and regulations, reserve minimums, and higher standards for chartering were put in place to protect the citizens. Ultimately, for Florida, bank failure in 1837 delayed its admission into the Union. Development of the vast interior, of plantations, and of transportation methods, stopped. Coupled with the Second Seminole War, the period of 1835-1842 was an incredibly bleak time for every social stratum in Florida, including the planter elite."],"display_date":"May 10, 1837","search_date":"1837-05-10","locations":[{"id":1455,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ST JOHNS, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2047,"title":"Vomito Prieto of Key West\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-06-08","end_date":"1841-06-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The young sailor's eyes were yellow, his face flushed. He complained of pain in his head and extremities and writhed on the bed as his pulse and breath quickened. The disease came to him in the night on a vessel in the Key West Harbor. Dr. C.C. Dupre had no doubt it was the vomito prieto, the yellow fever of Cuba, and it was rapidly progressing to its fatal termination. Yellow fever had struck here before, decimating the forces of Commander Porter in 1823 and compelling his removal, and again in 1829. Since that time, however, outbreaks of the disease were episodic and affected only the younger, transient population, like this young sailor. The older residents had warned the doctor that this season had been forebodingly hot and dead flies lay on the shores in great numbers.","Dupre moved fast. He bled the patient and gave him thirty ounces of olive oil in three doses. He also let him drink freely of the anti-febrile pineapple water. Other remedies he considered were almond oil, lime juice, and calomel in doses from 20 to 30 grams. Over the next two days, the sailor improved greatly, his skin cooler to the touch and the yellowness of his eyes dissipating. In his journal, Dupre recounted that encounter with the deadly disease and others over the course of his summer in Key West; the greatest number of cases occurred during a ten day period in mid-July.","Of greater importance to physicians all over the South were the origin and vector of the disease. Dupre put forth his hypothesis that the elevation of the site, the humidity of the soil, and the presence of marsh miasmata were only secondary influences in its genesis. Yellow fever would remain a mystery for much of the century, drastically altering the development of southern cities.","Almost fifty years later, Dr. J.C. LeHardy read a report in front of the Medical Association of Georgia that echoed Dupre's journal. Elevation was clearly a factor, as epidemics in St. Augustine originated in the low, rain-washed suburbs around the city. The moisture in the soil and the tropical sun that bathed the South were also primary factors in the breeding of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the vector of the disease. LeHardy asked the Medical Association how the South, a region that clothed the world and fed the hemisphere with her long growing seasons and immense forests, could have no large cities. He answered the question himself; the lakes, lagoons, and swamps across the region created an atmosphere for a horrific contagion that only drainage of the soil through canals and cleanliness could remedy. ","Dupre and LeHardy were not alone in their frustration. Yellow fever disrupted the entire fabric of life in the South. Many lost faith in the medical profession as they struggled to find answers, and outbreaks brought commerce to a complete halt. An epidemic in Pensacola in 1822 caused so many residents to flee inland that the Floridian, a prominent newspaper, shut down for lack of revenue. Outside investment capital saw the South as a risk. A later Florida epidemic in 1841 decimated such a large part of the population that it almost delayed Florida's admission to the Union. Florida, in close trading proximity to Havana, Cuba, was especially prone to importation of the disease. ","Despite all yellow fever's devastating effects, it fueled the growth of public health in the South. State legislatures created Boards of Health to prevent and isolate outbreaks, and the United States Public Health Service acquired funding, staffing, and authority to combat yellow fever. Throughout the nineteenth century, citizens demanded greater government involvement in disease control and better institutions to meet their needs."],"display_date":"June 8, 1841","search_date":"1841-06-08","locations":[{"id":1426,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MONROE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2048,"title":"Baylee, the Democrat from Eastville","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-01-01","end_date":"1892-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Baylee was a Democrat from Eastville, a town in Virginia's Eastern Shore.

One of those was from Representative Adams of Massachusetts. His petition was signed by one hundred and fifty women, wives, and daughters. The women, his immediate constituents, were praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. The petition was objected to by Representative Glascock. Adams was shocked by the objection; he did not expect any hostility to his petition. It was written in respectful terms, by women, mothers, and daughters. Congress had been decided previously that petitions of this kind would be received but disposed of afterwards. Adams felt that Glascock's objection violated the decision of the House as well as his constituent's freedom of speech. Adams argued that his petition was from persons of the greatest respectability and should be treated with dignity. The two men continued to debate the issue of petitions but ultimately, this was an issue of slavery, one man trying to keep an abolition petition from being recognized and another fighting for the right to petition.

Francis Scott Key, author of the Star Spangled banner, delivered the oration in the Rotunda of the Capitol of the United States.  He spoke to unite the country and reflect the significance of freedom.  Independence Day was newly designated since the county had only recently gained independence from Great Britain.  Francis Scott Key was aware of the magnitude of this celebration.  He started his speech by stating, The spectacle of a happy people, rejoicing in the thankfulness before God and the world for the blessing of civil liberty, is no vain pageant.  Key went on to speak of the duty of those assembled.  He called it a high and holy duty, stating We have opened the records of time, and read that bright page that proclaimed to the world the solemn purpose of the fathers of our country, and the sacred pledge they gave us for its fulfillment.  The pledge has been redeemed, the purpose is accomplished, and we are here, in the rich possession of what valor has won, and wisdom has preserved for us.  Key addressed the crowd with the hope of reminding citizens, in a time of turmoil, of the purpose and sacrifices of the fathers of our country.  The possession was won and the wisdom preserved, now it is the duty of the citizens to carry on the honor and mission of a free land, he stated. ","Key told of a fear that many Americans at that time derived from a clash between state's power and the power of the national government.  He urged everyone to take hope and courage from the past.  He was able to proclaim with pride, This is my own, my native land.  He ended his oration with the question, Is our country less loved, as it becomes more worthy of our love?    Francis Scott Key used profound and powerful words on the Fourth of July, 1831, to remind the country what the founding fathers fought so hard to obtain, freedom.  ","The oration given by Francis Scott Key was an optimistic attempt to rally citizens on the glorious celebration of the nation's birth.  However, the country was already divided over the issue of slavery.  Key was unaware of the events that would unfold in the remainder of 1831. Nat Turner's infamous rebellion was initially planned for the same day, July 4 1831, but was delayed.  In this same year, William Lloyd Garrison's newspaper, <em>The Liberator,</em> would begin contributing to polarization.  Key described the country as deserving love.  However, at this time the nation was divided.  Donald, Baker, and Holt describe the development of Southernism.  In their book, <em>The Civil War and Reconstruction</em>, they quote Alexander Stephens as saying, The South is my home- my fatherland.  Southerners held their region in the highest esteem and gave it their loyalty first and foremost.  This division, that Key struggled to overcome in his 1831 speech pointed towards the Civil War.

However, this day in Washington was not your typical day.  He started his diary entry by stating, Today is an era in my life.  In this one day, Mr. Rawlins was able to see the Declaration of Independence, call on and present letters of introduction and converse with Henry Clay as well as John Quincy Adams.  The Declaration was kept in a mahogany case in the State Department.  Already, some of the signatures were almost illegible due to fading.  The parchment bore evidence of being rolled up tightly.  Viewing documents of such significance sent a chill through Mr. Rawlins body. After viewing these historic documents he ventured to the John Quincy Adams' house, there he presented a letter from Mr. Cranch.  It was shocking how old Adams looked, his head almost entirely bald.  The little hair he did possess was silvery in color.  Afraid of staying too long, Rawlins quickly left.  He continued his day with a visit to the residence of Henry Clay, again to deliver a letter.  This visit delighted Rawlins, as Clay was dignified yet cordial.  His smile was peculiarly placid. Clay was tall and slender, with thin grey hair, small eyes, and a wide mouth, making him appear to possess a constant smile.  As if visiting Adams and Clay was not enough for one day, Rawlins also met with John Calhoun in the Senate.  He ended this day of activity with an evening of feasting at Judge Cranch's.  ","The men Mr. Rawlins was able to meet in his day in Washington were some of the top political actors in the nation at that time.  William Cooper, Jr. and Thomas Terrill, in <em>The American South- A History</em>, shed light on the background of a few of these monumental figures.  Henry Clay was John Quincy Adam's Secretary of State during his tenure as President.  As President, Adams envisioned a strong central government.  This only worsened tensions with the South.  It is no surprise that meeting these two men, who played divergent roles in the life of the country, was a day Mr. Rawlins described as, An era in my life.

He had always desired to see the city. The city was the object of greatest curiosity, fascinating the Bishop with its rich history. He stood in awe before a portrait of George Washington. The Declaration of Independence proved to be a most impressive scene, the picture fills every American heart with American feelings and memory carries him back to the time when in solemn conclave this noble band proclaimed to the world 'Liberty or Death. One could look at the Declaration for a long time and see new beauty in it each moment. Bishop Whipple was swept away in the beauty of the capital. ","However, some sights in Washington caused the New York native to grow frustrated with the current political situation. The House of Representatives particularly disturbed him. The charm of honor is lost, and these men having high sounding titles are not only men in form, but less than men in mind in many cases. Never have I seen as large a body of men who were called great men who came as far short from deserving the title. Such a lack of dignity, such a lack of courtesy, of politeness, of common decency can seldom be seen in a body of men who are law makers. He continued to rant that the law makers were actually the law breakers. Bishop Whipple was so disgusted with the Congress that he described them as beasts. Despite the beauty of the Capital, he left discouraged. There are very few men of fine talent in the House and when you leave the House and see the noble, calm, and kind faces exhibited in Trumbull's picture of the first Congress you feel sad at the difference. Despite his shame with the House, he was proud of the Senate and spoke of the joy he felt upon seeing John Q. Adams. As opposed to the beasts of the House, he described the Senators as men with mind and character. He was happy and proud to see such men ruling over the country. ","Bishop is extreme in his hate for the House and love for the Senate. He was obviously very interested in the politics of the polarized and divided country. In the introduction to his diary, Whipple calls himself a rational abolitionist. In 1844, the Abolitionist's movement was very strong in the North. This made the divide between North and South even more pronounced. Stanley Harrold writes in his book, <em>The Abolitionists and the South, 1831-1861</em>, about the growing white and black abolitionist's movement during this time. Garrisonians were fighting for the freedom of enslaved blacks across the South. Bishop was originally from the North and agreed with the Garrisonians. He was one of the many men joining forces with the movement that would continue to escalade during the Civil War."],"display_date":"April 30, 1844","search_date":"1844-04-30","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2072,"title":"Major R.

R. Henry of Tazewell County, Virginia campaigned for a seat in Congress under the Democratic Party in 1886. People from neighboring communities such as Lynchburg, Abingdon and Wytheville voiced their full support of his campaign and hopes for his success in the quest for a seat in Congress in the November elections. Although varied in their syntax, the message behind Henry's supporters emphasized the same ideas and qualities that would make him an ideal candidate for Congress. His supporters all commented not only upon his strength, using words like commanding, but also upon his masculinity and physical appearance. He was characterized as being both tall and handsome and being a true type of physical and mental manhood. They also reflected upon class and status, typifying him as a gentleman of culture and character and a first class man in every respect. His supporters made continual reference to his service in the Confederate Army. With all of the praise that was given to Major R. R. Henry, one can only notice what was not being commented upon by his supporters, his strengths in the political arena. There is no mention of their support of his platform or any political ideas that he may have had, instead emphasizing his physical and moral character.","This article exemplifies the qualities that were found to be important in any political campaign during that time. Henry's character was found to be more important then the political decisions he has made in the past and any experience that he has in the political arena. Also, the continual reference to his service in the Confederate Army is reminiscent of the mounting processions many of the Democratic candidates used at that time. In these mounting processions, the candidate would ride in front of a long line of people mimicking Robert E. Lee to touch Confederate sentiments. Perhaps the lack of hard hitting platform issues may be due to the defeat of the Democratic Party in the assembly resulting in the party trying to avoid any friction that would result in future lost elections. ","It was also during this time that sectional diplomacy in the South became a prominent issue in politics. There was a divide in the South in forming either a Northeastern alliance or a Western alliance. This divide led to the formation of an Alliance Platform, which later became the platform adopted by the Populist Party. Many politicians of this time adopted this controversial platform, which emphasized subtreasury plans and other Southern ideals. It may be the case that for Major Henry, the lack of a political platform in the news article reflects the tension in platforms of the time. By leaving out any political ideation, and focusing on the physical and moral characteristics of the candidate, Henry might avoid the struggle within the political system relating the Alliance platform, and reach the constituents based on a more universally accepted stance - morality and character.

It seemed that people supporting the temperance movement had overlooked another venue in which alcohol might have been ingested, which could cause harm. The newspaper warned of the use of alcohol in food preparation, specifically in the pleasant sauces and the dishes of home. It was seen as more dangerous because the use of alcohol in food preparation may not be seen as harmful. It would leave one vulnerable to the evils of alcohol in not recognizing that any ingestion of alcohol would be detrimental to his or her life. The article further delved into the relationship between women and whiskey. It claimed that women and whiskey were natural antagonists. Also, the use of any form led to the destruction of the women's home and family and so the article urged women that it was their duty to refrain from the use of whiskey to save the peace and purity of the home. Finally, the article urged the women of the home to drive out the snake of intemperance. It warned against the use of alcohol for medicinal purposes reporting that physicians claim that whiskey did more damage than the human ill itself.","This article illustrates the shift in focus for the temperance movement in the late nineteenth century. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, temperance based many of its assertions upon explicit biblical texts. The temperance movement during these times made it a religious duty resting upon divine sanctions. Many of the anti-temperance organizations and meetings resembled evangelical prayer meetings, with those that signed pledges to sobriety called converts giving testimony and signing hymns praising temperance. ","The shift in the focus of the temperance movement began as early as the 1840s with the formation of the Washingtonians and fraternal temperance organizations that did not make religion a prominent issue. Also, the formation of the Christian Women's Temperance Union in 1874 and the Anti-Saloon League in 1893 resulted in a shift in the overall structure basis of the temperance movement. These organizations had Protestant tones, but did not rely upon explicit biblical text as the reason for abstinence, but shifted more towards pragmatic reasons, demonstrated in the article above. Reference to the snake of intemperance makes an allusion perhaps to the devil, but the crux of the article against drinking focuses on more practical reasons, such as detriment to one's health. Prior organizations focused upon the moral aspects that surrounded the temperance movement, while later groups focused on legal means to achieve an alcohol free society. With this type of shift, the explicit biblical arguments did not hold much weight in support of temperance."],"display_date":"1890 - 1900","search_date":"1895-07-02","locations":[{"id":14278,"lat":36.8438879121,"lng":-81.53700883,"zoom":9,"place":"SMYTH, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2084,"title":"Joshua Frier&#39;s Salt Solution\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-01","end_date":"1864-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On his seventeenth birthday, Joshua Frier enrolled in a branch of the Florida Confederate militia which was eventually called the First Florida Reserves, Company B. The unit remained in northern Florida throughout its service, where the Union naval blockade intentionally caused serious import shortages on goods like coffee, tea, and salt. Salt was a commodity that was vitally necessary to preserve perishable foods for the army. Before the outbreak of the Civil War, manufacturers would produce salt by extracting it from saline artesian wells and rock salt deposits. However, during the war, due to the Union naval blockade and limited imports, Frier and his comrades had to produce their own salt by filtering it out of the dirt on the floors of meat store rooms. Frier hardly knew what to call the substance they created, for he claimed it looked more like mud than salt, but he was determined to make the most of the discovery. He and the reserve company manufactured several bushels and used them to preserve their meat during the winter of 1863. However, they soon realized that there was limited supply of useful dirt, and Frier worried that a salt famine was on the horizon. ","Since filtering salt-laden mud was not a long-term sustainable practice, Florida residents had to find other sources of salt. The method by which salt production came to be cheapest and most efficient in the state of Florida was boiling sea water, a simple process which required little machinery and which became the largest industry in the state following the Civil War. The industry helped increase civic morale and inter-state interaction during the Civil War, as many Georgians and Alabamans set up operations along the Florida coast to produce salt to sell to their home states. Critical to the development of the domestic salt production industry in the region was, indeed, Frier and his army. The war forced Southerners like Frier to look to new ways of producing those goods of which they were deprived, while it also helped to expand the previously small-scale enterprise of a few Confederate soldiers into a state-wide industry. Although Florida was strategically and physically peripheral to the Civil War, the Union coastal blockade and the occupation of its ports helped shape post war issues and industries.

A staff member had just handed him a vicious letter from a reader that, in no uncertain terms, castigated his paper for being so brazen as to refer to black people as Mr. and Mrs. in its articles and stories. The man claimed to be one of the Bourbon Democrats, those who would spill the last drop of their blood rather than apply such titles to such a degraded, worthless, inferior race... The editor could only think that in this day and age, almost 13 years after the war that had ended the institution of slavery in the U.S., it was the man who had sent this letter who was being brazen. The author of the letter, a Mr. Henry T. Earnest, was actually claiming to write on behalf of all Southerners. The editor's first hope was that there was no truth to that claim, after the progress the nation had made; his second thought was how deeply unfortunate it was that Mr. Earnest believed the whole South shared his extreme opinion. That he even still felt there to be a South with its own identity and opinions so alien to those of the rest of the nation was a barrier to all that had been fought over so recently. He chose to publish the letter in the paper- accompanied by a rebuttal. He picked up his pen and began to draft the response. He would address this letter to every reader of The Post who might be wondering what stand the paper would take on such a relevant and sensitive issue. He wrote, So long as colored people are permitted to vote, we will feel constrained to address them as human beings...The gentleman who addresses us should have shed his blood during the late war. When the letters ran in the January 19th issue, he hoped that every reader would know that the paper stood behind progress, not racism."," The letter written to the editor of <em>The Post</em> by Mr. Earnest typifies the definition of the Bourbon Democrats as Willie D. Halsell describes it: ...a ruling group, once dethroned but now returned to power, who stubbornly hold to the past and refuse to adapt themselves to a changing world about them. Despite the fact that the war had resolved the issues of slavery and secession of the South, there were clearly those who felt no such resolution. As Miss Halsell explains, the Bourbons only represented a small subset of the Democratic party; however, their ideas would proliferate widely as the nation continued to struggle with the issue of racial equality. These ultra-conservative Democrats preached white supremacy, and fought privately and publicly (as is evidenced by this letter in the news) to defend what they believed to be white Americans' superiority over black Americans. However, though there were many like Mr. Earnest who made their racist views known during the post-Reconstruction period, there were also those like the editor of <em>The Washington Post</em> who openly accepted and stood up for the black man's right to citizenship and the respect which that citizenship demands for every American."],"display_date":"January 19, 1878","search_date":"1878-01-19","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2100,"title":"The Great Democratic Procession\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-06-26","end_date":"1875-06-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the summer of 1875, Jane Pryor of Vicksburg, Mississippi wrote a warm letter to Caroline Kiger of Warren County in anticipation of the coming week's political events.

At a time when massive advancements were being made in the areas of agriculture, factory production, transportation, and communication, Richmond's General Assembly was still reeling from the logistics of such a massive overhaul. In early January, an advertisement was taken out in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser alerting the public to a petition about to be presented to the Assembly. If passed, the newspaper said, the petition would allow a railroad to be constructed, from the Coal Mines in Chesterfield, to some eligible point on James River, below Whitby bar as well as a line that would end near Belona Arsenal, in said county. At the time this issue was being voted on, Richmond (like the United States) was at a crossroads of economic growth. More than ever, industrial success depended on tying resources, markets, and people together in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Railroads were becoming the preferred way to do this, and any effort by the legislature to build an expensive railroad needed a lot of public support. ","But why was the General Assembly so eager to link coal mines with industrial centers (like Richmond) on the James River? The answer reflects an underlying fear that plagued many Virginians in the early nineteenth century: economic inferiority. Virginia had been a dominant producer of coal in the early decades of the nation's history, but by the 1830's the state was beginning to feel the strain of economic division. Rather than devoting itself completely to the production of one good (like states in the deeper South who depended on cotton), Virginia had diversified. As a result, coal miners in the west found themselves in competition with planters in the east for slave labor and transportation resources. This strain resulted in high prices and poor quality, setting Virginia behind other coal-producing states further north. Railroads represented a possible remedy for this problem, and would give entrepreneurs the ability to move coal from the mines to Richmond fast enough to be competitive with other states. Unfortunately, even the infusion of new technology brought on by the Industrial Revolution could not save Virginia's mining business. Although officials in Richmond tried to revive the industry (and gain public support), coal mining in the state was destined to remain the victim of arrested industrialization."],"display_date":"January 9, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-09","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2126,"title":"The Ill-Mannered Welcome of Judge White\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-01","end_date":"1840-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The honorable Judge Hugh L. White's welcome upon passing through the town of Rogersville, Tennessee, on his return trip home to Knoxville, was anything but warm. Upon his arrival, the former United States Senator was greeted with a large strip of cotton covered with insulting comments stretched across the main entrance to the town. The citizens behind this offensive act were members of the local Van Buren Party. These citizens were of the same group who had recently aided in removing White from his seat in the Senate. Many members of the town had pleaded with the Van Buren Party members that the banner be removed before his arrival. Their protests, however, were to no avail, and the sign was hoisted in anticipation of his entrance. The Judge and his party decided against passing under the sign, and bypassed the street altogether upon seeing the unwelcoming reception which awaited them at the town's entry. ","This offensive deed was most likely the Democratic reaction to Judge White's perceived misrepresentation of the views of his constituency during his term in the United States Senate. Hugh L. White and Ephraim H. Foster served as Tennessee Senators representing the Whig Party at a time when a fierce political battle between the Whigs and the Democrats raged in Tennessee as well as on the national level. During this time, the Democratic electorate of Tennessee felt that their interests were not being represented in Washington by their two Whig senators. A plan was devised in the State Legislature to force White and Foster to either resign or support the policy of Democratic President Martin Van Buren. Consequently, Senators White and Foster both resigned and were replaced by Democrats. ","The narrative of Judge White demonstrates just how strongly local Democrats of the town of Rogersville opposed their representation by the Whig Party. In accordance with this event, historian Jonathan M. Adkins argues that the core issue of this conflict between Whig and Democrat was the question of which party would best represent the people. Though Tennessee in the 1840's was split fairly evenly between both parties, the Democrats certainly made their opinions known about who they believed would better represent their state. These attitudes were evidenced by the chilling reception Judge White received from local Van Buren supporters.

National unrest had been building throughout the United States for quite some time, and sectional pressure between the North and South was nearing its boiling point. Those people living in Virginia's capital sensed the impending conflict more than most. Mere months before the South Carolina nullification crisis erupted, John Campbell, a politically active Virginian, returned home to Richmond after extensive travel throughout the country. Immediately upon arriving in the city, Campbell was struck by the attitude of the Virginians he encountered. From all I see and hear since my return home [to Virginia], he wrote to his friend Claiborne Watts Gooch, I think the people of the South (SC included) will support, by a strong vote, the [Presidential] nominee of the [Democratic] Convention. President Andrew Jackson's power, he believed, could not be shaken by any foreseeable event. Campbell immediately gauged the attitude of the South and saw fit to place his faith in the extremely popular Jackson, who would be indirectly nominated for a second term by the first-ever Democratic nominating convention held in Baltimore in 1832.","Campbell did admit to himself, however, that Henry Clay (a Whig) and John Calhoun (a secessionist) would do just about anything to destroy Martin Van Buren, who was then serving Jackson's Vice President, and Jackson himself. Calhoun, he believed, was pushing for disunion in a vain grab for power, hoping to become the eventual king or emperor of a Southern republic. This attitude was surprising coming from a Southerner at a time when regional solidarity was growing, and Calhoun was seen as the face of an increasingly separatist movement. Campbell also voiced his sneaking suspicion that the secessionists (Clay and Calhoun) had a personal interest in separation and were not representing the will of their constituents. Jackson, he felt, could harmonize the Union and preserve American liberty as he had done before. Our Liberty is gone when our Union is dissolved, he wrote. Why should we throw away the fruits of the toil and blood of the fathers of the Revolution? Is it because a Clay or a Calhoun wishes to be President, and the people are too slow in gratifying their ambition? "," Campbell's own opinion after returning to Richmond is significant not only in its foresight (the Union eventually dissolving) but also in its point of view. Campbell was a Southerner living in what would become the capital of the Confederacy, yet he had reservations about nullification and great faith in national unity. In the course of studying the antebellum period, we often assume that all Southern males, for example, thought alike. In reality, there were those that disagreed with nullification and those who did not trust the so-called spokesmen of the South. John Campbell's letter serves as an interesting study of Southern dissent mere months before the North/South divide came sharply into focus."],"display_date":"June 28, 1832","search_date":"1832-06-28","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2141,"title":"The Election of 1852 Comes to Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-07-25","end_date":"1852-07-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Four months before the presidential election of 1852, Thomas J. McClellan wrote to his friend Patrick Ragland, informing him of his views on the state of the Whig Party and the upcoming election. McClellan emphatically told Ragland that he intended to support the Whig nominee, General Winfield Scott, and the platform upon which he would run for the presidency. McClellan also expressed feelings of utter disgust with Ragland for even having asked him in his last letter if he would consider voting for Scott's opponent, Franklin Pierce of the Democratic Party. He even went so far as to inquire whether Ragland was deranged for asking such a question. McClellan proclaimed that, in order for him to leave the Whig Party, there would have to be reasons much more enticing than the candidacy of Franklin Pierce. He then went on to belittle the resume of Pierce and satirize him by saying how he small of a man he would appear if he were to wear the uniform of an esteemed General as Winfield Scott. ","From the contents of his letter, it can be inferred that McClellan was a dyed-in-the-wool supporter of the Whig Party. Although Pierce had served as a member of Congress and fought in the Mexican-American War, in McClellan's eyes, he was an inadequate candidate and was unworthy to even challenge such a man as Winfield Scott. While it appears that McClellan would have voted for the Whig ticket regardless of the candidate, his letter to Ragland implies that others may not have felt the same way. When asked about the views of the Whig Party in general with regard to Scott's nomination, he replied that although most Whigs were in favor of his candidacy, others were afraid that the advocacy of some of Scott's claims would hinder their future political aspirations. He also spoke of how Alabama congressman James Abercrombie left the Whig party altogether on account of Scott's nomination. ","This letter is telling of the strife that occurred within the Party on the eve of the 1852 presidential election. At this time, two factions, one Northern and one Southern, had formed within the Whig Party. The opposition between these two groups was on account of the abolitionist sentiments of the Northern Whigs. At the time of the nominating convention, the Southern Whigs heavily favored the candidacy of incumbent president, Millard Fillmore, to best protect their interests. Therefore, for many Southern Whigs, the nomination of Scott was not a favorable occurrence. According to historian Lewy Dorman, the election results of 1852 reflected the shift in allegiance of many Alabama Whigs to the Democratic Party whom they felt could better serve their interests. This goes to show that not all Southern Whigs were as devoted to their party as Thomas McClellan. In the Election of 1852, many Alabamians cast aside long held party allegiances in favor of their own best interests. This event marked both the decline of the Whig Party and the rise of sectionalism in the United States."],"display_date":"July 25, 1852","search_date":"1852-07-25","locations":[{"id":232,"lat":34.8100816932,"lng":-86.9813367451,"zoom":9,"place":"LIMESTONE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2149,"title":"Reaction to Nullification\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-11-04","end_date":"1832-11-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1832, Sophia Hunt, a Democrat living in Woodville, Mississippi, received a letter from her father in South Carolina describing the recent crisis of his state. The Nullification Crisis threatened to hurl South Carolina into warfare with the rest of the country. In her November 4 reply, Sophia expressed her sorrow upon hearing this news, as well as her doubt that South Carolina would be successful in its defiance of Federal law. Oh That the true interest of my native state was not obscured by such party factionists, Sophia lamented, distressed that South Carolina was being run by the aristocratic party. Horrified, she fearfully remarked on the possibility of civil war. However, Sophia must not have been too worried about this prospect, for she then went on to discuss the cholera epidemic that was plaguing Natchez as well as other family issues. "," Although the threat of civil war seemed improbable to southerners like Sophia in the 1830s, southern farmers and northern merchants had different economic interests at this time. This became an important issue when John Quincy Adams passed the Tariff of 1828. Southerners felt that the tariff favored the North, and swiftly voted Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, into office. However, Jackson failed to remove the tariff. South Carolina, fearful that the Federal Government had become too powerful, issued the Ordinance of Nullification in 1832. The Ordinance stated that South Carolina would no longer collect the tariff. The state began to raise troops to protect its new legislation. Jackson responded by instituting the Force Acts, which allowed him to send troops into South Carolina if the state continued to ignore the tariff. Many southerners who had staunchly supported Jackson were appalled at his institution of the Force Acts. They viewed his actions as an assault on states' rights. Still, like Sophia, the overwhelming majority of the South did not support South Carolina. The state's threats to secede were just too extreme. In January 1833, Mississippi's House of Representatives released a statement condemning South Carolina for acting impulsively. The report declared that the Ordinance of Nullification opposed the Constitution. Still, Mississippi's legislature did not fully support Jackson either as a result of the Force Acts. Many citizens, including Governor Abram M. Scott, believed that Mississippi should stand behind its fellow southern state by contesting Jackson's Force Acts. They thought that the tariff should be lowered. Even some supporters of Jackson expressed sympathy for South Carolina. Although views on the crisis were varied, Mississippi could not encourage disunion. Mississippians like Sophia could not have foreseen at this time that the country would be thrown into civil war in fewer than thirty years.

Both were members of the twenty-fifth congress of the U.S. House of Representatives. Graves represented Kentucky, while Cilley was from Maine. The two men certainly were not enemies, so the nation was shocked when Graves killed his fellow congressman. The conflict arose when Graves delivered a letter to Cilley from Col. James Watson Webb, a newspaper editor. Cilley refused the letter and made disparaging remarks about Webb's character. Graves objected to Cilley's comments. He declared that he would never deliver the note of a man who is not a man of honor, and not a gentleman. "," In the early nineteenth century, honor was essential to privileged men, particularly in the South. An honorable man possessed all of the characteristics needed to be a great leader. An understood code guided the daily conduct of men who considered themselves gentlemen. This system also set elite men apart in a nation centered around egalitarian values. An attack on a man's honor was not only an enormous insult, but could also be ruinous for a political career. Graves took personal offense to Cilley's ridicule of Col. Webb. To defend his honor, Graves challenged Cilley to a duel. On February 24, 1838 the two men met at Bladenburg, Maryland. They loaded their rifles, assumed their individual positions and proceeded to each fire one shot at the other. Both men missed. Cilley asserted that by refusing the letter he meant no disrespect to Graves. He simply did not want to correspond with Col. Webb. Graves would not accept this explanation. The men resumed their positions and fired again. Again, both men missed. At this point the duel should have ended. However, Graves' second, Henry A. Wise, convinced the men to fire another round. After the third shot Cilley fell to the ground. He was dead. "," The <em>Vicksburg Register</em> gave a detailed account of the event on March 16, 1838. The newspaper claimed to make every attempt to give an unbiased depiction of the duel, providing both sides' versions of the story. Politicians often used articles such as this one to emphasize their impartiality. However, they undeniably used newspapers to influence their constituents. Historian Joanne B. Freeman notes, When a duel was particularly controversial - when a duelist died or a chief was involved - politicians capitalized on widespread public interest with contending newspaper accounts, both sides attempting to win public approval while dishonoring their foes. The reputation of a politician involved in a duel often depended less on the duel itself and more on the media hype surrounding the event. The mild account of the Graves-Cilley duel in the <em>Register</em> depicted Graves and Wise as honorable men. Perhaps the <em>Vicksburg Register</em> supported Graves and Wise, or perhaps the article simply reflected the popularity of dueling in the South. The <em>Register</em> portrayed the duel as a respectable affair, but Cilley's death stunned the rest of the nation. According to historian Robert V. Remini many Americans viewed the duel as a barbaric slaughter. Americans considered Cilley's death a murder, and Congress soon passed legislation prohibiting dueling in the capital."],"display_date":"February 24, 1838 - March 16, 1838","search_date":"1838-03-05","locations":[{"id":7310,"lat":32.3603831169,"lng":-90.865936974,"zoom":9,"place":"WARREN, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2152,"title":"Controversy Surrounding the Panic of 1837\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-02-14","end_date":"1838-03-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["John F.

Wailes then stated, Truly our insane politicians seem to be determined to drive us into a state of anarchy and civil war and I see that the most disastrous condition of things is inevitable."," On April 24, 1860, Everard Green Baker, another white planter from Jefferson County, Mississippi, wrote in his diary, I fear there are terrible times ahead of us...There is this consolation - that we will be fighting for our homes, our lives, our families and our property. "," During the election of 1860, the talk of secession grew a great deal among Mississippians. It had been brought up before this time that if the northern states elected a president without the support of the South, that Mississippi would secede. When Lincoln, a Republican, won and took office, Mississippians were outraged because not a single one of them had cast a vote in his favor. In fact, no one in the Deep South had because they viewed the Republicans, and thus Lincoln, as staunch abolitionists who desired to rid the nation of slavery at the soonest possible moment. Mississippians held true to their promise, and two months after Lincoln's election, a statewide convention voted to secede from the Union. "," Mississippians, like many residents of the Deep South, had several fears of what a Republican government would do to their existence. Some, like Wailes, most prominently feared the destruction of the Union and were against secession. Most others, like Baker, felt that southern culture would meet its demise from the Republicans because they believed that the North, with its industrial endeavors, was unable to comprehend how necessary slavery was to the South's economy (or how necessary they felt it was). Thus, the white South was not necessarily fighting for slavery, but more so for a South with its foundations based on slavery. "," White southerners had become so accustomed to their slave society that they were terrified at the thought that the Republicans would try and force them to be without it. Many southerners had achieved an extremely comfortable life because of the peculiar institution. Their economy was the fourth richest in the world, they controlled 60 percent of all United States imports, and had more railroad lines than anywhere else in the world. They felt that this would no longer be the case without the system of bondage that they held African Americans in, and it was the idea that Lincoln and his party would destroy it that led them to talk of secession and eventually carry it out. Lincoln cited his priority as keeping the Union together, not abolishing slavery.

The newspaper praised Augustan citizens by saying that a vote for the Harrison/Tyler ballot was a vote for sound judgment, patriotism, and most notably, uniform obedience to the constitution and laws. ","The Whigs of Augusta County, Virginia knew, however, that the battle for the White House was far from over. They had to execute a strong national campaign in order to secure the victory. They did everything in their power to mobilize voters to support General William Harrison in his campaign for the presidency. Residents across Augusta worked together towards this common goal. One William Kinney of Staunton wrote to Newton Steele in another part of Augusta County regarding a club they had formed to help Harrison gain support. They called it the Tippacanoe Club after the nickname General Harrison had earned due to his victory over the American Indians in the Battle of Tippacanoe in 1811. Kinney enclosed club membership papers in his letter to Steele, asking him to mobilize the Whigs in his region of Augusta and to recruit as many people as possible to join their club. Kinney stressed the urgency of their purpose, writing, we ought to be active in getting every man we can to join [our club] before they can join them... He furthermore expressed his satisfaction in the effectiveness of their club, believing it to be the most powerful and effective means of promoting General Harrison...","The Spectator's mention of obedience to the constitution and laws obviously implied the Augustans' beliefs that, with Harrison and Tyler in the White House, the institution of slavery would be preserved, an imperative issue to the county's Whig majority, and most likely the crisis to which the article refers. Whigs viewed the practice of slavery as their constitutional right. Their faith in Harrison resided in the fact that he had sided with the South during the Missouri crisis, and that he openly denounced abolition. Furthermore, Tyler was a known advocate of state's rights, and right that was designated to each state was its ability to decide on the issue of slavery."],"display_date":"March 5, 1840 - May 23, 1840","search_date":"1840-04-13","locations":[{"id":13637,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2185,"title":"Thomas Jefferson Randolph&#39;s Controversial Opportunity to Assist the Choctaw Indians\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-03-08","end_date":"1837-03-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When the mail arrived in Albemarle County on March 8, 1837, Thomas Jefferson Randolph may have been surprised to receive a letter from R. G. Nicholas informing him that he had been nominated and accepted as Com[missioner] for settling claims to reservations under the Choctaw Treaty.  As a prominent gentleman from a well-established Virginian family, Randolph was a natural choice for the position except that the Choctaw Indian tribe lived in Mississippi, far removed from his native state of Virginia.  By the 1830s Virginia no longer had internal incidents with Indians because the nation's frontier lines had expanded and pushed tribes farther west.  But even residents of Albemarle County would have been very interested in the future of the Indians because these tribes lived on very precious land within the South's cotton economy.  ","Although the Choctaw tribe had recently earned distinction in the War of 1812 and had been declared the perpetual friend of America on October 24, 1816, when Mississippi became a state in 1817 the Choctaw Indians threatened the American identity of the new state.  They not only proved a problem for settlers wishing to move to the frontier, but moreover, by continuing to act as an independent nation within the United States, the Choctaws threatened the authority of the Mississippi state government. Grateful for the stability and unity of their own community, Albemarle County residents and other southerners would have expressed concern that the Choctaws posed an obstacle to greater prosperity of the South.  For this reason, political leaders throughout the 1820s and 1830s searched for ways to push the Choctaw westward onto territorial lands that were not officially part of the United States. ","In September of 1830, Andrew Jackson's administration finally concluded the treaty referred to by Nicholas as the Choctaw Treaty. Officially known as the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, the treaty removed the Choctaw Indians west of the Mississippi River and claimed all lands east of the river as the property of the United States.  But Article 14 of the treaty decreed that if any Choctaw Indian agreed to become a citizen of the United States, the U.S. government promised to give them a parcel of land on which they might live and farm.  Nicholas' letter alerted Randolph that he had been nominated to assign these pieces of land to those Choctaws who chose to remain. In presenting him with all of the particulars of the position, Nicholas informed Randolph that his pay would be three thousands dollars a year and that though there would be little personal risk involved the position would require ten or twelve months of his time.  But overall his letter drips of resentment towards the Indians who tried to remain in Mississippi because he considered it a cowardly last attempt to avoid removal.  His bitterness was obvious when he commented to Randolph that, if he accepted the position, his job would require him to assist some of the greatest scoundrels in the world. Nicholas doubted the sincerity of the Choctaw who had chosen to remain and suggested that he would be relived to hear that Randolph had declined accepting the appointment.","A week later, on March 14, 1837, Randolph received the official offer from R.B. Poinsett officially offering him the position of Commissioner to adjust claims to reserves of land under the fourteenth article of the treaty with the Choctaw Indians.  While there is no sign of Randolph's acceptance or refusal of the appointment within these two letters, as seen from Nicholas' letter, such a position would certainly have been debatable in southern society.  While some, like Nicholas, might have resented the Indians as a threat to the unity of the South, others would have defended the Choctaws' rights to the land and would have been grateful for the government's merciful offer to the Indians.  Thus, Randolph's appointment presented him with a quandary in the antebellum South as southerners struggled with their desire to expand and the existing Indian population."],"display_date":"March 8, 1837 - March 14, 1837","search_date":"1837-03-10","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2186,"title":"A Dinner Invitation to President Andrew Jackson\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-02-28","end_date":"1837-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 28, 1837, almost a week before the inauguration of the new president Martin Van Buren, <em>The Globe</em>, a Washington D.C. newspaper, reflected upon the Presidency of Andrew Jackson and expressed the thanks of the nation for his service.  The newspaper editors found a supreme example of gratitude in the people of Albemarle County who had recently appointed a committee to invite the President to a public dinner in the town of Charlottesville on his return from the seat of Government to the Hermitage.  Although at this time Albemarle County's Whig constituency had gained a slight majority over the Democrats, Jackson's loyal supporters wanted to recognize the man who had gallantly defended the South and served the nation as president.  Despite the fact that Jackson politely declined the invitation based on his health, he took advantage of the people's display of loyalty to champion all that their party had accomplished in office and to defend the political spoils system that he had encouraged. Jackson also appealed to the people of Albemarle by praising the county as the great home of Thomas Jefferson - the man from whom he claimed to have imbibed the principles... [of his own] public labors.  Jackson wrote that it would have been his greatest triumph to have learned that Jefferson's closest neighbors had not found him lacking in the high office that he shared with such a great man.  <em>The Globe</em> manifested these sentiments to the entire country and distinguished Albemarle as a favored place of President Jackson regardless of the fact that the President could not attend the County's dinner. ","The Democrats of Albemarle accredited Jackson as a fighter, ever-triumphing over his adversaries in defense of the nation.  They assured the President that they regarded his services with the more pride and gratitude, when we remember the bitter and malignant opposition with which it has ever been your fortune to contend, from the misguided friends, and real enemies of our country, and the faction of disappointed rivals and defeated aspirants to the same high office you have held. As a renowned military leader in the War of 1812, a defender of the frontier from the Indians, and a politician, Jackson's tenacious spirit earned him respect in counties like Albemarle that had voted strongly for him in the presidential elections of 1828 and 1832.","In an effort to extend his own personal thanks for their loyal support, Albemarle Democrats and other Jacksonians across the South benefited from Jackson's system of rewarding his followers with political offices.  The Jacksonian Democrats of Albemarle County adamantly defended Jackson's spoils system by proclaiming, It was our pleasure, as it was our duty to our country then, to sustain you and your measures...regardless of the idle charges of 'man-worship, office-seeking, corruption and subserviency' heaped upon us, and of 'tyranny, usurpation, and despotism,' so liberally bestowed upon you.  Although this would have undoubtedly been a point of opposition Whigs in Albemarle and across the South, the President defended the system not as a form of favoritism but as a moral and honest duty.  In Jackson's opinion such a system engendered loyalty and eradicated corruption in the government.  ","By the end of Jackson's second term, however, the South was no longer as united behind his administration.  William G. Shade concludes that his stand against nullification and his assertion of the Executive branch over the power of the individual states caused many southerners to voice discontent and turn their support to the Whig party.  In fact, Albemarle and other eastern counties of Virginia had voted pro-nullification because they wanted to defend the states' individual right to interpret the Constitution from the power of the national Executive branch.  Michael F. Holt maintains that this threat to state power was a prevalent concern in the South because of the greater degree to which state governments tangibly affected people's everyday lives.  Therefore, by the end of Jackson's second term in office, southerners were grateful for his sacrifices on behalf of the nation but many were ready for a new administration."],"display_date":"February 28, 1837","search_date":"1837-02-28","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2188,"title":"Eugene Davis&#39; Appeal for Temperance\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-10-23","end_date":"1842-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On October 23, 1842, Eugene Davis wrote a draft of a speech advocating temperance in Albemarle County.  While in the North many cities had embraced the temperance movement, in the South, country counties like Albemarle led the way for social and moral reform.  Evangelical congregations and women in particular expected the temperance movement to solve common social vices and fashion a society rooted in a moral tradition. Davis, truly believing in the positive results of temperance, called upon the people of Albemarle County to promote the common good [,]... to reduce an enemy whose ravages tell fearfully upon our national prosperity [,]...to rescue our national character... [, and] to redeem our national honor from the tarnish of taking rank with the...most drunken people in the world.","Many historians have defined the temperance movement as a reaction against the threat alcohol posed to the family and the evangelical church movement.  Alcohol not only wasted money that could have been used to support the family but it encouraged unacceptable habits and behavior that threatened the morality of the family.  Moreover, prominent leaders of the Second Great Awakening supported the temperance movement as part of the moral and spiritual reformation continuing among the rural South during this period. As historian Ted Ownby observes, this newfound evangelical fervor often found itself at odds with an essential part of southern culture - male honor and recreation.  Drinking and debauchery were present in almost every male activity: sporting events, social engagements, and even in the workplace.  Because of the pervasiveness of alcohol, temperance advocates worried that drinking among men encouraged a loss of self-control and restraint - two essential standards of the evangelical church and southern culture in general.  In Ownby's opinion southern men neither wanted to live outside of the all-encompassing evangelical community nor to abandon the alcohol and belligerence that defined their male identity. Their desire for compromise however proved impossible because the regional revival meetings of the evangelical church encouraged local populations to uphold an ideal of upright behavior and remain unyielding to forms of social excess.  In Ownby's words this demonstrated ever more clearly the ever-present tension between evangelical self-control and the aggressiveness of the masculine world. ","        To combat the threats posed by a culture submerged in alcohol, Davis encouraged the citizens of Albemarle County to set an example by taking a two-part abstinence pledge in which members vowed they would first themselves abstain from the use of all intoxicating liquors and second, that they would discourage the use of them by others.  By this oath, Davis believed that their community would exorcise the demon of intemperance [,] allay the devouring thirst and still the raging passions which had hitherto defied control.  He assured people that an oath of temperance would transform filthy rags into decent clothing and instill Christian morality within their society.  ","Southerners believed that this type of moral transformation would in turn positively reform all sinful areas of the southern male culture.  Prostitution and gambling were almost inherently linked with alcohol and by ending or limiting the occasion to drink temperance advocates hoped the South would be cleansed of these other vile institutions.  Bertram Wyatt-Brown notes that eventually, the temperance movement's public appeal for moderation hardened into Victorian repressiveness that struck many southerners as too severe. This extremist view irked some southerners and an opposition movement arose in the South proclaiming that temperance infringed upon individual liberties.  They resented the religious doctrines the temperance movement used to further its arguments and the subtle ways in which it attempted to force its views upon the South.  Thus, while Eugene Davis' speech rang of a genuine belief that temperance was the only way to revive the moral traditions of the South, Albemarle County would have been divided in its reaction because of the controversial social implications of his message."],"display_date":"October 23, 1842 - December 31, 1842","search_date":"1842-11-26","locations":[{"id":13596,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2190,"title":"President Martin Van Buren&#39;s Independent Treasury Sparks Controversy within the Democratic Party\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-12-12","end_date":"1840-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the year of 1840 drew to an end, the residents of Albemarle County prayed that the new year would finally bring relief and economic stability to the nation still recovering from the Panic of 1837.  President Martin Van Buren echoed these sentiments in his speech to the second session of the Twenty-sixth Congress concerning the general state of the nation.  As almost half of the speech discussed the economic state of the country, the editors of <em>The Virginia Advocate</em> determined that it was important enough to publish the speech in its entirety on December 12, 1840.  Although Van Buren mentioned several other pressing issues, his main objective was to address the financial future of the nation and the recently confirmed Independent Treasury.  As he reviewed the catastrophic events that led up to the Panic of 1837, Van Buren assigned the crisis' blame to the national bank and the national debt, arguing that both were not merely unnecessary, but in direct and deadly hostility to the principles of [the people's] Government, and to their own permanent welfare.  Thus, Van Buren maintained that the best way to rectify the country's economy was to establish an independent organization to manage the government's funds, hence his creation of the Independent Treasury.  ","As James Roger Sharp has ascertained, Albemarle County only had a slight Whig majority at the time of this speech and thus, the newspaper article would have attracted intense political debate and discussion. At the time, the Democrats and Whigs of Virginia were both desperate to restore the state to its former prestige and influence in national politics; after Jackson refused to renew the Bank of the United States' charter in 1836 and the Panic of 1837, both parties separately hoped that they would solve the America's uncertain fiscal future. The Whigs fervently believed that a national bank was the only way to preserve economic unity and that, when held in check, the credit system was healthy for the economy. While the Whigs had remained united in their efforts to oppose Van Buren's Independent Treasury since its proposal in 1837, ironically, within the President's own party, it produced much more conflict.  In late 1835 a faction of conservative Virginian Democrats had emerged led by William C. Rives who, as historian James Sharp explains, condemned the exclusive use of hard money for the sale of public lands as impractical and the Independent Treasury as another utopian scheme - unfeasible and ineffective.  Although the Democrats managed to avoid a major split within the party they were anxious to maintain that party unity despite the controversial issue of the Independent Treasury. ","By the time of Van Buren's speech in 1840, the Virginian Democrats had regained many of their wandering conservatives but the debate over the economy had proved volatile enough to have successfully created an unforeseen impasse within the party. Liberal Democrats supported Van Buren's Independent Treasury because they had seen the results of wild speculation in the Panic of 1837 while conservative Democrats argued that if credit and inflation were carefully monitored, a system of state and local banks was more efficient.  Rives hoped to turn the Virginia Democratic party against Van Buren's administration but by 1838 it became clear that the majority of Virginia Democrats would not leave the national party, even after the proposal of the Independent Treasury. Slowly conservative Democrats despaired of changing the party's platform and completely lost heart when Rives did not win his bid for reelection to the Senate in 1839.  Most returned to the mainstream Democratic party and by 1840, the presence of the conservative Democrats in Virginia had disappeared.","<em>The Virginia Advocate</em> very astutely appealed to both the Whigs and the Democrats in Albemarle County by printing Van Buren's speech because the financial health of the nation was a mutual concern as both parties tried to resolve the issue.  Furthermore, since another presidential election was fast approaching, the political atmosphere intensified as southerners debated party platforms and the future course of the nation. Thus, Whig and Democrat alike in Albemarle County would have bought this paper and perused the president's speech with equal interest."],"display_date":"December 12, 1840","search_date":"1840-12-12","locations":[{"id":13596,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2204,"title":"Major Townsend&#39;s Letter\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-12-21","end_date":"1837-12-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Major Edward Davis Townsend was in an alien land. He had made it a long way from his home in Boston to be a surveyor for the city of New Smyrna on Florida's frontier, and he missed all the pretty girls greatly. In a letter to his mother, Eliza Gerry, he described his new environment. He asked her to imagine to yourself me with my jacket off, covered with mosquitoes and sand flies, trampling through thick brushes, and running lines over rough paths cut out of hammocks. In 1837, the Second Seminole War was raging in Florida. Mrs. Townsend worried about her young son, a thousand miles away and fighting a war against the indigenous Seminole nation on behalf of the citizens of Florida. ","Townsend, however, kept her updated on the war news. General Eustis had recently assumed command of the Eastern Army after General Hernandez had allowed an Indian retreat to the south. Troops were building up in the county preparing to drive the handful of little wretches in our direction. Townsend's descriptions of the Seminoles were contrasting and flecked with both racism and respect. Later, he called the warriors respectable and distinguished, but referred to Chief Big Billy as a consummate rascal...a dark looking and immensely powerful savage. The chief he called Powell was a peaceable and consistent diplomat who also maintained a brilliant mind for guerilla war tactics. When in St. Augustine, Townsend had the honor of shaking hands with Old Phillip, Big Billy, Blue Snake, a friendly Seminole, and many others. His encounters with these war chiefs were of great importance to him, and he related these experiences to his mother.","The letter is a narrative of an outsider to the territory; Florida was still very new to Major Townsend. He arrived there having limited interaction with Indian populations, and his descriptions were powerful in their untainted perspective of a foreign environment. He consciously picked adjectives to describe these warriors and chiefs based on what he had witnessed, and reinforced them with what he had heard: stories of battles, massacres (Dade), and conversations with white Floridians. Powell, as Townsend called him, was better known as Chief Osceola to the Seminoles and later to all Americans, as his fame spread. Townsend treats him with great respect, as would many soldiers, officers, and citizens nationwide, giving insight into the thought process of a young soldier in respect to his so-called enemy. Osceola was born into a humble life in the Creek nation of Alabama, with no hereditary connection to the Seminoles. Upon relocating to Florida, he ascended to an unequaled position. He won a string of battles during the summer and fall of 1836, outmaneuvering and baffling U.S. troops in swamps and hammocks. He gave the Seminoles tribal identity and unified them in pursuit of a common goal. Osceola, as Townsend began to show, deconstructs the notion that all whites viewed Indians as savages. They gave respect where it was due, acknowledged valiance when it was displayed, and felt honored in his presence, regardless of his physical appearance or enemy status. Officers chose to deal with him in diplomatic consultations, and, upon his death on January 30, 1838, he was given a military funeral at Fort Moultrie. It is said that warriors and U.S. Soldiers alike wept at the news. The epitaphs at his gravesite read Patriot and Warrior, and so remains his legacy in U.S. History."],"display_date":"December 21, 1837","search_date":"1837-12-21","locations":[{"id":1503,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MOSQUITO, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2210,"title":"The Trial of John W.

Guiteau was delivered at the courthouse on the morning of the twenty-third of January. Although the court officers continually shouted for silence, Guiteau never ceased his criticisms of the court and Judge Porter even as the judge read off the charges against him. Judge Porter compared Guiteau to John Wilkes Booth, suggesting that the murderer of Lincoln shared with Guiteau a desire to win notoriety at any cost. Guiteau was accused of the assassination of President Garfield, with his only real hope of defense lying in a plea of insanity. The jury declared Guiteau guilty as indicted, followed by applause from the crowd and Guiteau's statement that the verdict was an outrage upon the American people.","   The Valley Virginian described the popularity of this trial that enthralled the entire public for the entire eleven weeks of its duration. Though guilty, sympathy often awaits the condemned as the consequences of the verdict come to be considered. However, the case of John W. Guiteau evoked less public sympathy than any crime resulting in capital punishment before it. The desire for a guilty verdict was universal as the nation felt that its own character, as well as the fate of the miserable assassin, was on trial. ","   The Virginian's editorial on the verdict of the case spoke to the faith of Augusta County in the legal system and its desire to protect the president of the nation. Though a national event, the Staunton newspaper published its own thoughts on the outcome of the trial, trying to reconcile the pity felt for those sentenced to a public execution and the outrage of an assassination. The strength of the public outcry upon Garfield's assassination is ironic considering he won the 1880 presidential election against Winfield Scott Hancock with a plurality of only ten thousand out of more than nine million votes. Garfield was the Republican candidate carrying most of the Northern states and none of the former slave states, including Virginia. James Garfield was not installed in office for much time before his assassination; historian James M. McPherson details how he was consequently unable to fully enact his plans to form coalitions between the Republican Party and the newly forming independent parties in the South. The outrage of Guiteau's actions described by The Virginian was not due to admiration for Garfield, but for the office he held. Though the South was often suspicious of Northern attitudes, they were bound enough to the Union to have an emotional investment in its commander-in-chief.

The performance of the Stonewall Brigade Band of Staunton confirmed the friendship that existed between the two sister cities of the Valley of Virginia, Staunton and Winchester. The Brigade Band performed to the general delight of all present outside the Commercial Hotel in honor of Captain W. L. Clarke, an old citizen of Staunton and the mayor of Winchester. One listener named the band the capstone of the civic virtues, illustrating the pleasure the music gave those in attendance. Mayor Clarke, as well as many other men, responded to the tribute made by the concert with addresses discussing the feelings of friendship existing between the neighboring towns.","  The performance highlighted the value that the inhabitants of Augusta County placed on an amiable alliance between sister towns and the qualities they treasure in their citizens. An attendant of the performance observed that brass was usually recognized as essential to success, and that he did not know any equal number of men who had more brass or knew how to use it better than the Stonewall Brigade Band. His comment highlights not only an appreciation of the skill of the musicians, but also the importance of brass, strength and confidence in a man, which is necessary for him to be triumphant. ","  The time for the South to remain confident came prior to the 1880 election. After the decline in Republican votes in the South in the election of 1878, the Radical Republicans identified a need to change the political distributions to dominate Congress if they were to attempt any government action in the South. Historian James M. McPherson describes how by 1879, they realized that a unified North had to outvote the solid South. While the North sought to show the South that they would no longer dominate the government, the South continued to reinforce the bonds that kept them politically united, furthering McPherson's argument by suggesting the implications of the attempts to form a solid North on the South. The playing of Staunton's Stonewall Brigade Band connected Staunton to her neighboring city of Winchester, strengthening the sisterly feelings that existed between these two cities of the Valley. Communication between cities allowed the sharing of ideas and news, both political and social. When election time arose, it is more likely that these cities would vote similarly because they had a vested interest in one another. It is connections such as these between Staunton and Winchester that formed the solid South, relationships that the North would like to break after the 1878 election.

Historian Gail Collins notes that these groups typically functioned as, a sort of informal, do-it-yourself junior college system. The idea of doing something unrelated to their families was an enormous breakthrough. The 1886 C.L.S.C. record book stated that the women studied wide-ranging topics with everything from, the poetry of the Elizabethan Age, and philosophical discussions of, mind and matter to, the formation of coal beds, and the, Geology of the Atlantic Ocean. The women undertook these endeavors earnestly and with enthusiasm, each member presenting a different topic for discussion in any given meeting; Mrs. Tolfree, an active member of the C.L.S.C, for example, would present Current Events, while Mrs. Travers would be prepared to speak on Congressional Proceedings, once particular bills were made law. "," The late nineteenth century gave birth to a new, small triumph for southern women. Across America, pockets of female intellectuals gathered together in order to discuss everything from the most classical works of academia to current affairs. The Queen City Chautauqua Circle was one such gathering. By 1900, there were roughly 5,000 such groups that were part of the General Federation of Women's clubs alone, while hundreds more, like the Queen City Chautauqua Circle formed on their own. Gail Collins suggested that women at this time were, reaching for something beyond the household. In an apparently spontaneous movement, women's study clubs started popping up all over the country. In cities, small towns, and even some rural areas, middle class housewives organized themselves into groups to study current affairs, world history, or English literature. And, indeed, these intellectual support systems for women seemed popular in the South; a roster taken in 1885 by Mrs. O. A. Parish had as many as 23 female members recorded. "," Collins noted that the Civil War was an earlier turning point responsible for this new way of life for southern women. She said that at a time when, southern manhood, 'the mighty oak,' had been, 'hit by lightening,' women began to forge bonds with one another and take on new societal roles like never before. In the late nineteenth century of the Gilded Age, women were showing up in the workplace in both the North and the South, or taking more active roles in their communities while still taking care of their families-which was more often the case in the South."],"display_date":"1885 - 1887","search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":7853,"lat":37.8246035682,"lng":-92.2076649652,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2227,"title":"A Northerner in Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-09-19","end_date":"1856-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Relations between people from each side of the divide between slave and free states proved to be contentious in the years preceding the Civil War. On September 19, 1856, the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> reported a peculiar incident involving a Northerner who had made his way South. The captain of ship from Maine docked his ship in the port at Alexandria, Virginia. Upon hearing the results of the election in his home state, the captain hurrahing as he went had [his ship] hauled out into the middle of the Potomac, let go her anchor, ran up his bunting and fired his guns all night in honor of his home. The sailor boisterously put forth his pride in the Abolitionist outcomes of the elections in his free home state for all his Virginia hosts to see."," The <em>Tribune </em>also reported on the coverage the occurrence received in the local <em>Alexandria Gazette</em>. The <em>Gazette</em> claimed the sailor's actions proved an insult to the great state of Virginia. The Northern paper proceeded to attack the <em>Gazette</em> for its indignation of the captain's actions by saying, The dignity of the honorable states of Virginia and Maryland is insulted by the infernal noise of a half-mad sailor glorifying over the elections of Abolitionists in Maine Poor <em>Gazette</em>, it don't understand that the heart of a sailor...beats rapidly at the sound of oppression, and always rejoices when the right is the victor "," The <em>Tribune</em> berated the Southerners attack on the half-mad sailor as pathetic and unnecessary. However, for those living in the South, any influx of Abolitionist rhetoric had to be viewed as a threat. As William Link contests, in the years directly before Secession, slaveholders had to constantly protect the institution of slavery from ideological threats, both from within the social system of the South and from the invasion of radical antislavery Northerners. While to the journalists from Chicago, the actions of the captain could simply be viewed as the patriotic expression of a free spirited man of the sea, to those in Alexandria, anxious to protect their way of life based on slavery, the actions of a man celebrating the victories of abolitionists, had to be viewed as a threat. Even if the election took place in the far-away cold North of Maine, any victory for abolitionism was a loss for the cause of defending slavery."],"display_date":"September 19, 1856 - December 31, 1856","search_date":"1856-11-09","locations":[{"id":14383,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"ALEXANDRIA CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2235,"title":"Episcopal Church Election Controversy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-12-01","end_date":"1897-12-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Arkansas Church Election, held on December 1, 1897, met in order to determine the election of Coadjutor Bishop of Little Rock. The New York Times reported on Friday, December 3, 1897 that the candidates for the position were Reverend John Gass of Little Rock, and William Montgomery Brown of Cleveland. The Diocesan Convention of the Episcopal Church of Arkansas met and elected Archdeacon William Montgomery Brown to work alongside the current Bishop Henry N. Pierce as Coadjutor Bishop. Bishop Pierce was already relocated to Little Rock, Arkansas in march of 1870 after his election to the position on January 25, 1870, where Brown joined him from Cleveland. His election, however, was not met with much approval from the Little Rock Episcopalian community. The New York Times stated bluntly that, The election of Archdeacon Brown has resulted in great dissatisfaction. "," The frustration that the public felt at Brown's election seems to have stemmed mainly from his economic standing and its potential effect on his clerical policies. On December 2, Governor Jones of Little Rock, a supporter of Reverend John Gass, accused Mr. Brown told the press that he felt Brown was unsuited for the job, saying that, an overwhelming majority of Arkansas Episcopalians belong to the low church, and Mr. Brown's chief qualification is his wealth. Jones also said that he believed that the economic difference, separates him from the people he is expected to bring to the church. If Mr. Brown is a true Christian at heart and desires to advance the cause of the church he will not accept this position."," This strong sentiment by the governor of Little Rock was reinforced by other accusations against Brown and his wealth. Col. Willaim G. Whipple, another active politician at the time, suggested to New York Times reporters that Brown won his position through intimidation by the high officials of the church. He was quoted as saying, his supporters seem to have relied chiefly upon his reputed wealth or that of some relative by marriage. This seems a poor qualification for a Bishop. Despite the initial reaction portrayed by the New York Times in 1897, Willaim M. Brown went on to succeed Bishop Pierce only three years later on September 5, 1900, becoming head of the region's diocese. And looking back, historian Dallas T. Herndon observed in 1922 that, under the ministrations of these several bishops [Brown included] the Episcopal Church has had a satisfactory growth in the state."," The Episcopal Church of the South in the nineteenth century was considered less prominent and had fewer followers than Methodist and Baptist institutions. Historian Samuel S. Hill attributes this smaller following, in Arkansas particularly, to the fact that Episcopalians tended to be of higher economic standing than most, putting them in a smaller demographic. Hill also suggests that, From Reconstruction to World War I the Episcopal Church in the South was concerned with two primary issues: recognizing and reorganizing and rebuilding after the war and continued growth with the creation of new dioceses. This validates the attentiveness given to the election of Archdeacon Brown, as the Episcopalian church was trying to re-establish its foundation in the South."],"display_date":"December 1, 1897 - December 3, 1897","search_date":"1897-12-02","locations":[{"id":752,"lat":34.7798418653,"lng":-92.3166533878,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2239,"title":"Ignoble and Impotent\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-03-04","end_date":"1895-03-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of Monday March 4, 1895, the Fifty-third Congress came to an end. The headlines that ran in the New York Times that day took the opportunity to let lose a harsh critique on that particular Congress. They read: A DISGRACE TO AMERICA, FAITHLESS TO PARTY AND COUNTRY, and, NO ONE REGRETS THE DISSOLUTION. The prestigious newspaper commented on the corruption and ineptitude of the political leaders in the Congress. After discussing several missed opportunities that the Congress failed to take proper action on, the New York Times listed the worst offenders in several states. Arkansas, along with several other southern states, had eight of its representatives' names appear on this list including James K. Jones, James H. Berry, Philip D. McChulloch, Jr., John S. Little, Thomas C. McRae, Willaim L. Terry, Hugh A. Dinsmore, and Robert Neil. Historian Dallas T. Herndon recorded each man's election to that disgraced Senate in 1922, The election for representatives in Congress was held on November 6, 1894. Those elected from the six districts in order were: P. D. McCulloch, John S. Little, Thomas C. McRae, William L. Terry, Hugh A. Dinsmore, and Robert Neill, all Democrats."," The New York Times seemed to be specifically attacking the Congress for its democratic majority. It suggested that the South's overarching democratic political sympathies and politicians were responsible for the problematic congress, not the North: the performance of the Democratic majority, coming into complete control of the government, entrusted with the power to embody in the laws... responsible for the prudent management of affairs, has been so lame and impotent that it may be said without offending Democrats, that nothing in the life of the congress became it so much as its taking off. The paper went on to accuse Democrats of being, stupid and, ignorant in their being out of sympathy with the conservative president of the time, Grover Cleveland. Jones, specifically, was accused of being, a rather narrow, weak, gullible, man who had, an unmitigated aversion for anything that smacks of sound money or loyalty to the president. He was held accountable for swaying the congress with those notions. "," The paper reported glumly that his term did not expire until 1897. In fact, James K. Jones stayed far past 1897, even though his name appeared first for Arkansas on the list of Those Who Have Betrayed the People in the 1895 edition of the New York Times. Jones's continued political career suggests that the political tone against Arkansas Deomcrats was not as hostile toward the end of the 1890s. The six representatives of the congress for Arkansas were then listed in order as, McCulluch a bullion coiner, Little who was willing to pay gold loans in silver, McRae whowould starve the commission out of office, Terry who voted against the silver repeal, Dinsmore who has been all the objectionable things in legislation on finance, and Neil, a starver of the merit system."," Although political tensions between the North and South lessened from the height they had been during Civil War, it was not all together gone, particularly in government. The two different parties came head to head with different ideals and ideas for the administration of the country. This open attack by a northern newspaper on the southern Democratic influence in the national government showed that although the war was long over, America was still working out how to merge a nation distinctly separated into North and South, Republican and Democrat."],"display_date":"March 4, 1895","search_date":"1895-03-04","locations":[{"id":456,"lat":34.2896663051,"lng":-91.374617067,"zoom":9,"place":"ARKANSAS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2257,"title":"President of Wake Forest University Denounces Participation of his students in Republican Stump-speaking\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-10-26","end_date":"1889-10-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Despite President Charles E. Taylor's plea, the students of Wake Forest University would not silence their political opinions.On the night of October 26, 1889, a Republican stump-speaking, literally delivering a speech from atop a freshly cut tree stump, occurred half-a-mile from campus. Fifty of Taylor's students attended the stump-speaking, led by Wake County native John Nichols, who was elected as an Independent to the United States House of Representatives in1886.  Nichols spoke for an hour, with two Wake Forest students asking permission to speak afterwards.  While Nichols speech was interrupted only by applause, the two students who spoke afterwards were interrupted by yells from the crowd because of the vulgar language they used.  ","What these students said exactly to anger the Republican crowd is unclear, but in Taylor's letter describing the event to John Wannamaker, General Postmaster of the Republican administration of Benjamin Harrison, he states his belief that, in the past, his students have taken no action to break up meetings of Republicans by behaving disorderly.  He had always advised his students to take no position in politics while they were in college, but could not stop his students from voicing their opinions.

With Democrat Grover Cleveland's 1885 accession to the White House amidst Republican domination of the office since the 1860's, Democrats only found themselves held to higher standards and stricter criticism.

Did the white men of North Carolina really want the negroes to decide the outcome of the upcoming election and degrade the white men of North Carolina?

Many of the boys clutched baseball bats, gloves, and catcher's masks in anticipation of baseball practice later that afternoon. On the back of the keepsake photograph, someone had scribbled Cluster Springs High School Baseball Team, over the words Cluster Springs Academy. The photograph dates back to the turn of the century, around 1900, when secondary education began to change in the United States, specifically in the state of Virginia.","A pamphlet entitled <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> published in the beginning of the twentieth century told the story of a Virginia preparatory school located a half a mile from Cluster Springs on the Durham Division of the Norfolk and Western Railroad, approximately six miles from South Boston, Virginia. <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> is a brochure that not only discussed the history of the Academy but also marked the school to potential students and their families. Many pages were devoted to discussing the benefits of the 150 wooded acres, the famous mineral springs, and the mild climate; the mild climate makes it possible for the students to indulge in some form of outdoor sport every week in the year. One page of the pamphlet was a testament to the school's athletics reputation especially in the sport of baseball where the record was one of the best among the preparatory schools in the state. In terms of academics, the pamphlet quoted that without any form of testing or examination 75 percent of students continued in schools of higher education. ","Virginia's education system was beginning to make several changes at the end of the nineteenth century including the growth of the secondary education system as a whole, the inclusion of specific educational requirements, and growth in attendance. For example by 1914, in some Virginia counties, such as Halifax County, there were as many as three public high school districts. At the end of the nineteenth century, there were also lists of recommended textbooks, courses, and subjects for public high schools published by several authors. Another important fact was the growth in attendance in secondary schools. Although the growth was not consistent from 1890 to 1900, the number of pupils increased from 9,124 to 11,736. Even though these were numbers and trends for public schools, the private school enrollment was about the same as the public secondary schools. <em>The Scarlet Cord</em> made the claim that Cluster Springs Academy is an example of evolution in the world of education, and the history of Virginia education proved the claim true."],"display_date":1900,"search_date":"1900-07-02","locations":[{"id":13902,"lat":36.7669669152,"lng":-78.9366405787,"zoom":9,"place":"HALIFAX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2277,"title":"A Dissenting Voice\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-07-09","end_date":"1837-07-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Unmarried and living on the La Grange plantation in northeast Florida, Ellen Brown could no longer tolerate her brother's inconsistencies on matrimony. Mannevillete Brown believed marriage to be an ultimatum-the great aim of women and last public act before retreating into domestic life. But Mannevillete also spoke of marrying for money, station, and power. How did he then reconcile his speech on a woman's motives if he just claimed that publicity is their only aim? Ellen derided her brother in a letter and blatantly challenged his concept of southern patriarchal order. Mannevillete did not have the right to assume he knew women and their motivations better than she did. Ellen claims he is just as anxious as all women to marry, but she did not accuse him, as he did her, of making it the business of his life. ","Moreover, marriage was more complicated than Mannevillete made it out to be. The concept of marrying well was influenced by many factors-by love, money, property, morals, and the peace of families. Mannevillete did not make inconsistencies agree. Ellen asked him to allow her to make her own decisions towards marriage. To this end, she humbly opined and apologized for her prolixity. ","Ellen Brown's voice was one of dissent in a suppressive society dominated by males. She was part of a larger migration of wealthy, New England families to the Florida frontier seeking opportunity. The Browns, including her sister Corinna, meshed with the social elite of Jacksonville and St. Augustine. They became family friends with David Levy Yulee and Judge Thomas Douglas, influential policymakers at the time. Thus, the Brown sisters came under tremendous systemic pressure to marry well. They were vibrant, young, northern-born women, educated, and literate. Their eloquent correspondence is evidence of pressure against customary social norms which would increase in intensity from the early nineteenth century through the Civil war and Reconstruction. ","In the early 1800's, the doctrine of separate spheres, the cult of domesticity, and the cult of single blessedness were widely held beliefs and concepts in the South. Men and women occupied separate and exclusive spheres of influence, one external and societal, the other internal and domestic. Women could not vote, hold property in most circumstances, or engage in economic transactions; husbands acted as brokers for their interests (coverture). Marriage was a way to gain status and influence through males, but single southern women, such as Ellen, could also carve a special niche in society, that of the maiden aunt who was blessedly single. An aging single woman, the maiden aunt, cared for family members and children in times of sickness and death and maintained a close-knit family through communication. These maiden aunts were especially close with their brothers, such as Mannevillete, who offered male companionship and attention, as well as outlets for political discourse and debate.","The Civil War and Reconstruction offered even more opportunities for women to expand their spheres of influence and redefine their roles in society. The percentage of single women had already begun to rise in 1830 and increased with the loss of thousands of men in the Civil War. Southern households were transformed. With the removal of slavery, women assumed new domestic duties but also moved outside that realm to become schoolteachers in new public and private school systems. In all these changes, women began to have a choice: choice of marriage, choice of profession, and choice of civic responsibility. Marriage was expected, but single women of the elite classes were not universally exiled to the periphery of southern society; they found meaningful roles to fill within the family and later, civic life. The correspondence of Ellen and Corinna Brown is more of an anomaly-atypical and unrepresentative of the whole of southern women. The Brown sisters were incredibly intelligent and well-educated, having the time and resources to write and preserve their daily opinions, thus offering a glimpse of social norms in flux. Most southern women were not so privileged. Still, as more women began to choose to be single, they helped shape their futures more than societal forces that once constrained them."],"display_date":"July 9, 1837","search_date":"1837-07-09","locations":[{"id":1324,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DUVAL, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2278,"title":"Brown&#39;s Speech to Congress\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-06-17","end_date":"1844-06-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Looking out over the twenty eighth Congress, Mr. A.V. Brown knew he needed to convey to the statesmen gathered that the division of Florida territory into east and west partitions, and the prolonging of the territorial phase therein, was both inadmissible and undemocratic. Brown, speaking for the Committee on the Territories, implored the House to strike down Bill H.R. No. 431. He began by appealing to the American ideal of self-government, a tactic that should carried some weight in front of a Congress who still vividly remembered the American Revolution. By 1844, the territorial-government phase in Florida had dragged on for 23 years. As such, its citizens had no formal political rights in Washington outside of a single delegate. Self-government was the maxim of America...that high privilege, the right of all men; Florida could no longer be denied participation while being subject to the supreme and despotic rule of those in Washington. Brown sounded much like Thomas Paine that day, and everyone in the room could relate to his words.","Brown then moved to describe the people of Florida as freedmen whose bosoms...heave with all the same impulses of liberty which mark the character of their fellow citizens. To such a population, the 23 years of absolute dependence had been degrading and injurious. The substance of his argument then became clear: Florida's entrance into the Union would serve mutual interests by relieving the federal government of the responsibility, expense, and trouble of maintaining the territory, while Florida would finally obtain formal political rights. In addition, the expedited admission of Florida would coincide with that of Iowa, maintaining the equilibrium of free and slave states. Brown concluded by again asking Congress to throw out Bill No. 431.","A.V. Brown's speech highlighted several divisive issues. The idea of a separate East and West Florida divided Floridians throughout the territorial phase. Not only was there physical and psychological separation between the two areas due to Florida's vast size, but divisionists argued that the cost of running a single state would be too high. They argued to delay the state-forming process, let the population increase, and then divide into two smaller territories. Unionists argued for Home rule, autonomy, and the benefits, such as education grants, that statehood would bring. David Levy Yulee, the most influential figure in Florida's antebellum history, backed the unionists and advocated for a United Florida. He served from 1841 to 1845 as the territorial delegate to Congress, leading Florida to statehood, and was subsequently elected as the first Jewish senator in U.S. history.","The entrance of Florida as a slave state, to balance the Union, was the substantive crux of the positions of Brown and Levy. Slave labor was essential to Florida's economic development; planters had poured in from the lower South after Spanish cession through the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1821 to establish cotton plantations in middle and western Florida, around Tallahassee. Just as with Maine, Missouri, and other territories admitted during the period, politicians sought to maintain a tenuous balance of power. Admission of Florida became more attractive as the application for statehood of a free territory, Iowa, appeared on the horizon and came up in 1846. Less than a year after Brown's speech, on March 3, 1845, Florida became the twenty seventh state of the Union."],"display_date":"June 17, 1844","search_date":"1844-06-17","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2279,"title":"E.P.

Although there was no consensus on the cause of the Panic, several different factors contributed, beginning around 1890. One of the important factors was a run on the gold supply, where people traded in their silver notes for gold notes. Since so many people traded in their silver notes, the U.S. Federal Reserve reached the minimum amount of gold required in their vaults and people could no longer trade in their silver notes. After this occurred, many banks failed, thus causing the price of silver to plummet. Once the banks failed many railroads (and then companies) in the West and Northwest followed suit and filed for bankruptcy. Thus, the estimates for the number of bank failures and companies reached approximately 500 and 15,000, respectively.","Politically, Americans blamed the Democrats and President Grover Cleveland for causing the Panic. Therefore, when it came time for elections, it was important for the Democratic Party to attempt to withstand the pressure and come out on top. The Virginia State Democratic Committee was looking for strong, respected community leaders to help get the votes within each individual county. This role of soliciting votes fell to the county Canvasser, and in the case of Brunswick County, the Committee chose E.P. Buford for the role. As an established lawyer within the town of Lawrenceville, Virginia, E.P. Buford was an excellent choice for the role because of his many connections within the town and surrounding community. He had many cases with different plaintiffs thus creating a large network and building a reputation within Brunswick County. This is exactly what the Democratic Party needed as it began to take heat for the policies that caused the Panic of 1893."],"display_date":"September 4, 1893","search_date":"1893-09-04","locations":[{"id":13681,"lat":36.7647849382,"lng":-77.8590149574,"zoom":9,"place":"BRUNSWICK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2287,"title":"Nat G.

Hutcheson were the minutes of the L.A. Armistead Camp Confederate Veterans of Mecklenburg County as well as several articles regarding the Camp of Confederate Veterans. One of the articles, Ex-Confederates Meet, was a lengthier article that discussed the application for the charter by the L.A. Armistead Camp of Confederate Veterans to the Grand Camp. Named the L.A. Armistead Camp Mecklenburg County's Camp was in honor of General L.A. Armistead who fell while waving his sword on the heights of Gettysburg. There were many Mecklenburgers in Armistead's Brigade. The initial goal of the Camp was to raise enough money to erect a monument in front of the County Courthouse to pay tribute to the fallen heroes of the Lost Cause.","In the last decade of the nineteenth century, Thomas Ellett, the Adjutant-General Grand Camp C.V. of the Department of Virginia, wrote the Instructions About Forming a Camp of Confederate Veterans. It was a specific outline on the proper way to apply for a charter from the Grand Camp, elect officers, and adopt By-Laws and Order of Business. In the missing portion of the pamphlet there were also the Proceedings of the Grand Camp, Charter and By-Laws of the R.E. Lee Camp, No. 1, C.V., Order of Business, Duties of Officials, Uniform, and Rules of Order. The creation of many other Camps of Confederate Veterans used the specific guidelines such as the L.A. Armistead of Mecklenburg County.","The Camps of Confederate Veterans became popular before the turn of the nineteenth century in the South as a way of honoring the 600,000 Confederate veterans who had fought and died in the Civil War. In Mecklenburg County, most of the companies were in the field by September 1861 and the men in these companies comprised about 10% of the Mecklenburg's white population. These camps held reunions for veterans and their families, erected monuments to honor those who died in the war, and provided a support group for the Southerners who had the war fought in their backyards. Since Reconstruction had not fully rebuilt the South both economically and structurally, Southerners still identified with each other through the Confederate cause. Therefore, instituting these Camps of Confederate Veterans was an attempt to fill the void in Southern identity. As in the cases of Robert E. Lee and L.A. Armistead, Confederate Generals and heroes served as names for the Camps. Mecklenburg County began their Camp in 1983, and it continued to be a success as documented in Nat G.

The convention consisted of a declaration of the opposition of the members to all caucuses, and a resolve not to make a nomination for any one for Congress. Five people were appointed to a committee who were to use all fair means to elect a representative to Congress. The news clip that reported on the two conventions also hinted at corruption within the party, saying that the five-man committee's task was to elect only a Whig Congressman who was also a political friend of Gen. Taylor. ","So it was that the September 15, 1847, issue of New Orleans' <em>The Daily Picayune </em>announced the outcome, and lack thereof, of the congressional district conventions of the Democratic and Whig parties in the Third Congressional District. In the 1830s, the Whig party enjoyed great local success among planters in Louisiana. Although Democrat Andrew Jackson won the state in the 1832 presidential election, the Democrats in general could not win local elections; in fact, Whigs controlled the legislature from 1838 to 1853. Much of this was based upon who could vote in 1830s Louisiana. The state had strict property requirements for voting; only those who were white and who paid state tax or purchased public land could vote, making it harder for poor farmers to meet property requirements. Poor farmers usually voted Democratic and rich planters, who owned their own property and paid taxes thus making up the majority of the voting base, usually voted Whig. They voted for the Whigs because the party portrayed themselves as the friends of the protective tariff on sugar and of the United States Bank, qualities that appealed to rich planters. The Democrats, on the other hand, were portrayed as the enemies of the institutions that planters valued and thus were not popular among the wealthy. There was some power shifting when the Democrats won the governor's mansion in 1842, but this was seen as a fluke caused by a banking scandal involving the Whig government, and the party remained a powerful force in Louisiana politics.","Things really changed after Louisiana's Constitutional Convention of 1845, when the new state constitution granted the state's citizens universal white manhood suffrage, dispensing with the previous property requirements. The next year Democrats, strengthened by the poorer farmers who till then had been unable to vote, again took the governor's mansion away from the Whigs, who had reclaimed it in 1844. The increase in suffrage was not the only thing that began to weaken the Whig party in Louisiana; sugar planters were having their own doubts about the Whig-supported war to claim Texas. They worried that Texas would become a competitive sugar market if it was allowed into the Union. Whig loyalty began to falter as voter turnout fell in 1848, and even though Whig candidate Zachary Taylor won the state, the victory is thought to owe more to Taylor's residence in the state than to Whig strength. Louisiana Whigs became even more disillusioned when national Whigs nominated a presidential candidate who was ambivalent on the Compromise of 1850. Louisiana voters began to seriously doubt the party, and by the 1850s a shift towards the Democrats became evident in the state. The 1852 election also signified the end of the national party. Disunity in the party had begun in 1848 when the issue of slavery split the party along North and South lines and the conflict intensified with the 1852 nomination. By 1855 most people had left the Whig Party in favor of either the Democrats or the Republicans. The ambivalence of the Third Congressional District demonstrates early uncertainty in the Whig party-a party that was beginning to die out in Louisiana and in the country."],"display_date":"September 15, 1847","search_date":"1847-09-15","locations":[{"id":5502,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"EAST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2296,"title":"Coal Miners of Allegany and Garrett Refuse to Work for Less Than Fifty Cents\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-09-01","end_date":"1879-09-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The coal miners of the Allegany and Garrett Counties in Maryland met on Wednesday, September 10, 1879 and decided to continue their strike.

The purpose of the Alliance was to work with these forces-particularly railroads and merchants-to protect their own interests.  The Farmer's Alliance described itself as a non-political organization, yet beginning in the 1890's, the Alliance became more and more involved in political lobbying such as the Bright Belt Alliance's fight against the tobacco trust, giving rise to the Populist movement with the formation of the People's Party, pulling members from both the Democratic and Republican parties who longed for the days of small-scale enterprise."],"display_date":"February 6, 1883","search_date":"1883-02-06","locations":[{"id":9474,"lat":36.3074066663,"lng":-78.5963440829,"zoom":9,"place":"GRANVILLE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2311,"title":"The Woman Voter\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-03-15","end_date":"1860-03-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When a woman in 1860, in Alexandria, Virginia, discovered that her husband was too sick to vote in the election, she tried to exercise what the Tribune called 'Woman's rights' by casting his vote for him.

As 1823 turned to 1824, Neamathla was the head chief of the Seminole Nation. This would not last, however. By July, he had been removed by the United States because of growing tension between him and the governor of the Florida territory, William Duval. The Seminoles were now faced with the challenge of electing a new leader who would represent them well without inciting the anger of the United States.","There were two candidates going into the election. Micopany was the candidate favored by the Seminoles, while the Tallahassees and the Micasukies favored Tuko-see-mathly, also known as John Hicks. The election went off without a hitch, and John Hicks was elected as the new head chief of the Seminole Nation-a political union of the Seminoles, Micasukies, and Tallahassees. ","This nation would not last, however. Within a decade, the Seminoles would again be embroiled in a war with the United States. Prior to this war, however, the United States had already begun making inroads on relocating the Seminoles. On September 18, 1823, the United States and the Seminoles signed the Moultrie Creek Treaty. The terms of this treaty moved the Seminoles south onto a reservation. This mass move of 2,300 Seminoles was poorly planned and poorly executed by the United States, primarily because of its lack of knowledge of the territory. The land upon which the Seminoles were settling was poor in quality, which did not bode well for the future health of the community. Indeed, they were hit with food shortages and starvation in both 1825 and 1827 when poor harvests left them without sufficient food to feed themselves. Naturally, they began roaming beyond the borders of their reservation in search of food. The United States, however, did not like this one bit. It had put the Seminoles on a reservation for a reason-so they would not interfere with the American settlers in the territory. So, in 1827, the United States passed a law forbidding the Seminoles from crossing the boundaries of their reservation.","This restriction, like the election a few years before, that seemed so significant at the time, hardly mattered in the long run.

Clay, a U.S. senator from Alabama, was in a feeling of intense anxiety concerning the upcoming election of 1841. Lewis, an Alabama representative, was getting rather annoyed. At Clay's request, Lewis finally sat down to write a letter on January 18, 1841, to Benjamin Fitzpatrick, his brother-in-law and wealthy planter living in Elmore County. Fitzpatrick had been recently nominated by the Democratic Party for governorship of Alabama.","Clay was anxious to talk with Fitzpatrick about his nomination and the election. Unlike Lewis, Clay believed that the prospects for the Democratic Party were cause for distress. The current President, Martin Van Buren, did not enjoy a very peaceful term. The Panic of 1837 burdened his office greatly, leading to an economic depression that was only exacerbated by crop failures and low cotton prices. Furthermore, he refused to annex Texas and opposed extending slavery into the territories, angering many southern Democrats. These issues weakened his chances of reelection. Lewis found a simple answer to this-the Democratic Party should just stay quiet and firm, holding off on any announcement of the Presidential candidate to prevent the resurgence of the same issues. As far as their opponent was concerned, he stated, The only struggle is the secret one going on among the Whigs.","Yet, Lewis was wrong. William Henry Harrison, the presidential candidate of the Whig party, was victorious in the final election. On a local state level, the Democratic Party still retained a strong hold in Alabama. This was because many slaveholders were able to associate abolitionist sentiments with Old Harrison. The electorate of Alabama chose the very popular Fitzpatrick and reelected Clay and Lewis to their respective positions. Nevertheless, the Whigs were not as weak as Lewis had imagined. According to James Volo, they brilliantly campaigned in the first modern political effort in history. Even though Van Buren won Alabama's electoral votes, the Democrats certainly had reason to worry on the national scale. Harrison won 234 of the electoral votes, with Van Buren only winning sixty. Lewis seemed calm and collected in the months preceding the election, blind to the future success of the Whig Party and the imminent split of the Democratic Party that would come only a decade later.

Billingsley on January 9, 1889. The contract specified that Lang agreed to lease around 48 acres of land previously rented by her husband Ellis Lang and on which she currently lived. The land was to be used for growing cotton. Consequently, the agreed upon rental price was the first three bales of cotton produced from the land each year, each having to weigh in at five hundred pounds. The lease agreement was stated to expire at the end of the year unless otherwise agreed to by Mrs. V.C. Billingsley.","Farm tenancy, the division of land to be rented and farmed by individuals, had been a practice in Texas since the colonial period; however, the end of the Civil War and the emancipation of slaves caused a boom in farm tenancy across the southeastern United States as the demand for both agricultural labor and employment skyrocketed. Initially, sharecropping seemed to be an excellent solution for both those with land and those without; yet eventually, it became evident that sharecropping created a dangerous cycle of debt and, at times, the abuse of power by the traditionally white landowner over the poor black and white sharecroppers. Sharecropping quickly became the most common farm tenant arrangement, one in which the tenant did not receive his or her payment, typically given as a share of the crops, until the crops were harvested and turned into the landowner. Through this system, the landowner still exercised a great degree of power, illustrated by the terms of Lang's contract.","Being a sharecropper was a risky business as many were left with no profit after paying back debts incurred during the growing season. This caused the sharecropper to start off the next growing season already indebted to merchants or the landowner and facing the additional challenge of an uphill battle against the unknowns of Mother Nature. Cotton was particularly popular for the high prices it fetched, yet it seeped all of the nutrients out of the soil starting a succession of diminishing returns. When this happened, sharecroppers frequently had to decrease their crop yield and were unable to seek out more fertile land as state laws mandated they remain on the property until they paid off their debts. Landowners and local merchants often took advantage of sharecroppers, many of whom were still illiterate, and maintained economic control. Indeed, because of the way in which sharecroppers were caught in a cycle of debt and were at the mercy of landowners, Claudine Ferrell refers to sharecropping as a form of economic slavery in her book <em>Reconstruction</em>.","While many poor white men also made a living as sharecroppers, a disproportionately high amount of blacks took part in the practice. Life as a tenant farmer was certainly not as grim as it had been for blacks living in slavery; black men and women technically had the ability to spend their time, money and energy as they so desired. Still, as Reconstruction came to a formal close in 1877, the plantation system remained firmly entrenched and many white landowners saw overseeing sharecroppers as a variation of the duties they had retained during slavery. The landowner maintained control over the individuals on his property and thus a relationship based on domination and vulnerability persisted between many blacks and whites in the South. Regardless of the inequity it perpetuated, sharecropping shaped the economic and social atmosphere of much of the agricultural South long after Reconstruction ended and on through the Depression."],"display_date":"April 19, 1888","search_date":"1888-04-19","locations":[{"id":12543,"lat":31.0376697014,"lng":-97.4782357231,"zoom":9,"place":"BELL, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2354,"title":"Debating Prohibition\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-08-01","end_date":"1885-08-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Dr. J.B. Cranfill, a resident of Texas, an ardent supporter of temperance and prohibition, packed his bag, headed for Crawford, Texas, and prepared to defend prohibition in what would be a heated debate in August of 1885. His opponent was to be Roger Q. Mills, a man formerly an advocate of prohibition but whom since had taken the side of whiskey men. Cranfill compared the encounter to that of David and Goliath, and by the time the debate started at 8 PM, there was standing room only.","Mills began by quoting men such as Thomas Jefferson and discussed personal liberty, democracy, and other popular arguments used by anti-prohibitionists; he received a standing ovation. Cranfill then took the stage and began with a reading from the Bible and quoted William E. Gladstone as saying It is the duty of the government to make it easy for people to do right and hard for the people to do wrong. Then, he introduced his next quotable authority with high praises and began to read excerpts from <em>The Prairie Blade</em>; this was a pro-prohibition publication which Mills himself had been editor of in 1856. Following the reading, Cranfill exclaimed Ladies and gentlemen, the quotation I have just read is from the pen of Honorable Roger Q. Mills of Texas As the applause grew to a roar, Mills was clearly embarrassed. Cranfill closed his argument by asking God to strike him dead that night if he was to be tempted away from the principles of prohibition and good will, as Mills had been. Cranfill later reflected on that evening debate as the greatest argumentative achievement of his career, enabling him to send a strong message on the reformation topic which he supported so passionately.","Prohibition, a reform movement to place a ban on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic drinks, was a topic of discussion and an influence on politics in Texas, the South and the entire nation starting in the 1840s. Drama and debate over the subject would continue until 1933 when Congress passed the Twenty-first Amendment repealing the Prohibition Act. In the 1830s and 40s, people in the United States began to notice an increase in the levels of violence and poverty; many blamed this on the increased levels of alcohol consumption and wanted to revive morality and decency by banning alcohol.","After the Civil War ended, the cause was met with renewed fervor and led to the creation of organizations such as the Anti-Saloon League, the Women's Christian Temperance Union and the Prohibition Party. Prohibition was a topic which enticed groups usually silent on political issues to voice their opinions, such as women and religious groups. The topic was debated from the biggest cities to the most rural areas. Nationally, the Prohibition Party received most of its support from Northern voters. This impeded united support of prohibition to an extent since many Southerners were reluctant to take up a common cause with the same people who had previously supported abolitionism and the Republican Party and who now supported female suffrage. The issue did, however, bring together some groups as many white and black voters joined together to fight for the dry laws they supported. Still, in the South the debate over prohibition largely took remained at the local level, and with the decision at the time still up to individual localities, many counties in Texas became dry.","Moving into the twentieth century, the prohibition cause, coupled with religious revivalism, increased in strength across the nation and eventually resulted in the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919. Despite the enthusiasm with which the cause had originally been championed, popular sentiment saw a shift in the 1920s and people soon became disillusioned with prohibition. The Twenty-first Amendment passed in 1933 and Texas voters repealed the state's dry law in 1935, thus leaving the decision up to individual localities. Regardless of the legal outcome of prohibition, the movement it inspired had brought together previously alienated groups through a common cause and enticed many others to have their voice heard for the first time in the political realm. A series of reform movements would follow through the years as politics was invigorated at the local level with passionate individuals eager to improve their country."],"display_date":"August 1, 1885 - August 30, 1885","search_date":"1885-08-15","locations":[{"id":13019,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"MC LENNAN, Texas"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2357,"title":"African Americans on Republican Party Ticket for State Office\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-08-28","end_date":"1873-08-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" In the heat of late August in Mississippi, the Republican Party's State Convention of 1873 was still in session trying to appoint candidates for upcoming elections.

Senator Alcorn, a prominent Mississippi politician, surprisingly declared that he was against the Republican ticket for reasons he did not immediately disclose.  He said that he would address the people of Mississippi the following evening at Representative Hall.  Upon dismissal of the session, the Republicans still had not decided who they would appoint to run for State Treasurer, Attorney General, and Superintendent of Education.  ","       James Lusk Alcorn was elected as the first governor of the reconstructed state of Mississippi in 1969, and he later became a United States Senator.  Alcorn was an extremely wealthy white planter who had been against secession in 1861, and was elated when Mississippi rejoined the Union in 1969.  He was a huge proponent of African American involvement in politics; he wanted them to contribute ideas, candidates, and their votes as newly declared United States citizens.  There were many Mississippians, however, who were not complementary of this idea, a large number of them being Democrats.  Voicing the opinions of many Mississippians, one state newspaper claimed, Nigger voting, holding office and sitting in the jury box are all wrong, and against the sentiment of the country.  African Americans were often stereotyped as lazy, ignorant, and illiterate, and therefore totally incompetent as governing officials.  Alcorn became known as an enemy of the white race; his desires for racial legal equality were not only controversial, but the cause of intense hatred towards him.  ","       The resistance to change and the racist lens through which Mississippians tended to view politics made it difficult for a black man to hold office during Reconstruction.  The appointing of two black candidates for office in Mississippi, despite opposition, however, was not entirely uncommon.  When the remaining Radical Reconstruction governments were finally overthrown in 1877, approximately 2,000 African American men had held local, state, and federal public offices in the South, including a wide range of titles and duties.  This proves that the freedmen were able to overcome the obstacles that held them back and not only run for office, but frequently win the election.  Mississippi blacks who ran for office benefited from the fact that their state was over 50 percent African American in 1870; the concentration of African American populations made a major difference in the likelihood of election for black candidates.  A vast majority of the blacks who ran for public office in the lower South were on the Republican ticket, like A.K. Davis and James Hill.  These two pioneers of black political participation in Mississippi were among the many African Americans who fought for a voice in American Politics during the Reconstruction.

Horace Maynard, the Chairman of the Sub-Ku Klux Committee of Florida, faced a difficult predicament in late November of 1871.  The members of the Young Men's Democratic Club of Leon County, Florida, were in extreme state of alarm and this was brought to the committee chairman's attention.  They were worried about the recent outing of the Ku Klux division of their political club before the Committee-they were afraid of the consequences of their exposure.  Many members of the Democratic organization were planning to flee to Texas, fearing that the same fate might be in store for them that their South Carolina sympathizers experienced.  Republicans in Leon County were also concerned, since people blamed them for exposing the Ku Klux men's secret to the Committee.  The Chairman considered his responsibility to protect the Republicans of Leon County from Ku Klux persecution and likely put a plan for their safety underway.","       The Ku Klux Klan originally started in Tennessee, but infiltrated into bordering regions of Alabama in 1867 or so.  From there it quickly expanded into the state, forming dens that covered the entire former Confederacy by the end of 1868.  Members of the Klan came from all different economic and social levels, but they were united in that the vast majority of them were young men and almost all of them were in some way affiliated with the Democratic Party.  The Klan tended to thrive especially well in rural areas of the South, like Leon County in Florida.  Therefore, it is not surprising that Klan affiliations were found within the Young Men's Democratic Club of this county-the members were perfect candidates for Ku Klux recruitment.  ","      It is also predictable that the Klansmen were turned in by Republicans, who tended to be more in support of African American rights and less active on their inner racist beliefs than the Democrats.  The idea of running away to Texas to escape punishment was a common idea for those who needed to hide in the late nineteenth century, as well.  Texas was a brand new state and, because it was so rural, it provided a great hiding ground for criminals and refugees.  The Klansmen of the Democratic Party in Leon County most likely did run away to Texas for a while to escape the consequences of the revelation of their KKK affiliations.  Their experience shows that Klan membership was a common political faction within many sections of the Democratic Party and reveals the reaction to KKK involvement in post-bellum society."],"display_date":"November 24, 1871 - November 30, 1871","search_date":"1871-11-27","locations":[{"id":1397,"lat":30.4585161351,"lng":-84.2751559802,"zoom":9,"place":"LEON, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2364,"title":"Abolition Crew\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-06-06","end_date":"1855-06-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Nine year-old Susan Bradford Eppes was worried about her father. On the eve of the family's journey to visit relatives in Tennessee an abolition crew had invaded the Eppes's plantation. According to Fannie, Susan's older sister, some white men, who had no business about the place, had come in the night and hidden away. Susan wanted to know more but Fannie refused to say anything else about that night. Due to the uprising in that night, Dr. Eppes did not accompany the family on their trip. Instead, he remained at the family plantation to keep watch. It was not until three days later when Susan pretending to be asleep on a couch, learned more. Her mother and uncle, having not seen her in the study, began to discuss a letter just received from Dr. Eppes. The men in the abolition crew had been on horseback, and according to Dr. Eppes, would be severely dealt with if they returned. Susan's Uncle Daniel stated in a serious tone that these abolitionists are everywhere through the South. Sooner or later they will make trouble for us. It was at that moment that Susan cried out in a voice full of concern and curiosity, Oh, Uncle Daniel, please tell me all about it? However, before Susan could glean any more information on the subject Fannie escorted her to bed. ","By 1855 the possibility of a plantation raid by an abolitionist crew had become a real fear for many large slave owners throughout the south. This episode is a prime example how abolition groups were growing increasingly bolder in their actions across the South. Vanished were the days when only those in the upper South had to be wary of such people. Abolitionists by 1855 were venturing deeper south into such states as Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. Rather than relying on mass mailing antislavery materials to plantation owners, abolitionists were penetrating the South seeking to directly aid slaves in escaping their masters. Encouragement for this kind of action was perpetuated by abolitionist orators like Gerrit Smith and Henry Highland Garnet. In his speeches Smith urged Northern abolitionist to go south and help them. Many Northerners agreed that helping slaves escape would play an important role in the attack and eventual crumbling of slavery. However, proslavery southern whites saw these rescues in a different light. While abolitionists saw slave owners as stealing slaves' very lives, slaveholders saw abolitionist crews as stealing their property. From the southern perspective slave rescues were an outlet of violent northern aggression against the peaceful South. Proslavery advocates saw northerners who participated in slave raids as vile fiends, emissaries of mischief and worse than thieves, robbers, or murderers. In response, whenever a slave rescuer was captured, agitated mobs would gather and insist that the captured parties be punished severely, whether legally or illegally. Outspoken southerners asserted that if northerners continued to interfere in the affairs of slave owners there would be violence.

In 1885, both timber businessmen and railroad executives repetitively brought cases to the Secretary of the Interior concerning the cutting of timber in certain areas of Alabama. These lands, amounting to some 200,000 acres of fertile soil and dense forests, were granted to the state in order to aid the construction of the Mobile and Girard Railroad in 1856. The Alabamians that wanted to cut timber on the lands claimed that the railroad had no valid title to the area because Mobile and Girard failed to abide by the terms upon which the land was given to them. The Secretary requested that the Attorney General get right to work because the conflict between these two interest groups had been steadily growing, and the state government needed to make a finite decision concerning the issue so as to pacify the competitors for the land usage.","A case of a land controversy such as this would have been common in the late nineteenth century as railroads were becoming an increasingly important means of transportation and focus of development. In 1881, Alabama formed a railroad commission to deal with issues such as land allotment for the building of railroads. The commission helped to organize and solve many problems with the railroads development, but they also created problems with citizens, such as the conflict with the timber producers.<em>The Mobile Register </em>frequently featured articles and commentaries against the commission, saying that from everywhere arose the cry of an oppressed people against the arbitrary rule of the great railroad corporations. Therefore, like the timber producers in 1885, many citizens of the Gulf Coast area felt that the railroad companies had unfair privileges and took advantage of the state, and frequently opposed the development of more railroad funding and support in local and state government.

Alabamians flocked to the poles to show their support for their party. The Democratic Party candidates in the county ran against candidates representing a fusion of the Greenback, Republican, and Independent Parties. Election poll officers excitedly reported that the majority of Mobile County voters were choosing the straight Democratic Party ticket, and accounts from the interior of the State reaffirmed the same information-the Democrats were in a clear lead. State officials told The Mobile Register that almost every county in Alabama had gone heavily Democratic as well. Numerical reports from Mobile polls also confirmed the party's victories. The lowest candidate on the Democratic ticket in Mobile County still had one thousand votes more than any Greenbacker or Republican candidate that ran for office-a huge feat for the Democrats Mobile citizens were, for the most part, overjoyed at their party's success, happy to be free from the radical control of the Republicans in their Gulf Coast town.","This swing towards the Democratic Party showed the presence of the old Solid South political climate-the traditional strong loyalty to the Democratic Party in Southern states. In Alabama at this time, the Democratic Party tended to be the party of planters and upper class white folk, whereas the Republican Party had a more racially diverse constituency and a wider range of types of candidates. The Republican and Greenback parties were much more likely to appoint a black to run for office than were the Democrats. Most whites in the Gulf Coast region were opposed to the Republicans' liberal agenda, wanting to return to their lawful superiority during the antebellum days. They certainly would not have wanted to support African Americans running for office, nor would they give their vote to Republican candidates who might potentially side with the Radical Reconstruction governments, further depriving them of their former security. Therefore, as the conservative Mobile population did in the elections of 1880, voters tended to support the more conservative states rights Democrats as opposed to the Yankee Republicans.","However, in coming years, this party alignment would begin to shift as the South evolved after Reconstruction and party lines shifted.

In the Governor's estimations, 500,000 North Carolinians would benefit from the railroad extension.

The state, he argued, could afford this cost by transferring its deteriorating Raleigh-Gaston Railroad, valued at 500,000 to a new North Carolina Railroad Company.  The State's remaining balance would be paid from the issuance of 30-year State bonds paying six percent per annum.  The state would present its first 500,000 of assets, he argued, only after individuals had first purchased the same amount.

Graham, the third of four consecutive Whig North Carolina Governors, was continuing an era of progress with internal improvements that sought to solve the State's dire need for improved transportation.  Even among Southern states, where transportation greatly limited most states' economic horizons as compared to Northern states, North Carolina was considered backward.  Stephen Goldfarb explains the tardiness of Southern industrialization as a consequence of poor transportation to coastal ports.  Distances of one to two hundred miles between the fall lines of rivers and their coastal outlets, a feature of the North Carolina Piedmont, required the advent of railroads. The State's earlier attempts to organize a productive rail line between Wilmington and Raleigh remained a money-losing venture for the State.  Graham's strong words in favor of continuing railroad investment eventually bore fruit when the North Carolina Railroad was formally opened in 1856 by its president, the former Governor Morehead."],"display_date":"December 4, 1848","search_date":"1848-12-04","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2430,"title":"A Last Appeal in the Election of 1860\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-11-06","end_date":"1860-11-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was the final opportunity to influence voters before the 1860 presidential election.  The <em>Raleigh Register</em> printed A Last Appeal for its readers to cast their votes for John Bell and Edward Everett in its final edition before the election.  Bell, whose motto the paper printed as <em>the Constitution must be maintained, the Union must be preserved, and the Laws must be enforced in all their integrity</em>, represented old Whigs of the South in the new Constitutional Union Party.  While the scope of the ensuing war that resulted during Lincoln's presidency was far greater than most could have anticipated, this last appeal to North Carolinian voters forebodingly warns of rupture that would lead to the now smiling fields barrowed by cannon balls, and manured with human blood and bones. The article considered that disunion for the current justifications would be modern humanity's greatest sin second only to the biblical original sin.  ","      The paper, eerily anticipating the prospect for Lincoln's victory in the election, made considerable effort to prepare its readers for the event of a Republican president.  An analogy to card games was made, such that if one begins a hand of cards and then finds the hand gone against him, he cannot honorably disengage but must respect his commitment to the other players and play it through.  Similarly, the article warned that North Carolinians must be willing to accept a Lincoln election just as they would expect Northerners to accept Bell's election.  This gesture of logic is considerable, as Lincoln did not even appear on North Carolinian ballots.  Furthermore, the article purported that factional grievances will be better resolved through Constitutional outlets than through disunion.  Finally, the article offered an assurance against disunion: millions of dollars of southern debt to northern creditors.  The pressures which manufacturers would bring to bear on Lincoln to maintain union, it was suggested, would suffice to dissuade the North from precipitating war.","Powerful forces lurked behind the political debates which confronted readers in North Carolina's Piedmont.

Because of the newly drafted Missouri Constitution of 1865, the term for the governor was reduced to two years and thus Governor Joseph McClurg was faced with having to win reelection in 1870.  A staunch protectionist and prohibitionist, Governor McClurg was strongly in favor of high tariffs, especially on liquor.   This stance made him unpopular with the more liberal wing of the Republican party.  Upon arriving at the Republican convention in late August 1870, B. Gratz Brown announced that he would come out of political retirement to be the liberal candidate on the ticket for the governorship.  It was predicted by the people attending the convention that should Governor McClurg successfully win enough votes to repeat as the Republican candidate for the governorship that Brown would run as an independent.

While many of the delegates supported full re-enfranchisement, Parrish states that some of the regular Republicans wanted to recognize the right of any member of the party to vote his honest convictions.  While this ground was considered neutral, the liberals refused to accept the language.  After an almost 100-vote margin decided to accept the amendments, 80 delegates from 35 counties left the hall and moved to the Senate chamber.  This action earned the delegates the nickname bolters.

After three years of recommendations, petitions, and court proceedings, the Senate of the state of North Carolina denied Lunsford Lane extension on his residency in the state to allow more time to purchase his wife and seven children.  Lunsford had been commended and allowed by his employer, the Governor of the State, to remain employed in the Governor's office keeping order, running errands, and making deliveries, according to a letter sent to the Legislature.  The letter acknowledged that this would be against the North Carolina law that required free slaves to leave within twenty days of being warned out. In 1840, the Secretary to Governor Dudley wrote the first request for Lane's extenuating circumstances.  The letter was answered with no objection, but the situation was considered a legal matter, which resulted in Lane being summoned to court. Due to an unprepared prosecution team, the case was postponed for three months, which allowed Lane to negotiate a petition of relief to be signed by over twenty men and sent to the Legislature for evidence of his strength as a respectable, hard-working man.  When the Court finally met and his case was argued, Lane was not allowed in the Senate chamber because he was a colored man and waited in great fear and anticipation.  The members adjourned and harshly reported Well Lunsford, they have laid you out; the nigger bill is killed.  This was a cruel reality, laced with mockery from the white members of the Senate, and Lane claimed to have felt defeat at its worst and utter hopelessness in the face of humanity.  He was not only denied, but also banished from North Carolina, departing three days later on May 18, 1841, for New York City.What is significant about this narrative is the blurred definition of freedom in all-white institutions in the South.  The freedom granted to Lunsford Lane is an example of the restrictions placed on blacks even after they reached their ultimate goal of liberty.  Freedom was never really free, as historian Robert Fogel found in research of slaves and their owners.  The act of denying citizenship and any extended privileges were both absent from the lives of freed blacks in almost every state, which often left them still suffering from oppression in a white supremacist society, no matter what physical or mental state they were in.  In Lane's case, even though he was awarded freedom, his material conditions and life working for the Governor at least allowed him to be close to his family and earn a substantial living, which were not guaranteed with his freedom."],"display_date":"November 3, 1840 - May 18, 1841","search_date":"1841-02-08","locations":[{"id":9842,"lat":35.8067238469,"lng":-78.6641504807,"zoom":9,"place":"WAKE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2463,"title":"Thanksgiving Day\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-11-06","end_date":"1886-11-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The November 6, 1886, edition of the <em>Goodson Gazette</em> of the Virginia Institute for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind ran the announcement by President Grover Cleveland who declared Thursday, November 25 as a day of thanksgiving and prayer.

Two weeks later, the paper ran Governor Fitzhugh Lee's follow-up announcement that concurred with the President's request. Lee told the families in Virginia to render thanks to Almighty God. The paper dedicated two lines to the abundance of partridges, pheasants, and wild turkies in the markets. The paper of the 27th provided an analysis of the holiday and its effect on game. The article praised the idea of the holiday and its success, but it reminded the readers that the North initiated this custom and It is hard for an innovation to take root among the old established social customs of the South.... The article also promised that the holiday would not subtract from the Christmas holiday because people gave thanks for daily blessings at Thanksgiving and thanked God for the Saviour at Christmas. With that problem settled, the opposing page reminded readers that they killed many turkeys so that they could celebrate that day.

The American South explains that during Cleveland's presidency, his job included keeping the country united, especially because the Republicans and Democrats seemed to be at odds more so than normal. In addition, the pain of the Civil War remained strong in people's hearts. One way to unite everyone without politics was the reaffirmation of Thanksgiving Day's place in America. This way, the people could view Cleveland as a president who cared for his citizens and the union of the country. He also affirmed Christian ideas in the nation. He could try to win over votes by reinstituting a holiday that people enjoyed and boosting the economy through turkey sales.

In the local section, no less than nine anonymous editorials gave the citizens their neighbors' opinions concerning the election. Two in particular mentioned Roosevelt and his relationship with the negro. The first included the phrase Teddy hugs the negro. The second called Roosevelt a demagogue and hypocrite, and attacked his play to the negro and apparent boast of his son sitting next to a black student. The other editorials concern Mr. Bryan and McKinley and their speeches and parties. Those editorials also attacked or praised the other candidates, but not with a racist angle. "," These editorials are short and to the point. This forum for Augusta County allowed the citizens the opportunity to voice their concerns and hopes. The paper also provided longer articles on the candidates and their positions and politicking to give structured and informative answers to the citizens' questions and concerns. The county felt fully involved in the elections and not isolated in the Great Valley from Washington. The attitudes towards Roosevelt and blacks reflect the growing racism and fears of the South after the Civil War.

These citizens of the South attacked Roosevelt for his friendlier than most attitude toward black people. They made their opinions known to the public in the newspaper, almost guaranteeing that county residents could know what view they should take. As Edward Ayers explains, the newspapers played a vital role of spreading ideas and opinions in the county. Alfred Stone believes that Roosevelt's actions during the campaign and then during his first few months in the White House insulted the South in a way that no one had done for many years. He also believes that the attitude most held was that Roosevelt had damaged the relations between the races, not that he improved them by trying to make their lives better. The Democrats campaigned against Roosevelt by attacking his warm relations toward blacks and encouraged the growth of the fear that the South had toward Roosevelt.

On January 2, 1849, the newspaper of Suffolk, Virginia, <em>The Suffolk Intelligencer</em>, printed an article entitled The Great Question. This article examined this turmoil, and pleaded the Union to mend its internal strife. The author explained that Northern fanatics in Congress were imposing abolition notions on the nation, efforts that threatened to bring the nation to the verge of disunion. Two new propositions were being discussed in Washington. The first was a proposal to abolish slavery in the nation's capital, and the second was a motion to bar slavery in California and New Mexico. The article contended that these two proposals had created a kindred feeling among all Southerners, regardless of their political orientation. The Northerners' proposals questioned the equality of a Southern man's property rights; it was hypocritical to allow a man from Ohio to move to Virginia with all his possessions, but to forbid a Virginian from bringing his property (slaves) into Ohio. The author attributed the source of these problems to the recent land acquisitions in the west, most notably the annexations of California, Texas, and New Mexico. The Great Question continued to examine this dilemma by describing the political stances of the Whig and Democratic parties. Though it was too late to quarrel over what has been done, the article claimed that the Whig party initially opposed the acquisition, and that the Democratic party supported the expansion. Therefore, the Intelligencer attributed the current turmoil to the Democrats. The article ends with a glimmer of hope, as the author believed that the councils of Congress would succeed, and reunite the North and South once again.","The article clearly summarizes the nation's state during the time of expansionism, and exposes the beginnings of clear sectional division. Though the nation had yet to split politically, the significance of these proposals would soon divide the Whigs and Democrats, creating sectional rifts that would weaken each party. The article describes proposals that would eventually help form the Compromise of 1850, a plan that would leave both Northerners and Southerners angry and unsettled. This turmoil would continue to heighten tensions between the regions. On a regional scope, the article's description of a newfound Southern unity is extremely important, as Southerners began to unite and to view the North as a common enemy. The mention of equal rights highlights one of the main issues bothering the Southerners, as many were angered that the Northerner's proposals threatened to take away their property. The seeds of disunion were beginning to sprout during this time period, and the nation was slowly moving towards bloody conflict."],"display_date":"January 2, 1849 - December 31, 1855","search_date":"1852-07-02","locations":[{"id":14073,"lat":36.8330322841,"lng":-76.5620503057,"zoom":9,"place":"NANSEMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2494,"title":"Hostile Northern Occupation of Little Rock Yields Friendship\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-09-10","end_date":"1865-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["New to the Little Rock area, John Levering, a U.S. colonel from Indiana, needed a place for his family to live.Recently re-stationed to the city from New Orleans, he found the best hotel in town uncomfortable and unsuitable for a Union officer.In January 1865, Levering encountered a desirable solution.Levering casually visited a local, celebrated lady of society, a Mrs. S--, and informed her that he and his family would be moving in to her house.Levering cited several reasons in his diary as to his selection of this residence.Firstly, it was the comfortable looking home of a clergy man.Levering was informed that Mrs. S--'sreligious husband was away from home fighting for the Rebel army. Also, the Arkansas family was wealthy, and this woman came from a plantation, which owned around 200 slaves at the war's commencement."," Levering's proposal was initially rejected by Mrs. S? who even cried at first sight of Levering and during various parts of their tense conversation.She feared he would take her house and her livelihood from her in order to benefit the Union army with a residence full of supplies and food.In addition, Mrs. S-- had already planned to provide her only spare room for her cousin who was returning from the Confederate army after receiving a severe injury."," Levering flatly informed her that this ex-Rebel soldier would not be moving into her home.Levering's adamancy eventually coerced her into submission; Mrs. S-- had no choice but to agree to co-inhabitance with this northern family.Levering asked her at what time they would dine every night; when her answer did not satisfy his schedule, Levering mandated a later supper time.At this point, Mrs. S-- was very discontented and greatly feared what others in society would think of her housing a Yankee colonel."," Eventually, a friendship grew between the Levering family, Mrs. S-- and her Arkansas lady friends who visited the house often.Mrs. Levering and Mrs. S-- became very intimate and both women were melancholy when the Union army left Little Rock and, in turn, the Leverings returned to Indiana. Levering notes his gratification of witnessing an earnest expression of regrets for my leaving, as were manifest, upon my coming. "," Dallas T. Herndon narrates that on September 10, 1863, Little Rock, Arkansas became a Union-controlled city, and everything north of the Arkansas River fell under northern control.Consequently, the inhabitants of the city adapted to northern presence, but the hearts of many Little Rock residents were overflowing with animosity and disdain.When Levering demanded to take up residence with an Arkansas lady and her family, the northern power over Little Rock, and other southern cities, was quite evident.Women, in particular, experienced Union occupation, as they remained at home while their husbands fought in the war.Many homes housed Union soldiers who entreated these women to accommodate them.Levering, for example, listened disconcertingly to a southern woman?s wishes.According to Herndon, women in Little Rock continued to aid the Confederate cause, sewing and helping as much as possible; and a monument in Little Rock even honors the ?Mothers of Arkansas? for their sacrifices and labor.Both northerners and southerners alike found their new relationships challenging and confusing, but they adapted to the times.As the Civil War dragged on, southerners found themselves living side-by-side with Union soldiers, as southern cities fell across all parts of the South."," The peculiar relationship between these two families illustrates the possible transgression of regional and ideological differences that many people faced during the Civil War.Levering is shocked that a clergyman?s family could descend from a plantation bearing such a large quantity of slaves and also fight with religious zeal for slavery?s continuance; the cultural differences between Levering and his southern tenants reflect the tensions, which were widespread during the occupation of an antebellum city.Their flourishing friendship, however, offered hope that large ideological differences could be bridged and the Union eventually might be reunited."],"display_date":"September 10, 1863 - December 31, 1865","search_date":"1864-11-04","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2498,"title":"The Revolution of the Immigrant Vote\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-08","end_date":"1861-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Political propaganda was not unique to the nineteenth-century South.

Ultimately, this article was an attempt to rally immigrants in support of the Democrat Party by showing that supporting Republicans would not give immigrants equal rights.","During the 1840s, the composition of America's workforce underwent a dramatic makeover. Immigrants came from predominantly two countries, Ireland and Germany, but also from an array of other European countries. This influx of foreign people would impact American society in virtually every way possible, whether through art, the economy, ideology, or culture.

The opposition to immigrants appeared in third-party platforms denying foreign-born citizens full political rights and eventually wove itself into the foundation of the Republican Party, with the Democrats as the opposition.","This article in the Staunton paper, January 8, 1861, shows how local activists encouraged immigrants to vote against the Republicans. Clearly Southern Democrat propaganda, this article promotes that party as a support of full citizen rights for foreign-born whites. Historian Gregg Kimball traces the immigrant impact of local and national politics, when European immigration sparked hostility during the Know-Nothing era of the 1840s and 1850s. Yet nativism and alienation of rights were undermined when local and national politicians needed the vote of the new immigrants. Where desire for disenfranchisment once existed, the Democratic Party had incorporated immigrants into the interests of its platform.

This financial strain, however, concerned Southerners less than its implications for domestic policy.  They warned, If it is not, it ought to be understood that the Tariff is only one of the subjects of complaint in the South.  The Internal Improvement, or general bribery system, and the interference with our domestic policy are things which will, if necessary, be met with something more than words.  More specifically, slave owners feared Federal interference with South Carolina slave policy.  These grumblings represented a prelude to more conflict, including the Nullification Controversy and later, the Civil War.The nullification confrontation of 1832 and 1833 dealt with whether or not a state could nullify federal law.  South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun, a supporter of states ability to nullify federal law, threatened secession to President Andrew Jackson in 1832 and 1833 if the federal agency encroached upon states' rights.  In addition, he noted that a state convention, while remaining in the Union, could use its absolute sovereignty to render a federal law null and void within that particular state's limits.  South Carolina, and the coastal areas in particular, were especially invested in nullification.  David Houston explores why this was the case.  As the first Southern state to delve into cotton cultivation, South Carolina was the first to see its soil lose its fertility.  This led to a disastrous decline in cotton prices from 1819 to 1835 and to progressively higher American tariffs.  William Freehling adds that these tariffs threatened the establishment of slavery, an explicit South Carolinian interest.  The South Carolina coastal plain was the most densely enslaved Southern area and, therefore, particularly sensitive to America's first antislavery stirrings.   In an interesting turn of events, Calhoun rendered nullification unnecessary by joining with Henry Clay in early 1833 to implement the Compromise Tariff, which very slowly lowered the duties.  This compromise temporarily quelled tensions, however South Carolinian dissatisfaction continued well beyond 1830 and fueled controversy that would contribute to the Civil War."],"display_date":"1830 - 1833","search_date":"1832-01-01","locations":[{"id":11522,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2518,"title":"News of Fort Sumter Rallies Supporters in Augusta County, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-20","end_date":"1861-04-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["James M.

Virginia was a strong supporter of states' rights, and Lincoln's response to the bombardment was in clear violation of those rights. South Carolina had seceded, and Virginia believed that it was the right of South Carolina to do so. Lincoln's unwillingness to let South Carolina leave the Union, propelled Virginia into secession. ","Secession was not a rash choice for Virginia; it had been deliberated constantly. When Schreckhise mentions that there are not a thousand votes for Virginia to stay in the Union, this did not reflect irrationality, rather, people's mind were set carefully.

This was the assumption made by one advertisement of the Red Flag Store, whose proprietor had recently purchased quality Ready-Made Clothing from Pumperle, Geven & Co. following their bankruptcy. The store, like many others, had been shut down and its workers made unemployed. These stores had attracted business mainly from Southern customers, and prior to secession and growing divisions between North and South, this market was dramatically reduced. Bankruptcy of Northern stores provided wealthy Southerners with a sound investment. Not once did the advertisement mention the Abolitionist contribution to the failure of these stores, other than Abolitionism existed where these stores collapsed.

James McPherson establishes the precedent for economic growth in the North and the South. In an effort to create Southern economic independence, Southerners revived the Southern Commercial Convention, which met through the 1850s. This organization ensure that Southerners would only buy Southern goods, and it promoted the construction of railroads, steamship lines, port facilities, banks, factories, and any other institutions that would create a more independent South. When secession was immanent, trade relations soured even more between the North and the South. The economic independence that the South strove for a decade earlier, would help that region create some of its own manufactories and allow for essential products to be made within the region. The North, while growing steadily faster than the South in a commercial and industrial fashion, lacked the raw materials formerly provided by the South.

The conference on race relations to be held in Montgomery, Alabama was a highly anticipated event. The political affair would bring to town many of the nation's finest orators and most distinguished authorities on the subject of race. On May 8, 1900, the Montgomery Auditorium hosted the conference, which included various speeches on racial issues from greater educational opportunities for blacks in the country to a repeal of the fifteenth amendment. The front page of the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> celebrated the conference's turnout: LARGE AUDIENCES ASSEMBLE TO HEAR THE DISTINGUISED ORATORS PRESENT THEIR VIEWS. "," In the midst of the conference on race relations in Montgomery, one article in the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> pleaded with the state to recognize the needs of poor whites in Alabama before attempting to better the position of blacks. This editorial, Industrial Education for White Boys in Alabama, specifically addressed the educational crisis in Alabama. The editorial cited the 1890 formation of an industrial institution in Tennessee as an example of a thousand fold return to the state in terms of citizenship. The article rallied, People of Alabama, where are your thousand boys? On the waste heap it is feared. The <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> editorial emphasized Alabama's educational emergency and called for a statewide reform, thus challenging the existing model of education in the state. "," The educational deficiencies in Alabama at the beginning of the twentieth century took root in statewide politics. White Democrats regained political power throughout Alabama during what was known as the Bourbon years (1874-1890). The moniker recalled the House of Bourbon's restoration after the defeat of Napoleon in 1814. The Democratic Bourbons immediately enacted measures to reduce the state debt and as a result funding for education decreased. In one swift political decision the Democrats eliminated the State Board of Education and significantly reduced both educational appropriations and constitutional guarantees of financial support. According to historian William Rogers, The Democrats opted for decentralization in control of educational affairs. "," These sixteen years of Bourbon rule would impact the statewide educational system into the twentieth century. Until 1891 Alabama schools were awarded funding based on the number of students by race. According to Rogers, townships could appropriate funds based on an amount they might deem just and equitable. This subjective appropriation of funding led to inadequate funding for black schools. However, blacks were not the only students suffering in Alabama. In 1900, there were 104,883 illiterate whites aged ten years or older living across Alabama. At 338,605, the illiteracy was significantly higher for blacks in the state, but these alarming numbers in both categories demonstrated a failed system. In his Bourbon Democracy in Alabama, Allen Going evaluates Alabama's educational system in light of Bourbon politics. He writes, The condition of Alabama schools, however, in comparison with those in other parts of the country was poor indeed. In 1890, the state ranked fourth from the bottom in a listing of various school statistics for all states by the Federal commissioner of education. When the editorial in the <em>Montgomery Advertiser</em> ran ten years later in 1900, the effects of the Bourbon Democrats lingered throughout Alabama. The educational deficiencies and resultant illiteracy rates at the beginning of the twentieth century resulted from a laissez-faire state government.

Upon exiting the train, the workers spotted two black men swinging from trees in the near distance.  According to sources at <em>The Washington Post,</em> the lynched men were the incendiary editors of the black newspaper, the Independent.  The editors were allegedly run out of Selma, Alabama the preceding week and supposed to have been lynched in Birmingham.  <em>The Post </em>noted, It is impossible to get particulars.  ","<em>The Post's</em> report incidentally concluded the dramatic Selma controversy first exposed in the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> on August 20, 1889.  The article, Alabama's War of Races, shed light on the racial tensions that plagued Selma.  On August 19, Reverend Edward Bryant, associate editor to the Independent wrote a highly controversial editorial attacking the whites of Selma and the larger southern community.   In his charged conclusion Bryant projected, You have had your revolutionary and civil wars and we here predict that at no distant day we will have our race war, and we hope, as God intends, that we will be strong enough to wipe you out of existence and hardly leave enough of you to tell the story.  According to the Tribune, Selma mayor, E. Starr publicly condemned the revolutionary nature of Byrant's editorial.  Both sides built up arms in the likely event of a violent outbreak.  Mayor Starr held the pledge of Confederate veterans to fight on behalf of the uniformly armed white population of Selma.  Bloodshed and conflict appeared almost unavoidable.   ","Racial tensions and violence plague the history of Alabama.  According to historian Virginia Hamilton, the use of violence was originally disconnected from racial issues, oftentimes settling disputes between whites settlers.  However, the tradition of violence in Alabama eventually shifted towards African Americans in the years following the Civil War.  Hamilton writes, Violence, the hasty recourse for settling scores between white men in frontier Alabama, was focused upon blacks after emancipation and war had proclaimed them to be people instead of property.  Initially the fear of a black uprising involving armed and newly freed slaves drove groups such as the Ku Klux Klan to persecute and execute countless African Americans in Alabama.  Towards the end of the century, however, statewide politics influenced many lynchings across the state.  One such example was the infamous 1882 lynching of black Republican leader, Jack Turner.  When Turner's Choctow County voted Republican in the 1882 gubernatorial election, the Democrats panicked.  With an upcoming congressional election the Democrats could not risk losing political power to the Republicans; Turner was shortly after found hanging from an oak tree.  ","    <em>The Post's</em> report of the lynching fits into the larger story of southern lynching in the post-slavery era.  A vague allegation of criminality motivated lynchings throughout the South.  There was an average of 150.4 lynchings per year during the last 19 years of the nineteenth century (1882-1900).  These lynched victims were usually accused of raping white women or other trivial crimes.  The murder of the two Independent editors does not fit into the general theme of crime retaliation seeing as the only crime committed was in their exercise of freedom of speech.  However, the story of Rev. Bryant and his associate editor at the Independent portrays the lingering fear of a black revolution.  The perpetual threat of black retaliation for slavery remained imminent in the minds of southern whites and the lynching of Bryant exemplified this fear.

Would the Chicago news reach her parents back home in Tuscumbia before she made it home to tell them in person? On May 17, 1890, the Chicago Tribune ran a special on the miraculous case of Helen Keller; a blind, deaf and dumb child from Alabama. Keller's wealthy parents had sent her up north to a special institution for the blind. According to the article, Keller's parents had heard of the great progress made by another student, Laura Bridgman, and hoped for the same results for Helen. Her success however, far exceeded that of Ms. Bridgman and in the first year Helen acquired a vocabulary of 3,000 words. Her teacher, Miss Fuller, gave her instruction as to how to place her tongue and the child would feel of her teacher's throat and lips when she was talking, thus learning the mechanical elements of articulation. The Tribune reported that Helen subsequently spoke quite readily and praised her remarkable accomplishments. After announcing Helen's feat to the entire city of Chicago, the Tribune concluded, The child has kept her wonderful recovery of speech secret, as she wishes to surprise her parents, whom she is to visit in the South soon. "," Born a healthy baby in Tuscumbia on June 27, 1880, a fever rendered Keller deaf and blind at the age of eighteen months old. Despite all odds, Helen Keller had achieved an international reputation even before studying under Sarah Fuller in 1890. By 1888, at the tender age of eight, Keller was recognized in the Chicago Tribune for her wonderful power. The article spoke of Helen's education in Tuscumbia with Miss Anne Mausfueld Sullivan. At the age of seven, Helen's parents hired Miss Sullivan to teach the child in Alabama. Subsequently, Helen traveled north to continue her education with another teacher, Sarah Fuller of the Horace Mann School. Helen Keller's story became a widely recognized and heartwarming tale by the turn of the century and her dedication to learning earned her both a spot in the public eye and that of history. "," Helen Keller's first educational breakthrough occured at home in Tuscumbia. Why then would her parents then send her away from Alabama to continue her learning? The Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind was established in the 1860s and served as a special needs school close to home. And yet, Keller traveled north to further her education at various private institutions including the prestigious Horace Mann School. Though Keller proved an exceptional case with respect to her achievements in education, she was not alone in her journey north to further her schooling. Many wealthy Alabama natives sent their children north at the end of the nineteenth century in search of higher education. The ill-defined school system and educational deficiencies throughout Alabama led many to look outside the state for higher educational purposes. Furthermore, racial segregation throughout the South created similar education problems as those faced in Alabama. State biographer William Rogers observes, In Alabama, as in the rest of the South, the problems of educational support were compounded by the decision to establish parallel institutions for whites and blacks. Due to racial tensions throughout the South, many southern families turned north for the best educational opportunities. If families had the private funds to find the best education available, many southerners looked north during times of educational and racial turmoil in the South.

The Tuskegee Institution invited the black community to witness what work the school has turned out, how that work is accomplished, and what is the character of the general population in which the raw material comes. Gathered in the hall were, perhaps a thousand colored people...mainly old-timers... including many who had journeyed more than 30 miles to view the spectacle. The audience listened to lesson recitals during the morning sessions and rhetorical exercises during the afternoon with perfect delight. The article also paid significant tribute to the inspiration behind the school, Principle Booker T. Washington. Washington, a man of unusual force and ability for any race, grew the school from the ground up with the aid of seed money from the state in the amount of 2,000. From this grant in 1881, Washington founded his school in a church with 30 students and one teacher. By 1887, the year the <em>New York Times</em> reported on the school, Tuskegee had grown to 275 students. With awe and reverence, the <em>New York Times</em> chronicled this communal gathering and paid their editorial respects to Washington for such a tremendous educational achievement. "," A vital piece of Alabama history lies in the foundation of the Tuskegee Institution. The institute's creation was intrinsically tied to Alabama state politics. The Bourbon Democrats gained control throughout Alabama between the years of 1874-1900. According to historian Allen Goings, the Democrats seized political control of Alabama in 1874 by waging a strenuous campaign based almost exclusively on the race issue. In strategic political move, W.F. Foster, a Democratic candidate for the Alabama Senate, traded black votes with a promise to create a school for the African American community. Under Washington's leadership Tuskegee admitted its first class of 30 students in 1881. Washington had his students build the Tuskegee Institution with their own hands to prove labor as both practical and dignified. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, in advocating hard work and teaching practical skills, Washington hoped to see his race rise through gradual and nonconfrontational change. "," Through Tuskegee, the nation witnessed the beginnings of racial change. <em>The New York Times</em> praised the creation of Tuskegee in the middle of one of the darkest and most hopeless parts of the South. Booker T. Washington had a vision of his black community rising through the ranks of society and Tuskegee proved a first step. Despite all that was in store for the black community in the South, the Tuskegee Institution proved a foundation for social change. On the brink of a new century stood Tuskegee Institute, ready to educate and uplift the black population of Tuskegee, Alabama.

Passing by a young lady on the street one fine afternoon, an elderly Alabama politician caught an eyeful. Was she wearing an article of male clothing? The <em>Greeneville Advocate</em> documented the growing women's fashion trend with a sense of urgency: THE BLOOMER IN ALABAMA. The article informed the readership of the so-called Alabama Bill in the December 9, 1896 edition of the Advocate. An unnamed, yet old-fashioned member of the Alabama legislature had drafted the bill in hopes that immediate action would end the growing ladies' fashion trend du jour. The operational definition of bloomer was of particular concern at the time. The Alabama Bill leaves no doubt that it aims at that article especially, and yet a general consensus as to the bloomers' rightful wearer did not exist. Was it, in fact, an article of male clothing or simply inappropriate women's apparel? The Alabama legislator knew for sure that a woman wearing an article of male clothing violated Biblical code and quoted Deuteronomy accordingly: The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth to the man; neither the shall a man put on a woman's garment; for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord. "," The mounting concern over the bloomer in Alabama had its root in southern conservatism. Fashion in the South mirrored the southern way of life and changed accordingly to reflect the times. During the antebellum years fashion helped preserve southern values in a time of rapid change and national fragmentation. In a time of southern instability during the Civil War, women played an important role maintaining southern tradition through fashion. The southern woman's clothing became tighter, heavier, and longer in attempts to idealize her heightened morals and purity. Women in both Alabama and the larger Southern culture were seen as a paragon of chastity, piety, and virtue. They were expected to be submissive in all respects to their husbands and lead quiet lives raising the children of the South. However, the arrival of the bloomer in Alabama in the late 1890s brought a change to southern fashion. Social historian Jeanette Lauer notes, The decades following the Civil War witnessed a growing democratization in southern fashion. According to Lauer, this democratization of fashion mitigated against the presumed uniqueness of the southern way of life... In The final decades of the nineteenth century and continuing throughout the twentieth centuries, southern fashion increasingly reflected national trends. The bloomer provides one example of a national phenomenon that extended south and into Alabama. "," The bloomer in Alabama signified societal change in the South. In his appeal to Biblical codes, the old-fashioned Alabama legislator demonstrated his staunch southern conservatism. However, by the late nineteenth century, the link between conservative values and accordingly conservative fashion had significantly weakened. On the other hand, perhaps only southern women felt relief in casting aside the shackles of fashion. After all, for decades women fell prey to the oppressive conservative southern values, which in turn dictated fashion. The unbearable weight of hoop skirts, the excruciating pain of corsets, and the insufferable summer days spent in layered petticoats all contributed to the popularity of the bloomer. The bloomer offered a chance for freedom at the end of an era characterized by male domination. At the end of the nineteenth century, fashion proved a juxtaposition between traditional male conservatism and a new female liberalism.

Recently re-stationed to the city from New Orleans, he found the best hotel in town uncomfortable and unsuitable for a Union officer. In January 1865, Levering encountered a desirable solution. Levering casually visited a local, celebrated lady of society, a Mrs. S--, and informed her that he and his family would be moving in to her house. Levering cited several reasons in his diary as to his selection of this residence. Firstly, it was the comfortable looking home of a clergy man. Levering was informed that Mrs. S--'s religious husband was away from home fighting for the Rebel army. Also, the Arkansas family was wealthy, and this woman came from a plantation, which owned around 200 slaves at the war's commencement. Levering's proposal was initially rejected by Mrs. S-- who even cried at first sight of Levering and during various parts of their tense conversation. She feared he would take her house and her livelihood from her in order to benefit the Union army with a residence full of supplies and food. In addition, Mrs. S-- had already planned to provide her only spare room for her cousin who was returning from the Confederate army after receiving a severe injury. Levering flatly informed her that this ex-Rebel soldier would not be moving into her home. Levering eventually coerced her into submission; Mrs. S-- had no choice but to agree to co-inhabitance with this northern family. Levering asked her at what time they would dine every night; when her answer did not satisfy his schedule, Levering mandated a later supper time. At this point, Mrs. S-- was very discontented and greatly feared what others in society would think of her housing a Yankee colonel."," Eventually, a friendship grew between the Levering family, Mrs. S-- and her Arkansas lady friends who visited the house often. Mrs. Levering and Mrs. S-- became very intimate and both women were melancholy when the Union army left Little Rock and, in turn, the Leverings returned to Indiana. Levering notes his gratification of witnessing an earnest expression of regrets for my leaving, as were manifest, upon my coming. Dallas T. Herndon narrates that on September 10, 1863, Little Rock, Arkansas became a Union-controlled city, and everything north of the Arkansas River fell under northern control. Consequently, the inhabitants of the city adapted to northern presence, but the hearts of many Little Rock residents were overflowing with animosity and disdain. When Levering demanded to take up residence with an Arkansas lady and her family, the northern power over Little Rock, and other southern cities, was quite evident. Women, in particular, experienced Union occupation, as they remained at home while their husbands fought in the war. Many homes housed Union soldiers who entreated these women to accommodate them. Levering, for example, listened disconcertingly to a southern woman's wishes. According to Herndon, women in Little Rock continued to aid the Confederate cause, sewing and helping as much as possible; and a monument in Little Rock even honors the Mothers of Arkansas for their sacrifices and labor. Both northerners and southerners alike found their new relationships challenging and confusing, but they adapted to the times. As the Civil War dragged on, southerners found themselves living side-by-side with Union soldiers, as southern cities fell across all parts of the South. he peculiar relationship between these two families illustrates the possible transgression of regional and ideological differences that many people faced during the Civil War. Levering is shocked that a clergyman's family could descend from a plantation bearing such a large quantity of slaves and also fight with religious zeal for slavery's continuance; the cultural differences between Levering and his southern tenants reflect the tensions, which were widespread during the occupation of an antebellum city. Their flourishing friendship, however, offered hope that large ideological differences could be bridged and the Union eventually might be reunited."],"display_date":"January 1, 1865 - January 30, 1865","search_date":"1865-01-15","locations":[{"id":749,"lat":34.7875733319,"lng":-92.2857489535,"zoom":9,"place":"PULASKI, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2553,"title":"The Virginia &#40;Secession&#41; Convention of 1861\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-01-12","end_date":"1861-04-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The large body of men from Albemarle County quickly came to a unanimous decision about who they would nominate to hold their county's seat at the Virginia Convention of 1861. They truly believed that the questions so long pending between the North and the South must be settled. They chose to nominate William C. Rives and V.W Southall to represent Albemarle County at the state convention. Rives and Southall, if they accepted nomination and won election, would be immersed in one of the most important events in the history of Virginia, to decide whether or not to take the state out of the Union. Though the more than 550 men nominating Rives and Southall were in favor of secession if the Federal government failed to respect Virginia's rights, they permitted Rives and Southall to exercise their own judgment at the convention. The men of Albemarle County chose Rives and Southall because of their prominent place in the community. T.J Wertenbaker, E.R Watson, J.N.O.H Bibb, and F.K Nelson were the leaders of the group who nominated Rives and Southall because their names were the only ones specifically mentioned at the end of the note to Rives and Southall.","In January 1861, Governor Letcher called a special session of the Virginia legislature, which approved a plan for a state convention. One delegate to the convention was Robert Y. Conrad an emphatic Unionist who believed Abraham Lincoln was the cause of the sectional conflict. At the convention Conrad became Chairman of a Committee on Federal Relations which debated the merits of secession. While many men in the upper south loved the Union, they supported the right of the states to secede if they chose to do so. Conrad believed the right of the states' to secede came from the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Bill of Rights. Conrad even supported a Constitutional amendment to protect slavery. His Unionist majority defeated an ordinance of secession on April 4 88 to 45. However just two weeks later the secessionists won out, carrying the Convention eighty-eight to fifty-five, a near complete reversal of Unionist fortunes. Two events sealed the fate of the Unionist cause at the Convention, the firing on Ft. Sumter, and Lincoln's call for 75,000 troops. ","Men like Conrad had expressed the will of the majority of Virginians at the start of the Convention, to remain in the Union if Congress granted them concessions, but events outside of their control made peace with Abraham Lincoln seem impossible and secession the only solution. The men of Albemarle County who nominated Rives and Southall expressed the same will in their letter that they believed in the right of secession, but wanted to stay in the Union if possible. The process by which Virginia seceded expressed the early reluctance common across Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas to leave the Union. Virginia's secession was also tremendously important for the Confederacy due to Virginia's population and industries, so important that the capitol of the new nation was moved there."],"display_date":"January 12, 1861 - April 30, 1861","search_date":"1861-03-06","locations":[{"id":13598,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2563,"title":"Brazil as the New South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-06-08","end_date":"1867-06-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["For southern whites, the end of the Civil War ushered in a period of poverty, dependence, and hate. The Union soldiers had confiscated or destroyed much of the plantation owners' valuable property, and without property or the system of slavery that had sustained the South for so many generations, the agricultural economy plummeted and became extremely vulnerable to carpetbaggers and scalawags. Those southerners who had held jobs in the political or other public sphere found themselves replaced by Yankees or Yankee sympathizers. Many once-affluent whites quickly grew frustrated with their forced dependence on the Yankees - for whom they had nothing but contempt and hatred - and the sense of desperation and hopelessness that pervaded the defeated South. Horace Buckner, the young son of a white Louisa County, Virginia planter, traveled throughout the South in the midst of Reconstruction and expressed his horror at the devastation wreaked upon the entire region. Writing his father in Louisa from Mobile, Alabama, in 1867, Horace expressed woe for both himself and the other southerners he observed. As a public school teacher, he worried that although I employed a competent teacher to serve in my absence with the consent of the board...if they are changed, which I think is very probable, I may lose my position. The military authority, which controls this state, seems determined to throw out every Southerner who has any public office and put Yankees in their places. Within the last week, they have removed the entire city government and replaced then with notorious Yankee sympathizers. ","He expounded upon the hopeless conditions in Mobile, writing times are very hard in this city. There is nothing doing. Money can hardly be obtained at all. The clerks in the stores are idle more than half the time. Hundreds are out of employment and are willing to work for almost nothing. He also worried that the registration of blacks to vote will distract them from agricultural work, and that the depressed economy in the South would discourage foreign capital from the region in the future.","After describing these conditions to his father, he proposed a rather radical solution for his own situation and asked his father's advice and counsel. Rather than stay in the ruined South and attempt to rebuild his life under Yankee rule, Buckner considered the idea of emigration out of the United States. During this period, a small number of southerners chose to leave the country rather than live in defeat. A good many seem to be immigrating to Brazil, Buckner writes. They all seem to be well-pleased with the country. I received a letter from a friend of mine out there, urging me to come out, promising me a good and easy situation among a flourishing colony of Southerners. Buckner's friend had promised him a job and a salary equivalent to 1,200 greenbacks and a place in a community of relocated southerners along the Amazon. In fact, over nine thousand southerners did end up relocating in Brazil. John Lowe, in his article Reconstruction Revisited: Plantation School Writers, Postcolonial Theory, and Confederates in Brazil in the Mississippi Quarterly, discusses this phenomenon. Lowe writes that even before the war, Brazil held appeal to many southerners for its perceived similarities to the American South: namely, an institutionalized system of slavery, warm, agriculture-friendly climate, and the nation's later sympathy to the confederate cause at the outset of the Civil War.","Buckner did not end up leaving the country, but instead spent many years traveling through the South and West, never truly settling into a permanent home. However, the fact that he considered - and other southerners actually went through with - leaving the country completely for a land as foreign as Brazil demonstrates the level of disenchantment and frustration felt by white southerners during Reconstruction. In the book Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction, James M. McPherson wrote extensively about the tensions in the postwar South between Northern and Southern whites. He concludes that most often, Southerners' pent-up rage could not be taken out on the Yankee soldiers themselves, and thus Southern white Unionists, or the notorious Yankee sympathizers, about whom Buckner writes, as well as free blacks, absorb the brunt of Southern anger. McPherson also details the corruption and exploitation of many Yankee officials. The federal government instated a cotton tax of 2.5 cents per pound, which was not revoked until 1868. Often, Yankees sent to collect cotton from Southern farmers for distribution throughout the Union instead simply stole it and sold it for their own profit - or accepted substantial bribes from southern planters not to do so.

Republicans charged that the Ku Klux Klan intimidated both white and black voters on behalf of the Democratic Party.  In that election, C.A Sheafe won close election 44176 to 3810, but the Republicans should have won a landslide with 7,800 newly registered black voters.  The House of Representatives agreed with the conclusion of widespread voter intimidation and passed a resolution that gave the seat to the Republicans.","To verify the Republican's claim of voter intimidation, officials interviewed numerous voters representing both parties and the evidence showed the KKK did prevent Republicans from reaching the polls. George McMichael, a former slave from Coffee County, reported that he returned home after voting for the Republican ticket and found the Klan waiting for him.  They tied him down on a log and whipped him two hundred times.  An African American by the name of Washington Ore testified that The Klan surrounded his home, but he escaped by jumping through his window. He said, they shot two shots at me, but did not hit me at that time. When he returned to his house, his crops were torn to pieces in retaliation for his Republican vote.  Although the Klan was a small organization that was unpopular in the early 1870s,  the organization gained strength and helped the Democrats win back the state government  by the late 1870s. ","Horace Maynard and the Republicans' effort to secure black voting rights in Tennessee was a political struggle in a divided region. The emergence of seven thousand new black voters threatened to break the even division between Republicans on the eastern part of the state and the agricultural interests of middle Tennessee.  Tennessee had a history as a moderate state before the Civil War when it voted for the Constitutional Union Party candidate John Bell instead of the Democrats. The same radical group of Democrats that pushed the moderate state of Tennessee into the Civil War, turned to violence in the postwar years to prevent a Republican advantage. Each party tried to forcefully keep the other away from the polls.  George Brunlow disfranchised the old Democrats until 1867. Once the Democrats, returned to the polls, Brunlow reluctantly gave African Americans the right to vote in order to solidify Republican power.  Tennessee was the first state in the South to take the monumental step to allow African Americans to vote.  When the Klan desperately resorted to violence and intimidation to gain a political advantage, Governor Brunlow, refused to certify the results in Tillman vs. Sheafe election.  He stated,  the votes cast for a candidate are illegal and his election void and that the KKK have used violence and other means of intimidation to deter legal voters from exercising franchisement.  With a slim majority threatened, Republicans fought to secure black voting rights for political reasons rather than the moral cause of equality.  Similarly, the Klan showed that they were not primarily motivated by race when they attacked large numbers of white and black Republicans.  Tennessee Republicans were more concerned with building new industry than the impoverished condition of African Americans that did not improve under their administration.  Republicans knew that the Party of Lincoln did not need to help African Americans to guarantee their votes on election day.

Having previously come from a rural town, John Wise was mocked by his schoolmates for being a provincial bumpkin.  However, most of the abuse from his fellow students was due to his father's political persuasion as a Democrat.  In one particular passage of his writing, he recounted how his days as a schoolboy in Richmond were comprised of deflecting taunts, and fighting off bullying from the sons of Whig and Know-Nothing citizens who were instilled with a hatred of all things Democrat.  At this time, the Whigs had essentially joined forces with the new American, or Know-Nothing Party, against the Democrats.  Many of Henry Wise's votes had come from the rural Virginia farmers and yeoman, while Richmond itself was a stronghold of Know-Nothingism.  "," The American Party, also known as the Know-Nothings, began in 1855.  It was founded along the lines of a secret society with elaborate initiation rituals, and a series of secret passwords and coded communications between its members.  Its platform was essentially radical nationalism that included anti-immigration and anti-Catholicism stances.  As the Whig party began to slowly loose strength in the United States, members often threw their allegiance to the Know-Nothing Party in an attempt to continue fighting the Democrats.  The Know-Nothings took power in some Northern states, and were so strong in Richmond that Democrats were referred to as The Spartan Band there."],"display_date":"November 1, 1855 - January 30, 1856","search_date":"1855-12-15","locations":[{"id":14218,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2580,"title":"Mr. Taney&#39;s Ominous Dinner\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-09-09","end_date":"1834-09-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Founded under James Madison, the Second Bank of the United Stated remained a source of controversy until its demise in 1836. President Andrew Jackson, who prided himself on improving the lives and representing the interests of the common white man, objected to the Second Bank of the United States and sought to destroy it. Roger Taney, the newly appointed Secretary of the Treasury and a firm believer in Jacksonian principles sponsored a dinner in Cecil County to increase Jacksonian electoral support in the upcoming Maryland state elections. The <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported that over 500 supporters of Andrew Jackson gathered in Cecil, Maryland to honor the political activist, Roger Taney. Taney warned the supporters of the great threat of the Second Bank of the United States and stated that the battle was almost over. Mr. Taney concluded his speech with these words: recollect at the ensuing elections, [to determine] whether the Bank or the People would rule this happy country. However, Taney's message would only resonate in the small farming communities of Cecil County. "," The Maryland state legislature elections occurred in October, one month after Taney's dinner party. The Baltimore Patriot printed the election results, listing each county name and the number of seats won by the Jacksonian and Whig party. The election allowed members of each party to win up to four seats in each Maryland county. The Jackson Republicans won four seats in the heavily agrarian county of Cecil, where Jacksonian principles may have influenced their vote. Southern counties in Maryland, such as Talbot, Somerset, Dorchester, and Worchester County elected Whig party members to fill the majority of their seats. With support from most of the counties in Maryland, the Whigs held an overwhelming majority of 77 to 18 in the state legislature. According to historians Richard Walsh and William Fox, many of the Maryland voters in the state election were sympathetic to the Bank of the United States and disliked Jackson and Taney's fiscal policies. The Second Bank of the United States thrived from the tax revenue deposited by the federal government. Working with Roger Taney, Jackson strategically removed funds from the Second Bank of the United States and placed the revenue into local pet banks to lessen the power of the Bank. However Jackson and Taney's plan led to economic instability and recession in Maryland and other areas in the South. After the election one southern Maryland Whig supporter stated in the Baltimore Patriot that the experiment [removal of the deposits] works badly. Mr. Taney does not keep the wheels well greased.   The Bank and the economic policies of the Andrew Jackson divided the Jackson Republican strong hold in the South.

Thomas McKee was an official in the Charlottesville school district in 1874. McKee handled funding both for the district's African American school and for the white school. He was puzzled to discover that the African American school received less funding in 1874 than its number of students was supposed to receive. McKee wrote D.P Powers, the local Superintendent of Schools explaining the discrepancy, reminding the Superintendent that the district's white school which had a smaller enrollment, experienced no such funding shortfall. At the end of the letter, McKee humbly deferred to the judgment of the Superintendent, perhaps because he knew further agitation would not help and might hurt the black school's budget. Virginia was redeemed by the white supremacist Democratic Party in 1873, the year before the funding disparity. Assuming that the funding shortfall stemmed from the race of the black students because McKee did not press the issue, he uncovered a form of discrimination which became increasingly common as Reconstruction ended. Though McKee may have been dedicated to providing the public schools, black and white, with their necessary funding, somehow a black school under his charge did not receive the funding it needed. ","Many white southerners in the wake of the Civil War continued to believe that African Americans were beneath them in the social hierarchy. In addition, fear of African Americans taking revenge on white southerners for slavery spurred the creation of Black Codes by short-lived provisional governments dominated by southern whites, which heavily regulated African Americans daily activities. The Fourteenth Amendment ended many of the Black Codes, but not the racism that created them. Thus fear of African Americans led to a need to subjugate them, and even while under the military governors' installed during Reconstruction, white southerners kept these intentions in mind. They argued that blacks lacked the education to be responsible voters, and did everything in their power to keep African Americans from gaining such an education. ","However, the Fourteenth Amendment required equal treatment under the law, so rather than eliminate education for African Americans white southerners undermined it, such as in cases like A. Thomas McKee's in Charlottesville. The southern state legislatures gained substantial black membership once black voters were protected by U.S. troops from intimidation. These more liberal legislatures spread public education throughout the South. Schools were segregated, but blacks increasingly accepted half-way measures such as these over nothing at all. Even Frederick Douglass believed that segregated education was the best that southern blacks could hope for. Nonetheless, freed slaves had an extraordinary desire to seek education, because they knew this was the best route out of the poverty and ignorance in which they were taken advantage of by whites. ","Southern white racism stymied these efforts however, because as Reconstruction ended southern whites gained control over the funding of black public schools. They saw education as a threat to keeping blacks subordinate to whites in society, as educated blacks would be more likely to seek better wages and working conditions. The Ku Klux Klan expressed the most violent form of this white prejudice, terrorizing the black community if members tried to improve their lives. The Klan even committed murder in order to maintain white supremacy. ","The Compromise of 1877 officially ended Reconstruction, as Pres. Rutherford Hayes withdrew all remaining Federal troops from the states of the former Confederacy, which took away the last glimmer of protection enjoyed by blacks. A. Thomas McKee's experience was important because it demonstratedone small part of atrend typical across the South as Reconstruction came to a close, the increasingly blatant campaign of white southerners to subordinate blacks to whites in society. Education played a key role because just as freed slaves understood that it was their best route out of poverty and ignorance, so too did white southerners, who consequently did everything in their power to undermine black education.

The women recorded how they sat at the courthouse for many hours in very hot temperatures just to see the bill that they supported pass through the legislators. They sent flowers down to the representatives who were supportive of temperance and prayed together that it would pass. After the bill passed, the women made sure that they were on record saying that the Women's Christian Temperance Union [was] bitterly opposed to the wine and cider clause and really was aiming for complete prohibition. Thus, the women in this group were successful in getting temperance put in place but did not achieve total prohibition.","Evangelism had an important impact on society in Georgia during this time period. Christian women had joined together to form the Women's Christian Temperance Union to try to promote temperance in society. As Cooper and Terill noted in their book, <em>The American South: A History</em>, Southern women formed groups within their religious organizations and used them as a means for protest and actions against a whole range of social ills. The Christian women in Georgia began their social protest against alcohol. Jeannie Whayne writes in her chapter that the historian Anne Firor Scott thought that the formation of women's groups allowed them more power and the ability to influence movements in the Progressive Era. Thus, women were beginning to play a larger role in society and were beginning to impact their government. Instead of allowing men to make all of their legal decisions for them and staying within the realm of the household, women were joining groups together and influencing legislation. According to Whayne's chapter, the historian Jean Friedman feels that the evangelical nature of society initially hindered women in their pursuit for more gender equality since, for example, women had to give all fundraising revenue to the men in the church. It is significant that Southern women were able to overcome the patriarchal practices of the South in order to form women's groups that could influence the government. Women were forced to take a more active role in their households after their communities were destroyed in the war. This activity carried out of their households and into the community and even politics.

The Georgia Democrats met on August 25, 1876 to discuss their common ideals. The speakers emphasized that Georgia had always adhered to the old constitution and have continued to be patriotic to the antebellum union government. They also criticized the Republicans for inflicting the South with Reconstruction policies. They were angry with how harshly the Republicans had treated southerners after the Civil War and encouraged Democrats to stay united in spite of the Republicans' offenses. Blaming the poor state of the nation on northern Republicans, they highlighted the Southern qualities of intelligence, virtue, and property that would make the Democrats' control of the country better. ","There was animosity in the South toward the northern Republicans, due to the fact that the Republicans were their opposition in the Civil War, ended the system of slavery, and imposed harsh policies in Reconstruction. The policies of Reconstruction did not improve the economy enough for the whole South. People were devastated by the war and had to establish a new system of making a living for themselves without slaves. Historian Eric Foner observed that the failure to produce tangible benefits among freedmen produced growing disillusionment with the Republicans throughout the South. The Republicans only offered limited aid to struggling Southerners when they were in great need of it. Whites and blacks both felt that their lives were not improved by Reconstruction and resented the Republican Party. ","Since this rally took place in August of a major election year, the Democrats were probably trying to gather support as election time got closer. The Democrats felt that they had an opportunity to reclaim power due to the economic Panic of 1873 and the scandals that occurred under the presidency of Grant. According to William H. Rehnquist, accounts of the time show that people guessed about the outcome and were prepared for a close vote, but scarcely anyone guessed just how close it would be. The Democrats were correct to try to get as much support as possible. The Republican candidate won the election by only one electoral vote and a conflict erupted in the nation over the possibility of counting votes wrong. The Compromise of 1877 allowed the Republicans to keep the presidency as long as they ended Reconstruction. Thus, this was an important election year in ending Reconstruction in the South when it was important for the Democrats to try to rally as much support as possible."],"display_date":"August 25, 1876","search_date":"1876-08-25","locations":[{"id":1821,"lat":33.7862251516,"lng":-84.4230424472,"zoom":10,"place":"FULTON, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2666,"title":"Seeing Conflict in Atlanta\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-01-01","end_date":"1875-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A traveler through Atlanta noted that there were many problems in Atlanta's society. He saw political corruption especially in the Governor's office. The governor was suspected of having unethical intentions with the State railroad. He seemed to have had financial investments in the railroad that benefited him greatly, but he observed that overall the railroad benefited everyone in the state. The traveler judged that Reconstruction [had] been a complete failure there due in part to the controversy in the city. ","After the Civil War, Republicans designed policies intended to increase the productivity of the South and industrialize the area. Eric Foner noted that the Southern law...was redesigned so as to encourage the free flow of capital in the South for industrialization. These policies left the state governments that were controlled by Republicans in charge of distributing the capital in ways to improve the economy. This made the situation more complicated by creating opportunities for corruption. According to Lewis Nicholas Wynne, people in Governor Bullock's office had the opportunity to accept bribes and Bullock was able to use the capital to reward loyal followers as patronage, which made many people suspicious of corruption in his policies. Democrats were unhappy with the Republicans because of their supposedly corrupt practices and the harsh policies of Reconstruction. The political tensions between both parties made it easy to start accusing people of corrupt practices, especially the governor.","Railroads were the focus of Southerners' attention during the years after Reconstruction. According to the research of Edward Ayers, there were many reasons why the railroads had such an impact on society. First, he showed that the creation of railroads that would stretch across the country created the need for making time zones and creating a standard time. Also, he noted that the railways were important for bringing commerce to the South that created new towns. This commercial aspect of Southern towns made them more similar to Northern towns and allowed them to assimilate with the rest of the nation. Another impact that Ayers noted was the creation of segregation laws concerning the railways. White men disapproved of the idea of black men being able to sit near white women because of the threat of sexuality between whites and blacks. Thus, Ayers wrote, the more closely linked to sexuality, the more likely was a place to be segregated.

Boles, the desire for survival was more important than the national cause of the Confederacy.As the Federal forces overran and decimated the Cotton South, many southern soldiers recognized the nearing defeat.Boles notes that the plummeting morale and the looming defeat led many southerners to desert the army.Joe Gray Taylor states that many Louisiana soldiers deserted the Confederate cause shortly after the Union army dominated southern strongholds.White southerners chose between protecting one's family at home or fighting in the Rebel army.Sharitt himself yearned for honor in warfare but recognized that his family's honor and livelihood were of supreme importance.","--J.R."],"display_date":"December 4, 1864 - December 31, 1865","search_date":"1865-06-18","locations":[{"id":5635,"lat":31.2197514707,"lng":-92.724986908,"zoom":8,"place":"RAPIDES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2719,"title":"The Post-War Union and Reflective Poetry\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-09-14","end_date":"1873-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" The famous poem by Francis Miles Finch entitled The Blue and the Grey commemorates soldiers who fought for both sides during the Civil War.<em>The Planters' Banner,</em> a local newspaper of Franklin, LA, published this poem on September 14, 1867.William T. Palfrey included the memorial poem in his plantation diary.The poem contrasts the North and the South, the robings of glory (the North) and the gloom of defeat (the South), and the dead and the living.Images of death and the grave beneath the sod and the dew run throughout.The poem also paints the vivid, gory picture of warfare, describing the flow of inland river where the iron fleets had once traversed and the grass beneath which soldiers lie in their graves.The rivers are no longer sullied by the red flow of soldiers' blood, and now flowers bloom around the scenes of battle.The poem shows life after war: it transitions from the gloom of defeat into a sunny spring day full of blossoms blossoming for all.While the seasons change and the weather varies, the Love and tears for the Blue, Tears and love for the Grey remain."," The poem memorializes the soldiers who fought and died for both sides; sentimental poems remember these fallen heroes.Yet, The Blue and the Grey challenges the pointlessness of the war itself, probing, Sadly, but no with upbraiding, The generous deed was done, In the storm of the years are fading, No braves battle was won.To Finch, little honor came from the Civil War, merely death for soldiers fighting for their causes.The poem paradoxically and simultaneously eulogizes and glorifies the Civil War in its pointless destruction and its grandiose battles. In memoriam of these soldiers of both the Union and Confederate armies, Finch paints a picture of common loss, equal splendor, and the remembrance of soldiers by visiting their graves."," Finch's poem was written to honor the universality of mourning in the North and South in the years preceding the war's end.Through the acknowledgment of mutual sympathies, he epitomized the new national tradition of memorializing the soldiers.According to David W. Blight, the poem was published in<em> The Atlantic Monthly</em> in Boston, and was very popular. Recitals of the poem continued for years to come at Decoration Days and Blue-Gray reunions.At these events, men and especially women commemorated the lost soldiers by visiting and decorating gravesites, convening at graveyards, and holding communal memorial services to honor those who fought for either side.Thepoem reflects the emerging reunionism that these events created.By 1866, southerners had founded memorial associations, with a majority of their constituents being women.These Memorial Days, described in detail by Blight, grew in popularity, and the North soon had their own."," Memorialization intertwined with civic life.Blight reveals that the memorial days were a means of coping with Reconstruction and its debilitating consequences on the South.In a different way, memorial days were a small tie to the ideals white southerners had been forced to desert in their defeat and in Reconstruction.Not only had slavery ceased to exist, but also the Confederacy, their nation of four years, faded with Robert E. Lee's 1865 surrender.According to Charles Vincent, the end of the war saw the end of the world as they knew it.Demoralization and social dislocation encompassed many white southerners' post-war lives.Some southerners still held on to their unique southern identity.Blight narrates that in John A. Bilmer claimed, The world had <em>conceded</em> to Southern courage, Southern devotion, Southern skills, and Southern power, as displayed in that war.Southern citizens still lived under the reign of Reconstruction and felt the aftermath and destruction caused by the war.Memorializing dead Rebel soldiers was a way of channeling this grief into a positive source, visiting the graveyards and battlefields in order to move forward, like Finch challenges his readers."," The North, too, began eulogizing the dead Union soldiers in much the same way.According to Blight, in May 1868 and 1869, General John A. Logan, commander-in-chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, asked for all Union veterans to honor the dead soldiers by conducting ceremonies and visiting gravesites.Northern memorials grew to encapsulate fallen southerners as well as black and Union soldiers.Finch's poem was a stepping stone to a reunified nation.","--J.R."],"display_date":"September 14, 1867 - December 31, 1873","search_date":"1870-11-06","locations":[{"id":5519,"lat":32.1808059275,"lng":-91.7158468561,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2720,"title":"Feelings of Dissent in Alabama\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-05-16","end_date":"1850-05-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1849, each state in the Union was allotted one stone in the newly constructed Washington Monument, on which it was to put its name along with a brief inscription. The inscription chosen by Governor Chapman of Alabama read as follows: Alabama. A union of equality, as adjusted by the Constitution. This dedication was authorized by the Alabama General Assembly on December 4, 1849. ","The editor of the <em>Huntsville Democrat</em>, a newspaper based in Madison County, Alabama, responded to the Governor's inscription on the stone in his May 16 editorial. In his column, the editor expressed many of the same sentiments toward the Union that the stone's inscription had implied. He expressed his belief in a Union of equality, in which sovereign states were bound together by mutual interests and the obligations set out by the Constitution. Under these precepts, he felt that each state should not have to sacrifice its own identity and beliefs at the expense of the national majority. To illustrate his point, the editor used an analogy comparing the states in the Union to the stones which made up the Washington Monument. He argued that each state, like the individual stones of the monument, could act as its own separate entity maintaining its own identity and still be incorporated as a part of the larger whole. ","The motto on the Alabama stone of the Washington Monument and the editorial in the <em>Huntsville Democrat</em> alluded to growing sectionalism in the United States. This sectionalism was agitated by the possibility of Congress limiting the practice of slavery in the new territories acquired in the aftermath of the Mexican-American War. According to the authors of <em>Alabama: The History of a Deep South State</em>, the people of Alabama interpreted the United States policy against slavery as an attack on their individual rights as a sovereign state. These sentiments serve to reflect the strict constructionist ideology of many Southerners who believed that since the Constitution did not directly grant the Federal Government control over the issue of slavery, all decisions concerning the institution should be delegated to the States. The editor of the Huntsville Democrat clearly echoed this perspective in his May 16 article. The growing antipathy towards the Union was prevalent not only in Alabama but also in other states across the South.

The next day, Harding could not take her mind off this gentleman, who she admitted to having second thoughts about.Her friends wondered if it was acceptable of her to be speaking with a northerner who had lived in the South for only a few years before the Civil War began.She, however, convincingly rationalized her fondness for this former northern gentleman.First, he had fought and been injured at the battle of Shiloh (fighting for the Confederate army) and was the son of an Episcopal clergyman.She viewed these qualities as honorable and pleasant.In addition, Harding described the man as a good southerner with elegant manners and courtesy.Harding delighted in this chance encounter with a handsome gentleman during her stressful refuge in DeSoto Parish."," According to William J.

Terrill, southern society heavily felt the impact of the Civil War, but as the war continued, faith in the southern cause turned into hopelessness.Harding was despairing at the fate of the Confederacy and yearning to return back to her plantation home in St. Mary's Parish, LA.Cooper and Terrill claim that the status of women also changed greatly, and women of every class had to adapt to the changing social and economic environment, as evidenced by Harding's own sacrifices during the war years.Harding, like other southern women, gained more independence not only physically and economically, but also in her mental capacities.She made up her own mind about this man, disregarding what her peers and family members thought of this charming man.Her social position, as a southern woman with certain expected principles, directly conflicted with her human attraction to this unique visitor.","--J.R."],"display_date":"October 17, 1863 - November 5, 1863","search_date":"1863-10-26","locations":[{"id":5496,"lat":32.0554385592,"lng":-93.7372826293,"zoom":9,"place":"DE SOTO, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2725,"title":"Taxes and Their Uses\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-01","end_date":"1895-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" In 1895 Mr. Thomas Brown paid his taxes to S.B. Hardwick, who was the treasurer of Westmoreland County, Virginia at that time. During that time, everyone had to pay one dollar to the state and fifty cents to the county per head. Taxes were based on every one hundred dollars worth of property. For example, it was thirty cents for state tax, ten cents for state school tax, and fifteen cents for road tax. Mr. Thomas Brown had 945 dollars worth of property, so he paid thirteen dollars in state tax, 3.97 dollars in state school tax, and 5.83 dollars in road tax. The government collected these taxes to pay for education, improvements in the town, and other public expenditures. Even with these taxes, Virginia was deeply in debt. "," The decade before the 1890s, Virginia pushed itself continuously further into debt as the Conservative party refused to stray from the Funding Act, even in spite of the evil name attached to the origins of the Funding Act, according to C. Vann Woodward. To try to compensate for the debt in other areas, the Funders bilked money from public schools, leaving the schools without proper funding. In the South, the public schools were 1.5 million dollars in debt, which forced many of them not to reopen the following years. By 1890, the monetary expenditure per student had slowly increased to 81 percent from 59.5 percent in 1871. The money expended augmented to about 97 cents, an increase for the South, but was still less than the 2.24 dollars for the country as a whole. Public schools suffered from this deficiency in funding, and the school termed shortened and did not reach its highest average again until 1900.

Hume, the Arkansas convention was unique, however, because it contained extensive debates about the role of race.The Civil War raged on, yet Arkansas was already underway of Reconstruction and improving race relations.Jesse N. Cypert, a southern white man from White County, pressed for ratification of a constitution excluding black suffrage, while William H. Grey, a black from Phillips County, advocated for black suffrage.Grey's arguments were rational, thought provoking, and supported by substantial evidence, and the convention approved black suffrage.Grey was treated as a gentleman and, at least in this convention, as an equal.The reigning president insisted that Grey be addressed Mr. ----, from ---- County the same way that the white delegates were addressed.Cypert's excuse for unequal address was that He had spoken of him as a negro, because he was such."," This rationale of racial equality reflects much of the Reconstruction South; it was hard for white southerners to abandon suddenly all previous prejudices.Yet, Grey proved his intelligence and deserved respect through his long oration on the reasons blacks deserved the right to vote.He based the majority of this argument on the idea that poor white southerners were worse off than many African Americans.To convince his peers of this idea, he quoted many South Carolina politicians and a Georgia judge who questioned the ignorance of these poor whites.For example, he quotes William Gregg who, in 1851, stated to the South Carolina Institute that he put[s] down the white people, who ought to work, and who do not, or who are so employed as to be wholly unproductive of State.Grey points out that blacks wanted to work and be productive members of society, yet this ignorant group of white southerners was granted more rights than his own race."," The Reconstruction Acts of March 1867 forced southern states to comply with the North to attain readmission to the Union.Hume notes that Arkansas was one of the former rebellious states to undergo a Constitutional Convention to discuss politics and bridge together opposing factions.Among these factions was the meeting of whites and blacks in a political sphere for the first time since emancipation.This instance shows the small, successful steps made during Reconstruction for black suffrage in a southern state; at the Arkansas Constitutional Convention, Grey epitomized the intelligent free black who desired large changes in southern society.According to John B. Boles, white southerners varied along class lines, and the poor white yeoman farmer or the poor white southerner were in a class separate from the slave-owning farmer or plantation owner.Boles narrates that their economic situation resulted in less education, and poor white southerners suffered substantially during the Civil War years.Using the inequality of whites along intellectual and socio-economic lines, Grey aptly proved to his peers African Americans' right to both respect and suffrage.Grey supported his arguments about blacks' deserved equality by exposing the contradictions in southern society.His victory over a bigoted Cypert was a victory not only for Arkansas, but also for African Americans who were now free and struggling with their newfound emancipation in a discriminatory nation.Such minor victories would be hope for blacks across the South, as acts of injustice dominated southern society for years to come.","--J.R."],"display_date":"March 1, 1867 - January 30, 1868","search_date":"1867-08-15","locations":[{"id":712,"lat":34.5311279044,"lng":-90.7753398937,"zoom":9,"place":"PHILLIPS, Arkansas"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2734,"title":"Agricultural Advances\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-10-19","end_date":"1876-10-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" It was October and the farmers belonging to the Piedmont Agricultural Society had gathered to hear a speech from Mr. William Fullerton.

He also reminded the farmers to make sure they were rotating their crops so they were not depleting the soil of the nutrients they were attempting to restore. Next to God, he pointed out, agriculture was a vital part of human life, especially in the South.

According to Michael Perman, farmers were no longer making enough profit and the economy was out of balance. Many were pushing aside interests in agriculture at the same time that self-reliance and independence were becoming more important for the individual farmers. Things had gotten so bad that the governments had to step in and they were proposing remedies, new techniques of farming, and advising the farmers on improving their attitudes in regards to farming. As Perman points out, when the government got involved with agriculture, especially the Democratic Party, claiming that cultivation had to become more efficient and more up to date, even things like elections were influenced over the issue of agriculture. Since the Democratic leaders were perceived as better at advising farmers on these techniques to improve their farming methods, the farmers who followed this advice began to actually see change, and this influenced them to vote for the Democratic Party.

McConnell, 647 black men chose to enlist in the First Arkansas Infantry and their Union patriotism is evident in this song.Black soldiers fought in the same war, and they deserved the same respect.The Song of the First Arkansas recognizes their patriotism, bravery, and desire to end slavery in order to attain rights and equality in their nation."," The enslaved people were eager to end slavery, recognizing that the myth of the patriarchy of slaveholders was false.The song illustrates how incorrect the pro-slavery argument that slaves benefited the most from slavery.The lyrics show white slaveholders' oppression of black emancipation, describing When we heard de proclamation, massa hush it as he will.Yet, these black soldiers took the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 literally and wanted to fight to emancipate the slaves of all the southern slaveholding states.According to McConnell, songs in the Civil War evoked enthusiasm and motivated soldiers to fight.The black soldiers remembered the oppression of their fellow blacks and had even more reason to stand up for the abolitionist cause.According to John O. Allen and Clayton E.

Furthermore, Cooper paints the picture that this was one of the largest deflationary periods seen yet in the United States where prices fell by one half between the years of 1865 and 1898.

Delivered by Benjamin Morgan Palmer of the First Presbyterian Church, this sermon advocated southern secession in defense of its providential trust to perpetuate slavery. Palmer believed that slaves were by nature incapable of self government and dependent upon their masters for protection. Dr. Palmer's reasoning is sound, sensible, and Christian to Wadley who yearned for the South's fighting for the patriarchal cause of slavery. Dr. Palmer justified slavery through the patriarchy of a white slaveholder who protected the dependent slave. Wadley's opinions were typical of the Lower South during the days after Abraham Lincoln's presidential election, and sectionalism grew quickly and passionately, even in women's minds. According to Samuel S. Hill and Charles H. Lippy, Palmer's sermons on slavery, namely this famous oration, led to his position as the elected moderator of the first General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of the Confederate States of America. Wadley listened to Palmer with attentiveness and respect; she, like many other white southerners, believed in the doctrine of slavery as a divine right from God granted to the South. Wadley relates another sermon from a Dr. Lord, which summarizes the mistaken piety of abolitionists in their attempts to emancipate enslaved people from southern masters. Dr. Lord derived his preaching from Isaiah, and he condemned those who setting up their own judgement and their own code of morals instead of religion, and the scriptures, condemn that which has been sanctioned both by the bible, and by ancient usage. This sermon reflects the religious doctrine of southern clergymen prior to and possibly during the Civil War. Wadley had faith in what Palmer and Lord preached under the sanction of their church and under God."],"display_date":"November 29, 1860 - December 4, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-01","locations":[{"id":5608,"lat":32.4685930803,"lng":-92.1385872026,"zoom":9,"place":"OUACHITA, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2744,"title":"Southern Baptists Demand Total Prohibition\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-03-29","end_date":"1883-03-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 29, 1883, the Baptist journal, <em>Christian Index,</em> implored the citizens of Talladega   County, Alabama to support the outlaw of alcohol trafficking.  In 1881, Talladega  County proposed a vote on the outlaw of alcohol consumption and the African American population allegedly voted in a bloc against the prohibition. The article blamed the African American population for the failure of passing prohibition in the county.  As the surrounding counties of Clay, Calhoun, St. Clair, and Shelby had previously outlawed the sale of alcohol, the Christians of Talladega County feared their county would be overrun with the scum and scuff of the other counties if they did not enact the same prohibition.  The Baptists of Talladega County greatly feared the community would become a cesspool of drinking and crime, as the only county in the area to permit alcohol sale and consumption.  Thus, the Baptists of Talladega County beseeched the community to protect their region from alcohol consumption and its consequences by outlawing alcohol trafficking in the county.","The <em>Christian Index</em> emphasized the depraved nature of drunkenness and the tendency for indulgence in spirits to encourage crime and lewd behavior, suggesting that those who consumed alcohol were depraved criminals and delinquents.  Thus, the article's accusation that the African American community voted in a bloc against the prohibition measure suggested that African Americans were depraved for their desire to drink alcohol or protect the right to do so.  As they vehemently condemned alcohol consumption, the <em>Christian Index </em>rebuked the African Americans in Talladega County for their part in the prohibition's failure.","The Baptists' fear of Talladega County's inevitable degeneration through alcohol consumption supports historian Robert Handy's argument that nineteenth-century Baptists believed that drunkenness was the cardinal sin of the land.  According to Handy, total prohibition was the primary and ultimate Southern Baptist position by the 1880's.  Historian Edward Ayers also argues that whites believed blacks were swing voters on the issue of prohibition, but black voters did not actually vote consistently against prohibition. The article portrays whites' view of African Americans as swing voters, as the writer condemned the African Americans for altering the outcome of the election.  Ayers argues that whites gave black voters a great deal of credit when dry forces won because of their perception of blacks as swing voters.  Nevertheless, the black voters were also held responsible when the dry forces lost.  In Talladega County, African American voters were blamed and denounced for the failure of the prohibition statute."],"display_date":"March 29, 1883","search_date":"1883-03-29","locations":[{"id":373,"lat":33.3761980073,"lng":-86.1510233984,"zoom":9,"place":"TALLADEGA, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2758,"title":"The Despotism of Jefferson Davis\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-03-24","end_date":"1863-03-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Confederate government extended its legislative powers to all spheres. The Raleigh Standard urged North Carolina citizens to take precautions against the Confederacy?s encroachments. A bill introduced in the Confederate Senate allowed the government to impress all the cotton in the Confederate States and then paid for it in Confederate bonds at fifteen cents per pound. In an attempt to pay its debts, the government in Richmond would have a monopoly of the cotton trade. Reminiscent of a centralized despotism, the government possessed the ability to take the property of the citizen in order to trade and make a profit on it. In order to preserve the safety of the people, citizens sought restrictions on those in power. This bill exceeded the Confederate government?s right of eminent domain or inherent sovereign power. North Carolinians wanted to preserve the Constitution their ancestors fought for; this goal was reached through vigilance over those in power.","Citizens of North Carolina protested against the despotism that would undermine their Constitutional liberties. As a result of the encroachment by the leaders in Richmond, North Carolina became increasingly dissatisfied with the Confederacy. Governor Vance and others led the fight by fiercely defying the prospect of a unified southern despotism and objecting to Jefferson Davis? dictatorial power and his ability to centralize war measures. Southerners contested Davis? ability to suppress the ancient principle of states? rights; they feared a fundamental change in their way of life and in the rights they possessed. During this time, the Confederacy suffered a series of devastating losses, thus diminishing the popularity of Jefferson Davis even more. ","This episode demonstrates how the discontent that spread through North Carolina, amplified the lack of governing continuity throughout the Confederacy. Even to Northerners, the South did not represent a solid block, but rather a combination of individual states with differing attitudes towards the composition of the South. With the largest circulation of any newspaper in the state, the Raleigh Standard apparently reflected the views of a substantial percentage of North Carolina public opinion. Several other newspapers and contemporary historian J. Cutler Andrews accused the Raleigh Standard of fostering defeatism, low morale, and widespread desertion among the North Carolina troops in Lee?s army. The Confederacy lacked the unity and the commitment to nationalism necessary to win the Civil War.

They argued that being a slave holder was, in fact, an agonizing personal burden. The American Colonization Society said that not only was being a slave holder overly demanding, but simply freeing slaves was impossible. Whites and blacks could never live together in a peaceful society. The need to expatriate slaves demonstrated the obvious racism in the United States.

In the introduction, the authors stated that their intention was to give people seeking a new home a brief description of the area and the advantages it offers as one of the foremost cities of the South. Throughout the book, they gave detailed accounts of various aspects of the county, including its public and private facilities, advantages and needs, and its relation to the state as a larger whole in terms of its products, climate, government, and people. "," When the handbook begins discussing the people of Durham, it mentions the negro population, and states that it was largely descended from former slaves, but the importation of those forced laborers was very rare at the beginning of the 18th century onwards. The authors then attributed the large number of blacks in the area to natural causes such as a healthy climate, a humane public system, and the kindly tempers of the owner They stated that African Americans were happy to stay within the state because of the affection shown to them by their previous masters. Since slaves' emancipation, the book claimed African Americans have been shown absolute equal rights, with the exception of the slightly larger poll-tax and property tax, which the writers attributed to their population within the state, not their particular race. When discussing suffrage later in the hand-book, the authors explained why African Americans are withheld from administering to the law themselves as magistrates. It is because, explained the authors, blacks have just been released from slavery and are therefore ignorant of the duties of citizenship. This, the authors claimed, is for everyone's safety, including the colored man. "," This extract is a commentary on the county of Durham that reveals a great deal about their identity. The Educator Company explains current race relations and demographics with a history of the treatment of African Americans, and claims that Durham is a harmonious community now because it has always been so, even in the times of slavery. This belief, as well as the reasoning behind the disenfranchisement of African American's rights, is representative of many other counties' and states' racial ideologies in the South at the turn of the 19th century. "," At this point in time, several southern states were passing laws or constitutional amendments depriving black citizens of their right to vote, or at least making it very difficult to do so. Jim Crow laws were also very popular, and North Carolina was on the brink of adopting the separate but equal statute following the Plessy v. Ferguson trial. Finally, a ruthless white-supremacy campaign launched in 1898 completed a decade of setbacks for African Americans living in North Carolina. This second-class citizenship was adopted by local, state, and national legislatures, and indeed, the vast majority of Americans. However, despite these obstacles, the black community still focused on improving their condition and bettering their community. Contrasting to the Educator Company's opinion of the political ignorance of African Americans, many of them became involved with and supported the newly formed Fusion political party, a combination of Populists and Republicans."],"display_date":"1895 - 1896","search_date":"1896-01-01","locations":[{"id":9427,"lat":36.0420245844,"lng":-78.889350822,"zoom":10,"place":"DURHAM, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2778,"title":"The New Textile Industry in Athens, Georgia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-11","end_date":"1849-01-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Cotton farming had reached great heights in Georgia by the mid-1800's but some saw that there was still room to grow in the cotton business. Though most of their neighbors were engaged in farming, twenty citizens of Athens, Georgia decided to break the mold. In January of 1849 they announced in the Athens <em>Southern Banner</em>, that they were joining together to form a new business: The Athens Manufacturing Company. In the announcement the company stated, [we] have associated ourselves together as a body corporate for the purpose of engaging in the business of manufacturing cotton and wool yarns and goods, and yarns and goods of which cotton and wool form component parts, and also of the manufacturing of flour and meal, and the repairing of machinery. ","The Athens Manufacturing Company was one of many new cotton-manufacturing companies established in Georgia during the 1840's. This sudden increase in industrialization was largely due to a series of developments over the early 1800's that came together to create a favorable environment for industry in Georgia. Manufacturing companies in Georgia were beginning to exist, but in 1849 they were still few and far between. It took a significant amount of money to start such a business and not many people could afford such a large investment. In the 1810's the change in national business law helped overcome this obstacle. Before this time, individuals or partners owned most businesses. This changed in the 1810's when the government began to recognize new corporate organizations that were composed of multiple investors. ","This group of investors was willing to take its chance at manufacturing but they needed a source of power for the machines they would use to make the cotton and wool products. During the 1820's, people in Georgia successfully harnessed waterpower, which became the source that provided the power for the Athens Manufacturing Company and other industrial businesses. In order to make a profit from the cotton and wool products, the Athens Manufacturing Company needed customers. Without a sufficiently-sized market such a company was not worth investing in; the number of buyers from Athens and the surrounding counties were not nearly enough to support the company. The rapid improvement of transportation systems across the nation in the early nineteenth century was responsible for increasing the size of markets, especially for inland companies such as this one. The Central Rail Road built in the 1830's provided an artery of transportation from central Georgia where Athens was located, to Savannah, an important national and international port on the Atlantic. ","Though Georgia was at the forefront of the textile industry in the South, the North had a significant head start and continued to dominate the national industry throughout the antebellum period. This regional disparity in strength caused political disagreements between the South and the North. This can be seen in looking at the increased tariff on foreign imported products in 1828, which was referred to in the South as the tariff of abominations. The tariff on foreign products was economically beneficial to American manufacturers, who were mainly found in the North, because overseas competition was decreased and they could raise prices. In the South most people were farmers, not manufacturers, and so the tariff was economically harmful because they had to pay more for manufactured goods. The increased price of manufactured products from the North was one source of motivation for the South to move from an almost entirely agricultural economy to a somewhat industrial one. The Athens Manufacturing Company provides an example of this change.

Logie went before a large gathering of farmers and cotton-growers in the Charlotte and proposed an organization of all cotton-farmers in the area. Under this association, farmers would pool their entire product of that year's growth, sell it as one, and share the dividends. This group would be headed by an elected congress of representative farmers who would create a constitution and by-laws for the agency, which would then create chapters in every state. Each state would be under the same management in terms of buying and selling, and all would be under the direction of the central board of control. "," While it is unknown if Logie obtained much support for his proposal, other alliances between farmers were very popular at this time and experienced much success, both economically and even in the political arena. Charlotte was considered to be one of the predominant Southern towns in the cotton industry. However, throughout the 1880s, agricultural depression had run deeply throughout North Carolina, causing many farmers to declare bankruptcy. Therefore, it is not surprising that Logie decided to propose his plan in this city, where he would find a large concentration of cotton-farmers also wondering at how to improve their economic means. The Farmer's Alliance, an organization founded by a group of farmers in Texas in response to the economic depression that ensued after the Civil War, had been increasing in size and popularity at this time, which likely inspired Logie to suggest a very similar society of farmers. "," The goal of the Farmer's Alliance was to increase the prices of their commodities through collective action in groups of individual farmers, which can be seen in Logie's proposal. The association quickly flourished and began establishing chapters throughout the south that helped white farmers buy goods at wholesale and sell their produce without having to pay a middleman. The organization eventually became involved in politics, and the alliance was later reborn as the Populist Party, centering on the same platform of government control of transportation and communication (which would help curb the powers of monopolies), as well as reforms of currency, land ownership, and tax policies. While historian Robert Hinton noted the ultimate failure of the Farmer's Alliance as an economic movement, their influence throughout the south, both agriculturally and politically, must be recognized as an inspiration to people like Logie who also desired to employ those tactics and attempt to improve the conditions of rural farmers.

Democrats instituted a system of disenfranchisement, by requiring each person to vote in the township in which he resided and by allowing voters to be challenged at the polls. Additionally, Democrats attacked Governor Holden and threatened to impeach him and then dispose of him once the Democrats gain political power.

On Wednesday, October 6, 1897, North Carolina Governor Daniel L. Russell dismissed Otho Wilson, the railroad commissioner, for conspiring with the Southern Railway Company to promote his own economic interest. Wilson did this by appealing to the railway company to stop at his hotel in order to increase the eating-house's business. According to Russell and the witnesses gathered by him to testify against Wilson, this had a negative impact on many businesses in Hickory, North Carolina, the stop that was replaced by Wilson's hotel. The town's only restaurant was forced to close when the train ceased stopping there. Others faced difficulties in transporting or receiving merchandise, and many were inconvenienced by the extra travel now required to reach the closest railroad station. Not only did the effect Wilson's actions had on the town of Hickory warrant his dismissal, but Russell argued that by placing himself under obligations not only to the Southern Railway Company it disqualified him to act as a fair, impartial judge and juror in any controversy that might arise between such corporations and individual citizens. "," A few years later on January 25, 1899, a group of people decided to contest this decision and wrote an appeal to Governor Russell asking for an explanation, as they felt Wilson's dismissal was unjust. Russell responded with a lengthy document that described Wilson's misdeeds and explained how severely he had affected the town of Hickory solely for his own monetary gain. Russell, the first Republican Governor of North Carolina since the end of Reconstruction and the last until 1973, was chastised relentlessly by the Democrats, who took Wilson's indictment for bribery, as well as that of Dr. Moss, the Chairman of the Commissioners of Vance County, to reflect personally upon Russel's legislature since he had originally appointed them to those positions. The Democrats argued that those officials' effects on North Carolina politics and the economies of local towns was unforgivable, and must be corrected with a new Democratic governor. "," This scenario reveals a great deal about both the importance of transportation in South at this time and the politics involved with that institution. At this time, the railroad was the most effective means of transportation throughout the South. As the railroad tracks quickly lengthened, so did the population and industry of places with train stations. Therefore, a railroad commissioner usually made decisions about stopping points with great deliberation because their impact on towns would be considerable, which explains why Wilson's crime was so grave. Also, since railroads were the primary mode of transportation, the politics surrounding them were intense, and as historian Leslie Decker claims, often involved conflicts between political and economic interests. This can be seen in Russell's dilemma and in the reasons cited by the Democrats for his incompetence.

","Thus, when W.W.

They no longer feared negro rule; although black politician Hiram Revels stated, as reprinted by James Wilford Garner, that black voters during reconstruction had been used as mere tools to elect imprudent [and corrupt] men who called themselves Republicans, after 1890, they were no longer used at all. The chivalrous (?) [sic] white Democrats, according to the Cleveland Gazette, were therefore quite content.","Blacks of Mississippi and of the nation as a whole, however, were not pleased. The Atlantic Monthly noted by 1892 that The Fifteenth Amendment is disregarded [in Mississippi] where it is not nullified on the face of the state law. Reporting on this system of Jim Crow law, the Cleveland Gazette noted that the state of Mississippi was referred to by blacks as his Satanic Majesty's abiding place.","The problem, however, was that his Satanic Majesty sometimes left home. According to The Atlantic Monthly, candid Republicans at the North admit that domination by the ignorant blacks of the Gulf States is something to be dreaded. The suppression of the negro vote, wherever such a step is necessary to secure control of the government by the whites, is winked at, if not applauded. For some reason, be it simple racism or otherwise, the 1890 Mississippi constitution made sense to both Democrats and Republicans in both the South and the North.

The President was passing through on his way to Jacksonville, Florida, and he had been expected for a couple days. But finally, on April 5, 1883, his train came through. The train pulled into the station, and while it was clearly an expensive and impressive presidential car, it was not very extravagant. The observation deck made it clear that it was for a prominent statesman. However, even though many people showed up to see him, the President did not get out of his car. He waved from the window, and was dressed well in a top hat and suit. He seemed in a cheerful mood since he smiled at the car from behind the window. The train continued on its way to Florida, and arrived there the next day. Yet it was a big day in Petersburg and many were excited to have caught a glimpse of the President. "," Chester Arthur was the Republican president from 1881-1885 as a result of the assassination of President James A. Garfield. In 1882 the presidency was in shambles, with cabinet positions still waiting to be filled. Corruption was rampant, and the President was restricted by his party and had little real power. Republicans did not do well in the Congressional elections of 1882, and in reaction to this, Arthur signed the Pendleton Reform Bill. This bill began to make some changes towards reform. It created a Civil Service Commission to administer new rules and it made appointments based on an examination. While these reforms were a good beginning, they were not enough. In the beginning of 1883, it was clear that Arthur's chances for winning re-election were slim. The political climate of 1883 was not positive for the President. In general there had been a decline in the prestige of the President in the 1870's and early 1880's as a result of massive corruption and unpopular policies, especially with Reconstruction in the South. Presidents of the late nineteenth century seemed to have no real purpose once they were elected. This lack of purpose gave few results within the government. However, it was clearly still an event to see the leader of the country, even in the South. He had a strong alliance with many in Virginia, including Governor William Mahone. Arthur was one of a string of lackluster Presidents in the postbellum period, yet even with his unimpressive performance, his arrival in town still brought excitement.

Forsythe settled into his library in his Dodge County residence to relax for the night. He was the everyday normal Georgia citizen, working at the Normansdale Lumber Company, managing the estate of Norman Dodge, and even serving as a witness in an ongoing perjury case against another member of the town, Luther A. Hall. No one expected that he would turn up dead hours later. ","Forsythe was shot through the window by a shoeless suspect. Officials initially suspected a burglary. What investigators later discovered was that Forsythe's participation in the Hall case was more involved than imagined. When Hall and four other members of Dodge's elite went to United States Court on December 8 for defrauding Norman Dodge, they also faced criminal charges of conspiracy to assassinate Forsythe. Two of the charged men confessed to their individual responsibilities in the plot and disclosed information about the hired black assassin. Their testimonies gave prosecutors ample evidence to convict each of the five accused men. ","While crime ran out of control across the South in the late nineteenth century, it was not limited to the racial incidents and lynchings that dominated the news. White men and women committed crimes too. Yet these cases were less prominent of an issue at that time because whites faced lesser consequences and publication of their crimes in comparison to blacks. Because racial tension was seeping through the South at this time, the felonies that received the most attention were those performed by blacks or white mobs in lynching. White crimes could squeak by without encountering harsh trials, severe punishments, or public lynchings. In Georgia only 19 whites were lynched in a fifty year span into the twentieth century. That was less than the total number of blacks lynched in Georgia in 1899 alone. While the public lynched blacks for a number of crimes, they lynched whites only in the cases of extreme violence. Class differences existed as well. Of the whites that were mobbed or harshly persecuted in the South, they tended to be vagrants and people without ties to the area and community. Therefore, wealthier citizens that had spent their lives in one place had the respect of their peers and were less likely to be forced into any unpleasant punishment for their crimes. ","Hall's assassination plot was cleverly designed to get rid of a key witness to his original trial without facing the severe consequences of this action. The hired assassin was a black man already wanted for a series of previously committed crimes. He would receive the brunt of the court's and the public's outrage because he was black, and because he was the physical killer. Also, being a well-known and respected lawyer in the area gave Hall the security that a jury of his peers would not be demanding in their sentencing of his trial. In this way, he was able to exploit race and class in order to commit a crime with little penalty."],"display_date":"October 9, 1890 - December 8, 1890","search_date":"1890-11-07","locations":[{"id":1736,"lat":32.1721870425,"lng":-83.1684277696,"zoom":9,"place":"DODGE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2827,"title":"An 1890 Constitutional Convention Role Reversal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-09-01","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the 1890 Constitutional Convention in Jackson, Mississippi, two men, at least, seemed to be on the wrong sides of the color line; Marsh Cook, a white Republican from Jasper County, and Isaiah T. Montgomery, eventually the only black representative at the convention, stood up for things taboo to many in their respective communities. The results of each man's stand not only affected them personally, but also shaped the future of Mississippi for many years to come.","Cook and Montgomery looked back at the years after the Civil War and preceding the 1890 convention and saw the same thing. In 1875, after ten years of Republicans in Mississippi joining forces with blacks, scalawags, and carpetbaggers, resulting in what many white Mississippians referred to as negro rule, it was apparently decided, according to Dunbar Rowland, that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Following an apparently very bloody revolution in which whites took back control (in theory), 15 years of intimidation passed, during which according to James George as printed in the Jackson Clarion Ledger, the method of preserving white supremacy was never entirely satisfactory. Isaiah Montgomery, in his speech during the 1890 convention, described these years in terms of every form of [political] demoralization [for blacks]-bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Although the convention took place under the pretext of, according to Rowland, eliminating ignorance at the ballot box, it was in fact a move to lawfully disenfranchise a majority of black voters by using a poll tax and a literary test in order to establish franchise qualification. According to estimates by Montgomery, the new State Constitution would disenfranchise 11,889 whites and 123,334 blacks in Mississippi. The Cleveland Gazette hoped the unconstitutional and un-American action would be prevented or at least delayed a few years, but it was not to be. ","For his part, and against what would perhaps be expected of a white Mississippian, Marsh Cook, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, took a stand against the principles of the gathering delegation and courageously challenged the Democrats for a seat to the Constitutional Convention in spite of death threats. Isaiah Montgomery did the opposite. As the only black representative to the convention, he took the opportunity to appeal to the good natures of the white representatives and their belief in a Supreme Arbiter, which supposedly would help the two races march together towards new and greater triumphs of progressive civilization. Montgomery apparently recognized the legitimacy of the white demand to rule for their [the whites] own protection, and he foolishly [in retrospect] hoped, by his support of the new constitution and its subsequent passing, that he and other black Mississippians would gain favor in white sight, thus bridging a chasm that has been widening and deepening for a generation He hoped his appeals would lead to the death of the constitutional movement or perhaps, if it passed, an immediate reversal of the new constitution.","Both men failed. Marsh Cook was ambushed and murdered, according to PBS, on a lonely road. The Cleveland Gazette hoped that his murder, being that of a respectable white gentleman, would cause the federal government to take the necessary steps to protect the American citizen at home, be his color what it may. It did not. Montgomery's hopes of racial cooperation also did not materialize. He was lambasted by the Cleveland Gazette, which called his defense of the monstrous franchise provision...a disgrace to the race and to our civilization, and wished he had never been born. For all of their objections, however, Mississippi, and the rest of the South, as many other states followed suit, plunged itself headfirst into a half-century of legal disenfranchisement and discrimination.

After his purchases Isaac wrote to Hayne informing him of what he bought and each items price. His purchases included: 30 men's frock coats, twilled cotton and wool, at forty cents per yard, 12 boys coats, 175 yards of GDB cloth, and 175 yards of wool for women, both at forty eight cents per yard. The bill, which included other clothing materials, amounted to 100.  Isaac makes a defined effort to tell Hayne what materials remained at the same price from his trip the previous year, which was mainly the price per yard of cloth. Isaac did note that there were some increased changes in prices over the past year, to which he asks what the benefits of the Tariff of 1842 were, relating to the effects it had on the price of cloth. ","The Tariff Act of 1842 was passed in response to the Tariff Acts of 1832 and 1833, both of which imposed high duties on goods produced within the United States, including cotton and woolen goods. The Tariff Act of 1833 meant to gradually reduce duty rates, which it did, until 1842, when there was a drastic, forty-two percent drop in rates within a six-month period, down to twenty percent.  Duties were supposed to remain at this rate indefinitely, but only lasted two months, due to a quarrel between the Whig Party and President Tyler, which had caused them to separate.  The Tariff Act of 1842 got caught up in the eventual agreement made between the two, which caused the duties to be higher than the original twenty percent rate.  Consequently, the public was not very enthused about the tariff, as they realized that it did not conform to the wishes of the manufacturers, but rather those of the politicians. ","While the Tariff of 1842 meant to protect the American cotton textile industry, it was not as effective in its actual application. Isaac Hazard asked what the practical effect of the tariff had been, because he had not seen any results from it.  At the time, in comparison to the price of equivalent fabric in Great Britain, domestic fabric in the United States cost twenty percent more.  Despite this, it must be noted that without the tariff many American textile companies would not have survived.  This is because the United State's industry was technologically behind Great Britain's. So, Isaac Hazard's complaint to his boss was largely a lost one, in that while textile prices could have been better than they were there was a cap on how much they could improve.

Harrington, CSA of Franklin County, Mississippi. It seems Mrs. Jones, most likely a widow at the time of her writing (note that it was she and not her veteran husband who penned the request), had been unable to secure the pension entitled to her by state law as the widow of a Confederate soldier. Although, according to Joanna Short, the most common reasons for this were failure to provide sufficient evidence of military service, disability, or poverty, it seems Mrs. Jones was simply having trouble with the paper work; as most people not directly affiliated with armed forces or government usually were (and still are), she had, up until the time of her writing, been stumped as to the proper procedure for filling out the proper forms and thereby obtaining the proper compensation. To this end, she sought the assistance of Major Harrington.","Mrs. Jones' case was not uncommon during the time period. During the period after the Civil War, many states began giving benefits to families of those killed during the conflict. With the backing of the Federal Government, the practice was most prevalent and more generous in the North, as the northern states could better afford to compensate families, but southern states also adopted the practice. Originally, pensions were afforded only to war widows, or wounded soldiers with variable extent of... disability, from 5 per year for the loss of a finger or toe to 150 per year for the loss of two or more limbs or total blindness. Then, according to the U.S. Government National Archives, Mississippi began granting pensions to indigent Confederate veterans or their widows in 1888. In other words, now any veteran who was down on their luck could be compensated, even if the reasons for their hard times were unrelated to the Civil War. ","The reasons for this expansion of benefits, according to Theda Skocpol, were mainly political, as straightforward compensation for wartime disabilities [turned] into fuel for patronage politics. The issue became so pressing nation wide that in 1882, Representative Roswell G. Horr of Michigan observed: I think it is safe to say that each member of this House receives [at least] fifty letters each week in regard to aid obtaining a pension. The subsequent bureaucracy that grew to deal with the large number of requests resulted in confusion, extravagance, and injustice, claims Judge Parry. The issue grew so large between 1880 and 1910, says Skocpol, the U.S. federal government devoted over a quarter of its expenditures to distributing pensions, which, aside from interest payments on the national debt in the early 1880s...exceeded or nearly equaled other major categories of federal spending. (This figure stands as a stumbling block for historians claiming an absence of federal involvement in social welfare before the New Deal.) ","Returning to Mississippi, Joanna Short notes that the average pension by 1910 in the state was 43.36 per year (41.08 in 1893 by a CPI conversion), and that for many Confederate veterans who struggled to earn a living because of disabilities or their widows, who did not have as much access to the work force, this amount was not trivial. It is unknown whether or not Mrs. Jones was an original war widow, in which case she would have been missing out on a great deal of money due her since 1865, or was trying to take advantage of the expansion of grants since 1888. Either way, the amount of money she would hopefully soon be receiving, with the help of the gentleman Major P.C. Harrington, would certainly help her during the economically challenging post war times in the South. The issue would be especially pressing to her, as the country had just experienced what the Hon. John W. Daniel called, in a speech before congress, the most acute stage of the panic of 1893, the result of which was a large across the board fall of prices, and the minimization of the United States financial system. This deflation and minimization most definitely affected many Mississippians. Mrs. Jones, therefore, most likely needed the help of Major Harrington as quickly as possible."],"display_date":"November 1893","search_date":"1893-11-15","locations":[{"id":7031,"lat":31.4771528974,"lng":-90.8978368524,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2856,"title":"Jim Crows to the Senate-a White Mississippians&#39; Defense of Supremacy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-12-31","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On December 31, 1890, Senator James Z. George (D. Miss), a man Dunbar Rowland calls a life-long resident of Carroll County, began his overwhelmingly convincing speech on the Senate Floor defending the newly written Mississippi Constitution. The new constitution, according to Rowland's 1902 reflections, was drafted in order to eliminate ignorance at the ballot box, and Senator George's defense was apparently very insightful; he displayed a more intimate knowledge of the constitutions of Massachusetts, Vermont and Connecticut than did the Senators who represented those states, and the speech itself has been called one of the great constitutional law speeches of the Senate. Indeed, the principles that the man from Carroll laid out in his speech were subsequently validated by the United States Supreme Court in Williams v. Mississippi, 1898. ","Two of the 1890 Mississippi Constitution's 285 main sections which George defended, however, have now earned historical renown: Sec. 243 establishing a uniform poll tax of two dollars, to be used in aid of the common schools, and for no other purpose, and Sec. 244 establishing a literacy test consisting of being able to read, understand, and interpret any section of the new Constitution. Although these two sections do not explicitly disenfranchise blacks and the provisions of the constitution of the State of Mississippi and the laws enacted to enforce them [were found in Williams v. Mississippi not to be] repugnant to the Fourteenth [and Fifteenth] Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the result was undoubtedly lopsided. According to William Alexander Mabry, the educational test if administered honestly [disenfranchised] about 123,334 Negroes and only 11,889 whites, leaving a white voting majority of more than 40,000 in the state instead of the existing 70,000 potential Negro majority, not to mention the fact that the Negro majority was already being repressed by bloodshed, bribery, [and] ballot stuffing.","Unfortunately, contrary to some of the official defenses of the 1890 constitution, including Senator George's, the result of disenfranchising a great number of blacks was intentional. As Rowland stated, the 1875 White Revolution in Mississippi and the subsequent years of intimidation of blacks leading up to the 1890 convention were carried out under the belief that the negro has proven himself unworthy of suffrage, and it should be taken from him. Even future early twentieth century Mississippi Governor James Kimble Vardaman noted, according to an online PBS history of Jim Crow, that there is no use to equivocate or lie about the matter. Mississippi's constitutional convention was held for no other purpose than to eliminate the nigger from politics; not the ignorant -- but the nigger. James George had fought since 1875 for this very purpose, and, despite claims of eliminating ignorance, it was in fact racial discrimination he defended before the U.S. Senate. ","Although the man from Carroll County's humble beginnings had earned him the nickname the Great Commoner, and his work in the United States Senate was valuable in aiding education and civil service reform as well as being instrumental in shaping the Sherman Antitrust Law, his staunch defense of the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 left a darker legacy to the South. While he was very likely only a product of his time and environment, as well as a much larger underlying racial problem in the South and indeed the entire country, Senator James Z. George's rousing speech left what would become a permanent stain not only on the man from Carroll, but also on the entire South and United Sates as a whole, as it justified before Congress the Jim Crow system of de jure racial segregation and subjugation.

One month earlier, Jefferson Davis had been inaugurated as the new president of the Confederacy. Elizabeth Saxon traveled to Montgomery, Alabama to celebrate the inauguration of Davis and then traveled to Mobile when Lincoln was inaugurated. In Mobile, she visited with a good friend and mentor from her childhood, Madame Octavia Walton Invert. Well-educated and charming, Madame Invert was a woman of society. Saxon described her as the most generous person she had ever met. The two exchanged formalities and then discussed Lincoln's present inauguration with sadness and fear. Invert cried for the friends she had scattered throughout the North and the South and knew how difficult the upcoming months would be. Saxon was younger and saw more hope for the future. Yet the depression of her role model was greatly troubling, and the somber mood quickly spread to Elizabeth herself. ","Uncertainty surrounded Lincoln's inauguration. Unionists and Confederates found themselves unsure of what would happen next. His inauguration speech needed to alleviate fears and explain his positions and possible actions. In his speech, Lincoln proclaimed that his purpose was not to eliminate slavery but rather oversee that which belonged to the government. In this sense, he was referring to the states that had already seceded. This included Saxon's home state of Alabama, which had seceded on January 11, 1861. Lincoln argued that he had no intentions of ending slavery in the South, but simply wanted to preserve the Union. ","Despite Lincoln's reassurances, southerners were not convinced. Many believed that slavery could not be protected in the current Union regardless of who was in charge. States that had already seceded continued to encourage border states to join their new nation. Even though states like Alabama had already taken action, no one knew what Lincoln's response would be. When he refused to sit idly by and allow the South to create its own nation, war became the next possible step. While the border states did not seceded until April and May, the rest of the South knew that war was coming. Unlike the inauguration of Jefferson Davis, the inauguration of Lincoln was a somber occasion. Invert's wisdom led her to believe that war between the North and the South was next and that would mean great casualties on both sides. Though younger, Saxon realized a great deal from watching the depression Invert faced. She too came to believe that the Confederate States of America would have to fight to preserve themselves. Lincoln could not say anything to convince the southern states that he would fairly handle the institution of slavery.

More importantly, Charles Goethe Baylor came to the Convention to address the planters while on temporary leave from his position as the United States consul at Amsterdam.  The merchants of Amsterdam had authorized him to tender cash advances, at low interest, to merchants and planters who wished to trade with Amsterdam instead of Liverpool.  On October 14, 1851, a Georgia newspaper editor commented on the broader possibilities of a change in trade: England has of late years given a good deal of aid and comfort to abolitionism.  Her West India policy proves her antagonism to African slavery and her intervention in Cuba shows it still more, to say nothing of the money actually remitted by her anti-slavery societies, to promote abolition in this country.  Hence it becomes important for the south to foster the cotton manufacture of the continent of Europe, so as not to be dependent either on Old or New England. ","Baylor's speech was widely reprinted in newspapers in the weeks following the convention, and the planters were bursting to adopt his ideas.  The convention delegates immediately passed a resolution offered by Baylor favoring direct trade, and they further resolved that any adopted strategy must include direct trade.  The convention delegates, however, could not agree on what plan to adopt.  The one finally selected was widely criticized.  The national movement for direct trade began to grow and the planters became more involved in agricultural movements, but Baylor's activities did not succeed in bringing direct trade to the South.  "," Baylor did manage to empower the southern cotton planters, if only figuratively, by forcing them to consider the possibilities of their taking matters of international trade and economy into their own control.  They were a wealthy and potentially influential group of men who had the power to effect change for their own benefit, and to the advantage of the American free trade.  Baylor was likely one of the first prominent figures to publicly acknowledge that power and to ask the planters to use it.  He was perhaps more successful in doing so because of his valid and personalized appeal to the possibility of no longer being dependent upon England, which held both economic and cultural significance.  The country's abolitionist policies and England's historical control over the American economy were both significant points of tension, but the United States had yet to challenge or address either one.

One white man and five black men were killed. Each side blamed the other for starting the riot. Its repercussions sent shockwaves through the state of Virginia, especially with the November elections so close at hand. In response to the Danville riot, Governor William Mahone sent out a public statement on his views of the Danville riot. Mahone blamed the bourbon managers (referring to the bourbon democrats) for provoking the collision. He claimed the violence was done to intimidate black people and hurt the cause of his Readjuster Party. He explained how United States troops had been requested since the state militia was so biased against blacks in dealing with the violence. The statement was clearly political, as he blamed his political enemies for the violence. "," The late nineteenth century was plagued with political upheaval, especially in the South, as Southerners searched for a postbellum identity. The Readjuster Party was a third party that had an important influence in Virginia politics. The party gave substantial power to blacks and was based on equality for all. The party wanted to lift the state debt and therefore cut many civil service programs. It rejected the radicalism of both the Republicans and the Bourbon Democrats, who were an extreme wing of the Democrat that resisted the compromises that the Democrats were trying to make. With the November elections approaching, the violence in Danville was the result of frustration on the part of whites because of the increase political mobilization and power of blacks. The failure of a black man to show respect to a white man was the catalyst, and the violence caused the situation to spin out of control. This reaction of violence to the perceived arrogance of negroes was typical throughout the South, as the practice of lynching indicates. It also reflected an intense sense of honor that was prevalent throughout the South. Through violence, whites kept blacks in their place and protected a sense of order. Blacks were given little opportunity to express their grievances, since the law was so often on the side of whites.

Calhoun was unable to beat. Come March 4, Senator James Mason of Virginia had to read one of Calhoun's last speeches in the Senate, an ominous prediction of what the slavery debate would ultimately do to the cords which bound these states together in one common union. Calhoun never saw the cords finally snap and civil war break out. He died on March 31, 1850. ","His death led directly to a period of mourning in South Carolina, nowhere more so than in Charleston, where he was laid to rest on April 26, 1850, in St. Phillip's churchyard. The event was significant enough that both major newspapers in the city, the <em>Charleston Mercury</em> and the <em>Charleston News and Courier</em>, took the day off from publishing, but not without first spending considerable attention on the Arrangements For the Funeral of Mr. Calhoun. The papers provided astounding detail: for the march to the Citadel, for the march from the Citadel to City Hall, on the funeral services the next day, on the firing of minute guns during certain points in the procession-and several diagrams in case readers were confused. T. Leger Hutchinson, the mayor of Charleston, declared April 25 a day of mourning. ","But more important than the attention to detail each newspaper spent on explaining the procession was what the papers said in their obsequies on April 27. The <em>Mercury</em> noted the ceremonial absorbed the whole thought, and soul, and presence of the city...Charleston was as one house of mourning. The <em>News and Courier</em> said it occurred with imposing magnificence and impressive solemnity. Certainly, the words of Governor W. Benjamin Seabrook echoed the thoughts of all present: I receive...with the deepest emotions, the mortal remains of him for whom South Carolina entertained an unbounded affection.... The name John Caldwell Calhoun will live while time shall be permitted to endure.","The words and feelings of Charleston in the wake of Calhoun's burial should not be taken lightly. This episode demonstrates concretely the importance of Calhoun to the Southern psyche. As historian Gerald M. Capers puts it, Like Washington and Lincoln, in the American legend John C. Calhoun is a symbol-a symbol of the Old South which was to be destroyed in the Great Rebellion that began a decade after his death. Calhoun, South Carolina's political leader from 1824 until 1850, remained (even after his death) the physical embodiment of a much larger idea: states rights, which included the right to nullify a federal law or the right to secede from the Union. In March 1850 he predicted what would happen 10 years later, little knowing his beloved South Carolina would be the first cord to snap.

He showed a masterful display of personal strength as he denied his brother-in-law, Henry Cheatham's, bid for a fifth straight nomination. John Fields had appointed a credentials committee that favored Cheatham, just as he had done in 1894, although this time Fields would not actually serve on the committee but rather was the chairman. White came from behind to prevent the Field's second attempt to fix the credentials process in favor of Cheatham. The convention lasted until around one o'clock in the morning when delegates overwhelmingly nominated White as their choice. Although White would face an experienced incumbent Democrat in the fall, the spring of 1896 Republican convention was the first one since 1890 to exhibit Republican unity.","White had gained the respect that put him in the position to be elected because of his dedicated service as the Solicitor since 1886. He was elected to the United States Congress in the elections of 1896 over incumbent Frederick A. Woodard and was again elected by the Second District in 1898. Although the Republican Party increasingly garnered a label as the black party and Democrats charged white Republicans as traitors to their race, White quickly became almost as popular in his party outside the state as he was at home in North Carolina. After the disputed 1894 elections, the state enacted changes which guaranteed the protection of minority voters and produced a voter turnout of more than 85% of all eligible voters in North Carolina, including an estimated 87% of black voters. In total, there was an estimated 330,000 votes cast, a 20% increase from the 1892 elections and the Republicans and Populists carried the state in all but one congressional district. Unfortunately, this trend would not hold in North Carolina and throughout the South.","White's nomination and later election to Congress was significant as it occurred in the face of a growing movement toward the disfranchisement of blacks. He was the last black Congressman elected in the South but chose against seeking a third term in the elections of 1900 as the North Carolina Democrats changed the laws, intimidating blacks from voting. After White, there were no African Americans elected to Congress for the next 28 years. Beginning in 1890, southern states invoked literacy tests, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, and white primaries to prevent many blacks from voting. Lynching and race riots also began to occur more frequently. In addition, in March 1891, the General Assembly decided to drastically redesign the North Carolina Second District, removing three black-majority counties, Jones, Vance, and Craven, from the Second District and redistributing them to areas dominated by the white Democrats. This forced White, a native of Craven County, to move to Edgecombe where he could once again run as a delegate for the Second District, the only district where he would have a chance of defeating a Democrat. Benjamin Justesen argued that in the face of this growing movement, the North Carolina elections of 1896 were significant because many considered them to be the state's fairest election since Reconstruction."],"display_date":"May 13, 1896","search_date":"1896-05-13","locations":[{"id":9436,"lat":35.9129129092,"lng":-77.5970968689,"zoom":9,"place":"EDGECOMBE, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2891,"title":"The Cross of Gold\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1891-11-05","end_date":"1896-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On November 5, 1891, in its Alliance Department, The Jackson Weekly Clarion Ledger published the Farmers' Alliance main agricultural ideas.  The central issue on the page, however, had nothing to do with crops, but had entirely to do with silver.  Indeed, under a section labeled Alliance Principles and Demands, the first demand was unlimited silver coinage, or certificates based on silver.","Since the 1870s, the Alliance had, no doubt, had much concern over the silver issue.  The passage of The Coinage Act of 1873 and the Resumption Act of 1875 (full resumption of convertibility of paper money into gold, and vice versa, occurring in 1879), the United States returned to a commodity monetary standard as in pre-Civil War times, with the only difference being that silver was omitted and the standard was entirely a gold standard.  According to Milton Friedman, the most obvious, but by no means the most important, consequence of the U.S. return to gold rather than to a bimetallic standard was the sharp rise in the gold-silver price ratio.  A far more important consequence was the effect on the nominal prices of goods and services in general.  The increased world demand for gold...coincided with a slowing in the rate of increase of the world's stock of gold and a rising output of goods and services.  The result of these economic factors was deflation from 1875 to 1896, at a rate of roughly 1.7 percent a year in the United States...[with] the wholesale prices of agricultural and other basic commodities [falling] at a greater rate (3.0 percent a year by one index).  ","In the latter part of the 1800s, this deflation became a serious concern for farmers in the United States, including those in Mississippi, as it exacerbated the ongoing problems with sharecropping and foreign competition. Deflation affected the farmers of Mississippi, as farmers are affected both by the falling prices (the things they are selling are worth less at the market) and also the rise in the real value of their debt (most farmers are debtors, meaning simply that they must borrow money to prepare their farm before they can hopefully sell enough products at harvest time to make a profit and pay off their loans).  As the Mississippi Historical Society states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, from 1870 to 1897, wheat prices fell from 1.06 a bushel to 63c a bushel, corn from 43c to 30c a bushel, and cotton from 15c a pound to 6c a pound. Most of the time farmers received even less for their produce.  The Historical Society blames over production, which may be true, but the overarching reason for this deflation was the monometallic standard.  Especially following 1890, deflation worsened and gave rise to the pro-silver politicians of the 1890s.  Because of the large farming constituency in Mississippi, these politicians were very popular in the State.  Such politicians supported returning to a bimetallic standard in order to ease the deflation and help American farmers (and sellers of silver), thus causing the State Alliance of Mississippi to publish in support of silver and agriculture in 1891.  ","The most influential silver politician of the 1890s was William Jennings Bryan, a Silver-Democrat (as opposed to a Gold Democrat) from Nebraska.  Bryan was especially popular in the strongly agricultural regions of the South, including Mississippi, and West.  Indeed, the Jackson Clarion Ledger repeatedly showered him with praise:  On July 9, 1896, the paper stated, in anticipation of the upcoming Democratic National Convention, that Mr. Bryan...is a finished orator with a resonant voice and command presence.  On October 15, 1896, the Clarion Ledger stated that Bryan is making the most wonderful canvass ever known in this country with his many speaking trips.  With these reports, the Ledger is reflecting his popularity with the farmers of Mississippi and the entire South.","In typical fashion, according to Friedman, William Jennings Bryan mesmerized the crowd at the 1896 Democratic National Convention with his now famous speech, in which he declared you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.  His speech has been called probably the most effective speech in the history of American party politics.  Bryan eventually won and accepted the Democratic nomination for President.  ","Although his platform had many other facets, which were outlined in his acceptance letter published in the Clarion Ledger on September 17, 1896, a bimetallic monetary standard and the free coinage of silver were always his main speaking points.  These points, however, began to lose ground during his campaign due to advances in gold extraction processes made by Scottish Chemists resulting in the beginnings of inflation.  Unfortunately for the Farmers' Alliance in Mississippi, Bryan's other platform stances were not strong enough for him to defeat William McKinley.  According to The World Almanac Encyclopedia of 1897, he ended up losing the election by 100 electoral votes and 603,514 popular votes.  As typical of the South and West, however, Bryan won 63,859 out of 71,184 votes in Mississippi, or slightly under 90 percent.  Election result maps show that McKinley was absolutely dominated in the region, excluding California, Oregon, and Washington.  Bryan's domination was due to the large farming and ranching constituencies in those areas, as well as, according to Richard Bensel, strong silver areas in such areas as Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, South Dakota, and Utah.  No doubt the Farmers' Alliance of Mississippi, as did many other similar organizations, rallied in his support."],"display_date":"November 5, 1891 - November 30, 1896","search_date":"1894-05-19","locations":[{"id":7062,"lat":32.2667120682,"lng":-90.442792619,"zoom":9,"place":"HINDS, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2900,"title":"Military and Social Subordination\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-11-23","end_date":"1853-11-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Richard Yeadon was a man who rarely minced words. In speaking to the Calliopean and Polytechnic Societies at the Citadel Academy in Charleston in 1853, Yeadon took the opportunity to address the audience on what would happen if higher institutions in South Carolina did not maintain strict discipline among their pupils.","Stemming from God, Order is the great law of nature, whereas Insubordination or rebellion was the primal sin, which drove [man] from Paradise. In the United States, Yeadon noted, order takes the place of the sword of power, pervading, ruling, and harmonizing our political system, which leads to the people of the United States literally reveling in the enjoyment of a political Eden, a national Paradise. But he cautioned, without order, we would be torn by civil dissensions, beyond all other nations, as the necessary result of our division into separate States...and we would soon behold our great and glorious Union, now covering a continent with its nationality and with the ample folds of our starry banner, broken into warring fragments, unable to command peace at home or respect abroad, and a derision and a by-word among nations. ","Yeadon's was a timely lesson. In 1853, only 11 students graduated from the College of Columbia, and nary a soul from the Citadel. It is manifest that a spirit of insubordination among our youth is not only at the bottom of these deplorable results, Yeadon concluded, but that it has increased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished. ","There are several reasons he gave for why this spirit of insubordination ought to be diminished, but the last was the most telling: The nature of our institution of domestic slavery, and its exposure of us to hostile machinations, both at home and abroad, render it doubly incumbent on us, and on our whole sisterhood of Southern States, to cherish a military spirit and diffuse military science among our people.... Thus prepared and harnessed for conflict...the South, the united South, self-sustained and self-defended, and thrice armed, as having her quarrel just, may defy the world in arms. ","One can almost hear his voice rising to a crescendo on these last words. Yet it was November 23, 1853. War would not break out between the states for over seven more years. But one would think from listening to Richard Yeadon's speech that the armies were marching to Charleston that instant. And the main reason for preserving order in the South's colleges: the threat of external attack on the South's peculiar institution. ","This episode supports historian Arthur Cole and others who believe there existed in South Carolina in the 1850s the danger of a rupture of the Union and of civil war ten years before the firing of the first gun on Fort Sumter when even sober-minded southerners...began to calculate the value of the Union.

Sass addressed the changing times as he discussed how a person is unable to choose whether an act reflects character or was the result of one's circumstances. He stressed unity in the future as his class matured and entered the world; he stressed unity as he said, And so we forgive and forget, and get along as well as we can with our neighbors, without going too far into the problem of their hidden characters. It is the wisest policy of all. Through this ignorance of surroundings, according to Sass, the class had to realize its powerless nature in regards to circumstance. As his speech progressed, Sass concentrated on the class? future by saying, ?it is not through the cultivation of the spirit of revolt and iconoclasm that this great end is to be attained. Not the breakers down, but the builders up, are the real helpers of humanity.? ","   In the speech, Sass touches on the concept of revolt in regards to a restoration of the antebellum South; in the post-Reconstruction era of the Jim Crow laws, this address incorporates a unique concept toward the increasing lines of binary division between the black and white races. According to Janette Thomas Greenwood, the 1890s set the stage for a white supremacist uprising in the South as concepts like Social Darwinism supported the biological superiority of the whites over the blacks as a whole. Sass? address stresses the importance of aid to humanity as a whole rather than revolt and negativity. Though he does not directly address the concept of racial superiority, he stresses both the focus of being a positive influence on humanity and the negativity of revolt, which directly relates to the deconstruction caused by the violence of white supremacists. ","   White supremacist groups, like the Ku Klux Klan, had used terrorist tactics in influencing the politically active blacks since 1866 across the South; moreover, the speech reflects the Southern tendency toward violence. Edward Ayers discusses how the time, being filled with political and economic conflict, following the Civil War yielded a volatile situation between the black and white populations.

On a side column on the first page, stuck right in the middle of the results of several other individual states, the <em>News and Courier</em> mentioned, almost as an afterthought, The Result: The returns from the different States indicate the certain election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency. There is no use for trifling details.","Perhaps the News and Courier somehow thought avoidance or derision would change reality. Andrew Magrath knew differently. Magrath was the federal district judge in the Charleston district. He was considered to be somewhat moderate, opposed to the prevalent idea that South Carolina should act on the issue of secession regardless of what the rest of the South decided to do. Upon hearing the election results, however, Magrath tore his robes, declared that he had resigned from the bench, and promptly left his courtroom. ","The next day, the News and Courier was all applause. It is our duty to record the Judicial demise of Hon. A. G. Magrath, late District Judge of the United States in and for the late Federal District of South Carolina. It is at the same time our privilege and pleasing duty to record that Citizen A. G. Magrath, of South Carolina, survives in full honor, and rich in the approving admiration of his fellow-citizens, and of the true sons of the South in all Southern States. ","This episode represents a fascinating theme that resonated throughout the South following Lincoln's election and leading up to the ordinances of secession. The attitude was one into which South Carolina has been forced the News and Courier claimed, by the event of the 6th of November. ","The use of the word forced is interesting. Since the first presidential election, the political system of the United States had managed to contain sectional differences by offering citizens an alternative to violence-the voting box. A loss one year could be balanced simply by winning four years later; no one should have to feel forced into a given action by any election results. Yet as historian Michael Holt contends, Once faith in [the Whigs and the Democrats] collapsed, however, a sense of crisis developed that government was beyond control of the people, that it had become a threatening power dominated by some gigantic conspiracy, and hence that republican institutions were under attack. This feeling-a new feeling of utter hopelessness- is so clearly seen by Judge Magrath and reverberated throughout much of the South in 1860. Instead of relying on politics and the proverbial voting box, the South soon turned to guns and violence.

James Hopkins Adams was certainly aware of the tumult he caused with that short declaration. A former governor of South Carolina from 1854 to 1856, Adams was, in December 1860, serving as a commissioner to the committee discussing the possibility of secession and civil war in South Carolina. His remarks caused Charleston resident Emma Holmes, in a December 5, 1860, letter to her friend Lizzie Greene in Georgia, to declare, Last Sunday will never be forgotten by the Charlestonians. The Convention was sitting. The Governor was holding a council of war. Troops were marching in the streets. The Palmetto Guards (The Finest and largest company of infantry in the state) took control of the Arsenal, and subsequently a salute of thirty two guns fired to the 'fallen grandeur' of the Stars and Stripes, as they were hauled down, to give place to the banner of the glorious Palmetto State. To top it all off, it was a Sunday-the Sabbath, the day of rest, which all Charlestonians were assuredly enjoying in a peaceful, leisurely manner, before the onslaught of troops and gun salutes. ","To be sure, all these displays were mere show, one snowballing into the next, probably unnecessarily troubling Charleston's finest ladies. Abraham Lincoln had yet to be inaugurated, had yet to call for 75,000 volunteers to stop the South from seceding, had yet to issue any other proclamations. Fort Sumter's bombardment-and with it a war-would not occur until April 1861.","But much can be said for mere show. Indeed, the state seems to have been working its way towards such displays in the several months prior. In a November 10, 1860, letter to Lizzie, Miss Holmes wrote of similar events: The report having reached Boston that South Carolina had already seceded, Mr. Caleb Cushman sent on in a vessel owned by himself and brothers, then here with orders to fire a salute of fifteen guns for the Southern States and to hoist the flag of S.C., a palmetto tree and Lone star. Though Emma was mistaken-formal secession would not occur until December 20 of that year-the multiple-gun salutes and hoistings of the Palmetto flag seemed common occurrences in the months leading up to secession. ","This episode is important in demonstrating the fact that Charlestonians were celebrating secession several months before it actually happened, a fact that should not be taken lightly. Historian Walter Edgar concurs, stating that South Carolinians had been calculating the value of the Union since the 1820s, and with each passing year, more and more found the Union wanting in the balance, a threat to the order and harmony of the state.

We, the People of the State of South Carolina, in Convention assembled, do declare and ordain, and it is hereby declared and ordained, That the Ordinance adopted by us in Convention, on the twenty-third day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, whereby the Constitution of the United States of America was ratified, and also all Acts and parts of Acts of the General Assembly of this State, ratifying amendments of the said Constitution, are hereby repealed; and that the union now subsisting between South Carolina and other states, under the name of the 'United States of America,' is hereby dissolved. The delegates had moved their convention from Columbia to Charleston due to rumors of a smallpox outbreak in Columbia. The importance of the move cannot be underestimated. As historian Walter Edgar says, There may have been one case (of smallpox) in the city, but by moving to Charleston those favoring secession would be in a locale more hospitable to their ideas. ","Among the hospitable was Emma Holmes, a young Charleston lady, who was both very agreeable to secession and willing to accept wholeheartedly the smallpox outbreak story. In writing to her friend Lizzie Green on December 20, Holmes exclaimed, The Union is dissolved, and we the people of South Carolina are a free and independent sovereignty Yesterday dear Lizzie the Ordinance of Secession passed at 1 1/4 P.M. and last night it was signed at Secession Hall (formerly Institute) amidst an immense concourse of people, and illuminations of tar barrels and fireworks of every description, music and parading of various companies. The Convention and Legislature adjourned here this week on account of the small-pox which is very prevalent in Columbia... In celebration, Frank Porcher lit 48 colored lanterns at his home on East Battery; tar barrels were burnt on Meeting Street; Roman candles and bombshells were launched throughout the city. The vote had been unanimous-all 169 delegates in favor of secession. This episode is important, of course, for the national ramifications it held. South Carolina was the first state to secede, others soon followed, with the results a new nation and civil war. But historian Ralph Wooster's data on the members of the South Carolina secession convention are far more probing. Delegates to South Carolina's secession convention held a median age of 49 years-the oldest median age of all the conventions-and were the only delegates to vote entirely for immediate secession. South Carolina delegates were also richer-with median personal property of 50,000, 18,000 more than the next closest, Mississippi-and held the most slaves-a median of 37, compared to 15.5 for Mississippi, again the next closest. Finally, 250 of the total 1,048 delegates at all conventions were born in South Carolina, and were heavily in favor of secession. ","Supporters for war in South Carolina, at least, were wealthy, older men. Perhaps the best conclusion to be drawn from this episode, then, lies in the words of Mr. Wooster: The motives for supporting immediate withdrawal from the Union seem then to have had a deeper basis than personal characteristics of convention members alone. Thus the political climate in Charleston, as this episode shows, may have contributed more to secession than mere property, age, or birthplace.

On December 6, 1850, William H. Barnwell, rector of St. Peter's Church, took the pulpit to expand upon the great political question which is agitating our country. The occasion? A Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer, as designated by the South Carolina legislature. The great political question? Slavery, especially in the wake of the Compromise of 1850, a compromise most South Carolinians viewed as an absolute defeat for the South. ","Barnwell was very clear on his stance: The purpose of the North is to use the whole power of the Government for its own aggrandizement, and the destruction of an institution which we believe to be of vital importance to our welfare. The institution for Barnwell, though, was not just important for South Carolina's welfare-it was ordained by God and a gift to the African race. His ultimate conclusion, though (the morality of slavery aside) remained political: Whatever speculative notions any one may have as to the moral influence of slavery, that it is a fundamental institution of the Southern States, and that no Government on earth has the slightest right to meddle with it, either directly or indirectly.","Turn to November 21, 1860. This time, South Carolina Governor William Gist had proclaimed another Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer. This time, it was Reverend Thomas Smyth lecturing at Second Presbyterian Church on The Sin and the Curse. This time, it was the election of Abraham Lincoln and a growing secession movement that prompted the occasion. It was all a foregone conclusion in Smyth's mind: This is only the result,-the consummation of a tragedy which has been long progressing to its last act,-when the curtain fell upon the dismembered body of the Union. He goes on to blame Northern Christians for this situation; they pervert truth, justice, honor, and good faith by forgetting that the condition of slavery has been and is recognized and regulated by God, who first ordained that it should come to pass as a penal infliction upon a guilty race, for the mitigation of greater evils, and for the good of all... that under the fostering care of these Southern States, and of this legally bounded institution, these people have multiplied in a ratio greater than their masters; that they are healthier and happier than any other laboring class on the face of the earth. ","This episode is important in showing the fusion of religion and politics in 1850s South Carolina. The views of these two pastors also aligned with those in the rest of the South. As Charles Iron of Elon University notes, By the 1830s, Southern whites insisted in their formulation of a regional, evangelical orthodoxy that God had ordained slavery and that slaveholders could confidently hold their property in persons so long as they were attentive to the spiritual condition of their slaves. Though these two sermons were ten years apart, the themes they espouse and the justifications for slavery they promulgate remained the same."],"display_date":"December 5, 1850 - November 21, 1860","search_date":"1855-11-28","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2929,"title":"Democratic Ratification Meeting Confirms Cleveland, Stevenson, Carr","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-07-06","end_date":"1892-07-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A New Bern ratification meeting on July 6, 1892 reflected more of a Democratic rally than a meeting as Cleveland, Carr and Victory chanted through the air in Craven County. The meeting set the Democratic ball in motion as the assembly greeted the resolution with applause and enthusiasm. Mr. Furnifold McLendel Simmons, the first speaker, championed Grover Cleveland and Adlai Stevenson as the perfect presidential pairing and presented Elias Carr and his associates on the State ticket as excellent candidates. His condemnation of the Republican and People's Party also drew tremendous applause. Mr. Stevenson followed Mr. Simmons and he too received great applause from the crowd. General Battle then spoke on behalf of the Democratic Party and mentioned how for the half century that the Democrats administered the government, the Party had secured both a reputation abroad and property at home. He said that every inch of territory that had been acquired by the United States, except Alaska, resulted from the efforts of the Democrats' administration. During this period, the Democrats had humbled both England and Mexico, along with the savage Indian tribes, until the Republicans broke the constitution and forced the South to choose from inequality in the Union or independence out of it. He claimed that the Union, led by the Republicans, made the war within the States inevitable. Finally, General Battle argued that Cleveland's administration would restore the South to her position as a sovereign state of the Union.","Grover Cleveland went on to win the presidential election of 1892, becoming the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms, his first being from 1885-1889. Adlai Stevenson served as his vice-president and Elias Carr became the Democratic governor of North Carolina from 1893-1897. Democrats viewed these victories as the triumph of old values over those implemented during Reconstruction. Cleveland was the only Democrat to be elected during the Republican reign of 1860-1912.","This narrative displays the rebuilding of Democratic politics in the South in the 1890s. Michael Perman argued that disfranchisement, including poll taxes, white primaries, and grandfather clauses was an attempt to skirt the 15th Amendment and restore white domination in the South. The Republicans had controlled the government for the Reconstruction era but by the 1890s, the Democrats were intent on again controlling their home and their land. They would no longer let the Republicans, the black party, represent the South and the election of 1892 was a testament to the prevailing Democratic sentiment."],"display_date":"July 6, 1892","search_date":"1892-07-06","locations":[{"id":9375,"lat":35.0750705618,"lng":-77.1185103654,"zoom":9,"place":"CRAVEN, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2938,"title":"North Carolina Farmers&#39; Alliance Comes to Sampson County \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-01-01","end_date":"1888-01-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Although the Alliance appeared in Robeson County, North Carolina in the spring of 1887, it was not until January 1888 that the Farmers' Alliance reached Sampson. By October 1887, the Alliance had established a state organization, with Syndenham B. Alexander as its president, Leonidas L. Polk as secretary, and Elias Carr as chairman of the executive committee. The Alliance attracted both small and large landowning farmers, in addition to tenant farmers, rural doctors, and teachers. The group allowed women to join but excluded blacks, atheists, lawyers, and merchants from joining. Over the ten week period following the arrival of the Farmers' Alliance in Sampson, the organizers set up almost twenty sub-Alliances spreading from Newton Grove to Goshen. They advertised their organization by speaking at churches and schools and describing the Alliance to anyone who would listen. They would then set up a sub-Alliance in that area.","The Farmers' Alliance appealed to Sampson farmers and residents for a number of reasons, first of which was that it offered farmers goods and materials such as fertilizer, at lower prices. This allowed the farmers to avoid the high prices or credit problems that they associated with merchants. At this time, commercial agriculture was expanding in Sampson as production of cotton, the county's leading cash crop, had increased by more than 500% between 1860 and 1890. At the same time, cotton prices had fallen dramatically and the farmers could expect little help from the elected Democratic officials whose own interests favored the existing arrangements.","James Hunt argued that while the Alliance expanded to many places throughout North Carolina, the expansion of the Farmers' Alliance to Sampson County was especially important because it was in Sampson that the group found one of its most powerful leaders in Marion Butler. Shortly after learning about the Alliance, Butler became the president of the Sampson County division and published its news in his newspaper, The Caucasian. His presidency within the Alliance was the beginning of a long political road for Butler, leading to his election to the state Senate as an Alliance representative, president of the North Carolina Farmers' Alliance, president of the National Farmers' Alliance, and finally a six-year term to the United States Senate in 1894 as the Fusionist representative."],"display_date":"January 1, 1888 - January 30, 1888","search_date":"1888-01-15","locations":[{"id":9794,"lat":34.991531922,"lng":-78.3712329782,"zoom":9,"place":"SAMPSON, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2969,"title":"The Successful Georgia Whig Convention of 1843\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1843-06-19","end_date":"1843-06-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Georgia Whig leaders were ready for a fresh start when they convened at the state capitol in June of 1843. The purpose of this convention-the largest body of the kind which has ever been held in Georgia - was to nominate Whig Party candidates for Congress, a candidate for the 1844 Georgia gubernatorial race, and delegates to represent the Georgia Whig Party at the 1844 Whig National Convention in Baltimore. At the very beginning of the convention, the delegates unanimously adopted the following resolution: Resolved, That many of the evils which afflict our people, can be traced directly to the injurious and ruinous legislation of the few last years; and believing the success of the Whig Party is essential to remedy this state of things, we conjure our friends to bring out their strongest and best men for the Legislature, in the several counties of the State.","The Whigs had recently experienced several setbacks, so this Convention was especially important if the party hoped to regain its political strength. The Whigs had just elected their first president, William Henry Harrison, but he died unexpectedly one month into his term. Vice President John Tyler renounced his Whig affiliation and loyalty after his presidential inauguration, as a result of the ideological and power clashes between Tyler, Henry Clay, and Whig leadership. As suggested by the Convention's adopted resolution, the Whigs were also upset by the current Georgia administration's Democratic policies, as the two parties were increasingly and irreconcilably polarized; the Whigs favored protectionist policies over the Democrats' free trade, and they favored economic development and diversification over economic growth. The Georgia Whigs themselves were also increasingly divided over national issues, including slavery and the state's right to secede from the Union. ","The Convention ultimately nominated George W. Crawford for governor and Alexander H. Stephens for a seat in the House of Representatives. Both men won the respective elections. Eight Georgia Whigs were nominated for the National Whig Convention in 1844, where they would serve as delegates and vote for Henry Clay as the Presidential nominee and John McPherson Berrien, the elected president of the Georgia convention, as the Vice Presidential nominee. After the convention, <em>The Recorder</em>, a Milledgeville newspaper supporting the Whig and States' Rights Ticket, congratulated the delegates on prioritizing the selection of strong, promising candidates across the board, rather than focusing on the nominees that they personally favored. The 1843 Convention delegates realized that they needed to ensure the survival of the Whig party before they could effectively resolve any controversial political issues."],"display_date":"June 19, 1843 - June 20, 1843","search_date":"1843-06-19","locations":[{"id":1524,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2989,"title":"The Whigs Hold a Meeting.

On August 4, 1840, six members of the Whig Central Committee of Vigilance of Fauquier, R.E Scott, Samuel Chilton, Tho's T. Withers, Richards Payne, John P. Philips, and John Walden, invited the voters of Fauquier and surrounding counties to attend a Whig party meeting in Warrenton.  The men made it clear that the invitation was not limited only to those aligned with the Whigs, by telling members of all parties as well as their Van Buren 'friends' to COME  At the meeting they intended to present the citizens with the opportunity to discuss the topics connected with the upcoming Presidential Election and develop and explain the principles that created the basis for Whig political actions.  The Whigs held their first national convention in December of 1939, which helped to develop them into a National Party.  Smaller Whig meetings, like the one held in Warrenton, were the reason the party moved forward organizationally and developed firm ideologies during the Presidential Election of 1840.  The election was defined by Southern ideals, seeing that Whig candidate, William Henry Harrison, was a native Virginian, and Democrat candidate, President Martin Van Buren, was strongly against abolition and had an unwavering friendship with the South.  The Southern ties both of these candidates had caused two party politics to become strongly established in the South, as there was a split among party lines.  Historian William J. Cooper makes this clear in saying that, Each party stressed its claim to be the protector of Southern interests and accused the other of infidelity in those interests.  Despite these similar interests, the Whigs and Harrison were victories in the election, carrying seven slave states, and winning more than half of the popular vote below Mason Dixon line.  After the election, the close competition between the two parties continued, each claiming to be the 'champion of the South.' Close competition made party cohesiveness in small counties and communities, like that shown in Fauquier, more and more important for party victories.

These developments included the postal service itself as well as the railroads, roads and canals that facilitated the ease and efficiency of sending mail.

Rives did not agree with a measure recommended by the Virginia Legislature.  At the time it was common understanding that federal senators should comply with instructions from legislatures because they were chosen by legislatures.  Senator Rives stance against the legislature brought him criticism from the people of Virginia, most notably those of the Republican Party, which Senator Rives was a member of.  In response to the criticism, a man under the pseudonym of Hector wrote a letter to the Republicans of Fauquier County that defended Senator Rives.  The letter argued that the criticisms he was receiving from the people of Fauquier echoed the views of Monarchists, not those of the Republican Party.  Hector asked the people of Fauquier: Has he forsaken any of those cardinal principles of the republican creed, which lie at the foundation of our government?  To this he responded: No one would say that he has.  This supported his argument that centered on the fact that the U.S Government gave senators the right to disagree with the 'Executive' in order to keep their decisions in check.  He then went on to say, if this process was not allowed then U.S might as well have a Grand Sultan for chief Magistrate, eluding to the way the people's criticisms advocated a monarchy. Senator Rives ultimately resigned due the criticisms and lack of support he received from his party as a result of his decision.  Whether this conflict should have ended in his resignation is questionable.  The defense that Hector gives in the episode echoes the views of the Whig Party at the time, which looked to uphold the Constitution.  They viewed the practice of Senators following the instruction of the legislature as a threat to the Constitution.  If this were the case then Rives should not have resigned.  However, if extreme Republican doctrine, which acknowledged that senators were responsible to the will of their states and therefore should follow the instructions of their legislature, was staunchly upheld then Rives would have seen reason to resign.  The people of Fauquier most clearly agreed with the Republican view, seeing that they were being addressed with a presentation of the opposite view.On February 10, 1834, the Whig majority in the Virginia legislature instructed senators to use their best exertions to make their own decision on the issue at hand, which related to the controversy over the removal of the deposits from the Second Bank of the United States.

Despite a divide among many Southerners about the honor of accepting federal pension, C.M.B. argues, Why then should ex Confederates prefer to burden their impoverished friends and states, rather than appeal to the generosity of this rich government.As the nineteenth century concluded, questions arose over how to deal with the health of the men the fought in the Civil War. In addition to the massive deaths incurred by both the Confederacy and the Union army, the South was forced to deal with rebuilding infrastructure, developing a new source of economic production, as well as replacing an entire generation of men lost to the war. The difficulties facing the South were furthered by the fact that Southern veterans were denied national pension that was given to aging Union soldiers. As the issue of federal pensions came to light in the final decade of the nineteenth century, many Confederate veterans had claimed that accepting the federal pensions was dishonorable and that self reliance should be the only means of economic viability. Yet, even those who proclaimed the pensions to be dishonorable knew that the lagging economy of the South made it difficult for veterans to afford to remain self-sufficient. Additionally, aging soldiers who lived off their families placed an added burden on their children that did not seem appealing, especially when Northern soldiers received government aid. The story of C.M.B. illustrates an important question regarding how best to deal with the lost cause of the South. The southern states had staked everything on the Civil War, and upon defeat were treated by the North as the losers of the War. The absolute destruction of both the Southern economy and infrastructure placed the South in an era of poverty. Consequently, as aging veterans grew too old to work, many individuals were forced to burden their families with the cost of caring for an additional family member. While industry had slowly returned to many southern cities by 1899, the need for government pensions seemed necessary to the aging veterans.

The press was also toasted, in the hopes that it would always be as clean and free from obscenities as it was useful to democracy. Andrew Jackson was referred to as the hero of the age, and James Madison was called our enlightened and independent statesman, and hope for a dignified and peaceful retirement for him was expressed. The state of South Carolina was also specifically honored, and the hope was expressed that she will never desert the post of danger, when the rights of freemen are invaded. Approximately 20 such toasts were given to celebrate the Fourth of July, each one diligently recorded in the next week's newspaper.","    The July celebration cited in this South Carolina newspaper is typical of the types of celebrations completed during the early nineteenth century in commemoration of the young nation's independence movement.

Andrew Jackson had recently risen to national fame after defeating the British in New Orleans in the War of 1812 but was also well liked as a local hero because he was born and raised in Waxhaw, in Union County, another upstate district. The reference to James Madison was due to James Monroe's inauguration a year before, and Madison's resulting retirement from public office. Monroe proceeded to appoint South Carolinian John C. Calhoun as Secretary of War, a decision that clearly made him popular in the South and shaped political tensions for decades to come. Overall, the impression given by this episode is one of political and social union between South Carolina and the rest of the nation, with little evidence of the coming conflicts.

In the year of 1897 citizens of Mobile and their representative Thomas H. Smith presented a series of bills to the Alabama Senate regarding child labor reform. These bills were purported to have come from the Mobile Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. All were shot down in committees. Though these laws were for the state of Alabama, the child labor reformers saw New England as being somewhat complicit in opposing the bills. In 1901 the Alabama Child Labor Committee wrote an open appeal to the people and press of New England and received wide endorsement throughout the state, including a former governor and the representative John Craft from Mobile.","The Committee engaged New England in what they thought was an important barrier in the reform movement. They asked for the interest and aid in pushing for child labor laws in the year of 1901, telling New Englanders that the responsibility is also yours. The responsibility lay with New England because, as the committee stated, While the proportion of the children under twelve in our Northern and Southern mills is approximately the same, yet in the mills representing the Northern investments, the actual number of such children employed is twice as great as the number found in the mills controlled by Southern capital. The letter called a Massachusetts representative the aggressive and effective opposition to attempts at proposing child labor laws at the turn of the century as well as being influential in stating opposition to laws being presented in the Alabama Senate in 1897. The appeal was a call for an awakening of public interest in the matter but it also directly spoke to New Englanders whose capital was used to erect factories and mills in Alabama.","From the discourse that carried on between the two it appears that any progress on the issue was greatly impeded in 1901. The Northerners wrote back but mostly denied wrongdoing in the matter, citing only four of the forty mills in the state were northern owned. They also argued that they did support the cause for reform but mostly because they believed young children to not be intelligent enough to do good work. Indeed, it was not just the lack of support from the Northern owners and legislators that made progress difficult. Mobile did not have many mills or factories compared to the rest of Alabama so it is natural that other districts and cities in the state would not necessarily agree with their stance. As early as 1887, Alabama had already enacted child labor legislation and it had been supported by Senator Daniel Smith of Mobile. Fines of up to fifty dollars were issued for employers who violated certain laws. Children under eighteen could not work more than eight hours in mechanical or manufacturing jobs, children under fourteen could not work more than eight hours in a factory, and no child under the age of fifteen was allowed to work in mines. These were certainly important milestones in the reform movement; however, as the appeal written by the Alabama Child Labor Committee demonstrates it was not enough. Citizens of Mobile, Alabama were credited with primarily supporting these laws and most any legislation surrounding the issue, most notably in 1897. Because of the efforts of the citizens and representatives of Mobile though, Alabama was considered to be pioneering the cause of child labor reform."],"display_date":1897,"search_date":"1897-07-02","locations":[{"id":288,"lat":30.3671940073,"lng":-88.3660108917,"zoom":9,"place":"MOBILE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3042,"title":"Jabez Jackson and Defense of Union\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-07-07","end_date":"1835-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After the resignation of James M. Wayne from the United States House of Representatives, the Jacksonian Party of Georgia desired a strong unionist to represent the Milledgeville Congressional District in Congress.  On July 6, 1835, a convention of Union Party delegates nominated Jabez Jackson to fill this void.   Jabez Jackson himself wrote to the Central Committee of the Union Party of Milledgeville a letter of informal inauguration and thanks.  The <em>Georgia Telegraph </em>published the letter in its paper the next day. Jackson outlined his own history by paralleling it with the history of his proud state.  At the age of 17, Jackson fought alongside a Georgia regiment in the American Revolution.  Later in life, he continued serving the state in civil and military matters.  After thanking the Committee and accepting the nomination, he then turned to the heart of his address: the sacred cause of his party and thus the sacred cause of the Union. The cause of his party was simple: to maintain the strength, unity, and integrity of the United States.  His scorn quickly turned to his fellow Congressmen from South Carolina who stood for nullification and the State Rights party, so called.  He claimed that these representatives would be mocked by the Founding Fathers from their state, who would not be eager to exchange the glories of the Star Spangled Banner for the mock heroics of the Palmetto Button.  The members of the States Rights Party of the Palmetto State, as South Carolina was lovingly called by its citizens, often placed their state's autonomy over that of the nation.  Jackson scornfully mocked their allegiance to their state in contrast with the Founders' allegiance to the Union.","Instead of standing steadfast for states rights, Jackson defended the noble institutions of our country and its rich history and constitution.  This, he claimed, is the debt he owed to the heritage of Georgia.  A few short years after the Nullification Crisis and 22 years before the Civil War, this Congressman from the Black Belt of Georgia left no doubt where he stood in the brooding sectional conflicts of the era. The Nullification Crisis and the call for states rights divided much of the South in the mid-1830s.  Under the leadership of President Andrew Jackson, Congress passed a law that President Jackson signed in 1832 creating protective tariffs over certain manufactured goods from Europe.  These tariffs pushed prices on manufactured goods from abroad above the rates of the same goods from the North, guaranteeing that the South would buy these products from the North rather than from Europe and thus help the economy of the North and of the nation.","South Carolina's bold stance against the federal tariffs placed upon certain manufactured goods also came at a time when Andrew Jackson was busy piecing together a national party.  In fact, the President called his party the Union Party as a symbolic gesture of national harmony and unison at a time of bubbling regional conflicts like the Nullification Crisis.  Unlike later fire eaters of the Deep South who stood for secession and absolute state rights in the face of Unionism, Jabez Jackson and other Union Party members sought to support Georgia by remaining united to the nation during times of sectional conflict.  Unionists like Jabez Jackson remained loyal to the Union rather than the debated rights of their own states in following conflicts such as the Compromise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act that seemed to threaten the integrity of the Union.  This Unionist sentiment remained largely prevalent until the late 1850s and early 1860s as war eventually broke out between the North and South."],"display_date":"July 7, 1835","search_date":"1835-07-07","locations":[{"id":1523,"lat":33.0697355251,"lng":-83.2500363363,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3043,"title":"Blacks in South Carolina: Education and Christianization\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1834-01-01","end_date":"1834-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Several members of South Carolina's Chester County delivered a petition to the state assembly in response to an 1834 act outlawing teaching reading to slaves. The citizens expressed outrage at the legislation, saying themselves and other citizens were prepared to disobey the law because slaves across Southern plantations already had the ability to read. They further expressed their opinion that the law would not be enforced in the state, except in cases of malicious and spiteful intent on some slaveholders' parts to punish men better than themselves. The petitioners denounced the legislation as ridiculous because slave owners would not be able to prevent their slaves from reading and learning to read, much in the same way that they couldn't prevent their slaves from learning to write, a skill many slaves taught themselves despite the watchful eyes of their owners.","    The petition continued to question the logic of the assembly in enacting such legislation and questioned their assumption that intelligence is more likely to produce insurrections among slaves than ignorance. They argued that general ignorance within the slave population is more of a threat because it would make slaves much more susceptible to the influences of any Nat Turner type character that might pass through the region. The petition ended with the scornful question does chivalrous South Carolina quail before gangs of cowardly Africans with a Bible in their hands?","    Despite the moral and Christian basis of this petition, this appeal and many others like it were continually rejected by the state legislators. According to historian Walter Edgar, South Carolina was known across the antebellum South as the most stringent state with regards to teaching blacks, both free and enslaved. However, many individual slave owners did break these laws, mostly in the hopes of educating their slaves about Christianity, knowing that the laws, though strict, were hardly enforced. In reality, it is estimated that around 5 percent of South Carolina's black population had some grasp of reading or writing. The state assembly insisted on enacting such laws because of leaders' beliefs that literate blacks, whether free or enslaved, presented a major threat to the system that the South relied upon so heavily. Additionally, the reference to Nat Turner's rebellion 3 years earlier in southern Virginia gives a sense of the uneasiness that rippled throughout the South as slave owners saw the delicate balance of the system their entire lifestyles depended upon. This episode is an excellent illustration of the different pressures felt by white Southerners throughout the antebellum period: recognizing slaves as human souls entitled to the same rights as whites versus slaves as commodities upholding the economic and cultural basis of Southern culture."],"display_date":1834,"search_date":"1834-07-02","locations":[{"id":11463,"lat":34.6920570183,"lng":-81.1595343266,"zoom":10,"place":"CHESTER, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3048,"title":"Picnic for Family, Friends, and Politicians","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1894-09-23","end_date":"1894-09-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Frederick, Maryland, once again, demonstrates its political prowess by holding a political picnic and barbeque for the surrounding areas political parties.

Political candidates were at the political picnic to discuss the community's pressing issues as well as the new tariff reform policy. Col. L.V. Baughran, presided and introduced the picnics guest which included one nominee for Congress, and two representatives currently serving. The guest list included many prominent society members such as professors and aristocrats, who traveled considerable distance to attend the event. ","The picnic serves an extremely pivotal socialization function. Great cooks come to serve their specialty to the attendees of 500 or more, able to see friends you are unable to see due to distance, and the chance to meet influential politicians and discuss matters of the heart. For this reason, these political functions serve a major social role. While the kids play with the other children, you are able to hear contrasting views regarding a subject. That's right. Either if one political party set up the picnic, often, invited or not, the other political parties seeking influence in the area, come to deliver their side of the discussion. This sets up the sight for a potential debate. Both sides believed that their success in the district seems promising, and that in November, will give their side the majority. In the context of the picnic, Hon. Ferdinand Williams and Hon. George Wellington of the Democratic Party iterated similar their thoughts. Alleghany County is all right.

Under massive pressure from their northern brethren on the Indian Bills, the Telegraph vehemently defended the territorial rights of the state of Georgia.  The newspaper viewed the Indian Bills as a simple issue of property rights, not one of Indian removal and southern supremacy.  According to their interpretation, Georgia had adequately paid the monetary demands of the Cherokees to the land that they once possessed and thus had every right to the land, regardless of who currently resided upon it. After explaining that Georgia sufficiently paid for the land and thus legally owned it, the <em>Macon Telegraph</em> turned its attention to the criticism coming from other states.  The <em>Telegraph</em> placed specific blame on the North, who hated to see the growth of the South and the consequent wane of its own preponderance in Congress.  Removing the Indians and ensuring Georgia's sovereignty would also expand its representative power in Congress, and, alternatively, decrease the congressional delegation of the North.  Because of this, the North, they believed, would do anything to slow the economic and physical expansion of the South.  ","Finally, the Telegraph asserted that Georgia did in fact have the concerns of the poor Indians in mind.   While the North had their own motives in mind rather than those of the Indians, Georgia did not wish to injure or harm the natives.  In fact, the editorial continued, Georgia had already paid a large sum for the land and had patiently awaited the exit of the Indians to lands west of the Mississippi.  This payment proved that the Cherokees had left by their own free choice rather than by coercion.  Furthermore, the Indian tribes were destined for healthy, fertile lands abound in game, leaving them infinitely better off than they were or ever could be in Georgia.","The Telegraph's disdain for the North only grew once Chief Justice John Marshall stepped into the controversy.  In Worcester v. Georgia, Chief Justice Marshall sided with Samuel Austin Worcester and Elizur Butler, two missionaries that wished to live with the Cherokees in Georgia territory.  The Indian Removal Acts had declared that these Cherokees must leave Georgia, but Worcester and Butler ignored the law and instead sued the state.  According to Marshall, the two missionaries and their Cherokee friends had every right to remain in Georgia. Marshall declared that the state of Georgia did not have the authority to regulate the intercourse between the citizens of its state and the members of the Cherokee Nation because the Indian territory remained in the hands of the Cherokees, not in the hands of the Georgia government as the <em>Telegraph</em> asserted.  Thus, the interactions between the Cherokee Nation and the American government must occur on the federal level, not the state level.  In this way, Georgia law was not binding to the Cherokee peoples because it interfered with American laws and treaties that were superior to state law.","Famously, Andrew Jackson strongly resisted Marshall's ruling.  Although Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune misquoted Jackson as saying that John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it, the inaccurate quote captured Jackson's attitude towards Marshall and the Cherokees.  Instead of executing the outcome of Worchester, Jackson continued his policy of Indian removal.  Although many of the Cherokees adopted the customs and habits of the white Georgians, Jackson insisted on their removal from the state.  In 1832, Jackson pressed the Cherokees to sign a treaty ceding their lands to the state of Georgia.  This treaty required that the Cherokees depart the state in two years.  This exodus finally began six years later, in 1838.  Through rain and snow, lacking sufficient food, clothing, and shelter, Jackson forced the Cherokees out of Georgia and towards Oklahoma.  The Trail of Tears was lined with thousands of dead Cherokees, forever removed from their Georgia home."],"display_date":"June 12, 1830","search_date":"1830-06-12","locations":[{"id":1547,"lat":32.8060034472,"lng":-83.7076277097,"zoom":10,"place":"BIBB, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3064,"title":" Cabell comments on 1896 election\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1896-11-29","end_date":"1896-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["For the first time, William Cabell voted Republican and broke his loyalty to the ","Democrats. 1896 was a major year for presidential elections, and silver was the major ","political issue of the election year.

Traditional Republican, Democrat, and Populist leaders viewed this convention and show of unusual partisan solidarity with alarm.","The idea of ?free silver? gained popularity in the late 19th century, fueled by the recession in the early 1890s. Unlimited coinage of silver was taken up by people all across the nation as a solution to economic problems, especially those of farmers. Indeed, the Farmer?s Alliance in 1890 and the Populists in their 1890s platforms called specifically for this measure as a balm for the national financial crisis. In Alabama, a region of mostly cash-poor landowners and farmers, free silver seemed to be central to their future economic survival and prosperity. This episode highlights a trend in political alignment at this time. The Populist party and other men standing for free silver joined together in political alliances with traditional Republicans and Democrats in hopes of gaining more power. Indeed, the idea of free silver would get the greatest following in 1896, just a year after the formation of these clubs in Alabama, when the Democrats and Populists run Bryan for president on a free silver platform.

Indeed, attendants of the People's Party mass meeting in Thomson Friday, December 5, were deeply stirred as Pearson described his wife who requested that she wanted to give something to help Mr. Watson get his rights. Of course, the Mr. Watson whom Pearson's wife referenced in her last moments was none other than Thomas Watson - the darling of the Populist Party in his campaign for reelection to the House of Representatives. Pearson circled the gathered crowd and, recalling his wife's indelible devotion and enthusiasm for Mr. Watson, sought to invigorate the gathered members and inspire them to act likewise. A People's Party Paper correspondent covering the meeting wrote, It stirs very deeply, very, very deeply, when I think of this good old woman, lying in pain and in the awful shadow of death, and yet having her heart so full of zeal in the cause as to make her last act on earth a proof of her devotion to it, and her last message one of cheer to me. Following such an emotional appeal by Pearson, it is difficult to believe someone would be averse to working for such a man as a Mr. Watson and his populist cause, and yet opponents abounded in his reelection campaign.","What became of Joseph Pearson and his quest to fulfill his wife's dying wish is unknown; however, it may be said that his efforts were part-in-parcel of Watson's eventual reelection to the House of Representatives as a Populist in 1892. Not only was Watson one of the founders of Georgia's Populist Party, but he was also a brilliant orator and incredibly charismatic speaker. Both of these traits helped him climb the ranks of the Populist Party as he strove to unite agrarians across class lines and overcome racial divides. Later, he even advocated for the right of African American men to vote - a radical appeal for a Populist to make given the party's traditional base among white farmers. Unfortunately, Watson's early support for and among African Americans like Joseph Pearson soured after the failure of the Populist Party to fuse tickets with the Democrats in the elections of 1896 and 1898. Watson blamed minorities in the South for the Party's failures on the electoral field of battle and thenceforth transformed into a bitter racist. Watson had always harbored intense anti-Semite and anti-Catholic sentiments, but given his early support for African American rights, few could guess that he would eventually call for the reorganization of the Ku Klux Klan. Watson proceeded on to the national political stage as both a vice presidential candidate in 1896 and a presidential candidate in 1904. He failed, however, to receive enough support to elect him on either front. ","When Watson initially formed the Populist Party in Georgia, it appealed primarily to white farmers, due to its emphasis on agricultural protectionism in the South following low cotton prices in previous decades. On a more national level, the Party advocated for issues like free and unlimited coinage of silver, the abolition of national banks, a system of graduated income tax, public ownership of the railroads, steamship lines and telephone and telegraph systems, and direct election of United States Senators. Fierce competition from Democrats - who were still a viable force in the South at the time - demanded that the Populists appeal not only to the white populace in Georgia but also to African American Republicans. This initiative to attract the black vote obviously proved successful in the case of Pearson's deceased wife. Emotional appeals like Pearson's prove the overwhelming success of Watson in reaching out to the African American populace - an incredibly symbolic attempt which struck a strong chord among many and enabled him to claim bi-racial support on agrarian issues."],"display_date":"December 5, 1892","search_date":"1892-12-05","locations":[{"id":1819,"lat":34.426000328,"lng":-83.2423737095,"zoom":9,"place":"FRANKLIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3097,"title":"A Change in Direction\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-01-06","end_date":"1897-01-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["1897 was an important year for the educational system of Maryland, and subsequently, the South as a whole. Mayor Hooper of Baltimore, Maryland was becoming upset with the members of the school board. He strongly felt that the board of school commissioners were becoming too political in their decisions and straying from the board's intent to deliver the best quality of education to all public schools. City Counselor Hayes and City Solicitor Elliot supported Mayor Hooper's decision. They believe that the object is to take the schools out of politics and to place them on a strictly educational basis, so as to benefit the children, and, in fact, the whole community. The city was finally ready for a new direction and an expansion of the realm of government in this specific realm. Besides creating a new board, Mayor Hooper wanted to ensure that the board members cared about education as a whole, rather than trying to priveledge a select few. For that, he selected Dr. Lillian M. Weish, to grant recognition to female children. However when asked, he chose not to select a person of color to the new board.","Why did Mayor Hooper grant a proxy for all demographics, except blacks? Not to downgrade his act to relocate education away from the reach of politicians, but to disregard the interests of a key group is unsettling. Later that year, the board decided to rename one of its schools, and thus input more money into the educational program there. The Colored Polytechnic Institute was the first free black school to teach practical knowledge to its students. Though nearly nine years after its white counterpart was established, blacks were finally given a chance to make something of themselves. Upon face value, one would believe that the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools in Baltimore was doing a service to the black community for now attempting to recognize that the South's best interest included the interests of their kids, as well as blacks. However, the public might have interpreted the new institute not only as a strengthening force, but also as one of perpetual enslavement. Ayers recognized that the new school could possibly reinforce blacks to look for professions involving manual labor and appropriate education for blacks, rather than educating them in literature and music.","At the heart of this narrative, we can see the subtle changes in the thought process of Southern States in the late 19th century. Though Mayor Hoover deliberately decided not to place a person of color on the school board, his decision to choose safe and intelligent citizens to represent the interests of society is quite admirable. Correctly, then the board gave blacks an opportunity to gain experience through a technical school.

He proposed all men, both white and black, should be allowed to vote, but that those who owned property should have their vote count for more. Specifically, a man would receive an additional vote for each 500 worth of property he owned up to 5000. Thus, a wealthy man could have his vote count for ten times as much as a poor man's ballot. The stated purpose of this plan was to counteract the African American majority in South Carolina. As an analysis of the proposal states, the plan would wipe out the colored majority of 40,000 voters and insure a white majority of 20,000. If enacted, this proposal would allow Southern governments to disenfranchise blacks without violating the Fourteenth Amendment."," Pee-Dee's proposal was not controversial because it disenfranchised African Americans, but because of the effect it would have on poor and middle class white voters. This attitude of searching for legal loopholes to institute segregation became prevalent across the South after the end of Reconstruction. Once they were no longer under military occupation, white Southerners began looking for ways to reassert control over their society. Proposals such as these would eventually build up to the Supreme Court validation of segregation in Plessey v. Ferguson and decades of African American segregation under Jim Crow laws. While this specific proposal was never passed, similar measures were soon enacted to disenfranchise African Americans and ensure white dominance of the political system in the South for generations.

The purpose of the bill was supposedly to ensure the survival of slavery in the state, but it was largely opposed. People disagreed on the real intentions of the bill, and on what the consequences of it would be. The Georgia <em>Telegraph</em> called the policy unwise, impolitic, and short-sighted. It was fraught with as much injury to the institution of slavery as if the policy had been generated in Massachusetts for the express purpose of destroying the institution. ","Both sides of the debate were pro-slavery, but could not agree on how to preserve the institution. Most argued that the bill favored the wealthy by increasing the value of the slaves they already owned, thus maintaining the planter class's status quo by making it extremely difficult for other farmers to procure slave labor at a reasonable price. Supporters of the bill believed that if the interstate slave trade continued, slaves would eventually become so numerous that they would no longer be a profitable labor source. Slaves would become less valuable as their numbers increased. Eventually, the cost of maintaining them would exceed their worth, and the practice of slaveholding would die out entirely. ","An editorial published in the <em>Telegraph</em> argued that the measure would have an exact opposite, negative effect. Prohibiting the slave trade would likely inspire other southern states to do the same, and eventually slave-selling states like Virginia would no longer have a market for their primary export. If Virginia's economy collapsed, the state would abolish slavery, and others would follow. The <em>Telegraph</em> argued, Who does not know that the accumulation of slaves, without reciprocal benefits, without profitable results, would eventuate in its abolition even in Georgia or Mississippi. What man would own slaves, if they only run him in debt The bill initially failed to pass. Amendments were twice offered on the original bill, and the bill succeeded on its third try by a 57-44 vote.

Taney served as the Secretary of the Treasury under Andrew Jackson from 1833-1834, and the fifth Chief Justice of the United States from 1836-1864.  In this reader's letter to the editor the following day he remarked about the tone of the dinner and the ill feelings towards Nicholas Biddle and his National Bank.  The toast at the end of the night, given by a good natured Irishman, who, no doubt, was eminently qualified to give us natives a learned dissertation upon the currency and banking, expressed the true dislike that Taney, Jackson, and other followers had for Old Nick and his National Bank.

Nicholas Biddle was the President of the Bank of the United States from 1822 until 1839.  He pressed for re-chartering the Bank in 1816 and fought Jackson through the twenties to keep the Bank alive.  The Bank lost its national charter in 1832, but operated as a state-sponsored bank until its failure in 1841.  According to Thomas Govan, Biddle was seen by some as a corrupt and deceitful schemer while seen by others as a perfect example for the American gentleman.  Andrew Jackson and Maryland native Roger Taney were seen as two of Biddle's greatest opponents.  They feared the political power of a national Bank because of the danger faced by concentrating the wealth of the nation's largest corporation.

Adolphus Sterne went with his friends Mr. Houghson, Mr. Hoya, and Mr. Linn to Colonel Raguet's house for dinner. After dinner the Colonel accompanied the group to Mr. Moore's for a meeting of the debating society. Sterne presided over the debate and listened to each side equally. The fiery speech of wild Bill Sparks, a former Republic of Texas Congressman, would be difficult to beat. The debate was on the question of whether or not it was beneficial for Texas to be annexed into the United States. Sterne deliberated then gave the victory to the side which argued against annexation. ","Annexation of Texas into the United States was a big debate, and as early as September 1836, the majority Texans had given their support to annexation into the United States; however, as late as 1844, there were still some who thought that Texas would fare better if it remained an independent republic. One of the major concerns of opponents to annexation was war with Mexico. Since Mexican officials never recognized Texas independence as legitimate, and they disagreed on the official boundaries of Texas, annexation into the United States would certainly cause conflict. A war with Mexico would be tragic for Texas as it would be fought on their own land. Having just finished their own war with Mexico, it is understandable that some Texans would want to avoid further bloodshed. ","Pro-British sentiments also played a role in some Texans' opposition to annexation. Britain had recognized the independence of Texas and played an integral role in peace negotiations between Texas and Mexico in 1843. Some even thought that Britain could force Mexico to recognize Texas's Independence. Britain adamantly opposed annexation and was willing to do what it could to prevent annexation. The British feared the results of annexation: expansion of the United States, loss of profitable trade with Texas, and the extension of slavery. Britain was one of Texas's key allies and upsetting its people could be detrimental to Texas. Trade with the British was profitable for Texans too, and loss of that trade would hurt the struggling economy. ","The annexation of Texas was a hot issue in the 1840s because of its far-reaching consequences for several countries. Just like in the United States, there were in Texas both those who supported and those who opposed annexation. Texans who opposed annexation thought that Texas had more to gain by remaining an independent republic.

Crowded in the town's Temperance Hall, because of rain outside, Friday night witnessed the much anticipated literary and musical entertainment. Despite the weather, spirits remained high and prominent male and female speakers generated great joy and thunderous applause. The night's favorite performance came in the form of nine year old Mamie, whose solos left the audience shackled by their laughter. The enthusiasm for the temperance celebration surprised even the event's organizers; as the anniversary resulted in complete success. Despite no boring pleas for money, donations covered all the expenses. Sunday, April 24, celebrated by all the local churches as Temperance Day, witnessed mass meetings at several churches, with gripping sermons that kept people in their pews long past when the doxology and benediction normally concluded services. "," Protestant churches in the South regarded the coming of a New, commercial South in the late nineteenth century as a threat to the Old South culture, so deeply rooted in Christianity. Thus, local organizations, often supported by churches, emerged to improve and perfect an increasingly chaotic society. Movements towards Prohibition grew out of these efforts, which more often than not had a strong female presence. Such a seemingly Puritanical movement generated resistance from those who felt the church had overstepped its bounds. Nonetheless, some isolated communities, like Chincoteague Island, were able to construct their own local temperance options, though areas with a larger lower class typically encountered more resistance. "," On a national level, a prohibition party could never succeed due to the differences between temperance supporters in the North and South. Most Northern prohibitionists were Republicans and former abolitionists, anathema to self-respecting Southern elites. Within Virginia, however, the Prohibition Party increased by 1887 to ten times its support in 1884. These followers tended to see bars and saloons as the basis for the wrongs of Southern culture, fostering lewdness and incessant swearing. Oftentimes, the prohibitionists would reach out to blacks for several reasons. First, they were seen as important swing voters who could counteract the usually dominant Democratic Party. Also, there existed religious and class based reasons that white professionals could associate and share the same values with their black counterparts. This sort of mutual respect appears in a statement made by a white, pro-temperance preacher, Let us make a great pile of all the unreasonable race prejudices, all political animosities, all sectional bitterness, all partisan hate.... The most successful nation-wide coalition in the nineteenth century; however, came with the creation of the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the first group formed by solely women to act politically. Nevertheless, no state encompassing prohibition laws emerged until later on in the 1900's. Yet, by 1887, Chincoteague rejoiced in finding what they considered a more perfect society.

William Williston Heartsill, a young 22 year old store clerk working in Marshall, Texas was one of the first to enlist. Before he had left for training, Heartsill began a diary to record all the moments and sentiments leading to the cause of his enlistment. He believed that it was imperative to fight and to the fight the best we can. Heartsill was a passionate man who did not think the war would last longer than 12 months, as their cause is just before high Heaven, that we will succeed in this great undertaking. Heartsill supported and followed actively the road to secession, acknowledging the election of Abraham Lincoln as the event that set the wheels in motion for the mass-meetings that convened in every county in the state to lead to the nearly unanimous vote for secession. "," After Lincoln was elected President, many Texans felt threatened regarding the future of slavery. Although slavery came comparatively late to Texas, by Lincoln's election one of every four Texas families owned slaves. The citizens quickly urged Governor Sam Houston to call a convention for Texas to decide the course of their future. As a man dedicated to the Union, Houston repeatedly forestalled the convention fearing the future results. However, the convention was finally legally organized by state legislature on January 28, 1861. The Texas Ordinance of Secession was drafted and voted upon with a favorable margin of 166 to 8 on February 1, 1861. Houston refused to accept the convention, sign the document, or take the oath of allegiance to the new government, thereby resigning as Governor. "," The Texas Ordinance declared that Texas abandoned her separate national existence and consented to become one of the Confederated States to promote her welfare, insure domestic tranquillity and secure more substantially the blessings of peace and liberty to her people. The decision to secede was fueled by several grievances including the sending of pamphlets and papers to stir insurrection throughout Texas, distribution of arms to slaves and the hindering the slave institution, and refusing to allow appropriations for protection against Indians.

Mr. Conrad delivered a speech on the subject to the meeting in which he discussed the ills inflicted on the southern states by the North such as disregard for run away slave laws and their disregard for the importance of slavery in the South in general. He stated that We assure our northern brethren that the institution against which this insane war is waged, is so interwoven into our social, domestic, and industrial life, that any sudden change would be destructive to us, and even to themselves. While Mr. Conrad made it clear that the citizens of Frederick Country would not tolerate actions against slavery, he also states that secession will only worsen the situation. Mr. Conrad pleads for reconsideration by South Carolina in this statement: Hence; we do not question the power of South Carolina, in virtue of her state sovereignty to absolve her citizens from their allegiance to the federal government. But we do utterly deny her right, under the circumstances that now exist; and as parties to the compact, deeply interested in its fulfillment, we deny that she alone has the right to decide whether adequate cause exists. Mr. Conrad also presented several solutions to the conflict with the North which he suggests giving to the Virginia General Assembly. We may obstruct the wheels of the Federal Government; or defend our Constitutional rights, in arms, under the flag of the Union; and even these extreme measures would be less fatal than a voluntary secession, he stated. He and the members of the meeting agreed that South Carolina did secede the North would be quick to put them back into place and repair their own actions against slavery. The remedy is with our Northern friends: we await their action with trust and confidence that they will now see and appreciate the evil, and apply the proper correctives. "," After the secession of South Carolina the rest of the southern states were left with a very critical decision: stay in the union and allow the north to force its anti-slavery ideals upon the entire south or join the rebellion, unsure of what would come next. The question facing the upper South was not simply whether to secede but whether to aid their brothers farther south. This looming decision divided the South into three sections. The first was made up of those southerners mostly in the lower South who believed in immediate secession, the idea being the quicker secession is accomplished by the south the stronger the statement. The next group was made up of southerners in the upper South with fewer slaves who wished to wait until a group effort by all the states was decided on before seceding. The last group was made up of those who sided with the North and were against secession completely, this seeming to be the group that Mr. Conrad would side with as he confirmed by stating: We have no faith whatever in the success of any southern confederacy of these States, except merely for the temporary object of mutual defense. South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas, being of the immediate secession group, all joined the rebellion with majority votes in their conventions soon after the election of President Abraham Lincoln. About the election of President Lincoln Mr. Conrad stated The election of Mr. Lincoln is recent, was unexpected, fortuitous, and if not already regretted by his supporters, will, in all probability, prove the destruction of his party. Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina also joined the cause with a majority but only after President Lincoln called for a move on South Carolina, being more of the second group. In Virginia the decision on secession was especially important because Virginians were so close to the North and the South at the same time. As Edward Ayers confirmed, More than half of the war's battles were waged with in Virginia's borders, making their decision especially critical. While Virginia did decide to ultimately secede the vote was deeply divided. The slaveholders, mainly living in the east, wanted to secede while the non slave holders in the west wanted to remain in the union. This division was one of the main causes for the creation of the separate Union state of West Virginia in 1863."],"display_date":"December 14, 1860","search_date":"1860-12-14","locations":[{"id":13839,"lat":39.2038567799,"lng":-78.2606208397,"zoom":9,"place":"FREDERICK, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3192,"title":"Threat of Conscription\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-02-15","end_date":"1864-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When Lizzie, granddaughter of the Gordon family living in Paris, Texas, wrote to her grandmother, she talked about the war.

There were many factors that led fathers, brothers, and sons, to become soldiers, and just as many reasons to evade the conscription laws.

In 1862, the Confederate State Congress passed a conscription law that called all men in the ages between 15 and 45 into service. Many men did voluntarily fight, and others followed the conscription law so that at one time there were more Texans fighting in the army than votes cast in any of the states elections. Although many Texans did fight in the war, the conscription policy proved detrimental to morale since many were forced to fight and others viewed the law as unconstitutional. "," While there were many men fighting, there were still a great number that evaded the war by leaving the country or paying for a substitute to take his place. In fact, conscription tended to force the older men who were settled and needed to stay ar home into finding a substitute. While many outwardly voiced disapproval to those who did not go and fight, newspapers were more frequently filled with bids ranging upwards of thousands of dollars to take another's place.

On the night of January 22, 1877, the Democrats of the West Virginian legislature held a caucus in Wheeling in order to place two candidates on the ballot in the coming Senate race. Both spots were open in the 1878 elections due to the death of Senator Caperton and the expiration of Senator Davis? term.

He owned the Staunton <em>Spectator</em> from 1856-1860. The <em>Spectator </em>reached many residents of Augusta County. He kept an extensive diary during his life, of which the years 1855-1865 are still preserved. On October 15, 1856, after having contemplated the hopeless Know-Nothing campaign of Millard Fillmore and having acknowledged the local impact of national politics, Waddell thought of the assessment of his father's property, earlier that day and gave an estimate of his own possessions. Among those, he noted his printing office, stocks, bonds, two of his slaves, furniture, silverware, and a slew of other commodities, totaling to an understated 8700. His slaves Selena and Moses were mentioned in the middle of Waddell's list of property, but later on in the diary entry, Waddell alluded to a moment earlier in the day when a Dr. McGill offered 1000 for Selena. Waddell wrote that he would not have sold Selena for 20,000, unless she desired to go, or had grossly misbehaved. He continued to espouse his philosophy that, Speculating on human flesh is utterly horrible to me and he explained that he wished slavery were extinct, yet claimed to be no abolitionist and advocated that he lived in a time when emancipation was not prudent."," There was a socially accepted hypocrisy for the slaveholding Southerners. Slaveholders, like Waddell, separated the morality of slavery and the slave market. The slave market was a disgusting profit-driven business, owned by those merchants of disease and disorder slave traders. Historian Walter Johnson illuminates the contradiction that slaveholders could sell slaves as well, but believed that it was not with the intent of making a profit; there was always a noncommercial reason for selling a slave. This invisible line provided enough self-justification for slaveholders to shift the guilt of human exploitation onto those slave traders. Slaveholders were able to control and decide the actions of their slaves because they were property. The hypocrisy lies in the question, if slave traders only sold sub-human property, then why the disgust with slave traders? And if slave traders were trading people, not just property, than how could slaveholders justify owning people?

The legislature furiously answered on November 19, 1815, with a condemning resolution absolutely denying the right of the courts to rule the acts of the state legislature invalid.  The resolution did not specifically mention which acts the Superior Court ruled unconstitutional simply because the Georgia House had no concern for the specific policy ramifications of the actions of the Court.  Instead, the House sought to absolutely deny the right of the Court to rule any act that the Legislature passed unconstitutional, regardless of the contents of the laws in question.","According to the Legislature, the Court had begun usurping their power the moment that it assembled without direction of the Legislature.  During this session, the Court ruled against a wide array of local judges and legislative acts.  The Georgia House of Representatives declared in its resolution that each of these rulings were void because the Superior Court did not have the standing to try any of the cases. ","The resolution continued, declaring that the actions of the judiciary even usurped the power of the citizens of Georgia.  They claimed that only the legislature has the ability to represent the people because it is the only branch directly elected by the people.  In contrast, the unelected judicial branch simply represented a potentially totalitarian body that could not be controlled through the democratic process.  Because of their institutional inability to check the judicial branch, the Georgia House of Representatives had no choice but to condemn the Court publicly.","With a vote of 40 to 35, the Georgia House of Representatives rejected the Superior Court's power to rule on the constitutionality of the actions of the Legislature and declared that the Georgia Superior Court should never again wrest the power of the good citizens of this state through such rulings.  Finally, and most condemningly, the Georgia House recommended a candid examination of the United States Constitution as well as the Georgia Constitution for a better understanding of the court's position in relation to the legislative branch of government.  At the time, no precedent existed regarding whether the state judiciary should simply focus solely on its own state constitution or on the Constitution of the United States as well.  The Georgia House of Representatives concluded that the Georgia Superior Court should re-evaluate both.","The ongoing struggle for power between the judicial, legislative, and executive branches winds its way in and out of American history.  Few powers in the United States Constitution are as vague as that of judicial review, or the power of the judiciary to review the acts of the legislature and executive and rule on their constitutionality.  Even the Founders were split.  While James Madison, the author of the Constitution, favored judicial review, Thomas Jefferson feared it.  ","Georgia's Superior Court, however, did not act entirely out of historical context.  Other state courts had declared their power of judicial review in the twenty eight years of governance under the United States Constitution.  <em>Marbury v. Madison</em>, which was ruled 12 years before this specific controversy in Georgia, declared that the United States Supreme Court had the power of judicial review over the federal government.  On the state level, the Georgia Constitution's language in Article III, Section One seems to mirror that of the federal constitution, and, according to Chief Justice John Marshall, this type of constitutional language allows for the courts to rule acts of the other two branches of government unconstitutional.  However, Chief Justice Marshall's ruling in <em>Marbury</em> did not put the controversy of judicial review to rest.  Many lawyers at the state and federal level did not believe that Marbury settled the judicial review controversy once and for all. ","In this way, the debate between the Georgia House of Representatives and the Georgia Superior Court fits perfectly into the national debate on judicial review.  The Georgia Superior Court exerted its power to declare the acts of the Georgia legislature null and void.  Like other legislatures across the nation, the Georgia House of Representatives vengefully denied the court's usurpation of power in this condemning resolution."],"display_date":"January 13, 1815 - November 19, 1815","search_date":"1815-06-17","locations":[{"id":1521,"lat":33.0753708914,"lng":-83.2660648937,"zoom":10,"place":"BALDWIN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3210,"title":"The State Seal: A Symbol of Revolution\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-03-30","end_date":"1861-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The bird of liberty sat perched on top of a Magnolia, waiting to strike a cautiously approaching serpent that threatened the safety of her nest.

One attempt to coexist with the Indians was through the creation of reservations. Some Indians were able to acclimate, while others with a more nomadic lifestyle found it quite difficult. Tensions continued between the Indians and settlers as more settlers encroached on the reservation land and Indians continued to raid and roam throughout Texas and Mexico. In fact, the dangerous raids and attacks performed by the Indians forced several local volunteer units and the United States army to become involved.

Mobley's main focus centered on how both of the national parties, democrats or republicans, could not be counted on to aid farmers.

The farmers of the Populist Party took different economic actions to aid them in their fight for stronger agriculture in America.

Making his way through a swampy pine barren, Ruffin found little trace of any cultivation or civilized inhabitation. The few people in the area raised cattle and, since their animals grazed on the open land, the concept of property ownership was completely foreign to these miserable people. Ruffin scorned the crude capitalists, for some of them owned 500 to 1,000 head of cattle and not a single acre of land. In his private diary, Ruffin noted that these men belonged to a peculiar class: In about a space of 10 miles square of Williamsburg and Georgetown districts, the inhabitants are wretchedly poor, have no slaves, scarcely any other property, and almost no agricultural labor or regular industry of any kind. The men live by hunting, often helped out by petty pillage or trespass on the neighboring properties. These people, and even the more industrious and honest of the poor in lower S. Ca. are a most wretched and worthless population - compared to those whose condition that of the slaves is one not only of greatly superior comfort and happiness, but also of respectability and dignity.","Edmund Ruffin had been commissioned by James Hammond, then governor of South Carolina, to perform an agricultural and geological survey of the state. Ruffin had developed new methods of using calcerous manures to improve the fertility of soil, and some South Carolinians hoped that agricultural reform would help develop the economy and preserve the institution of slavery. Ruffin was always a renowned advocate for secession and an ardent believer in the inferiority of the black race.","Ruffin's disdain for the poor whites of South Carolina's coastal plain demonstrates the power of class in antebellum society. Notions of class were always intertwined with the institution of slavery. In his account, Ruffin immediately emphasized that these people owned no slaves, consigning themselves to a pitiful class. But as Stephanie McCurry demonstrates in <em>Masters of Small Worlds</em>, the intricate relationships of power within the yeoman household were just as significant as those more conspicuous class tensions between plantation owners and yeoman farmers. Poor white men set boundaries of power within their household that defined the roles of their wives and their laborers. The yeomen and the powerful planters of the low country were not socioeconomic equals, but they shared a position of power over their respective households, a power rooted in gendered symbols of inequality, command over dependents, and a fundamental assertion of manly independence."],"display_date":"March 31, 1843","search_date":"1843-03-31","locations":[{"id":11523,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3296,"title":"Union Sentiment in Mississippi\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-05-21","end_date":"1862-05-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dedication to one's state and the Confederacy was of utmost importance to citizens of the South during the Civil War. Union sentiment or the suggestion of a peace negotiation with the Federal Government was considered an abomination among stanch Southern Confederates, including women. However, Unionists did exist on the southern home front, a struggle that pitted families and neighbors against one another (Sutherland, 3). In many of the border states, such as Missouri, guerilla warfare broke out between friends and neighbors. Confederate Bushwhackers took up arms against Unionist Jayhawkers. This armed conflict was not suffered everywhere, but the strife between the two sentiments was felt across the South. Often, neighbors found themselves at odds with one another. "," In her May 21, 1862 diary entry, Kate Carney of Yazoo, Mississippi recounted a story in which she rebuked a fellow community member, a man named Tally, for signing a petition in favor of Mississippi returning to the Union. Carney recounts, Cousin Ann & I went to the store and I asked Tally about putting his name to the paper requesting the State go back into the Union. He seemed proud of it when I first asked him, but I gave him such a big piece of my mind and talked so fast he couldn't say much....I had a good time raking Tally over about being a Union man.  "," Both women and men across the South prided themselves in their allegiance to the Confederacy. Kate S. Carney was one of them. For her, the War was a matter of life and death. O how I do hope our Confederacy may be victorious in the end, she divulges, I can't conceive of defeat being possible. What would I do if the last spark of hope was extinct? Carney's attack on Tally, who was more interested in peace with the Union than a fight to the death, was a response to her sensational dedication to the South. Union sentiment within a southern community was viewed as treacherous and, in Tally's case, blatantly attacked. Devotion to the Confederacy was of utmost importance. Whenever and wherever unionist feelings were divulged, conflict and resistance arose, as the incident recorded in Carney's diary illustrates."],"display_date":"May 21, 1862","search_date":"1862-05-21","locations":[{"id":7357,"lat":32.8110245687,"lng":-90.414506221,"zoom":9,"place":"YAZOO, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3301,"title":"A Strike at the Docks\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-01-15","end_date":"1887-01-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad Company lay powerless, while over 300 mostly black dockworkers armed themselves with any object they could find. Once organized, they forced their way through the barricaded doors of Pier 2. Now inside the docks, they struck out at the scabs, filling their jobs, and ravaged the offices, where they stole a barrel of whiskey. The effects of their new capture only further soured their demeanor, and resulted in them acting like demons. The dockhands' violence emerged as the culmination of a strike, led by a man named Kelly, a member of the Knights of Labor. Effectively organized, the workers had gone on strike for higher wages, but had received no promise from the Company's agent, Col. Bremond, who claimed to lack the proper wage authority. This disappointment prompted the reckless decision to break into the pier, and subsequently, a Warwick County judge's call for five companies of armed troops. The military unit, of both white and black companies, quickly restored order and forced the rioters to disassemble. Accepting failure, many of the dockhands hoped to eventually to return to work for the railroad company. "," The Knights of Labor emerged in the early 1880's in response to the Industrial Revolution, opposing the increasing trend of concentrated corporate power and monopoly in American business. Though more popular in the North (Kelly hailed from New York), union leaders did travel throughout the South, organizing whites and blacks, and men and women. By 1886, the Knights could claim over 50,000 members, spread out over 10 Southern states. This particular strike resembled typical labor disputes led by the Knights, in that they usually demanded a combination of better wages, better working conditions, or shorter workdays. In fact, the Newport News strike existed as one of twenty-two different strikes by the Southern Knights during that decade, but like Newport News, few affected any measure of change."," Very unique to the Knights of Labor, blacks and whites were treated as equals, despite most leadership still remaining white. Yet, compared to other Gilded Age organizations, such as the Farmer's Alliance, the Knights appeared remarkably interracial. Blacks of the Farmer's Alliance would actually comment on the differences when the two unions formed a tenuous alliance in 1889. An Era of Good Feelings existed for the black and white workingmen in the organization, as interracial solidarity and democratic idealism were fearlessly proclaimed. Sadly, this feature contributed to the union's downfall, as newspapers, across the country, attacked the group for blurring the color line. Coupled with failed strikes and uncooperative economic conditions, by the turn of the century, the Knights had faded out of sight. In their place, though, would emerge the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and its leader, Samuel Gompers. Hoping to organize resistance to affect the same types of changes, this union chose to exclude blacks, preferring that they form their own organization.

It was July of 1858 and Davis was giving a speech to the citizens of Maine about the importance of the unity of the country. The <em>Pittsfield Sun</em> recounted the substance of his speech. Davis spoke of the differences between Maine and Mississippi and explained that these differences between the all of the states are what made the United States unique. He expressed how each state had something different to offer the Nation, which made their unity as a country more crucial. Only three years after this eloquent speech in Maine, Jefferson Davis ironically found himself seated in Richmond, Virginia as the President of the Confederate States of America. Davis' speech in 1858 gives evidence to the fact that he and his fellow Mississippians had no clue a major war that would divide the nation was in the making. In 1858, Mississippi and the rest of the South considered themselves part of the great United States. These citizens prided themselves in their state's attributes and differences and worked to use them for the advancement of the nation as a whole.

The men divided themselves into committees on issues ranging from education to temperance. On the final evening each committee presented their resolutions on the individual concerns addressed at the convention. The most extensive and detailed solutions addressed the criminal justice and education systems. They advocated a change in the jury system that would allow the participation of black men. They also sought regulations for chain gangs and prison life and the adoption of an anti-lynching law. In education, the men desired a six-month school year, and more private and public funding for schools, especially from the state. The men researched other important issues and reported, although following the convention, no significant public changes were made. Following the Civil War and the ending of slavery, whites needed a new way to cope with free blacks in the society. They solved this problem by adopting Jim Crow laws and segregation policies. While almost all aspects of public life became segregated in the South, education and the criminal justice system were two of the most intensely separated between the races. Schools differed among blacks and whites on the school year, funding, and facilities. White children attended school for six months, three months longer than black children. The white schools also received the majority of the state's education budget for new schools, textbooks, and materials. The remaining money in the budget was given to black schools, which was barely sufficient to keep schools running. The criminal justice system was just as poorly run. Georgia employed a chain gang and the prisons housed predominantly black convicts. The criminals were held at the mercy of white guards and officials who had no hesitation in allowing the prevalence of assault, hunger, sex, inadequate clothing, and even disease. It was not uncommon for guards to hire out black prisoners for labor-an arrangement that resembled slavery.

Looking at Virginia's entire 2 district (heavily African American), which included these Tidewater counties, Democrats appeared to have netted about 4,000 votes, greatly slimming the opposition's lead. Sensing the reaction of Mahone's Readjuster Party, which commanded the Virginian Republican vote, the Democrats planned appropriately. Contacting a renowned gunsmith in Portsmouth, they ordered fifty new Winchester rifles, to be strategically dispersed near important voting precincts. Along with the men unafraid to use these guns, this stern measure of intimidation hoped to discourage white Mahonite leaders from inciting the newly disenfranchised black voters to attack the polling places. Celebrating such an important political gain, Southampton Democrats held a large rally at Newsome's farm attended by great numbers of local farmers. "," Virginia's Reconstruction Constitution in 1869 gave blacks and previously disenfranchised poor whites the right to vote, thus largely expanding the electorate in what had been the South's largest slave holding state. Virginia politics during Reconstruction differed from that of most other former-Confederate states, as no real Republican party emerged. Rather, the Readjuster party took up many Republican platforms, and quickly became the party of the African American vote. The Readjusters combined the black vote with that of the poor whites, and it appeared as if a coalition, capable of challenging the white ruling elite, had finally arisen. Sensing disaster, the Democrats began to couch their political appeals in the late 1880's in strictly racial terms, hoping to appeal to a sense of white solidarity. As they defended themselves from the Readjuster onslaught, Democrats also sought to disenfranchise blacks, thereby stifling a future biracial coalition. "," Unfortunately for the Democrats, the Fifteenth Amendment made it very difficult to restrict the right to vote for race-based reasons at face value. Thus, in this period of Redemption, election officials (most often Democrats themselves) would employ registration and election restrictions that they knew targeted blacks and, subsequently, some poor whites. Oftentimes, they would also commit outright voter fraud by stealing ballots, stuffing ballot boxes, or erasing names from the registration. Virginia also adopted the Australian ballot, aimed at confusing those who could not read, by not listing party names next to candidates, and giving voters less than two minutes in the voting booth. Nonetheless, black leaders, especially in the Tidewater area, continued to resist such coercive measures by flooding the polls with blacks, even if their votes were not being counted. "," Motivated, predominately, by the desire to more effectively hinder the black vote, Virginia, and other Southern states, underwent constitutional conventions in the 1890's. Resulting in residency requirements, grandfather clauses, and poll taxes, the South crippled the non-Democratic vote, evidenced by the drastic decline in voter turnout. Whereas 75 percent of eligible voters voted in 1890, this figure dived to 33 percent by 1900. Outright intimidation, though rare, also would emerge in the form of the Klu Klux Klan and the Red Shirts, vigilante groups who ensured few blacks would slip through the cracks. In Virginia's eastern counties, resistance to such Democratic injustice could also spell doom at the hands of newly purchased Winchester rifles.

The general assembly failed to pass a law that would prohibit anyone under the age of 13 from working in cotton factories. The Savannah Press was disturbed by the actions taken by the legislators in Georgia. The general assembly's actions showed that the need for production outweighed the importance of fair labor standards. ","During the nineteenth century many farmers planed cotton throughout the South. In Georgia, cotton was one of the main cash crops. Before the Civil War slaves worked on cotton plantations which attempted to meet the great national and international consumer need for the product. After the Civil War, freedom was declared for African Americans and many plantation owners lost much of their labor force. The owners of plantations needed people to work the land in order to make sure the need for cotton was met. At the time of the industrialization of America the cotton industry grew, and cotton factories were built throughout the South. Cotton manufacturers needed workers in these factories, and the age of the worker did not seem to matter. Manufacturers were willing to employ anyone and the age or the person did not matter. It seemed to the Savannah Press that the necessity for cotton outweighed moral values of the employers who ran the cotton factories. Employers tended to depend on women and children who were under the age of 16 as the main source of the labor force. One textile executive stated that many employers took no regard as to who should work and how many hours a person should work. The legislators in Georgia seemed to agree with the cotton factory employers on the idea that having as many workers as possible in order to meet the demand for cotton was of the utmost importance.

The article said that lately the officers who were supposed to keep the South in line had begun to overstep their original duties and were getting involved in both civil and local matters in the city. The president had apologized for the officer?s actions and said he was unaware of what had been going on. He also said from then on, the officers would only be able to act after receiving specific permission from him. However, most of the Mississippians were skeptical of this apology and were not satisfied with it. The only person who could have allowed such things to happen was the president; therefore, he had to have known about what the officers were doing. "," This recent series of events angered most of the citizens in Vicksburg as well as Mississippi. As if the original duties of the military occupation were not enough, when the officers began to interfere with matters that the states were originally supposed to deal with, the people became upset. In their eyes, the occupation was overcoming the idea of a Republican form of government and was being taken over by an unlicensed military power. "," After the war, Congress came to the conclusion that the best way to punish the South while also fixing their problems, was to have a military occupation throughout the major cities. This went along with other provisions for readmission into the union. The military rule was supposed to only be a temporary thing to keep the peace and make sure the South did not rebel again. All of the terms had been drawn up in what was known as The Reconstruction Act. However, the military was supposed to remain subordinate to civilian authorities.

While the Democrats had already taken over the Georgia state legislature as early as 1870, the party wished to appease any fears that black citizens may have about the end of Republican rule.  On November 12, 1884, the <em>Savannah News </em>contained an article titled A Word to the Colored People, written by an unnamed Democratic party member.  The author ensured black citizens that they need have no fears that there will be any attempt by the Democratic party to abridge any of the rights and privileges which they gained after the Civil War.  In fact, he insisted that the Democrats were much more willing to help blacks further their condition in the South than the Republicans ever were.  With the Democrats in control, the opportunities of colored men to advance as their race increases in intelligence and improves its condition, will be far greater than they are at present.  ","The article demonstrates the Democratic party's attempt to secure the black citizens' support.  Blacks represented a huge percentage of the South, and had the potential to influence politics.  African Americans composed a majority of the Republican Party's support.  In reaction, the Democrats' political goals included limiting the power of black citizens through instituting poll taxes and new registration requirements.  By communicating their acknowledgement of black enfranchisement, Democrats attempted to detract electoral support from the Republicans.  This movement of Democrats to increase black support for the party was called the New Departure.  However, Democrats were more successful at detracting political support from the Republicans by encouraging dissension and factions within the party.

In it, a gentleman from Natchitoches, Louisiana reported that the Chief of the Caddo Indian Confederacy was plotting a conspiracy with the Spanish officials in Texas. Despite having traveled into the province on mercantile business, the Chief returned spouting adoration for King Ferdinand VII and boasting of his new title: Generalisimo of all the Indian tribes resident beyond the celebrated Arrayo Honde, between [Natchitoches] and the Sabine. All travelers in this area were subject to arrest by this new minister of the Spanish monarch. The citizens of Natchitoches feared the consequences. Their town was located only a short six miles from Arrayo Honde. The author of the letter feared increased violence and Indian attacks against townspeople and adventurous Americans, as well as the encumbrance of Spanish authority in what he believed to be American lands.","Until 1819, the Spanish still laid claims to the lands of Louisiana just east of the Sabine River up to the Arrayo Honde, a tributary of the Red River, while Americans held that the Sabine maintained the border between Spanish Texas and American Louisiana. During Thomas Jefferson's presidency, the United States acquired the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon, who approved the sale to promote war against Britain. The territory of Louisiana had only just changed from Spanish to French hands through the treaty of San Ildefonso three years earlier. Neither the French nor the Americans attempted to define the borders of the territory until the treaty was signed in 1803, at which point, the French foreign minister replied, I can give you no direction. You have made a noble bargain for yourselves, and I suppose you will make the most of it. ","For the next two decades, the Spanish in Texas and the Americans migrating into Louisiana wrestled over land. The treaty did not define the western border of the Louisiana Territory, so the Spanish sought means to push their claim and authority further east, through individuals like the Caddo Chief, while American settlers pushed back with equal force. The Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819 solved these struggles. It gave up American claims to Texas and Spanish claims east of the Sabine. Despite opposition from westerners who steamed over the loss of Texas, support for the treaty was unanimous in Congress.","This episode demonstrated a significant disjunction between the federal government's concerns and the desires of the American people actually living on the frontier in Louisiana. The author stated somewhat sardonically, How far this affair may require the interpolation of government, government will best determine; but be assured we consider it a matter of considerable importance. The author's tone and comments dripped with disdain for a government that seemed unconnected with his needs. The sense that the people actually living in these borderlands might need to defend their own rights because their government was unable or unwilling to do so permeated throughout the letter. This suggests that the people living in the West were unimpressed with a government that could not keep up with their demands for more land or negotiate effectively to solidify ownership of territory which people living on the frontier believed should belong to them."],"display_date":"February 10, 1817","search_date":"1817-02-10","locations":[{"id":5585,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"NATCHITOCHES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3391,"title":"Col.

M'Duffie was a congressman for South Carolina at the time, and would later become governor of the state. Original reports sent back to Charleston anticipated that M'Duffie would die from his wound. The next day two letters were received, one from M'Duffie and another from a friend, both claiming that M'Duffie was stable and that they were slowly making the return home.

Greenberg argues that an attack on one's honor (usually, by claiming that he is a liar) is what leads to a duel, not the actual issue over which the original dispute was based. To not duel when challenged would mean that one does not care enough to refute an accusation of lying, and is considered very disgraceful. Honor was such an important institution in Southern society that to lose it would be a severe handicap in the professional, social, and political realms.

The newspapers prior to the Civil War are full of reminders that not all people were in fact equal. Two adds in The Valley Star (the primary newspaper in Lexington, Virginia) were surprisingly similar: one describing a lost horse and the other a lost slave. In Virginia at the time, the two were very similar. Both were considered property and both influenced the livelihood of a farmer. Although many southern planters did feel that slavery was unjust, they could not imagine life without it. The main reason the South was in such disrepair after the Civil War was because the ruling class, the slaveholders, had completely lost its livelihood. The war had taken their property.","On January 18, 1949, Clayton Coleman published an ad in The Valley Star concerning his runaway. LOOK OUT FOR A RUNAWAY 50 REWARD. My man GILES, who calls himself GILES BURLEY, left my plantation in Louisa County, Virginia, on the 3rd day of January. He has gone over the mountains, in company with some of the many hirelings. He described Burley's appearance in great detail, down to the amount of money that he was probably carrying.","At the time, slave trade was a legitimate profession. The traders were not considered to be the nicest of men, but it was a business, and they were in it to make money. Local traders would start small, and gradually build their enterprises. Sales were commonly made from farm to farm within a region. An ad directly above the aforementioned runaway notice declared a sale of slaves because of the owner's death. The attorney auctioned off ten slaves, including a mother and her three boys under the age of 9. It is presumed that this family would be split among different farms in the region; a reality that was a constant incentive for slaves to behave. ","With the Compromise of 1850 came a tightening of the Fugitive Slave Act. Anyone who helped a slave escape would be punished. Northern abolitionists found this to be preposterous; in fact, both the North and the South hated the compromise. Most northerners simply refused to follow the Fugitive Slave Act, and if they had been helping runaways prior to 1850, they continued."],"display_date":"February 26, 1849","search_date":"1849-02-26","locations":[{"id":14232,"lat":37.8159085737,"lng":-79.4457347683,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCKBRIDGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3409,"title":"A Day of Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-08-21","end_date":"1863-08-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On Friday August 21, 1863, Reverend Stephen Elliot delivered a sermon to Christ Church in Savannah, Georgia. In his sermon, Elliot compared the plight of Southern citizens to that of the biblical figure Ezra who is thought to have led 5,000 Israelite exiles living in Babylon to Jerusalem in 459 B.C. As quoted from Elliot?s sermon, ?We find ourselves in a condition which calls for a wisdom superior to our own, for a power greater than we can control. A day of darkness and of gloominess has unexpectedly settled down upon us, and without being able to perceive any natural causes sufficient to account for it, we are conscious that ?our hands hang down and that our knees are feeble,? and that we are in peril of our cause.?"," Southerners assumed God was fighting on their side during the Civil War. But even believing this, many white citizens of the South still needed to be reassured from time to time. In the spring of 1863 the Confederacy had started to turn the tide on the war against the Union with military triumphs in Virginia at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville while Southern forces moved north into the underbelly of Pennsylvania. But following a crushing defeat at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania in early July and a hasty retreat back across the Mason-Dixon Line, Southern spirits in late August of 1863 were low. "," Perhaps sensing this, Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States of America, issued a proclamation that declared Friday August 21, 1863 ?a day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer.? Davis asked that all ?people who believeth that the Lord reigneth and that his overruling Providence ordereth all things--to unite in prayer and humble submission under his chastening hand, and to beseech his favor on our suffering country.? "," Elliot?s sermon was delivered in accordance with Davis? proclamation but it was not the first time that the Confederate war effort was aided through the involvement of religious denominations. In Georgia, church congregations collected goods and supplies and distributed them amongst Confederate soldiers. Preachers, like Elliot, who was elected the first Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Diocese of Georgia in 1840, often propagated intense biblical ideologies, tying the Confederate struggle against the Northern oppressors to that of a Holy crusade. Religious revivals were also frequently held as a means to boost morale. "," Citizens in the South took heavy solace in the belief that God, a higher power, was watching over their struggle. In times of vulnerability, it was not uncommon for citizens of any stature to turn to the Lord in search of comfort and vindication of their religious convictions."],"display_date":"August 21, 1863","search_date":"1863-08-21","locations":[{"id":1632,"lat":31.9014449767,"lng":-81.1192880728,"zoom":9,"place":"CHATHAM, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3410,"title":"A Change in Direction\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-01-06","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["1897 was an important year for the educational system of Maryland, and subsequently, the South as a whole. Mayor Hooper of Baltimore, Maryland was becoming upset with the members of the school board. He strongly felt that the board of school commissioners were becoming too political in their decisions and straying from the board's intent to deliver the best quality of education to all public schools. City Counselor Hayes and City Solicitor Elliot supported Mayor Hooper's decision. They believe that the object is to take the schools out of politics and to place them on a strictly educational basis, so as to benefit the children, and, in fact, the whole community. The city was finally ready for a new direction and an expansion of the realm of government in this specific realm. Besides creating a new board, Mayor Hooper wanted to ensure that the board members cared about education as a whole, rather than trying to priveledge a select few. For that, he selected Dr. Lillian M. Weish, to grant recognition to female children. However when asked, he chose not to select a person of color to the new board.","Why did Mayor Hooper grant a proxy for all demographics, except blacks? Not to downgrade his act to relocate education away from the reach of politicians, but to disregard the interests of a key group is unsettling. Later that year, the board decided to rename one of its schools, and thus input more money into the educational program there. The Colored Polytechnic Institute was the first free black school to teach practical knowledge to its students. Though nearly nine years after its white counterpart was established, blacks were finally given a chance to make something of themselves. Upon face value, one would believe that the Board of Commissioners of Public Schools in Baltimore was doing a service to the black community for now attempting to recognize that the South's best interest included the interests of their kids, as well as blacks. However, the public might have interpreted the new institute not only as a strengthening force, but also as one of perpetual enslavement. Ayers recognized that the new school could possibly reinforce blacks to look for professions involving manual labor and appropriate education for blacks, rather than educating them in literature and music.","At the heart of this narrative, we can see the subtle changes in the thought process of Southern States in the late 19th century. Though Mayor Hoover deliberately decided not to place a person of color on the school board, his decision to choose safe and intelligent citizens to represent the interests of society is quite admirable. Correctly, then the board gave blacks an opportunity to gain experience through a technical school.

The only trouble was that the United States government had not declared war against Spain. In fact, the governments of the United States and Spain were currently attempting to ratify a treaty outlining once and for all the borders between American Louisiana and Spanish Texas. This band of adventurers did not have the authority to attack Texas, and yet, until the end of July of that year, news of military preparation against Texas persistently crept east to Baltimore, Boston, and Washington, D.C. On July 19, the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> poked fun at the brazen upstarts, who they believed to have been duped into joining the expedition to fight along side the famous guerilla leader, Xavier Mina.","Xavier Mina was forced to flee Spain in 1814 when he opposed the restored Spanish monarch, Ferdinand VII. Mina then attempted to attack Ferdinand VII through an invasion of Spanish Mexico. His efforts were thwarted and he was executed by firing squad on November 11, 1817. A contingent of his force against the Spanish was led by American Colonel Henry Perry. Perry also died in the attempted coup; only four of his men escaped the battle that claimed their commander's life and eventually made their way to Natchitoches, Louisiana. ","Presumably, it was these survivors, and other Americans like them who had lived under and fought against the Spanish government in Texas, that rallied their neighbors in a renewed revolutionary attempt, calling on the name of Mina to consolidate support for their cause. While the <em>Intelligencer </em>felt compelled to certify Xavier Mina's death and express annoyance over the third attempt to resurrect him in the name of raising recruits, the <em>Baltimore Telegraph</em> vehemently supported the expedition.

When this process was complete and Tennessee was admitted into the union he was offered a seat in the House of Representatives but later transferred to the United States senate.

The specific concern those in meeting grappled with was the fact that in March 1827 the General Assembly provided a charter for corporation in Virginia to the Maryland-based Baltimore and Ohio Railroad company. The railroad would have great freedom in choosing what land to occupy, which threatened to intensify intra-regional competitions within the state. Of additional concern, the railroad could obtain a virtual monopoly of land in those counties it chose, and thereby directly threaten the state government's jurisdiction. The railroad or any other State who may, in an unguarded moment, acquire an interest and influence subversive of the great and permanent rights, influences and power of our government was how Virginians like John Coalter of Stafford phrased the problem. It was Coalter who prompted the meeting by circulating an editorial in the state's leading newspapers. He entreated editors to notify the public of the summit, in order that there may be some concert, and as general a meeting procured, from every section of the State.","Internal improvements, which included canals, toll roads, and eventually railroads, were not an all a new consideration to Virginians in the early nineteenth century. In the 1780s George Washington had initiated plans to build a canal connecting the Chesapeake Bay and the Ohio Valley, and to drain the Great Dismal Swamp. The state government chartered several road and canal by 1815, many of which connected the growing Valley region in western Virginia with the Tidewater and Piedmont parts of the state. In these early years, capital for improvement projects in Virginia was raised by public stock companies. Once chartered by act of the state assembly, a company would offer a certain number of shares to private investors. The state government also typically purchased an initial stake in these companies, somewhere between ten and twenty percent. But until the 1820s, the state did not provide any more than that partial financial support. That dynamic would change by the late 1820s. In its previous history, Virginia had generally avoided incurring state debt. The state owed some money to the federal government for the War of 1812, but paid this off by 1826. But that is precisely when the issue of internal improvements heated up. In the next twelve years, Virginia went over six million dollars into debt to encourage the growth of canal and railroad companies within its borders. Baltimore and Ohio was one of the largest beneficiaries."," The financing of internal improvements had become an issue of national scope. Eleven new states, most of which were located in the Mississippi basin, had joined the Union by 1821. Whereas Virginia earlier tried to link the eastern and western parts of the state, now the Americans tried to economically link East and West on the national scale. States directly competed with one another to attract railroad companies. Virginians saw themselves in competition with Pennsylvania and Maryland.

Newspapers kept citizens up to date with daily progress by their American troops south of the border, including lists of the casualties as well as those enlisting. New Orleans residents opened up their <em>Times Picayune</em>s the morning of July 8 to read a familiar notice, entitled Departure of Troops. It announced that the steamship New Orleans, along with her captain, Captain Auld, had departed from the city the previous night, headed for Mexico. On board was a full ship's worth of passengers, both men and animals. The full inventory consisted of 151 horses, Captain Dobbius' company 4th Infantry, Captain Featherstone's company Louisiana Volunteers and 50 quartermaster's men."," These men were leaving behind the humid, crowded and filthy streets of New Orleans for another undesirable location: a war zone close to Mexico City, Mexico. They arrived back on land likely just in time to play a part in the last major battle of the Mexican War at Contreras. At this site, Mexico sustained over 700 casualties while the United States walked away with a mere 60. The Mexican War officially began on April 25, 1846, when Mexicans opened fire on Americans in southern Texas. Although the Mexicans appeared to start the war in the sense that they did fire the first shots, Americans can be considered the true instigator: Texas had declared itself to be an independent republic from Mexico in 1835, but it essentially remained Mexican territory until the United States annexed it ten years later. "," This annexation may have been a conscious part on then-President Polk's part to actively cause a war with the intention of winning and gaining land. After all, Mexico had plenty of territory after which the United States lusted, and America did emerge from the war with both California and parts of the modern day Southwest. This war did not have the same urgency that past wars fought on American soil had had: never were the war strategizers worried that they would lose. The United States was cool and collected in comparison to the disorganized and flustered Mexican government, and the possibility of anything but a victory seemed remote at best. Regardless of the United States' confidence, they continued to battle bravely in Mexico. A year prior to Captain Auld's departure for Mexico, the Mexican President had claimed that his soldiers would not only regain control of Texas, but also work their way into the existing states - a few cities in Louisiana in particular. This direct threat to New Orleans likely prompted the strong turn-out. Although veterans were not eager to jump back into battle, the memory of those Mexican War victories probably gave the Confederates a sense of confidence when it came time to face their own countrymen a decade later."],"display_date":"July 8, 1847","search_date":"1847-07-08","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3450,"title":"Perry&#39;s Detainment\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-01-01","end_date":"1831-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["An unidentified man named Perry (likely a relative of James Perry) had finally arrived in Texas. As he is mentioned in a letter to James Perry, who had a number of business interests in Texas, it is probable that he was there in a role of some relation to James Perry's investments. Unfortunately for Perry, the winter of 1831 was the worst winter that Texas had experienced for several years. Upon disembarking from his boat, he intended to venture further on into the settlements, but was detained for four days by bad weather and high water. Perry was, of course, not the only one to suffer from the adverse weather conditions and their effects on the local road systems. ","William Hunter, James Perry's agent who had been running his business in Texas commented upon the economically pernicious results of the impassable roadways. Hunter related to James Perry that he had only been able to transport two loads of their goods up from the river where they were deposited by boat. He declared that he was verry much disappointed in getting hauling done because a team that had started to the river for a load the previous week had returned empty-handed. He further noted that one or two teams were mired down on the roadways at the time. This development was clearly economically damaging, as Hunter could not sell goods that he didn't have in his possession. He lamented that if his goods had arrived before the bad weather, he could have done a good business. Like the financial fortunes of Perry and Hunter, the economic well being of the South was highly dependent on roads and other means of transportation. Well-kept roads were crucial for the shipment of goods, especially from rural areas to urban centers where they could be sold or shipped to larger markets. As a result, local governments communities throughout the South put much emphasis on road maintenance even at a time where municipal services were few. An excellent example of this facet of community cooperation occurred in Virginia's Prince Edward County. As noted in Israel on the Appomatox, the Prince Edward county court expended considerable effort responding to petitions for new roadways. Also, county surveyors, or citizens in charge of certain sections of road were enlisted for general maintenance of thoroughfares. These surveyors had the power to conscript other men's slaves (and free blacks) for several days each year in the interest of improving roads. The yearly cleanup allowed for uninhibited commerce along the county's highways and byways. Because the economy of the South produced primarily agricultural goods that had to be shipped for sale, good systems of transportation were crucial. In addition to roads, transportation throughout the South was carried out by other means such as boats or, later on, railroads. However, at the time of Perry's detainment by muddy paths, Texas was little more than a collection of settlements strung together by roads that were clearly inadequate for year-round business."],"display_date":1831,"search_date":"1831-07-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3458,"title":"Moses Austin&#39;s Final Move\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1830-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Moses Austin had been dead nine years when his final move came about. The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one. From politics to economics and the social realm, religion was an important influence in the South."],"display_date":1830,"search_date":"1830-07-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3471,"title":"Mr. Brown and the Indians\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-01-13","end_date":"1831-01-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Mr. Brown's absence was a strain on the family that he left behind. Taking care of day-to-day business without a husband and father in the rough settlement of San Felipe de Austin was not an easy feat. The pressures upon the family increased as time went by, and the news of him they received after his absence spanned one month was not heartening. Brown was taking part in an exploration of the upper colonies of Texas, and his party's horses were stolen in an Indian raid. However, the settlers vowed to pursue the marauders and not to return until their stolen property was recovered. Additionally disturbing was the fact that Indians had recently committed several such attacks in the upper colonies. ","The fact that even in the sparsely populated lands of Mexico's northern colonies Brown and other Anglo-Americans were involved in conflicts with Indians was indicative of the Indians' struggles within the United States. Interestingly, the Indians of the upper colonies were not all native to the area. In fact, as a result of persecution within the United States, many of the Indians with whom the Anglo-American settlers interacted were displaced members of the Cherokee tribe. After the American Revolution, a large number of Cherokee left their traditional homes in the southeastern part of the United States, and moved west to Louisiana, then owned by the far more welcoming Spanish. As time passed, more and more Cherokee who found their eastern homes encroached upon by white settlers joined their tribal brethren to the west. Following the U.S. purchase of Louisiana, many Cherokee again moved, now seeking to live under the friendlier Spanish government in Texas. As time passed, Anglo-American settlers as well as the Spanish government again threatened the Cherokee Indians. Cherokee leaders actually applied for a formal land grant in order to legally secure their lands from other settlers, but they correctly interpreted repeated delays in their application's approval as a portent of eventual rejection. By 1826, the Cherokee were desperate enough to take part in an armed insurrection against the Mexican government, along with some Anglo-American settlers and other indigenous groups. The revolt was crushed by Mexican troops with the aid of volunteers from the more established American colonies. ","The plight of the Cherokee in Texas was merely a later chapter in their great struggle resulting from the colonization of their native lands. Throughout the history of the South, Indians occupied large portions of the region's soil and directly influenced politics, agriculture, and other aspects of Southern life. It was not until approximately 30 years before the Civil War that the Indian populations of the South were forcibly removed from the area. However, with the continual westward movement of settlers, political and physical conflict between Anglo-Americans and Indians would continue to be a factor in shaping the country for years to come."],"display_date":"January 13, 1831","search_date":"1831-01-13","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3478,"title":"Settlers and Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-02","end_date":"1830-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The steamboat made it safely over the sand bar and arrived at the mouth of the Brazos River in Texas. Upon landing, William Hunter quickly composed a letter to his business associate James Perry to give tidings of his safe arrival. Hunter noted to Perry the presence of 30 Negroes on board and wrote of his plan to inquire of the owner, a settler from Alabama, about the means of their transport into the Mexican territory that was Texas. Hunter clearly expressed interest in importing slaves to Texas, and he was not an inconsequential businessman. Perry, the recipient of his letter, was the brother-in-law of Stephen Austin, the most important player in Anglo-American settlement of Texas, and Hunter conducted business with both of these men. ","Though Hunter's life is poorly documented, much is known about his traveling companion, Stephen Austin. Austin's father, Moses Austin, originally negotiated with the Spanish government to secure a land grant and to bring 300 Anglo-American settlers to inhabit the sparsely populated northern reaches of Spain's North American possessions. Upon Moses Austin's death in 1821 (the same year that Mexico gained independence), the grant passed to Stephen Austin. The specific attention given by Hunter (and presumably shared by Austin) to the importation of slaves into Texas is of great interest due to its place in a primarily business-related letter and the early date at which it occurs. It appears that like other parts of the American South, slavery in Texas was associated with business and profit, regardless of slaveholders' professions of paternalistic sentiment toward enslaved people. Also, the fact that slaves were brought into Texas at such an early stage in Anglo-American settlement is important as it affected later national politics. ","The Mexican government, in fact, frowned upon the form of slavery found in the United States. All slaves in Mexico were legally emancipated in 1829, however Austin's powerful friends managed to secure an exemption from this law for Texas. In composing the Civil and Criminal Regulations that governed his colony, the laws regarding slavery were the only ones imported directly from codes in the American South. Such Anglo-American support of slavery at the highest levels demonstrates both the pervasive nature of the institution and the reason that it eventually became such an issue of contention. In the years before Texas joined the United States, the annexation debate was influenced by Texas's possible status as a slaveholding state. Reminiscent of the conditions that necessitated the Missouri Compromise of 1820, Northern residents and anti-slavery forces were concerned with the balance of power shared by slaveholding and non-slaveholding states. In 1844 Democrat James K. Polk ran on a platform of annexing Texas and re-occupying Oregon, a bid to please both North and South. Thus, Hunter's seemingly innocuous comment regarding slaves being brought into Texas was actually a portent of turbulence to come."],"display_date":"January 2, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-02","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3483,"title":"Staunton Convention of 1816: The Tyranny of Eastern Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-08-19","end_date":"1816-08-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["RESOLVED that this meeting will now proceed to elect two fit persons to meet delegates from other counties in this commonwealth at Staunton on the 19th of August next, for the purpose of concerting... judicious means of reforming the representation of the state legislatures,  stated the resolution of an Augusta County, Virginia citizens meeting. For the county seat, Staunton, state politics became local in the August of 1816, when a statewide convention was held in the town to, according to the Columbian of New York, amend or propose amendments to the [state] constitution. The delegates came specifically to debate questions of representation in the state legislation. As more settlers crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains to settle in the Shenandoah Valley, they agitated for more representation in the House of Delegates-still dominated by lowlanders from the Eastern tidewater region."," Representatives from twenty-four of the western counties and 12 of the eastern counties came to Staunton on August 19. By the end of the convention five days later, the convention had drafted a memorial to be presented to the General Assembly. Noting that despite having less than half of the total population, the 49 counties in the southern and eastern parts of the state had a majority in the legislature, the memorial exclaimed that in a republican government the will of the government should be the law of the land and yet in a state boasting of the pure republican institutions, this first and fundamental principle of republicanism does not exist. The memorial received support from a commission formed by the state government to hear the results of the convention, and a resolution was drafted to hold another convention to rewrite the Constitution. The resolution passed the House of Delegates but was defeated by a vote of twelve to nine in the Senate."," While it did not pass, historian A.E. Dick Howard in his article for the Virginia Law Review, 'For the Common Benefit': Constitutional History in Virginia as a Casebook for the Modern Constitution-maker sees the Augusta Convention of 1816 as a part of a larger sectional conflict between the eastern and western parts of the state. Waves of migration during the eighteenth century, into Shenandoah Valley counties like Augusta, and subsequent prosperity and population boom resulted in political tension between the two parts of the state. These stresses were further exacerbated by economic slumps in the east and a general unwillingness among Tidewater residents to relinquish the power they had held in state politics since the state's creation, as reflected in the appearance of only 12 eastern counties at the Convention. The matter would not be settled until a convention was held in 1828 to reform the constitution."],"display_date":"August 19, 1816 - August 24, 1816","search_date":"1816-08-21","locations":[{"id":13634,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3486,"title":"Abolitionist Expelled from Bethany College\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-10-12","end_date":"1856-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It was the fall of 1855; Bethany College in Bethany, Virginia had been in session for only a few weeks when an incident shattered the equanimity of the student population. Five northern students were dismissed for trying to introduce their Abolitionism into the college, into its literary societies, and into the church, according to the college president and founder, famed Restoration minister Alexander Campbell. On October 12th the A.L. Institute, a college literary society, was holding a debate on the topic of The Right of Christians to Engage in War when a student, Mr. Everest of Ohio, remarked that 'the arguments from the Bible to sustain war, polygamy, and slavery belong in the same category.' The following Sunday night, another young student from Ohio, Mr. Way, again pressed the issue when speaking of Satan's misquoting and misapplying the scriptures when he tempted our Savior - he remarked that 'Satan's emissaries often misquote and misapply Scripture to sustain intemperance, spiritualism, and slavery.' On this night, the challenge was not ignored by the southern students present but called forth many threats and expressions of indignation. These two students, along with three of their classmates, were promptly expelled.","Little is known of what happened to these young abolitionists, though there is evidence that they returned north and told their story to several newspapers in the upper Midwest. But it is the use of Biblical scripture to argue against slavery that stands out in this narrative. The radical Christian reform movement was reaching its zenith around the 1850s with the rise of the religious abolitionist movement, as well as the temperance and pacifist movements.","Highlighted in the student's arguments, however, is one of the tensions inherent in antebellum religious reasoning against slavery. The Christian anti-slavery movement faced a difficult problem in refuting the southern slaveholder's claims that a literal interpretation of the Bible supported slavery. Thus, the question for the abolitionists became how to repudiate slavery in the Bible without refuting all scripture. Everest and Way addressed this problem by linking the Bible's support of slavery to its support of other practices widely acknowledged as socially unacceptable, like polygamy. They also linked slavery to the other major reform movements of the time by mentioning intemperance and war. But their argument also raises the issue of where to draw the line on literal biblical interpretation. This issue became a theological quagmire for many Christian abolitionists at the time, difficult to escape, and one that limited effective use of the Bible in the argument against the South's peculiar institution.","This story is indicative of the high tensions and conflicts that prevailed among all levels of American society at this time, North and South, abolitionist and slave-owner, theologian and educator, especially over the issue of slavery. The Bible would soon be interpreted in a very different way, as both the North and the South would use passages to support their separate causes in the Civil War.

A Methodist preacher had been teaching the colored people out of catechism No. 1 - teaching them at the plantations, when a Baptist minister heard of his efforts and raised the alarm. The Baptist quickly called a meeting and began to denounce the practice of preaching to the slaves through the catechism. Not all in the audience were convinced by the harangue, however, and one member of the Methodist church declared that her mind was not changed at all; the missionaries would still teach her servants out of the catechism if they would. Eventually, the Baptist minister retired and gave up the idea of convincing the Methodists of the evils of the catechism. ","During the religious awakenings of the nineteenth century, the practice of converting large numbers of slaves to Christianity became more acceptable. Prior to that, slave Christianity was a problematic issue because of the ethics of one Christian holding another in bondage. In the late eighteenth century, Methodists in particular took a strong anti-slavery stand, but were overruled by the laity in the southern states. With the advent of evangelicalism and a new emphasis on personal salvation, however, Christianity came to be seen as a way to control and pacify slaves, and most white preachers emphasized the idea of obedience to those in bondage. Many sermons centered on the idea of obeying an earthly master as one was required to obey a heavenly one. Therefore, the idea of a white minister teaching scripture to slaves was not only accepted, but often encouraged. ","Problems arose, however, when reading became a part of the equation. Knowledge for a slave in the antebellum South was power, and the ability to read and write allowed slaves to forge passes and freedom papers to help them escape. While few southern states actually had laws preventing slave literacy, it was generally discouraged by the whites in power. Therefore, the use of a catechism to preach to slaves was socially contentious, and in some places, illegal. Even the possibility that blacks might learn to read made whites nervous, and so the catechism became a front page issue in slaveholding states like Virginia. ","For many slaves, both church and the Bible became important tools in the quest for literacy. Often slaves would memorize passages during church services and then look them up in secret. In this way, slaves taught themselves to spell and then later, to read. The same problem arose with the catechism. If slaves could memorize passages from the book and then find them later, the book could become another way to learn to recognize words. The narrative also reflects the competition for converts between the different denominations of the Protestant church. In the early years of the Great Revival, Baptists and Methodists in particular fought for control of different populations, as seen in the Baptist minister's determination to address the Methodist missionaries' congregation. This rivalry was still a factor in many parts of the South, even in the 1850s, especially in the less settled regions. Many parts of western Virginia were still wilderness at this time, and so this story would hold particular relevance for those in the less settled parts of the state."],"display_date":"June 26, 1858","search_date":"1858-06-26","locations":[{"id":14833,"lat":38.1460994742,"lng":-82.4270334246,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3507,"title":"Augusta County, Nat Turner, and Abolition","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-01-01","end_date":"1831-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1831, the news of Nat Turner's rebellion provoked a seemingly unexpected response from women in Augusta County, Virginia: a call for abolition.

They could not hide the fears which agitate our bosoms, and the dangers which await us, as revealed by recent tragical deeds.

While emancipation was not granted, the Women were not alone. The Annals report that there were numerous other petitions from Augusta County as well."," Although contrary to the conventional view that slavery in the South was immutable, the women's' petition probably did not fall on deaf ears in the Virginia Legislature. Historian Scot French notes that the State Legislative session of 1831 and 1832 following Nat Turner's Rebellion, became a debate over the future of slavery, the specter of black insurgency, and the possibility of solving this problem through abolition and removal of African Americans from the state. French quotes James McDowell, from Augusta's neighboring county, Rockbridge, as commenting on the large number of black victims killed in a frenzied white response to the revolt: Was it the fear of Nat Turner and his deluded and drunken handful of followers which produced or could produce such effects?

Templeton's brigade before his death, but in that time the ex-slave managed to leave a lasting impression. Templeton was a young Union soldier from Savannah, Ohio who took part in several major battles of the Civil War, including Antietam. He spent much of his first two years in the mountains of West Virginia, as the horn player in a military band attached to Rutherford B. Hayes' 23rd Ohio Infantry. On April 14, 1862, he wrote home to his parents to describe a former slave, or contraband, who came in about a week ago and began to work for the brigade. Templeton described the man as a very pleasant fellow and works well. Says he will stay with us and go with us home. Two weeks later, his parents received another letter mentioning the escapee, this time to relay the facts of his death. You remember I told you we had a contraband at work for us? He took sick and died very suddenly on Tuesday last. We did all we could for him. He was only sick two days. The doctor pronounced his disease inflammation of the stomach. He was a fine fellow and we miss him very much. ","As slaves fled from their former owners during the chaos of war, they often attached themselves to the advancing Union army. Though some slaves attempted to make the dangerous journey to the states of the Union, the advancing northern army was often the closest and safest option. Everywhere the northerners went, escaped slaves followed, usually to be held by the advancing army as contraband from the enemy. The Virginia-West Virginia border provided a perfect opportunity for many other slaves to escape, as West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863 on the condition it would be a free state with a plan of gradual emancipation for those currently enslaved. Since the state shared a long border with the largest slaveholding state in the Confederacy, Virginia, it was a popular escape route for many slaves. ","As Templeton's letter indicates, the new contraband went to work for the soldiers of the Union brigade. All over the South, contrabands worked for the northern army in many different roles, as laborers, hospital workers, cooks, and often body servants for federal officers. They became a vital part of the workings of the Union army. Slaves were even put to work for the Confederate cause, usually pressed into building trenches or fortifications, and thousands went into the field with their masters as personal servants. By the end of the war, Jefferson Davis was even pressing for the conscription of slaves into the Confederate army, with promises of freedom for those who volunteered. Though this Southern plan was never put into action, the North did indeed recruit and arm runaway slaves, as well as free blacks from the northern states. In this capacity, many African Americans served with honor and distinction.

Their official business was to  take into consideration the depreciation of the notes of certain banks, for the economy was at the bottom of a large dip - the Panic of 1819. The citizens decided that the notes of the State Bank of North Carolina should no longer be received at normal value, but rather at a discount that was fixed to same discount in Richmond."," Further, the citizens decided that the merchants in the town should hold onto the   bank notes they received.

The situation was made more precarious as people became cavalier with their debts: it was a time of economic booms, and great speculation in the South.

In the election of 1860, the Democratic vote was split between three candidates, John Bell, Stephen Douglas, and John Breckinridge. During a formal debate between Gen. George Blow, a Douglas Democrat, L.H. Chandler, a Bell man, and Maj. William Lamb, a Breckinridge supporter, the discussion quickly disintegrated into personal insults between Mr. Lamb and Mr. Chandler. The <em>Herald</em> wrote that Lamb, might have spared some of the gross ribaldry and vituperation which he unnecessarily and we should think injudiciously heaped upon the [Constitutional] Union party, and that when he was understood to say that no honest man could attach himself to such a party...[it] was felt by hundreds present as a direct personal insult, and resented by a storm of hisses. However, when Lamb pointed at Chandler and alleged he was a member of the controversial Massachusetts Freesoil Party in 1848, it was simply too much for the Bell Democrat to bear. It's a d----d lie. announced Mr. Chandler. Do you mean to say I am a d-----d liar? Lamb responded. To which Chandler then shouted, ...sir, you are a d----d infernal liar And, as the paper so delicately put it, it was here the parties came into a collision...the blows seemed to those nearest the spot to have been almost simultaneous. This exchange of punches prompted supporters of each man to rush to the stage. To The <em>Herald</em>, in a chillingly prescient statement, it seemed that one imprudent act...might have lit up a flame of discord that could only have been quenched with blood, and caused the sacrifice of many lives.","This violent dispute reflects much of the turmoil that marred the Upper South during the months prior to the Civil War. The border states held the closest ties to their neighbors to the north and therefore felt the rift between the two regions most deeply. And it was here that the rift in the Democratic Party was felt most intensely. Breckinridge was supported by the Deep South, as he was a vocal proponent of slavery and its expansion. Those closer to the border were wary of his rhetoric, however, and Virginia was especially unenthusiastic. Stephen Douglas was more acceptable in this region, as he was dedicated to the preservation of the union. John Bell, the candidate of the Constitutional Union party, an organization dedicated to avoiding secession, also had a large following. The main issue was slavery. The South wanted a permanent guarantee of its continued preservation and expansion to new states in the form of a Constitutional amendment. This proposal was absolutely opposed by the North, who feared the political power that the slave states would hold if new states that welcomed slavery were allowed into the union. Though every Democrat in the South demanded a right to slavery forever, their differences in the area caused more conflict than unity. It was this conflict that allowed for the victory of Abraham Lincoln, the Republican candidate, who took office with a minority of the popular vote. And it was this event that prompted the Cotton Belt states to secede, but the deep divisions among southerners, evident in this episode, delayed Virginia from immediately following suit.

The <em>Annals of Augusta County</em>, a historical record, speaks of an imposing and influential political convention in 1832. Attended by people from all over the State, the delegates called themselves National Republicans and adopted resolutions which called for Henry Clay for president. Four years earlier, the <em>Staunton Spectator</em> ran a little piece explaining just how much Virginia, and especially Augusta County was stacked against Clay's rival, Andrew Jackson. James Madison and James Monroe are opposed to the election of gen. Jackson...John Marshall is opposed...four out five judges of the high court of appeals are opposed to gen. Jackson. The <em>Spectator</em> then spoke of Augusta: There are thirty-six justices of the peace in the county; of which 31 are opposed to Gen. Jackson... The mayor, recorder, three (out of four) alderman and five councilmen (out of six, with the sixth on the fence), Unsurprisingly, the <em>Annals</em> claim that when President Jackson came through the Shenandoah Valley on his way down to Tennessee on July 27, 1832, he as usual avoided Staunton, preferring to stay in the neighboring town of Waynesboro."," On the other hand when Henry Clay came through town just two days later, he was called on by many citizens. He had visited four years earlier as well, and the <em>Spectator </em>related a charming story about the man as he passed through the County. Clay was walking by a schoolhouse where a lot of boys were out playing and he asked one of them if he could have a cup of water. After Clay had drunk his fill, the boy emboldened by his friendly manner asked Clay his name. Mr. Clay, he exclaimed, from Washington City? As soon as Clay responded, the air reverberated with the cry of Huzza for Clay and Adams-We are all for Clay and Adams here-Huzza for Clay and Adams"," Of course, Jackson would have the upper hand in the end, defeating Clay in the national election of November 1832. But in a way, Augusta's staunch allegiance to the Whigs-even under greater sectional tension in 1859, Augusta still claimed a Whig majority-demonstrates the idea that Edward Ayers espouses when examining party affiliations in the first half of the eighteenth century, that once formed, political loyalties were hard to break. People in the first half of the nineteenth century did not join political parties purely out of individual ideology, but rather they often followed their neighbors, especially the prominent ones because they could then stand to receive political prestige and influence.

The purpose of the meeting was to pick a location for the university from three different choices: Lexington in Rockbridge County, Staunton in Augusta, or the site of Central College in Charlottesville, in Albemarle. Key to their decision was the degree of proximity and centrality to the white population which alone constituted the important point of comparison between these places, and the commissioners decided that Central College in Charlottesville, being on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, was that central point. The commission, Jefferson included, went on to lay out a sketch of the University, naming its curriculum, the cost of buildings, and its general goals."," However, the controversy was not yet over. In January of the following year, there was a motion in the Virginia House of Delegates to strike out the Charlottesville location and reintroduce the possibility of Staunton or Lexington. According to the Alexandria Herald of January 20, 1819, a Mr. [Briscoe] Baldwin spoke in favor of Augusta County. After a debate, in which fine bursts of eloquence relieved the dryness of geographical details and arithmetical calculations, the motion was voted down 69 to 114."," The formation of public universities, like the University of Virginia, provided a means for Southern elite to come together and deepen ties of shared experience. Mr. Jefferson's University was the first of a wave of public schools chartered between 1819 and 1860-Alabama in 1820, Mississippi in 1844, and Texas in 1858. As the historian Charles F. Irons notes, this trend highlights the strategy of southern leaders and elites to educate successive generations in a shared ideology and groom them for public service. With the centrality of slavery to the southern economy and psyche, it was important that those with the most at stake develop tools, like the public universities, to continue a sense of political community. The extent that this was successful becomes clear in Edward Ayers account of Augusta County from 1859 to 1863, <em>In the Presence of Mine Enemies</em>, in which most of the prominent men of Augusta were schooled at the university that almost found itself situated in their county."],"display_date":"August 1, 1818 - January 20, 1819","search_date":"1818-10-26","locations":[{"id":13634,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3542,"title":"A Slanderous Newspaper\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-09-27","end_date":"1854-09-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the nineteenth century, politicians and political parties owned the newspapers, and","utilized them for their own personal agendas.

A staunch abolitionist, Brown was the first white American to set about culling up a slave insurrection. He first gained the nation's attention when he led a volunteer militia during the Bleeding Kansas crisis of the previous decade. Following his involvement in that conflict, Brown was responsible for the direction of the Pottawatomie Massacre on May 24, 1856 and subsequently freed eleven slaves in the neighboring state of Missouri. What he is best remembered for, however, is his participation in the famous raid on a federal armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, in modern-day West Virginia. The anti-slavery espousals and violent methods of John Brown incited neighboring Virginian counties into action; according to W.W. Scott's <em>History of Orange County</em>, Brown's well-known raid on Harpers Ferry occasioned wild excitement, a good deal of local apprehension, and was, indeed, the alarum gun of the war that so soon followed.","John Brown's incendiary actions caused the immediate organization and equipment of numerous volunteer companies throughout the state of Virginia. One of these militias originated in Orange County, the self-proclaimed Montpelier Guards, of whom many are memorialized in the lists of Confederate soldiers buried in Charlottesville cemeteries. They were characterized by Scott as a fine volunteer company [that organized themselves] at and about Orange Courthouse. Led by Captain Lewis B. Williams, Jr., the Montpelier Guards traveled to Charleston, South Carolina where they stood guard until Brown and such of his accomplices as had been caught were hanged. Although they did not participate in the capture of Brown himself, their presence in Charleston thwarted the rumored attempts his rescue during the term of his imprisonment. Nevertheless, the company was Brown's military escort to the scaffold where he was hanged for treason to the state of Virginia. ","The Montpelier Guard of Orange County, Virginia served as an example for several other county-organized militias of the 1850s, including the Gordonsville Greys, led by Captain William C. Scott, and the Barboursville Guard, who operated under the command of Captain W.S. Parran. These companies, following in the footsteps of Williams' men, were uniformed, and began regular drills in preparation for the direful conflict which everybody felt was coming, indeed was almost come.

Ever since the blood of American soldiers had been shed in Texas, the call of patriotism compelled many Americans towards war.  In Edgecombe, patriotic banners and speeches had been prepared for the men who would soon be off for Mexico.  Present at the ceremony was a renowned Senator of North Carolina, Captain Louis D. Wilson.  In the name of his country, Wilson had left his Congressional duties to lead a group of Edgecombe volunteers into Mexico.  Sarah E. Howard addressed Wilson and his men on behalf of the women of Edgecombe:","Appreciating the heroism which has impelled you at the call of your country to rush to her standard... we have wrought with our hands a banner for the volunteers...  Whilst the weakness of our sex forbids us to encounter the fatigues and privations of war, it has always been deemed appropriate that women should cheer on the soldier to the field.  In this we but emulate the example of the maidens and matrons of the Revolution, that Revolution which established those political liberties and conferred those social benefits, to secure which you have volunteered.  Your fathers waged war against the haughty Britons...  You are now engaged in a contest with the perfidious Mexicans, and the flag of '76 is the flag of '46... You have enlisted under that proud banner which has been consecrated to the cause of human liberty - the glorious stars and stripes of your country - it is the precious emblem of our noble confederacy of free and independent states... Go; our hearts are with you.","Women's activism was proscribed in the arenas of war and politics.  It was not their place.  Howard's speech accepts the role of women as secondary to the masculine political issues.  Even at such a powerful event, the contributions of women were still gendered.  Like the women three generations earlier, the female patriots of Edgecombe County could only craft banners and cheers in support of the soldiers.  The references to the maidens of the Revolutionary War and the community of Edgecombe are significant because these geographical and historical communities were what bound women in their place in the South.  As Jean E.

In a large a state as Florida, transportation posed a serious problem in the late nineteenth century. However, politicians felt that railroads were a priority since Florida is a peninsula. More than 300 miles of land also created a challenge to connect the Atlantic Ocean and trade from Europe to prosperous ports on the gulf side of Florida, like New Orleans. ","Politicians threw around the idea at the turn of the century of the possibility of a canal through the narrowest part of Florida. Feeding the frenzy of the idea of a Florida Ship Canal was the success of the ship building industries in Florida. St. Augustine would serve as the key link for the canal, which shows the importance of this coastal town during this time period. Ultimately, a stagnate economy prevented Florida from investing millions of dollars in a canal. Then after the influx of settlers to the state during the early part of the twentieth century, the idea was pushed to the back burner and considered a moot point. The Florida Ship Canal experiment presented an exciting idea of linking the Gulf of Mexico directly to the Atlantic Ocean. Nevertheless, a canal through Florida would have been difficult for railroads to overcome, which served as the primary choice of transportation through the twentieth century for Americans.

In the evening, the colored people of the city met and formed a group called the Afro-American League. They wrote a preamble and resolutions against the laws requiring separate railroad cars and waiting rooms for blacks and whites. While demanding change in the law, they also wished to educate the population. Their league's object shall be the creation of a healthy public opinion and they will use the church, the press, meetings, and the court system to appeal the laws. "," Whether this League is a branch of the Afro-American League, founded in 1890, is hard to determine from this one article in the <em>Staunton Spectator</em> and Vindicator, the weekly paper for Augusta County. The paper did not say it is, and only listed the fourth resolution. The members said they were organizing a league to be known as the Afro-American League and not anything about being a branch league. The paper made no comment for this event and ran no other articles that day which had racism, black people, or blacks' rights as the subject. There were not any follow-up articles the next week either."," By 1891, Reconstruction had ended, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments had been passed, and Jim Crow laws regulating railroads were already in effect. Jim Crow had not fully seized the South though, and Booker T. Washington and Tuskegee Institute were working for blacks' rights. C. Vann Woodward has noted that by 1890, the hope that Reconstruction and the Civil War had brought was nearly gone. Edward Ayers, however, has noted the uncertainty and lack of concrete rules and regulations governing the South in the 1880's. He also intimated that newspapers bear some of the blame for inciting tension because of their stories and skewed coverage of blacks. This type of story of a meeting was not uncommon because black people continuously worked to retain their rights and gain new ones. They saw themselves losing the enfranchisement and losing the possibility of gaining political positions in society. Meetings like the one in Staunton were not everyday occurrences but groups such as the Afro-American League were beginning to form and trying to exert some influence in towns and cities. A South Carolina woman wrote in her diary that, The negroes are evidently in an excited state. It is important to note that the black people of Staunton had a plan of action. They did not meet to complain about their situation but to improve it. They had a document that explained their goals and beliefs. They knew they had to act and knew that using the court system and press were the best routes. This minority group in a city with 7,289 inhabitants in 1900 made their presence and wishes known to everyone and to those many other readers in the surrounding counties.

Most of the city attended the ceremony, which was complete with an unveiling of the stone and speeches by prominent local lawyers, clerks, and judges. They spoke of historical events and the importance of the new courthouse. To signify this step towards the future, they made the cornerstone a time capsule. The city implanted many relics which will be of great future interest. The weekly paper, <em>The Staunton Spectator,</em> noted that the stone came from the same quarry as the Washington Monument. "," Readers should note the date of the laying of the stone. Augusta County receives only a few snowfalls each year, but the weather is cold. City officials, however, felt that the Christmas time and the cold weather would not hinder the city from celebrating. In fact, the city could build momentum off the holiday spirits. The <em>Washington Post</em> did not list the important relics, probably feeling that the citizens of Washington, D.C. would find this ground breaking interesting because of the quarry for the stone. This article lay above more dynamic articles concerning explosions and riots in other southern states. "," Mary Ryan has written that during the nineteenth century, the contests for public spaces were an indicator of the spread of democratic politics, but as Wayne Durrill pointed out, democracy itself did not necessarily spread just because people wanted to control these public spaces. Lynchings, for example, occurred in public places and are not indicative of spreading democracy. The city of Staunton recognized the importance of the courthouse and its strong role in the community. In the past, Staunton citizens prided themselves for their gas and music. They needed an equally impressive courthouse that could reflect the citizens' feelings of importance. Durrill also notes that the best way to gain political influence was through having the power to regulate and build the civic space, such as the courthouse. Based on the honorific titles of the men who gave the speeches at the ceremony, they were some of the most powerful men in the county. Their presence at the laying of the cornerstone of the courthouse let the city know the power and influence that they held. E. Lee Shepard has noted the importance of court days as political focal points. During these days, people bought and sold things, and they met socially to catch up and enjoy each other.

M. Turner decided to pick up a copy of the Evening Star on the night of February 28th, 1890, when a certain headline caught his eye: Bruce on the race issue. The Honorable Blanche Kelsoe Bruce was an old friend of the Bishop's who had become a Senator of the state of Mississippi and moved to Washington D.C. Each man greatly admired the other for his work and his distinguished accomplishments.  Bishop Turner was visiting the capital at the time that he came across the attention-grabbing headline, and by the time he had reached his home in Atlanta at the end of his work-related travels, he had read the article. Suffice it to say that he was perplexed by what he had read, so he determined to write a letter to The Washington Post respectfully challenging Mr. Bruce's negative stance on the issue of colonization for black Americans.  ","Let the negro go if he desires or remain here if he prefers. Let him exercise his own intellect...when you say they have no desire to go to Africa, I say, who know the real condition of our race as well as any man who lives, a million at least of them desire to go somewhere, wrote Bishop Turner. He was trying to express that though there had been some progress made in the push for civil rights for the negroes of the U.S., the nation was still very much a racially prejudiced one. He argued that for some negroes, moving to Liberia was potentially the most advantageous escape from oppression in a white-dominated society; for others, moving to Liberia would only leave them helpless, forlorn, and bereft of their livelihoods, however stifled those livelihoods may be. You, Senator Bruce, say all of you stay here and wait for better times. I say, let us pray God and man to pass the bill of Senator Butler, and let a line of steamships be started between here and Africa, and let such of us as believe that we are not monkeys, and can do something without the white man's domination, go and try the experiment. ","He ended his letter, only to find it quite a bit longer than he had planned to write; however, this issue was very close to his heart and mind, and he wished he had all the space in the world to explain to his countrymen and his fellow black American, Senator Bruce, that it was high time Congress focused on the deplorable state of the negro race in the United States. The issue in this letter to Senator Bruce from Bishop Turner is the fact that colonization was perhaps the path to a better way of life for many black Americans. There was endless controversy in the capitol over colonization throughout most of the 19th century, and by 1890 when this letter was written, many black Americans felt that it should be left to each individual to decide whether or not moving to Africa was his chosen destiny. As historian Ralph Luker then points out, the longings of southern blacks to be freed from oppression continued to feed the dream of emigration... Turner was trying, with his letter, to emphasize that continuing the existing societal dynamic between blacks and whites in the South was futile; it was true that the tension that was growing between whites and blacks in America could neither be solved by sitting idly by and hoping for gradual equality, nor be solved by shipping masses of black Americans to Liberia to begin new lives."],"display_date":"February 28, 1890","search_date":"1890-02-28","locations":[{"id":1279,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3600,"title":"Congress Returns to the Capitol\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1882-01-01","end_date":"1882-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the winter of 1882, Frank G. Carpenter watched all the members of Congress as they descended upon Washington in preparation for the upcoming session. With them appeared lobbyists galore, bureaucrats too many to number and Washingtonians coming from the woodwork with something to sell to the incoming crowds. The city was booming; boarders and hotel owners were tidying and revitalizing their accommodations in order to attract customers, private individuals were opening their homes to newcomers to make a dollar or perhaps a companion, and prices were steadily increasing. Interestingly, visitors self-segregated somewhat based on the region they came from when it came to finding lodging and a social scene during session. There was everything from quiet, demure hotels for politicians who wished to be close to the White House to more raucous, lively hotels where you might find Congressmen bantering the night away. Frank knew where he could find someone in D.C. when Congress was in session. ","This session was marked with particular excitement for two reasons. First, the Democrats had become the majority party in the House of Representatives; second, the national election was right around the corner so Congressmen and aspiring politicians were already hard at work, campaigning for their very near futures. Frank was thrilled to be in the capital at a time like this one. ","Frank G. Carpenter was an author during the 19th century who traveled and wrote commentary pieces on life and society around the world. What he saw in 1882 in Washington D.C. is quite revealing about the dynamic between the city and the Congressmen, as well as between the Congressmen, and other visitors, themselves. Naturally, the city took complete advantage of Congress being in session every year. The influx meant more business, more money, more intrigue - more everything. Between the visitors and between the Congressmen it was very interesting that party lines were very much a function of geographic origin, and even more so, were very segregating. This polarization Carpenter witnessed supports a piece of historian Vincent P. De Santis' view of the political scene at the time, which involved the proliferation of Independent politicians as the parties strengthened. Men split from their parties in attempts to induce real change. The parties had become political machines, facing off with one another on every level, incapable of reacting in kind to the actual issues that confronted the federal government."],"display_date":1882,"search_date":"1882-07-02","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3601,"title":"Frederick Douglass Addresses the New American Party\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-02-20","end_date":"1884-02-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The American Prohibition Convention of 1884 was held in Lincoln Hall and kicked off on the evening of February 20th.  Several prominent politicians, bureaucrats, religious leaders and thought leaders of the time were present to help usher the American Party into the upcoming election season. Mr. E.D. Bailey, who had just been appointed to the committee responsible for nominating a President and Vice President of the United States, spoke first and set the tone for the evening by highlighting a few key themes of critical importance to the American Party:  the party's firm foundation in Jesus Christ's vision of Democracy, the growing need for temperance and prohibition, the threat of Freemasonry on the nation, and the highly objectionable way in which Republicans seemed to appeal to the black community simply to win votes before elections.  ","With the mood perfectly set for his address, Mr. Frederick Douglass took the stage to present his speech on civil rights. We have got rid of slavery. It is gone, gone, gone, never to return. But its long black shadow stretches across our entire continent...You ask sometimes when this negro question will cease...It will cease when we have one country, one citizenship, one liberty, one equality for all people...  He then spoke to the issue of colonization, heatedly denouncing it as a unthinkable solution to the problem of racial inequality. He asserted that black people wanted to take part in the freedom and progress that was so unique to the United States, a nation that they were as much a part of as white men. In fact, he elaborated humorously, many whites and blacks may be closer in relation than they might think given the history of interracial relationships in America He even indicated to his largely male audience that, in general, men could learn something from the more compassionate and respectful attitudes of women, who he had known to show the kind of sensitivity and care necessary to bridging the gaps between the white and black races. Every last one of his words was met with applause, laughter, admission, understanding, and approbation by all those in the hall, white and black alike. ","Retrospectively, this speech which occurred in 1884 came at a hugely significant time in the history of race relations in the United States. The Supreme Court of the United States had ruled the Civil Rights Act of 1875 to be unconstitutional less than six months before it was presented at the convention of the American Party. By 1885, as historian Valeria W. Weaver explains, the 'Jim Crow' South was really taking shape, severely impeding if not stopping in its tracks, the push toward the equality between whites and blacks that was the foundation of Douglass' mission."],"display_date":"February 20, 1884","search_date":"1884-02-20","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3605,"title":"Commencement at Howard Draws an Illustrious Crowd\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1879-05-01","end_date":"1879-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It wasn't every day after the Civil War that former slaves and former slave-owners would admit to having something in common, much less celebrate it openly. But in the early summer of 1879 at the commencement exercises for Howard University, they did just that. The crowd began to arrive and soon it became clear that there was not nearly enough room to seat everyone who wanted to witness the 236 soon-to-be-graduates of Howard University receive their degrees. Families, friends, curious onlookers, Congressmen, and other prominent men and women from the community and from elsewhere showed up to pay their respect to the achievements of a class of young black people who had been given the tools and the opportunity to take advantage of the freedoms that the country and the world now offered them - the excitement was impossible to miss.  ","The exercises followed a memorable annual meeting of the Board of Trustees of Howard University. There, the Honorable Thomas J. Kirkpatrick of Virginia, former slaveholder, Confederate soldier, and Southern Presbyterian U.S. Congressman, gave a speech in support of the university's mission of providing the education and thereby the opportunities that black people had been denied for so long in the United States. His delivery touched the hearts and minds of many in the room, including those of Frederick Douglass, who took his turn at the podium. Douglass, renowned for his ardent self-expression and motivational words as a former slave and a champion for the black race in America, wholeheartedly resounded the Congressman's words and challenged him and the rest of the Board to continue their support of Howard and its noble work.  ","When the 236 young black men gathered to receive their degrees and set off into the world not only empowered, but prepared, even those spectators who had not been at the Trustees meeting could sense that Douglass' call to action was already very much in motion.  Washington D.C., as the nation's capital, was setting the example through Howard University for an active pursuit of righting the wrongs that slavery had perpetuated on black Americans. Though this was not the first graduation for the college, it came nearly a decade and a half after the Civil War, when the South was beginning to embrace the idea of segregated schooling for blacks and whites. Historian Michael Dennis explains that white Southerners realized the necessity of educating the newly emancipated African-American population in order for them to be able to sustain themselves; however, most were only in support of their education if it was separate from that of the white population."],"display_date":"May 1, 1879 - May 30, 1879","search_date":"1879-05-15","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3607,"title":"Spring of 1888 in the Diary of Miss Jennie Barker\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-03-31","end_date":"1888-03-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Miss Jennie Barker made note of each day of her life in the year 1888 by writing inside a diary given to her as a gift by her cousins on New Year's Day of that year. On March 31st, Jennie wrote, she and her friend Clara took a trip to the market in Washington, D.C. where they lived.  After marveling at the flowers and other wares, they decided to attend a nearby women's rights meeting. Jennie was not very impressed, despite being entertained by the goings on. She couldn't understand how women's lives and the state of things would be improved if women were given the right to vote. Not really very bothered, she and Clara finished their day with a trip to the dentist and dinner with family and friends.  ","Despite her nonchalance about the idea of women's suffrage, as viewed in this moment in her life, Jennie was an extremely self-empowered young woman. Her dedication to living a life full of education, religion, and social activities and events of all kinds is evident throughout her diary. As an upper-middle class young woman in Washington D.C., Jennie made a point to stay current on fashion, read novels such as '<em>Silas Marner'</em> or '<em>The Last of the Mohicans</em>' regularly, study and teach lessons for Sunday School, attend church and Christian Legion meetings, and do her domestic duties all at the same time.         ","Jennie's disinterest in the women's suffrage movement may then seem peculiar. However, Jennie was a Southerner, and the South was emerging from the Reconstruction Era in 1888. As the historian Louise M. Young explains, there was bitter resentment engendered in the South by the Reconstruction policies: a resentment that hardened into an emotional block against enfranchising women that was never resolved. Jennie enjoyed her life tremendously, from what she wrote in her diary, and enfranchisement wasn't going to add anything to her life that she felt she needed. In fact, the South felt that all the effort that had put forth in enfranchising black Americans during Reconstruction had created far more harm than good.

The movement was a period of intense religious activism that trickled down from northern, urban cities and affected Protestant denominations with a heightened sense of social activism. Bettie V. Jones, a resident of Fluvanna County, Virginia, received numerous letters from family and friends, including her husband, William J. Payne, and various other people from and around Charlottesville, Virginia. According to the letters, the Payne family was prominent in the political sphere of central Virginia; included in the letters is a mention of the 1852 Whig convention and the upcoming election, along with a seating chart for the House of Delegates for the 1853-54 session. Jones, a Methodist herself, corresponded with a few Albemarle County residents about the Charlottesville Methodist Church revival, an event that was probably similar to the countless other religious awakenings sweeping the nation that sought to, among other things, counter the assertion that the Bible was fallible. ","Of particular interest to the historian in the collection is a letter addressed to Jones from a family member in Arkansas, a slave state admitted in 1836 on the condition that Michigan was admitted in 1837 as a free state. The issue of runaway slaves is addressed in the letter, a contentious subject that caused a great deal of strife among slaveholders and non-slaveholders alike. The Fugitive Slave Law, enacted in 1850, was established in response to the demands from the South for more stringent and detailed Federal legislation concerning the rights of slaveholders and the punishment of runaway slaves. This controversial law further divided those for and against slavery, prompting the increase in the number of abolitionists and the inception and increased efficiency of the Underground Railroad. ","The central tension that is elucidated in the letters to Bettie V. Jones is that of the revivalist spirit and increased moral awareness of southern Americans coupled with the institution of slavery. The collective conscience of the American South was at a crossroads in the 1850s; on one hand, the comfortably profitable lifestyle many southerners had grown accustomed to depended on slave labor as the backbone of their economic system while, conversely, the Third Great Awakening signified a renewal of vigor and strength in relation to the importance of personal religion. In 1845, some slaveholding states left the official Methodist Church to form their own branch, one that condoned slavery on the basis of moral justification by invoking God's will and the examples of slavery in the Bible. The Third Great Awakening focused on the intertwining of religion in the public and private sphere, a relationship that forced both community leaders and citizens to evaluate their beliefs in order to steer clear of hypocrisy. Bettie V. Jones, along with the other central Virginians who experienced the awakening, grappled with the inherent moral and social contradictions presented by religion and slavery that created an unsolvable dilemma, one that only a schism could reconcile."],"display_date":"1849 - 1856","search_date":"1852-12-31","locations":[{"id":13819,"lat":37.8418490908,"lng":-78.2774543474,"zoom":10,"place":"FLUVANNA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3609,"title":"The Truth About Mormonism\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1880-04-03","end_date":"1880-04-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was April 3rd, 1880. Ellen E. Dickinson was about to record the official statement of Mrs. Matilda Spaulding McKinstry's, describing her understanding of the connection between her father's Manuscript Found and the infamous Joseph Smith's Mormon Bible. The connection between the old romantic manuscript and the piece of religious writing was about to expose the real, and far less celestial, origins of the Mormon religion. This story could potentially blow the lid off of the mysterious genesis of Mormonism; Ellen was about to get the interview that would finally show that Joseph Smith's Mormon religion had its roots in an old, unpublished story written by an Ohio gentleman in 1812, and most certainly <em>not</em> in some gold plates divinely revealed to Mr. Smith.   ","Mrs. M. S. McKinstry was the daughter of one Reverend Solomon Spaulding, who happened to be Ellen's great-uncle. Naturally, Ellen's interest in her family's potential link to what was looking to be like a religious conspiracy was great. Rev. Spaulding created the Manuscript Found after discovering bones and relics in some mounds of earth behind their Conneaut, Ohio home when McKinstry was just a girl. As Ellen interviewed Mrs. McKinstry and recorded her statement, the events that began with the creation of the fantastical Manuscript Found by Rev. Spaulding and ultimately led to the creation of the Mormon Bible by Joseph Smith started to become clear; Mrs. McKinstry's account confirmed that family and friends who had heard the manuscript read aloud as a fictional narrative in 1812 noticed the gross similarities between it and the Mormon Bible.  Mrs. McKinstry affirmed that her father had lent the manuscript to a publisher for some time, at which point it could have been copied or replicated. Whatever the case, McKinstry was asserting that many who knew of the contents of the manuscript would swear it was the source of the Mormon Bible. Ellen had recorded the words that would end the debate on the validity of Mormonism for good. ","Ellen Dickinson's interview was extremely significant to the religious dynamic of the South in the late 19th century. Historians David F. Boone and David Buice explain that Mormonism never became mainstream in the South, and Mormons were persecuted for their unique religion which promoted scripture outside the Bible and espoused other departures from the Christian faith. The Mormons had migrated West in the 1830s due to persecution from Christians who felt threatened by their doctrine, but they began to conduct missionary work in the South after the Civil War. They were fairly successful in spreading the Mormon faith, and because of that success, they were persecuted even more violently than before. It was in this environment that Ellen Dickinson chronicled an interview that she hoped would invalidate Mormonism and eradicate the threat she believed it posed on Southern life."],"display_date":"April 3, 1880","search_date":"1880-04-03","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3610,"title":"Washington Says Farewell to Dick Wallach\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-02-26","end_date":"1881-02-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 26, 1881, the <em>Evening Star</em> printed an article, 'A Noble Life' about Mr. Richard Wallach.

The residents of Washington, D.C. had been proud to call Richard Wallach their Mayor for several years, and news of his impending death caused many to reflect on the beneficial impact he had had on the city and the well-being of all who lived in it. ","While he was mayor the City Hall, which had previously acquired the bad name of 'the Buzzard's Roost,' was very unhospitable quarters for the noble army of jobbers and strikers, said the <em>Star</em>, describing how full of integrity Mr. Wallach was. That same day, the <em>National Republican</em> sang his praises in an article entitled, 'Waiting for Death': As a citizen he was enterprising, energetic, liberal, laboring zealously and faithfully for the city, which appreciated his efforts on her behalf. Clearly, 'Dick' Wallach's personal and professional integrity had manifested itself in his mayoral accomplishments; the man had set the bar for mayors in Washington's future.  Mr. Wallach passed away during the afternoon on March 4th, 1881. His funeral was attended by many prominent members of the community, black and white, male and female. ","What made Mr. Wallach's death so monumental to the Washington D.C. community was the fact that he symbolized all that education reform had done and was continuing to do for the community. Wallach had made education his primary concern, and he spent his long tenure in office striving to make the city's system better. This was very much in step with the rest of the South at the time. According to historian Edward L. Ayers, throughout the late 19th century South where progressive reform was deepening rapidly, school and educational reform was priority number one. The reasons were many, and pertained to both black and white schooling: the educational system didn't have the money to pay teachers or furnish schools, students weren't showing up, and literacy was abysmal, especially when compared to that of more Northern parts of the U.S.  Richard Wallach's death deeply saddened a community that had felt the benefits of his work right in their own homes."],"display_date":"February 26, 1881","search_date":"1881-02-26","locations":[{"id":1278,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3617,"title":"Orange County Elections of 1860\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-01-01","end_date":"1860-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In a letter written from Mossy Creek Academy to his parents back home, Casper C. Branner discussed the results of the presidential election of 1860. This election of 1860 demonstrated the adherence of the majority of Orange County, Virginia residents to the Union. Although the elections of 1860 were considered by many to be the beginning of the American Civil War, the processes and tensions regarding abolitionism, economic disparity of the North and South, and the balance of power between the federal and state governments had been brewing for decades. The polar extremes of these competing ideologies seemed to exist in the remote, distanced areas of the two regions while states like Virginia occupied the occupied the precarious border zone. In central Virginia, mixed sentiment pervaded the collective conscience of citizens like those of Orange County, a feature of the population best expressed in their voting patterns. ","427 people voted for Bell and Everett, candidates on the Union ticket. On the States' Rights ticket, 475 Orange County residents voted for Breckenridge and Lane. Also running under the Union banner, Douglas and Johnson received 12 votes, while Lincoln and Hamlin accrued zero. In sum, there were a total of 914 votes, resulting in a States' Rights majority of only 48. Evidently, citizens of Virginia were not so deeply entrenched in a Southern ideology in the early stages of the war and in fact remained mostly committed to the notion of solidarity within the Union.","After Lincoln was elected in 1860, several southern states seceded from the Union, following the example of the first to do so, South Carolina. The secessionists of Orange County were emboldened by these unprecedented maneuvers; according to W.W. Scott in his <em>History of Orange County</em>, Rosettes of blue ribbon, called 'cockades,' appeared everywhere, even at the churches. These decorative adornments symbolized the dedication to the principles of states' rights that came to define the Confederacy in the years to come. Like Branner, whose stance on the Virginia elections was relatively objective and reasoned, the citizens of Orange County were once nearly divided on antebellum political issues yet took the side of the South as neighboring states seceded from the Union, highlights effects of the hysteria-inducing frenzy drummed up through the manipulative forces (politically funded newspapers, for instance) that polarized opinions and heightened the dichotomous distinctions between North and South."],"display_date":1860,"search_date":"1860-07-01","locations":[{"id":14129,"lat":38.246275988,"lng":-78.01344008,"zoom":10,"place":"ORANGE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3626,"title":"Van Buren for a Second Term\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-10-20","end_date":"1844-10-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the morning of Tuesday October 20, 1840, <em>The American Statesman</em> newspaper of Petersburg, Virginia ran an article on the merits of President Martin Van Buren, who was then running for a second term as President.

However, this inability to vote was not because it was illegal for African Americans to do so. Three hundred armed white men were standing in front of the registry office in the town of Palmetto in St. Landry Parish, Louisiana to prevent them from registering to vote. After the armed men left, a few African Americans had managed to register to vote and were therefore flogged unmercifully for their actions. Following this beating, the group of angry white men went to the home of another black man, Reuben Stelly. After requesting that he come outside to talk with them, Stelly became frightened and shot into the mob, killing a nineteen-year-old white man. In response, the armed mob fired back into the house, killing Stelly and another black man that was with him."," Though African Americans had been given the right to vote in the fifteenth amendment nearly 30 years earlier in 1870, white men of the south were still trying to take a stance against this decision. This incident occurred in 1896; just one year after the grandfather clause had been enacted by several of the Southern states in the United States. A grandfather clause is a phrase used when an exemption is put in place that allows an old rule to apply to particular circumstances, while a new rule applies to everything else. This particular grandfather clause was put into place in lieu of the Jim Crow laws, which were state and local laws in the South between 1876 and 1964 that required racial segregation of African Americans in the majority of public areas. The clause stated that those who had the right to vote before 1867 would be exempt from any property, tax, or educational requirements for voting, and their descendents would have the same exemption. Because African Americans had not been given the right to vote until 1870, the clause effectively excluded blacks from voting. However, it still guaranteed the right to vote to many illiterate and poor white men. As a result of this clause, any African American attempting to register to vote would face quite an ordeal. The type of situation that Reuben Stelly was involved in was obviously chaotic, with racism motivating irrational actions. It was very common for groups of white men to gather in this way to protest the voting rights of black men. When violence erupted from these types of circumstances, it was typical for them to result in an unjust case that was unfairly represented on the part of the black man. Clearly, Reuben Stelly acted drastically because he knew what the situation entailed. The mob of white men did not just want to talk to him; he had registered to vote - exactly what they didn't want him to do. Unfortunately, this situation resulted in casualties on both sides.

This decision was unfortunate for the fashion industry, as purses, reticules, traveling bags, and footwear were all accessories that could be made out of alligator hide. Apparently, it was fashion's mandate to do so. In Louisiana and Florida, their abundance of alligators added an extra boom in their economy and helped support this fashion craze. However, alligators preyed on muskrats who would eat the crops in the area. The decline of the alligator population led to an increase in the population of muskrats, thus seriously damaging the crops. The Police Jury was so serious about this prohibition that they would fine anyone killing an alligator a penalty of 25 and put them in prison for a month for each offense. Clearly, the ban on killing alligators was not an example of animal rights activism. The banning in Plaquemines was economically and financially motivated.","While this instance could be deemed an early example of animal rights protection, it is much more likely that it is a case of Louisiana protecting its economy. Without their crops, Louisiana, much like many other states of the South, had nothing. Later in the nineteenth century, prices of farm products were consistently low. Poverty was widespread throughout Louisiana's farming population already, and without the alligators there to prey on the muskrats, their crops and income were being hurt even more. Farmers' Alliances were formed to help combat these financial issues. However, at this time, the Democratic Party was dominant in the South, and they essentially stood for white power, while the Farmers' Alliances consisted of mostly black farmers. During 1890, the People's Party was beginning to form, which was supported mainly by farmers in the South. It was similar to the Greenback Labor Party which had formed during the 1880s and opened the door to the concept of populism, which is the appeal to the common person and, likewise, incorporates a sense of working class activism. The Police Jury's response to the alligator situation was in direct correlation with the ideals of the People's Party and populism. The area was much more densely populated with poor farmers, struggling to make enough money to live, than rich people, who would be deeply upset by the absence of alligator purses. Only the wealthier half of the population in the state and the country could afford luxuries such as those. Therefore, the mandate to forbid killing alligators was both necessary and logical. Crops bring in much more money to the states economy than the alligator fashion trend, so sacrificing that fad makes much more sense for the sake of the states' financial well-being."],"display_date":"April 26, 1890","search_date":"1890-04-26","locations":[{"id":5620,"lat":29.1168615299,"lng":-89.3283829847,"zoom":8,"place":"PLAQUEMINES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3637,"title":"A Mayor Improves Baton Rouge\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-01-01","end_date":"1899-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the summer of 1899, Robert A. Hart, the mayor of the city of Baton Rouge in Louisiana, along with a small band of progressive citizens persuaded local property owners to approve a sequence of bond issues in order to improve the area. One of the issues cost 200,000 and paid for a new city hall, a new school, and paving of certain roads. Other issues went towards making new schools and hospitals and improving drainage systems. Hart's ability to cajole property owners into approving these bonds is commendable because the citizens of the city were infamously stingy with their money, especially in taxing themselves. Part of the funds from the bonds went to pay for a black public school, as well, which was a decision that the citizens were not aware of, and were not happy with. While African American children had been attending a segregated school in the area, they had never received an improvement, and the white people of Baton Rouge did not want them to have one.","Racial segregation in schools and other public systems was customary throughout the United States during the nineteenth century. In the case of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 involving the segregation of railroad passengers, racial segregation was deemed constitutional as long as the facilities were separate but equal. The Supreme Court did not acknowledge the fact that most of the facilities in the country that were segregated were not actually equal. However, one of the Supreme Court justices, Justice John Marshall Harlan, favored the rights of African Americans as guaranteed. Harlan protested that the separate but equal decision was an expression of white supremacy, would stimulate aggression and hatred between the races, and would perpetuate a feeling of distrust. Schools weren't the only areas being segregated; hotels, toilets, parks, bars, schools, hospitals, even telephone booths, and separate sections in libraries, restaurants, and move theaters were being segregated, as well, the latter often with separate ticket windows and counters. There were also laws prohibiting inter-racial sex and marriage, which is known as miscegenation. African American schools were required to have African American teachers and administrators, while white schools were required to have white teachers and administrators. White citizens would naturally be enraged if they found out that a black school was getting an improvement that their school was not receiving. However, schools for African American children rarely saw improvements, much less through a bond issued by the mayor. Hart's improvement, therefore, was unique in the South and revolutionary in the changes that it suggested.

Morton was lying in port. A fight occurred between some of the sailors, and one man was severely injured while another was killed. Charles Furlong, one of the men who intervened in the quarrel in an attempt to stop the men from fighting, was convicted of murder. He was sentenced to 5 years of imprisonment and was sent to the Baton Rouge Penitentiary Center on July 15, 1885. Orders were later issued to send a fleet of the convicts to Shreveport, Louisiana, where they would be working in the swamp and raising the road bed above the high-water mark. Furlong had heard of the cruelties that many inmates suffered through when they were taken on jobs like this. On the way to Shreveport, he jumped off of the boat that was transporting him in an effort to commit suicide. Multiple shots were fired at him, but he swam away and was not injured. Several days later, the coroner of Ascension Parish, Louisiana found a body of a man floating in the river and it was identified as Furlong.","Suicide seemed like a much more appealing option than the brutality faced by inmates during their imprisonment for many convicts during the nineteenth century in the South. Charles Furlong was, therefore, one of many men who decided he would rather kill himself than go through the torture of being in the Louisiana Penitentiary System. Though slavery had been abolished in the thirteenth amendment in 1865, being forced to do work on roads, railways, plantations, and buildings was similar to being brought back to pre-abolitionist society. Men were whipped and beaten on a regular basis; much like a slave would be, if they did not do their assigned work correctly. The tales of brutality that existed at the camps were shocking and almost beyond belief. There was even a law that paralyzed the tongue of the convict, forbidding him to speak of what had happened to him at the convict labor camps. Convict labor was so important that if a slave attempted to escape or kill himself, much like Furlong did, guards were ordered to shoot and kill them in their tracks. Major General Winfield Scott Hancock was currently in command of the military department in Louisiana and had issued an order for the employment of convicts outside of the prison walls. There also was ample military necessary for the General's actions. A state law was currently in place that actually stated a prohibition of convicts working outside of the penitentiary walls. However, state laws concerning prisoner's rights were then of little account, and prison management had drifted into the wrong hands - the hands of the military. They used the convicts at their disposal and for their own profit. While the control of the Louisiana State Penitentiary lying in the hand of the military was unusual, prisoners committing suicide to escape the brutal work at convict labor camps was not, and Charles Furlong's story is one of many."],"display_date":"July 15, 1885","search_date":"1885-07-15","locations":[{"id":5772,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"WEST BATON ROUG, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3640,"title":"African American Vote Eliminated in Louisiana\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"10/19/00","end_date":"10/19/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In October of 1900 the African Americans of Louisiana did not vote. The newly implemented Poll Tax Qualifications eliminated their ability to do so. The total amount of white men that registered to vote was 102,723 against only 1,147 registered African American men. What was true of the state as a whole was equally true of individual parishes, as well. Fifteen parishes reported less than ten African Americans were able to register to vote. There was even only a single black man registered in the parish of St. Charles. The poll tax cut down the African American vote by roughly 130,000 men. Only about 35,000 whites had allowed themselves to be disenfranchised by the poll tax laws either because they do not value the ballot, or because of neglect or carelessness.","The voting situation in Louisiana in October of 1900 was not unique to this state alone. The Poll Tax Qualifications required each person registering to vote to pay a tax for their vote. The origin of the implementation of the poll tax rests in the development of the Populist Party of the 1880s and 1890s in the Southern United States. The Populist Party demanded a graduated income tax, government ownership of the railroads, a tariff for revenue only, the direct election of U.S. senators, and other measures designed to strengthen political democracy and give farmers economic parity with business and industry. The Populists in the South gave the Democrats the only competition they had seen in the polls since the end of Reconstruction. The competition became so intense that both parties pushed for African Americans to be able to vote in the election so that they could have their votes. However, the Democrats won, and when the Populists were defeated the Democrats implemented various laws into their state constitutions in order to disenfranchise the African American voter. After payment of a poll tax was made a pre-requisite to voting, very few blacks had enough money to pay for it, along with impoverished white citizens, thus eliminating their ability to register to vote. This poll tax lived on for several decades, until the Twenty-Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1964 declared poll taxes unconstitutional in all states. The large disparity between black voters and white voters in Louisiana, therefore, was common to southern states in 1900 because of the disabling poll tax."],"display_date":"October 19, 1900","search_date":"1900-10-19","locations":[{"id":5666,"lat":29.8836153938,"lng":-90.3630468207,"zoom":9,"place":"ST CHARLES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3643,"title":"Moses Austin&#39;s Final Move\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-07-17","end_date":"1830-07-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Moses Austin had been dead nine years when his final move came about. The owners of the land where Austin and his wife were buried were apparently quite anxious to have their bodies moved off of the property, for reasons unknown today. Their son, Stephen Austin requested to a certain Bishop Rosatti (through his brother-in-law) that they be placed in a Catholic burying ground. It was noted to the bishop that a number of the elder Austin's children were baptized in the Catholic Church, and that as Austin had become a Spanish citizen, he presumably was a Catholic himself. This assumption was reasonable because, as the letter to Rosatti states, the regulation of that govt was not to receive any but catholicks.","Moses Austin's original land grant from the Spanish government specified that every family that settled the Austin lands must be Catholic. It has been observed that even in light of this stipulation, the other generous provisions [of the Austin land grant] immediately furthered the Texas land rush. The regulation would turn out to be of little importance because after the Mexican nation gained its independence from Spain, the Catholic Church declined in influence. Following Mexican independence in 1821, the Catholic Archbishop of Mexico returned to Spain along with a number of other bishops. Higher-ranking clergy who remained in Mexico were not replaced as they died off, and by the time Texas gained independence from Mexico in 1836, only two priests served the massive land of Texas. However, even as the hierarchical controls of the Church deteriorated after Spain's withdrawal, the deep cultural entrenchment of Catholicism helped to maintain its prominence. In 1823, two years after Mexico gained independence, the Imperial Colonization Law was passed, which specified that all colonists must be Catholic. Laws passed in 1824 and 1825 specified that colonists must be Christian and abide by the laws of the nation, yet the implication was still that colonists would join the established Catholic Church.","Religion played an important role not only in Texas and Mexico, but also throughout the entire South. As the Catholic faith played an important role in Mexico, evangelical religions had a great impact on many aspects of life in the South. As early as the middle of the eighteenth century, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists were spreading their religions throughout the South. Socially, the introduction of these evangelical religions was empowering to groups such as women and blacks that had held little sway in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church. Politically, evangelicals created an environment in which slavery was not as unquestioningly accepted as it once was. Many said outright that slavery was a sin. The promotion of this moral viewpoint even had the effect of creating a relatively high rate of manumission following the American Revolution. Studying the role of religion in Texas and the rest of the American South reveals that its effect was far more than just a spiritual one. From politics to economics and the social realm, religion was an important influence in the South."],"display_date":"July 17, 1830","search_date":"1830-07-17","locations":[{"id":15202,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3650,"title":"A Request from the American Colonization Society \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-07-07","end_date":"1820-07-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On July 7, 1820, the American Colonization Society took out an advertisement in the <em>Norfolk and Portsmouth Herald</em>. The ad, which was actually more of an announcement, concerned the need for equipment, tools, food, and other supplies by the colonists whom the Society sponsored. These colonists were free African Americans who had volunteered to set up a black colony on the west coast of the African continent. The advertisement announced that the endeavor was so far a success and that there was no doubt that the colonists would establish a permanent settlement. However, the colonists still needed various supplies including tobacco, iron, tar, pitch, nails, medicines, flour, axes, hoes, and other various tools which the Society hoped would in part be supplied by the generous donations of Americans like the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth."," But why would white Southerners be willing to donate these sorts of item to blacks free of charge? What would make the American Colonization Society believe that they would easily receive donations from slaveholding whites? The answer is simple. Southern whites believed that a society where free blacks and whites coexisted peacefully was an impossibility due to the perceived inferiority of the black race. Therefore, the solution to this 'problem' was the colonization of the African continent by the free blacks of the United States. Thomas Jefferson himself believed that the most sensible plan for emancipation included a requirement for colonization. Furthermore, Jefferson believed the national government should bear the responsibility of financing the reversed black population flow. However, this idea seemed threatening to slave states whose entire economy was based on the forced labor of blacks. The 1820s and 1830s saw the greatest push for colonization and although the American Colonization Society succeeded in establishing colonies in Africa, the United States never adopted the program of full scale colonization because the great expense and the possibility of Southern secession if such a plan was carried out."],"display_date":"July 7, 1820","search_date":"1820-07-07","locations":[{"id":14405,"lat":36.8654174886,"lng":-76.2893042264,"zoom":12,"place":"NORFOLK CITY, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3653,"title":"Slave Management in Darlington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-10-13","end_date":"1852-08-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There were always fears of slave rebellions. In a letter dated October 13th, 1849, from E.W. Cooper, Thomas Cassels Law learned of a Negro insurrection in his home district of Darlington, South Carolina. Cooper served on an investigating committee to respond to the matter. Although they could not gather sufficient evidence to have the four leading insurrectionists hanged, they were lodged in jail and later sent out of the state. One of the enslaved men mentioned that word was spreading around Darlington that this was the last year the slaves would be held in bondage; white men traveling between Sumterville and Darlington City were apparently spreading the rumors. Cooper believed his own slaves were largely ignorant of the matter, but he warned Law, You had better keep a look out.","It is unclear how much of an impact this letter had on T.C. Law, but it is known that he was an active member of the Darlington Agricultural Society. In 1852, Thomas Cassels Law gave an address to the society entitled, Report on Management of Slaves - Duty of Overseers and Employers. Law's chief purpose was to give some insight in keeping an efficient and productive operation, and he incorporated an intricate analysis of the relationships between master and slave and overseer. He began, If slaves were brutes, as many seem to view them we might more easily point out their proper management, but they are human beings - morally accountable - committed to our care by a mysterious Providence, for, no doubt, a wise purpose. Law advocated for a moderate and constant work schedule for slaves, with proper intervals of rest. Yet, he also justified the use of the whip by citing scripture: he that spareth the rod hateth his child. Law recommended giving slaves a small plot that they could work in their off time and have a small notion of ownership. When the owner buys crops from his own slaves, it convinces them of your doing justice. ","As Law's report suggests, the relationship between master and slave was intricate and multi-faceted, layered with contradictions. Slaves were seen as racially inferior, yet still morally accountable human beings. Slaves were quite literally the property of their owners, and Walter Johnson's <em>Soul by Soul </em>examines the reduction of human beings to financial numbers. Yet, Law and other planters found it immoral and improper to rule by simple and violent dominion over their chattel. Religious and racial convictions compelled white masters to treat slaves with paternalistic supervision. There was also a level of insecurity. So, giving a token piece of land to the slaves and convincing them of the justice of the system was a rational approach to slaveholding. Though men like Thomas Cassels Law may have applied the industry of slavery moderately and sensibly on their plantations, the existence of slaves as economic property was inherently dehumanizing."],"display_date":"October 13, 1849 - August 10, 1852","search_date":"1851-03-13","locations":[{"id":11496,"lat":34.2738944437,"lng":-79.941633894,"zoom":9,"place":"DARLINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3668,"title":"Northern Neck of Virginia Desires Immigrants\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-01-01","end_date":"1872-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Board of Immigration from the counties of Richmond, Westmoreland, Lancaster, and Northumberland assembled to compose their forthcoming pamphlet enticing immigrants to their regions of Virginia: ...our earnest desire is to attract to it and immigration not only from the northern and north-western states, but also from Canada and Europe.

His intentions were motivated by a humanitarian desire to assist the freedmen adjust to their new lives. His efforts at ensuring the enfranchisement of blacks did not go unnoticed, however. On February 12, 1869, a letter was waiting for Pierson when he arrived at his home. Adorned with a skull and cross bones at the top, it addressed him as Sir. Pierson was called a vagrant carpet-bagger and a scoundrel of the deepest dye for maliciously interfering in the political realm of the town. The threatening letter was from the white supremacist group, the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan warned him to stop his efforts at enfranchising blacks and leave the region immediately. If he failed to comply with their demands, they threatened to kill him. The letter concluded by stating that Congressional reconstruction, the military, nor anything else under Heaven could protect him should he decide to not abide by the group's orders.","Upon receiving the threatening letter from the KKK, Pierson left Andersonville and traveled to the nation's capital, Washington D.C. While there, he wrote a letter to United States Senator Charles Sumner detailing his experience. In addition, he included descriptions of various acts of violence against black citizens in the South, and demanded that they be addressed and punishments be enforced. In 1870, Congress passed the Force Acts to help end the violence and enforce the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments of the Constitution.","The KKK was a secret society created during the Reconstruction era to intimidate blacks and white reformers. The white-supremacist group employed terrorizing methods towards individuals usually associated with the Republican Party. Northerners were often associated with the Republican Party by southerners. This elucidates the connection between Northerners and the term carpetbaggers. The term carpetbagger was used as a derogatory reference for northern whites who moved to the southern states during Reconstruction. They were often viewed as exploiters who were taking advantage of the economic, social, and political conditions of southern society for their own personal gain. Members of the KKK blamed the Republicans for overturning their social order and imposing restrictions on southern whites who had supported the Confederate war effort. They burned black-owned buildings, and terrorized and killed freedmen who tried to exercise their right to vote in elections. Unfortunately, their efforts were usually successful. However, due to the efforts of reformers such as Pierson who demanded that the government take action, the KKK gradually faded away."],"display_date":"February 12, 1869 - December 31, 1870","search_date":"1870-01-21","locations":[{"id":2224,"lat":32.0399997503,"lng":-84.1970888963,"zoom":9,"place":"SUMTER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3673,"title":"Northern Neck of Virginia Desires Immigrants\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-01-01","end_date":"1872-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Board of Immigration from the counties of Richmond, Westmoreland, Lancaster, and Northumberland assembled to compose their forthcoming pamphlet enticing immigrants to their regions of Virginia: ...our earnest desire is to attract to it and immigration not only from the northern and north-western states, but also from Canada and Europe.

Zephaniah Turner raised this question repeatedly before the House of Delegates in Richmond. In the eyes of Turner, West Virginians were just as responsible for payment as Virginians, seeing as how the debt had existed before dismemberment of the state. Turner blasted Virginia's political representatives for rattling on about preserving honor when their priority should have been to prevent burdening the state's citizens with enormous taxes. When the people discover the unjust tax plans, Turner exclaimed, they would run out the current leaders and elevate to their places others who have less sublimated ideas of honor and fame and the past, and more practical ones as to the present and future."," In the aftermath of the Civil War, Virginia faced a significant economic hurdle-- a public debt of approximately 45 million. Although the debt, initially used to fund transportation initiatives like railroads and canals, started out as 33 million prior to war, the amount had swelled to its present state. Debates ensued over how to pay this sum. Since the westernmost counties of Virginia had only established the new state of West Virginia in 1863, some, like Turner, argued that the debt belonged to West Virginia as well and thus Virginians were not legally bound to pay anything. However, the main controversy of 1871 became whether Virginia should fund its entire debt plus interest or pay at a readjusted (reduced) level. This battle catalyzed the formation of two factions, the Funders and the Readjusters."," In 1871 the state government passed the Funding Act. This legislation pledged Virginia to pay the debt in full, marking the state as the only southern postwar government to fund its debt at such a high rate. As rationale, Funders pointed to the importance of saving the honor of Virginia, although additional motivation came from the fact that many were looking to profit from their state bonds. The Funders' decision eventually proved to be a strain for Virginia as it exhausted the state of its revenues and forced it to borrow just to continue operating its government. Leaders also severed funding for social services such as asylums, encouraged skyrocketing property taxes, and enforced new taxation on items such as dogs and liquor consumption. In addition, although constitutional requirements demanded the state to assume most of the cost of the new public school system, the Funders instead chose to shut down half of its schools, citing public education as a luxury.

Northern leaders had degraded you and themselves, he criticized, by inviting the co-operation of the black race with Abraham Lincoln's proclamation freeing slaves in the Confederacy and inviting them into the North's army and navy. Just before, the Union had been condemning the South for seeking the intervention of the white French and English. "," In response to Lincoln's actions, Davis issued a statement of his own, declaring slave status for all free blacks in the South. Captured black Union soldiers would also be deemed chattel, as would all African Americans in any states taken by the Confederacy. Slavery is a corner-stone of a Western Republic, Davis emphasized, and the proper condition of the negro is slavery, or a complete subjection to the white man. "," The Confederate President composed his address during a bleak time for the South. A few months earlier, Southern troops had suffered defeats in both Kentucky and Maryland, obliterating any hopes of recognition and aid from England or any other European nations. Davis knew that Great Britain would not risk involvement in the conflict unless signs clearly pointed toward a Confederate victory. In addition, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation provided the North with the moral upper hand in the eyes of anti-slavery England and France. The South recognized its need to defend itself as the elimination of slavery became a major goal of the North, which had initially put forth preservation of the Union as its primary aim above all else. "," Davis' reference to blacks in the Union military reflected another significant difference between the North and the South. The North employed African Americans even before Lincoln's declaration; Union commanders sometimes recruited black troops, and in 1862 the War Department sanctioned the recruitment of African Americans. By the end of the war, almost one out of every ten Union soldiers was African American.

During debates for the December Legislative session, several people, including the governor, presented their opinions to defend the bank. Benjamin Yancey, after summarizing the previous remarks, passionately defended the bank. He provided a brief history of the bank in the state and differentiated it from the national bank. He explained why the state bank has served a public good even though most citizens were unaware of it. The bank, according to Yancey, had paid profits into the state treasury department that went to pay off public debt that financed public projects. Furthermore, the bank had never been in better condition and was financially sound where all available assets met its liabilities. Another example of the public good given emphatically was the loan to the Georgia Rail Road Banking Company. This loan provided resources to a company that would build railroads that will bring more connections to the state and bring in untold millions. Finally, Yancey demonstrated how the bank had kept the prices of slaves from depreciating. He cited an example in Alabama to persuade others to realize without the bank, the economy would not be in good shape. ","As seen during the 1830's, the issue of the bank of the United States became ever more important. The historian Michael O'Brien discusses the role Andrew Jackson and John C. Calhoun played in matters of the bank of the United States. O'Brien provides support to the position that the bank played a very important role in politics. Jackson, against the bank for ideological reasons, fought to defeat it. He removed the bank deposits, effectively killing the bank in 1834. Directly as a result of this, the Whig Party formed in opposition to Jackson. John C. Calhoun, another opponent to Jackson, favored the bank and fought against Jackson when he removed the bank deposits."],"display_date":"December 13, 1848 - December 13, 1855","search_date":"1852-06-13","locations":[{"id":11504,"lat":33.8449766897,"lng":-81.9100531274,"zoom":8,"place":"EDGEFIELD, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3690,"title":"The Southern Press\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-05-25","end_date":"1849-05-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The <em>Keowee Courier</em> published Senator Butler's contention that shocked the local town of South Carolina that the Southern Press was not to be found in the North. His statement read that not a Southern newspaper is to be seen in a large newspaper reading room in Washington D.C.

Shall we continue to make Northern men wealthy in order to promote their abolition doctrines These acts menaced the institution of slavery. Southerners must rally around Southern newspapers and bear in mind that each dollar spent to help the wealthy Northerners was only helping them challenge freedoms enjoyed by the South. ","The South always felt the North did not respect Southern society nearly as much as it should. William Freehling argues that South Carolinians thought they were special for representing the 'old South' and for the intellectual stature. This newspaper article matches the scholarship of Freehling and indicates the importance of how Southerners thought they were viewed in the North. They had a high sense of 'self-worth and would challenge anyone who did not agree. By not granting the Southern newspapers on the same stature as Northern newspapers, Northerners were perceived as insulting South Carolinian. ","This reflects the larger concerns over slavery. South Carolinians, even in 1849, feared the abolitionist intentions of the North. The Free Soil Party had run as a moderately successful third party in the 1848 election but was nowhere close to being popular. However, Southerners were aware of Northern abolition intentions, even if they were on a small scale and feared that any disrespectful action towards the South meant that abolition of slavery was coming.

One of the greatest political figures of the 19th century had just died and the atmosphere surrounding his death was incredible. Both Chambers were crowded to overflowing, and the stillness that pervaded the vast assemblage told plainly that some great calamity had happened to the country. Calhoun, born in Abbeville in 1782, had served the state of South Carolina on a national level for many years. The entire front page of the Courier devoted its coverage to his death. Senator Butler, in his remarks about the death of Calhoun, called him one of the nation's great gentlemen, who treated everyone with justice and fairness. Butler further emphasized Calhoun's love of the nation, his devotion of service to the institutions of the country. As head of the Senate, he presided over the chamber with dignity and with efficiency and with a true devotion of service to the country. The following day's coverage further demonstrated the deep love and admiration of Calhoun. His body was brought into the Congressional chamber for a viewing which was filled with the President, Vice President and many officers of the army and navy. As Butler noted, one of the brightest luminaries has been extinguished from the political firmament. ","The death of Calhoun marked the end of one of the great compromisers of the ante-bellum South. Even though he did not see live to see the Compromise of 1850, he played an instrumental role in the compromise. He did propose ending slavery in the District of Columbia because he feared the potential consequences of maintaining it there. ","Furthermore, William Freehling discusses Calhoun's role within South Carolina. South Carolina viewed him as a hero, someone to be proud of. He was their senator and the vice president and played a critical role in the nullification crisis during the 1830's. The Courier's tribute to his life demonstrated the deep affections local communities had for Calhoun, and Freehling concurs with the newspaper in describing how important Calhoun was to South Carolina. Even though Calhoun had been a defender of slaveholders' rights, he still agreed to compromise. But he only wanted to compromise to a certain degree. Calhoun was a champion of state's rights and this attitude would later contribute to the secession crisis in 1860. The nullification crisis demonstrated Calhoun's belief in the fundamental sovereignty of South Carolina which would be used to justify secession from the union ten years after his death. After his death, the old guard of Clay and Calhoun gave way to a new generation which would have to deal with new compromises and new challenges and new threats to break up the union.

The Courier reflected on the prudence of how to protect Southern rights within the senate proceedings. Concerns were expressed regarding what the future would hold in store if California were admitted in the Union as a free state. The great discussion involved several senators, Badger, Downs and Pratt, and whether or not they should enter a formal protest into the bill. Debates continued in the House of Representatives and involved whether or not to establish a territorial government for Utah. Nevertheless, the Bill passed the Senate with Senator Pratt of Maryland voting against the bill and Senators Downs and Badger abstained from voting on the bill. ","The compromise of 1850 had a tremendous effect on the country. Both Northern and Southern loyalists felt the compromise weakened their positions. As argued in the book, The Civil War and Reconstruction, Henry Clay, usually given credit for enabling a compromise, did play a pivotal role, but he did not lay out all of the terms of a compromise. Clay's dramatic Senate speech early on in the year summed up his life as a politician and continued the approach that slavery was bad and evil but did little to actually bring it to an end. Calhoun, before his death, gave a speech in the Senate saying how the union had lost its old republic sense that the hostility towards the South and slavery had to be stopped or else secession could be justified. Donald, Baker and Holt provide evidence to support that point and seem to indicate that secession could be close at hand.

Northerners were tired of Southerners always controlling party politics and Southerners believed that any restriction of slavery or the expansion of slavery was unacceptable, as evidenced by the newspaper article. David Donald, Jean Baker and Michael Holt argued in their book, <em>The Civil War and Reconstruction</em>, that Southerners even began to question the meaning of the Union and what to do if a provision, like the Proviso which struck at their rights to slavery, passed Congress. The newspaper wrote in protest of the Proviso in order to mobilize support against it, but it is debatable whether or not the Proviso truly caused fear in South Carolina. Nevertheless, at the heart of southern society, slavery did exist, and it had to be protected. ","The House passed the bill twice but the Senate prevented it from becoming law each time Even though the Proviso ultimately did not pass, the issue of territorial slavery expansion did not go away; the issue of slavery expansion remained salient throughout the 1850's."],"display_date":"September 1, 1849","search_date":"1849-09-01","locations":[{"id":11627,"lat":34.811393256,"lng":-82.9187403935,"zoom":9,"place":"PICKENS, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3698,"title":"Blood in the Streets\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-01-07","end_date":"1847-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Contrary to popular belief, the Civil War was not an instantaneous outbreak of violence. The years leading up to the affair were full of bargains, compromises, and violent encounters that transcended both racial and societal lines. On January 7, 1847, many newspapers distributed articles focusing on the ongoing war with Mexico. The dispute increased social and political unrest back east, and the decision of whether or not to allow slavery in the new lands previously occupied by Mexicans was at or near the top of the agenda. In an attempt to bolster and create a harmonious atmosphere in the nation's capital, the news publication The National Era ran an article proclaiming the importance of order and abstinence from violence in the District at such a perilous time. The most threatening concern expressed in the article was the importance of keeping the city running smoothly and peacefully, despite widespread domestic turmoil. The citizens of Washington felt this was vital because visiting foreign diplomats saw Washington as a picture or representation of the nation as a whole. Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the city in order to secure positive foreign relations. After all, if anarchy existed in the city of Washington, then visiting foreign diplomats would be less inclined to trade or do business and would also leave with a poor impression of Americans and republican liberty in general. The gradual emergence of a world economy built upon trading was fundamental to the existence of both the North and South. This futuristic ideal economy requires, at the very least, peaceful conditions back in Washington so as to promote the kind of city-on-a-hill atmosphere that will attract foreign support. Richmond for example, saw an increase in urban population and a rise of new professions such as prostitution - which could yield a livable economic income at the time. After further examination, Joshua Rothman pointed out that resources were scarce and consequently, prostitutes constantly assaulted one another in public. If upon arrival foreign ambassadors or diplomats were greeted with a scene similar to the picture Rothman paints of Richmond, then their view of Washington would no doubt be negative, and therefore detrimental to the reputation, accountability, and future existence of the nation as a whole."],"display_date":"January 7, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-07","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3702,"title":"Prospectus for 1850\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-12-13","end_date":"1849-12-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the antebellum period newspapers frequently published editorials that prophesized the events to come. These special prospectuses gave readers a direct insight into the minds of the editors by outlining their principles and beliefs. The National Era was a weekly abolitionist newspaper and the editor of the paper, Mr. Bailey, was interested in publishing literary ideas as well as developments and changes taking place during this period of history.Many of these prophecies did indeed come true as illustrated by one of Mr. Bailey's arguments, which essentially stated that federal legislation ought to be amended so as to place a limit on the President's time in office. The ratifications of the twenty-second amendment ratified on February 27, 1951, provided that, No person shall be elected to the office of President of the United States more than twice. Therefore, Bailey's prediction proved to be valid, despite being a hundred years overdue. In a way, many of Bailey's predictions proved to be more valid than the speculations from Edward Bellamy's famous work Looking backward: 2000-1887. For example, Bellamy predicts cheaper costs for education in the years to come for public schools, when in fact tuition rates and student debts have been gradually increasing over time. Though many of the penny press' so called prospectuses did shed some insight on the future to come, they also had an ambivalent side with predictions so vague that they easily could have some aspects of truth.

Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press. In an article published on March 12, 1857, The National Era ran an explanatory article breaking down the case and illustrating its ramifications.The article pointed out that, with the Dred Scott ruling, an African American could never become a citizen of the United States. More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable. If he or she were the victim of the ever-increasing practice of kidnapping free blacks and selling them back into slavery as with Solomon Northup, a freeborn person of color, then that person would have no means to pursue any kind of defense in their name. Though it was certainly not the only account of its kind, Northup's story began in New York where he was lured with tales of lucrative labor opportunities to Washington, D.C. There, he was drugged, threatened with death if he told anyone the truth about his true identity, and put on a boat bound for New Orleans where he would work as a slave for almost twelve years. Upon reviewing Northup's memoirs, Walter Johnson concluded Northup's account centered on a single question: who can be trusted?

Many rumors circulated about secret deals with foreign countries in exchange for economic and Republican support. One particular rumor published in an article from the Farmer's Cabinet concerned the possibility of a United States acquisition of all Nicaraguan lands in exchange for help establishing a firm and stable government. The authors pre-disposition against the British was quite apparent as the author went so far as to blame them for creating a treaty with Nicaragua to debunk the United States' plans for expansion into Latin America. This geopolitical chess game is not an unfamiliar scene in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There were many occasions when it was rumored that Washington had already worked out plans with a foreign nation only to discover later that such a possibility could never exist. Only a few weeks after this article was published, the Panama Railway opened, becoming the first railway to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The influence of articles like the one from the Farmer's Cabinet helped to keep Washington in check.

Virginia had just succeeded and the loyalty of the yard was torn between North and South. Both sides wanted it and sent forces to take control of it. The first ones to get there were two companies of Virginia Navy volunteers and militiamen of the Norfolk Greys who mustered outside the gates. They hoped to persuade Commodore McAuley, the man in charge, to give control up to the Confederates. McAuley had already planned on holding out at the yard until the Union arrived to take it over, which he thought would be soon. This put him in a serious predicament: he could try and hold out and risk losing the yard to the confederates, or he could burn the yard to the ground and sink all of its ships so the confederates couldn't use anything at the yard. McAuley chose the latter, he burnt the whole yard and sank all of the ships. As all of this ruckus was going on, the help that McAuley was waiting on arrived. The USS Pawnee arrived from the Potomac River, and the Union soldiers finished setting fire to the yard and blew up the dry dock to put it out of use. The Pawnee then headed back north leaving the Gosport Naval Yard in ruins. They also left the Confederates with many heavy guns, gun powder, and the sunken USS Merrimack."," This event contains the fight between the North and the South for the possession of seats of power. In the case of Gosport it was a heavily armed naval yard. Even though it was in Virginia, which succeeded, the Union claimed much of the weapons contained in the yard. This event shows the hostility that existed between the North and South even at the beginning of the war, and how people were pressured to quickly side with one or the other, like in McAuley's case. It shows the phenomenon of how the two sides in the war so quickly came to oppose each other when, not long before, they were all one country that shared much of the same heritage.

This financial strain, however, concerned Southerners less than its implications for domestic policy.  They warned, If it is not, it ought to be understood that the Tariff is only one of the subjects of complaint in the South.  The Internal Improvement, or general bribery system, and the interference with our domestic policy are things which will, if necessary, be met with something more than words.  More specifically, slave owners feared Federal interference with South Carolina slave policy.  These grumblings represented a prelude to more conflict, including the Nullification Controversy and later, the Civil War.The nullification confrontation of 1832 and 1833 dealt with whether or not a state could nullify federal law.  South Carolina senator John C. Calhoun, a supporter of states ability to nullify federal law, threatened secession to President Andrew Jackson in 1832 and 1833 if the federal agency encroached upon states' rights.  In addition, he noted that a state convention, while remaining in the Union, could use its absolute sovereignty to render a federal law null and void within that particular state's limits.  South Carolina, and the coastal areas in particular, were especially invested in nullification.  David Houston explores why this was the case.  As the first Southern state to delve into cotton cultivation, South Carolina was the first to see its soil lose its fertility.  This led to a disastrous decline in cotton prices from 1819 to 1835 and to progressively higher American tariffs.  William Freehling adds that these tariffs threatened the establishment of slavery, an explicit South Carolinian interest.  The South Carolina coastal plain was the most densely enslaved Southern area and, therefore, particularly sensitive to America's first antislavery stirrings.   In an interesting turn of events, Calhoun rendered nullification unnecessary by joining with Henry Clay in early 1833 to implement the Compromise Tariff, which very slowly lowered the duties.  This compromise temporarily quelled tensions, however South Carolinian dissatisfaction continued well beyond 1830 and fueled controversy that would contribute to the Civil War."],"display_date":"1830 - 1833","search_date":"1832-01-01","locations":[{"id":11522,"lat":33.1820917038,"lng":-79.1977192455,"zoom":9,"place":"GEORGETOWN, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3782,"title":"Woman Suffrage Summarily Disposed of in MissouriWoman Suffrage Summarily Disposed of in Missouri\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-02-17","end_date":"1871-02-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Missouri Congressional session of 1871, women suffragists from across the ","state drafted a proposal which was given to the State Senate Committee.

He felt that if the state were allowed to ignore any law put in place by the National government, then the entire Union was threatened.

Stuart, on the other hand, was born in nearby Staunton where he was greatly involved with politics.   Although both of these men were politicians, they also owned land that they farmed.  In his letter to Stuart, Letcher seemed very concerned that Stuart had received some particular seeds for his farm.

Even though the two men were politicians, they depended on agriculture to supply food for their families as well as wealth to further their political careers.  Farming provided economic and social well-being for many other families in the South.  Without farms many people would not have been able to survive.  Particularly in western Virginia, much of the most fertile land was depleted, so many families resorted to subsistence farming.  They also tried to grow enough crops to profit from their hard labor.  The Stuart family was definitely one of these families who practiced both for-profit and subsistence farming.  The great concern for the delivery of the seeds demonstrates how these seeds were important.  The Stuart family needed these seeds to continue the preservation of their family.  They needed the seeds for food and to sell their crops on the market.     ","  Congressman John Letcher knew the situation of his friend and fellow politician because he was also in the same position.  Letcher hailed from Rockbridge County where agriculture played a similar role as it did in Augusta.  Letcher and his family practiced subsistence as well as market-based farming just like the Stuarts.  Numerous Southern families, such as the Letchers and Stuarts, relied on agriculture to provide food for the family and to represent the family's entire economic well-being.

In April 1862, the Senate Committee on the Conduct of War was asked to investigate accusations of Confederate crimes against Union dead and wounded at the First Battle of Manassas.  On May 5, 1862, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> published the Committee's report, including excerpts of testimony and their conclusions.  The testimony was taken from soldiers and citizens who witnessed or were victims of the atrocities.  The testimony of Drs. Swain and Ferguson both highlighted instances in which wounded Union soldiers were denied adequate medical care, leading to further pain and death in some cases.  Louis Francis, a Union soldier, gave testimony as a victim of this inadequate treatment; his wounds were so badly tended that on several occasions the bone of his amputated leg continued to rupture through his wound.  His multiple requests for a more qualified surgeon were all denied.    Finally, the Committee heard testimony from many citizens who had witnessed Confederate soldiers desecrating the bodies of the Union dead in order to obtain trophies, such as bones or skulls.  All of the testimony and evidence led the Committee to find that Confederate soldiers had committed atrocities against the Union's wounded and deceased.  In their conclusion, the committee decried the barbarism of the Confederacy and called for the support of all loyal people and foreign nations to defeat this inhumane and immoral enemy of the Republic.  ","The First Battle of Manassas was an embarrassing defeat for the North; it weighed down their spirit of prewar triumphalism, deflated the morale of the troops, and quelled public support for the Civil War.  Historian Harry Stout claims that many religious and civilian leaders viewed the defeat as a moral judgment against the North's leaders and their aims in war.   After the defeat, the North needed to rally mass public support and boost the morale of the troops; this report and its publication were an attempt to define the North's cause as a noble fight against the barbarism of the uncivilized South.  The committee made this expressly clear in their conclusion's call for support and solidarity against the inhumane enemy.  This article framed the conflict as a war that pitted the civilized and virtuous North against the uncivilized and barbaric South; this interpretative shift helped the Union regain popular support for the War and reenergized their troops against the enemy.

News of the nation's worst military defeat on the frontier traveled slowly. A massive blizzard blanketed the West and traveled eastward, preventing America from learning the fate of the 81 soldiers until nearly two weeks after their deaths. When newspapers finally received word from their frontier correspondents, a horrified nation was stunned by news of an Indian attack like no other to date.","\"Massacre\" screamed the headlines as Americans tried to piece together what had happened.

Fort Kearny's commander and Fetterman's superior, Colonel Carrington became the immediate scapegoat. Carrington was accused of everything from cowardice to incompetence as the War Department sought to paint the fiasco as problem of local, rather than national, command. Courts of inquiry convened and official investigations, both by the Army, and eventually Congress, lead to conflicting testimony. Rather than conducting \"a war of extermination,\" the Army quietly settled affairs the following year by signing a treaty with Red Cloud, the Indian leader responsible for planning the attack on Fetterman.","But ultimately, Fetterman himself would take the blame for the \"Fetterman Massacre.\" Popular history describes him as an arrogant, foolhardy officer whose underestimation of Indians led to not only his own demise, but, excepting only Custer's Last Stand, the worst Indian-related disaster on the Plains in American history."],"display_date":"December 21, 1866","search_date":"1866-12-21","locations":[{"id":15204,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"DATOKA TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3882,"title":"Furman University&#39;s Philosophian Society Discusses Divisive Issues\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-03-22","end_date":"1861-04-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 22, 1861 in Philosophian Hall at Furman  University, a secretive meeting was called to order.  A leather-bound book as tall as a man's forearm with robin's egg blue pages was then opened reverently, and a man's voice read aloud the last meeting's minutes.  After he finished, his hand held a pen poised above the first line of a new page, ready to record in flowing script the minutes of the newest meeting of the Philosophian Society.  ","The Society met to discuss important philosophical, historical, and contemporary issues.  During a typical meeting the members decided on a small question to discuss immediately and another question to more seriously and thoroughly debate at a later time.  For the postponed debate, specific members - often teams of two or more - were assigned positions in favor or against and given several weeks to prepare.","The March 22, 1861 meeting exemplifies the Philosophian Society's typical blend of topics.  The immediate discussion questioned whether Joan of Arc was an enthusiast or imposter.  For official debate, the men considered if \"a man [was] justified in obeying a law of his country which he [felt] to be morally wrong?\"  While the Philosophian Society covered both ancient and current issues, the minutes reveal that its members felt the latter to be more important because of the ratio of time and effort spent on each.  At the conclusion of the debate on April 5, 1861, the secretary recorded the Philosophian Society's decision: a man was <em>not</em> justified in obeying laws he felt morally wrong.  The Society's emphasis on contemporary issues also included the admittance of free  states into the Southern Confederacy, the taking of Fort Sumter immediately following secession, and the prohibition of the slave trade in the Southern Confederacy's constitution.  ","Furman's Philosophian Society mirrored the larger trend by addressing the divisive and emotionally charged topics of religion, politics, and war.  According to Jonathan Daniel Wells, debate was not limited to collegiate societies, like those at Furman or the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but spread into the wider southern population.  Southerners established literary and debating societies to open dialogues in which they willingly and safely discussed such controversial issues for both education and entertainment.  Stephen Ash's depiction of John Robertson illustrates the importance of a safe forum.  John Robertson, an East  Tennessean who supported the Confederacy in a largely Unionist area, experienced violent and destructive persecution because of his beliefs.  Wells suggests that debating societies allowed people of different opinions to present their contradicting views in a civil manner without fear of retribution.","These southern societies applied their northern predecessors' models of organization and operation even as the gap widened between northern and southern states.  They grew in number and popularity as the middle class enlarged, serving an important centralizing and community-building function in a south divided by limited transportation systems and scattered populations.

Randolph, representative of Albemarle  County, gave a speech in regards to possible emancipation within the state.  Although it was 1832 at the time of this address, the proposed plan that Randolph spoke about would only affect slaves born after 1840 and would take 80 years to complete.  Virginians would hold male and female slaves until they reached the ages of 18 and 21.  Upon this age, the state would remove the slaves from the Commonwealth.  This produced a heated debate among Virginia leaders, and Randolph sought to promote the plan; at the very least, he wanted to propose the idea to all the constituents of Virginia.     ","            The Virginia emancipation debate of the 1830s rarely consisted of extreme abolitionist views.  However, some Virginians did have opinions about whether or not the institution of slavery was politically and economically necessary.  Randolph suggested that the gradual emancipation plan would not hurt the state economically, as it \"levies no money tax upon the people - each slave pays his own removal by his hire.\"  He argued that slaves would still be in the state until they reached adulthood, and even afterwards, they could be sold to other southern states for a profit.  Politically, Randolph argued that since the plan would take a full 80 years, its effects would not be sudden.  He said even if negative consequences emerged, then \"a repeal of the law\" would bring things back to the 1832 standard.  ","            In addition to the political and economic aspects of gradual emancipation, Randolph discussed the immorality of slavery.  He pointed out that slavery was not justified by the fact that other lands practiced it.  He argued that \"upon the same principle he could justify...plurality of wives...,murder...,\" and other endeavors that Americans considered wrong, but which took place in other areas.  Furthermore, he criticized the many Southerners who used the Bible to justify slavery.  He highlighted the Biblical passages that actually made slavery a dishonorable practice, such as \"that which teaches charity, justice, and good will to all.\"  At a time when southerners rarely questioned the morality of slavery's moral aspect, Randolph clearly took a risk in some of his arguments.","            Following his political, economic, and moral reasoning, Randolph exploited southerners' anxieties regarding slaves in order to advance his argument.  The Nat Turner Rebellion, which led to the deaths of many Virginians, afflicted fear upon the state and led some to question the institution of slavery.  Randolph argued that if gradual emancipation and removal were not put into effect, then the slave population would grow and become uncontrollable.  He said this group could potentially be found \"burning with enthusiasm for the liberation of their race\" and rebel.  Even with this daunting point, there were still many listeners who opposed Randolph's strong democratic views.  Randolph therefore implored that his fellow delegates at least propose the plan to their constituents in order to decide what step to take next.  Mostly western Virginians, along with the state's governor and a few legislators, applauded Randolph's idea. However, other eastern Virginians such as William Brodnax thought it was \"a scheme...destined to produce 30 years of domestic warfare...(and)...to make every patriarch a child-seller.\"   Various ideas emerged following Jefferson's proposal, including Brodnax's plan for immediate deportation, many elitists' hope to discontinue the debate all together, and Archibald Bryce's \"abstract affirmation of colonization.\"  Randolph supported Bryce in hopes to start any sort of emancipation movement. Legislators debated Bryce's plan to fund the deportation of blacks but ultimately only passed it in the House without confirming it in the Senate.  Thus, although, Virginia adopted what historian William Freehling calls \"an ambivalent, ineffective colonization experiment,\" the power struggle between eastern elitists and western egalitarians was significant.  It foreshadowed the tension in Virginia that would persist for decades to come.

Chiles wrote a letter to fellow South Carolinian Reverend James C. Furman detailing the health of Chiles' family and the surge of religious revival in his area.  Chiles began the letter with an apology that it had taken him so long to respond offering the explanation that he had been close to death and his youngest sister had died.  Joy and sorrow flowed together as he lamented the determination of the diseases that attacked his family, but praised God for his sovereignty.  Chiles continued on matters of God, taking a more optimistic turn as he recounted the great spirit of revival in his area that year, and he told Furman about the many baptisms he was performing in local churches.   He briefly mentioned the \"excitement of politicks\" regarding their state and how he hoped they were rightly following the path of God.  After committing to pray for these events he ended his letter asking for a personal meeting with Furman to see each other and preach together.","  Chiles' letter echoes the attentions of many Americans during the early 1830s.  The masses had a general awareness of political events and conflicts, but they concentrated most on personal matters with a particular emphasis on disease, death, and religion.  The early 1830s brought an onslaught of contagious diseases such as influenza and cholera, but the simultaneous onset of a widespread Christian revival offered hope to families stricken by epidemic disease.  Americans believed that God was in control and looked forward to the promise of seeing loved ones again in the afterlife.  Additionally, with death and religion capturing the attention of the people, there was little time left to ponder the tenuous condition of state and federal affairs.  Chiles' vague mention of excitement in his area most likely refers to the nullification crisis of the early 1830s when outraged Southerners proposed to nullify the high tariffs they believed favored Northern manufacturing cities and crippled the South.  President Andrew Jackson objected to the nullifiers and proclaimed secession unconstitutional, even while Vice President John Calhoun (a South Carolinian) led the faction supporting nullification.  The same month that Chiles wrote his letter, December 1832, Calhoun stepped down from the vice presidency as tension rose over the split in ideology.  Henry Clay managed to mollify the situation with the Compromise Tariff in February 1833 by calling for a gradual lowering of tariffs which eased the threat of conflict for the present.  Even in the midst of such seemingly crucial events, personal matters still consumed individuals like Chiles and prevented them from entering into the political dialogue.

It was here, in Columbia, that the federal court attempted to provide serious solutions to stunt the organization whose actions had become increasingly violent and oppressive. While these actions by the federal court and the infamous nature of the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina created controversial issues in the late 1860s and early 1870s, the \"reign of terror\" by the Ku Klux Klan was temporarily immobilized by token arrests in 1871. ","The Ku Klux Klan planted their roots, under emissary R.J. Brunson in 1868 in Rock Hill, S.C. The Democrats, hoping to win back governmental positions in South Carolina, felt that by intimidating and eliminating the \"negro Republican vote,\" victory could once again belong to the Democratic Party. In Abbeville County, for instance, the secretive, violent actions of the Democratic Party went hand in hand with the actions of the Ku Klux Klan, working together in most cases. In the presidential election year, South Carolina was anticipated to have won steadily Republican seats, but instead, intimidation triumphed democracy.","The violence exploded in the elections of 1868, as Abbeville, Newberry and Anderson counties were entitled \"the KKK counties\" because of the armed mobs and murders that occurred on Election Day as white supremacists employed violence to ensure political upheaval. One Southern man claimed that they [white Southern Democrats] were being \"trodden under foot by an inferior and barbarous race.\" But by 1870, the Democrats could no longer depend on intimidation to win elections and the emergence of the more militant KKK continually gained momentum, primarily for Democratic Party political gains, and of course, in the name of white supremacy. When 2,500 armed whites gathered in Laurens County to violently protest the election results in 1870, violence spread among the upstate of South Carolina. Negroes were pulled out of jail, beaten and murdered by white supremacy members of the KKK. In York County alone, in the course of six months, there was an estimated 304 incidents of violence. Klan violence, though the Klan had been officially disbanded in 1969, arose out of all socio-economical classes in a decentralized format, reigning terror and death wherever possible. The federal government, under Grant in late 1870 and early 1871, respectively passed the Enforcement Act and the Ku Klux Klan Act hoping to put an end to the once again rebellious South through these increasingly strict federal acts. Because of these acts, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended in nine South Carolina counties and in most cases, the procedure of due process was neglected.","The trials, evidenced by Evans Murphy's questioning during one aspect of the ongoing South Carolina trials, proved mostly ineffective and as support waned, largely futile. In the South Carolina KKK trials alone, an account collaborated by the federal government in 1873 discovered that 831 persons were indicted and only 27 of which were ruled guilty, 71 persons pled guilty, and by 1875 pardons released the last of the imprisoned KKK members and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 was passed in early March. Under the Klan's \"virtual reign of terror,\" however, much violence and terror was accomplished. But those who were caught and testified in court, such as Evans Murphy, created an environment not easily conducive to convictions. Evans claimed \"[he] didn't see anything [himself], [he] didn't do anything [himself],\" and \"[he] didn't hear anything\" about the night he was said to have been one of nine members in a beating at the Rainey house. Yet, as the questioner so succinctly stated, \"so it turns out that those who happen to be indicted didn't do anything, and all those that haven't been caught, did the whipping.\"  And with that testimony, Evans Murphy, like the other token Klan members convicted, was fined one hundred dollars and imprisoned for eighteen months, in order for South Carolina to put an end to Klan violence and grant South Carolina peace. The story of Evans Murphy provides insight into the South Carolina Ku Klux Klan trials, which temporarily shattered the Ku Klux Klan and reinstated temporary law and order, only to have the organization emerge once again in the 1920s, more violent than ever."],"display_date":"December 28, 1871 - March 1, 1875","search_date":"1873-07-29","locations":[{"id":11639,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3900,"title":"Southern Wartime Humor Concerning President Lincoln\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-01-07","end_date":"1863-01-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 7, 1863 the Raleigh Register published a song by Smith Webb mocking President Lincoln and his ability to keep the Union together.

The newspapers printed humor in different forms including drawings, songs, and poems.  The humorous propaganda was very political and commonly associated with a certain party relating to both local and national events. The humor appealed to all classes and united them during their time of struggle. Many of the humorous writings focused on patriotism. Often the writings urged citizens to fight in the war or support their nation and the war effort with more enthusiasm.  Humor was also used as an outlet to express discontent with the war and the political situations occurring during the time. ","The Confederate newspapers constantly published wartime humor mocking Lincoln and portraying him in extreme fashions.  Lincoln was the embodiment of the South's anger with the war and the current state of affairs.  His trouble with secession was a constant subject of mockery from the southern newspapers.  One cartoon depicted Lincoln as an acrobat balancing the North on one side of his pole while dropping the South to the floor below.  Another cartoon depicted Lincoln as a circus performer about to do a balancing act with the northern and the southern states as plates on sticks balancing in the air.  Lincoln was subject of a variety of wartime humor published in the South, but all the humor published served to communicate the current political issues and opinions.

He proposed the construction of a huge public park that would \"be enjoyed by thousands of all classes, without distinction.\"  The ideals of Romanticism and the Republican view of the importance of nature were at a peak among educated Americans at this time and this commentator proposed a way to manifest these ideals.  New York City, being the largest city as well as the informational center, certainly had many who supported the idea that nature should be valued and used respectfully to enrich one's mind and refresh one's spirit.  From these beliefs arose the idea for the creation of a huge park to be enjoyed by all the citizens of New York City.  This journalist, in <u>The Horticulturist, and Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste</u>, was one of the first to publish his opinions on the issue and explain the beginnings of such a park.  He criticized New York for not having enough open public spaces, and emphasized the Republican idea that nature is closely linked with virtue and comparing New York to cities in Europe, most of which had public parks.  The mayor of New York at the time, Ambrose Kingsland, had recently proposed 160 acres for a park.  This proposal was the first of its kind in America for park of such large scale, but the writer condemned this as being too small.  He suggested a 500 acre plot of land between the Harlem River and 39th, land that is in fact today part of Central Park.   Although this author's passionate essay on the importance of establishing a large park brought no immediate action, it marked the beginning of a huge public interest in such an endeavor.  Two years later, in 1853, there were still only 143 acres out of New York's 14,000 dedicated to public spaces, including cemeteries.  Many later authors continued the journalist's argument; one enumerated the reasons why such a park was a necessity for the city, being a haven for health, recreation, and driving and riding.  The park's approval and design finally took form in the late 1850's.  The proposal for Central Park had a huge impact on New York City as well as the patterns of urban development across the country."],"display_date":1851,"search_date":"1851-07-02","locations":[{"id":8924,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":3903,"title":"Govenor Zebulon Vance&#39;s Negotiations with General Sherman\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-11","end_date":"1865-04-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Zebulon Vance, North Carolina's governor during the Civil War, was a very loyal Confederate.

Governor Vance requested the safety for the city's \"defenseless inhabitants.\"  Vance expressed hope that General Sherman would protect the charitable institutions of the state as well as the libraries, museums, and public records.  Governor Vance appealed to General Sherman's logic when he stated, \"I can but entertain the hope that they may escape mutilation or destruction in as much as such evidences of learning and taste could advantage neither party in the prosecution of the war whether destroyed or preserved.\"  ","    Governor Vance made many efforts to save North Carolina from the Union forces before he wrote the letter of surrender to General Sherman.

Vance also attempted to protect the war supplies in North Carolina when he learned the Union army was coming.  Vance feared an invasion by General Sherman because of the campaigns made by Sherman throughout the South.  In these campaigns, Sherman's destroyed large areas of Georgia and South Carolina.

Their choice for president was Millard Fillmore of New York, and for vice president Andrew U. Donelson of Tennessee, nominated by the American Party.  There was no further explanation for this information, but rather an announcement the editors believed to be true for the majority of Abingdon citizens.  A letter by Abingdon resident F. McMullin approved in the May 17, 1856 issue of the newspaper, saying that he had been \"requested by Mr. M. H. Buchannan, sheriff to this county, to state that the same commissioners and conductors who superintended the elections last spring will perform that duty on Thursday next, the 22nd.\"  While Mr. McMullin was only supposed to give this particular information, he went on to write on his own political views.  He said he was aware of the county's choice to vote mostly for the newly-formed American Party, but he wished they would consider their view on the Whig Party and notice that urban areas of the state like Richmond, Norfolk, Lynchburg, and Alexandria still recorded Whig majorities. However, Washington County citizens did not seem to take this letter into consideration.  Even a week later there was still no response regarding it, and these two candidates' names were still printed in bold on the second page of the newspaper.  ","    While this sort of announcement and letter were very prevalent in Virginia newspapers throughout the decade because of Virginians' obsession with politics, there was normally some form of opposition from a citizen within the county. It is ironic that there was no response to this letter, especially since according to historian William Link, only 35 percent of Valley and Southwest Virginia citizens voted for Millard Fillmore in the 1856 election.  In these regions where Abingdon is located, around 90 percent of the citizens voted Democratic and would not only be opposed to Fillmore, but also McMullin's idea for the continuation of Whig approval.  It was unlikely that citizens had nothing to say about the political matter because these issues were the subject of discussion not only in this county in Virginia, but all counties throughout the South.  The Whig Party was dwindling from its previous excellence, the Democratic Party was growing strong, and parties such as the Know-Nothings and American Party were gaining support, yet no one was completely aware of who was to follow.  The main topic of debate was slavery, and by the time of the election of 1856 it was unclear which party would be the most successful in maintaining the South's way of life.  Therefore, it is most likely that a citizen in Abingdon did respond to McMullin's letter, just not immediately as historians would suspect.

At that convention James Shannon gave an address entitled \"Domestic Slavery,\" in which he attempted to justify the practice of slavery and disprove the validity of the reasons given by abolitionists to outlaw the practice. The reasons he gave in support of slavery covered a broad spectrum, typical of the Southern justification of slavery. He cited Bible verses that in his mind showed that slavery was condoned, even encouraged, by God himself. He predicted economic catastrophe in not only the southern United   States, but the entire country, if the slaves received freedom. Shannon estimated the value of slaves in the United States at over two billion dollars, a huge financial loss in the event of emancipation. He attempted to refute claims about the immorality of slavery by arguing that the slaves actually benefited from American slavery, saying that under the guidance of the white race the Africans learned how to be civilized. In his conclusion he suggested that once \"all peaceable means to protect our rights, and save the Union\" were exhausted, \"we will stand to arms,\" and \"God will defend the right.\"","            Shannon's arguments for slavery were typical of the rhetoric used by pro-slavery forces in the decades leading up to the Civil War. Southerners believed that they were justified by the law and by God in their practice of slavery, but Shannon's remarks went beyond simply justifying the practice of slavery. Even in 1855, half a decade before the first state seceded from the Union, the idea of secession from the Union was common among Southern pro-slavery forces. The aggressiveness of the Wilmot Proviso, which proposed outlawing slavery in all the land acquired during the Mexican-American War, caught the attention of Southerners. Shannon was among many others who thought that preemptive action was necessary to stop Northern politicians from outlawing slavery. This early support by Southerners for secession and acceptance of violence as a necessary step in order to protect the right to slavery made the American Civil War seem inevitable, even five years before the first shot was fired."],"display_date":"July 13, 1855","search_date":"1855-07-13","locations":[{"id":7668,"lat":39.0656247172,"lng":-93.7855117112,"zoom":9,"place":"LAFAYETTE, Missouri"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3914,"title":"Opposition to Freedom\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-12-31","end_date":"1889-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            On the last day of 1889, an editor of the <em>Roanoke Daily Times</em> criticized \"the relations of the races,\" which, he avowed, \"do not appear to be at all improved by the election of a Republican president.\"  The editor continued, affirming that black people had \"become restless and arrogant in a large measure, and ready at any time to enter on the work of bloodshed and murder.\"  This was not the case under the presidency of Democrat Grover Cleveland, who assured justice and contentment for all black citizens, the editor argued.

Moreover, the editorial highlighted growing white backlash in Virginia against the rights that African Americans gained following the Civil War. ","            Numerous reasons explain why the editor of the <em>Times</em> criticized Harrison's administration and the situation of black Americans.  Harrison took office in 1888 having defeated Cleveland, the incumbent Democrat.  Running on a platform of \"Rejuvenated Republicanism,\" Harrison received a smaller percentage of the popular vote than Cleveland, and he alienated strongly Democratic areas of the country as he took office in 1889.  Additionally, his support for black civil rights and his appointment of Frederick Douglass as a foreign minister to Haiti further angered his opposition.  Cleveland, on the other hand, had supported returning captured Confederate flags to former Confederate states and had expressed federal appreciation of Confederate soldiers.  Harrison's failure to engender support from Democrats and former Confederates resulted in the 1892 re-election of Cleveland in the most decisive presidential election in 20 years.","            The advancement of civil rights legislation that followed the Civil War was a source of opposition to black citizens.  Historians Nancy Bentlen and Sandra Gunning write that after the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments, \"African American men were suddenly free to enter local and national government during Reconstruction.\"  Philip A. Bruce's publication of <em>The Plantation Negro as a Freeman</em> in 1889 reflected growing white opposition to black freedom.  Characterizing black men as immoral and rebellious, Bruce \"devoted a great deal of time to writing Southern history that directly aided and abetted the post-Reconstruction backlash against African Americans, arguing that as they moved beyond slavery, blacks were inevitably devolving into barbarism.\"  ","            Both the administration of Harrison and the advancement of black rights that took place after the Civil War and Reconstruction gave rise to this editorial.  Its criticisms and fears reflected those of white Virginians across the state, many of whom were staunchly Democratic and still loyal to the former Confederacy.

Additionally, Mahone sought alliances with Republican officeholders in order to gain more political salience.  Pleas like that of McDonald arose, therefore, out of Democrats' fear of Republican and Readjuster control of state-and even national-politics.

In Lynchburg, former Confederate General Jubal Early avowed, \"the Negroes must know that they are to behave themselves and keep in their proper places.\"  McDonald believed that staunchly Democratic Cleveland was an effective counterbalance to the Readjuster movement, and he therefore attempted to feature him as the central figure in Lynchburg's 1887 Fair."],"display_date":"August 22, 1887","search_date":"1887-08-22","locations":[{"id":13702,"lat":37.2188776641,"lng":-79.102397246,"zoom":9,"place":"CAMPBELL, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3950,"title":"The Beginning of the End\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-02-15","end_date":"1861-02-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The inauguration of Abraham Lincoln, the beginning of a new presidential term and a new era, would be the end of the old Union.

In his inaugural address, Lincoln pledged to hold, occupy, and possess all federal property. This was message to all of the Southern states.","The new Southern Confederacy was set on creating its own government and its own constitution. According to The <em>Baltimore Sun</em>, \"it will be the policy of the new government to preserve the <em>status quo</em> of affairs until the 4th of March, when the inauguration of Lincoln will enable him to indicate the course his administration will pursue towards the Southern Confederacy.\" The Southern Confederacy was not willing to wait around to see what policies Lincoln was going to put in place. Representatives of the Southern states sat down and created a constitution. The constitution they created was similar to the original Constitution of the United States but had a few major changes. The constitution adopted by the South was considered temporary and provisional. Delegates to the Southern Congress in Montgomery said, \"we hope the permanent government will be made and established speedily, and without reference to anything going on outside of the confederate states.\" The Southern Confederacy did wish to split from the Union peacefully. One of the first acts of the new government would be to send a commission to Washington to deal with peaceful matters between the two republics. The South Confederacy hoped for \"the acknowledgment of our independence, the surrender of the forts, a fair division of the public property and of the public debt.\" However, many people were aware that the Union would not be easily severed. The article stated, \"let us exhaust every honorable means for a peaceable settlement of the terms of our political separation with the free States-it will be time enough then to resort to the argument of arms, when God defend the right.\" The Southern states knew that they might have to fight to get want they wanted and fight is what they did.

He went on to explain that \"with what little (crops) we have to sell won't bring enough to pay for the expense of raising it.\"  Other such maladies that McClure noted were that the livestock was not selling for a sufficient amount, that many people were ill and dying, and that \"this portion of Virginia has suffered very much with hay cholera,\" which made farmers' meat suffer.  The most challenging trouble he described was the state's economic position, which furthered the racial equality dispute.","After the war, much of the South experienced high debt.  Thus, the government was hesitant to fund certain programs but did raise taxes in order to appropriate money for public education.  Proponents of this had various rationalizations.  First, throughout the post-war South there were much lower literacy and school attendance rates among blacks and whites, as compared to the North.  Furthermore, Southern families grew in size, meaning there were more children to send to school.  Finally, given the hard economic times, the Southern states struggled to pay teachers and upkeep school buildings unless they taxed.  Not everyone favored these taxes, though, and as McClure wrote, it caused \"our state to disagree.\"","On the other side of the debate were white Southerners like McClure who feared blacks would \"infect\" the white students.  Another apprehension was that blacks were inherently immoral, irresponsible, and did not deserve an education.  There were also those who worried about what other types of freedoms blacks would seek if granted equal education.  McClure also mentioned the argument that the tax money was wasted on blacks.  He said that \"9 out of 10 of them may go to school 5 years and they won't advance much beyond a spelling book and in 12 months after leaving school will forget everything.\"  Not only did he find blacks ignorant, but he also claimed that they did not value an education because \"everything they care for is to frolic and drink whiskey.\"  Although McClure wrote this letter in 1886, the sentiments on both sides were not entirely new.","The issue of black and white equality versus inequality was present even before the Civil War began.  What was newest to the debate was the political and religious controversy it sparked.  In the 1870s, the Republican Party promoted funding for public education, claiming that it furthered the ideal of patriotism.  Catholics and some Democrats, on the other hand, argued that the Republicans' platform jeopardized individualism.  Catholics instead sought to gain funding for <em>private</em> education.  No matter how many people wanted public education, racial tensions were at a peak, and many did not want to pay for schooling if it was going to be for blacks.  Some historians saw the \"African factor as the difference between success and failure,\" suggesting that \"white racism undermined any movement for meaningful national unification through mass education\" at the time.  ","As the 1880s arrived, so did a new leading political party of Virginia: the Readjusters, who promoted public education for both blacks and whites.  During this decade, the focus on two parties dwindled while various independent political thoughts emerged.  The truth revealed in McClure's letter was that during that era,Virginia political tension was strong.  He also accurately portrayed the anxieties of many southern whites in regards to post-war education.  Yet history does contradict McClure's fear of public education being a complete waste.  While early Reconstruction may have not been successful in mass education, there were many achievements from 1880 to 1900 as literacy rates rose dramatically among whites <em>and</em> blacks.  Unfortunately, though, with the turn of the century, Edward Ayers notes that \"blacks in the south paid for schools for whites--not the other way around.  The more black citizens in a county, the greater the benefits to white students.\"  Racial tensions would not disappear for some time."],"display_date":1886,"search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":13600,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3957,"title":"Virginia Governor John Floyds Thoughts on Nullification\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-19","end_date":"1832-12-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Virginia residents opened up their newspapers one morning in December 1832 and discovered an address from the governor, John Floyd.  He wrote to the Virginia Senate and House of Delegates in regards to the South Carolina Nullification Ordinance, and the newspaper posted this as an article for locals.  Floyd explained that South Carolina felt the Tariffs took advantage of it and the state had \"declared those laws unconstitutional.\"  In South   Carolina's defense, he noted that its state had implored Congress to overturn those laws many times, but that \"all this had been disregarded by that body.\"  Although Floyd first presented South Carolina's motives for nullification, he went on to note the potentially negative consequences of this action.  The Virginia governor warned that \"should force be resorted to by the Federal Government, the horror of the scenes hereafter to be witnessed cannot now be pictured even by the affrighted imagination.\"  Floyd presented both sides of the issue.  ","Floyd's desires for how Virginians should respond to nullification, more clearly revealed his inclinations.  Historians describe the governor as a \"states' rights advocate\" who \"originally opposed secession.\" These two ideas seemingly conflicted with each other.  Floyd promoted an all-encompassing stance that would preserve South Carolina's rights and also promoted the ideal of limiting Congressional powers without endorsing nullification. He said that first there should be \"an investigation of the causes, with a view to a redress of grievances.\"  However, he acknowledged that South Carolina had already attempted to do this and failed.  Thus, he said the next step was \"an amicable reference...to the great tribunal which formed and adopted the constitution, viz: the PEOPLE of the States themselves.\"  Floyd went so far as to say that if the people could not settle the issue peacefully, it would essentially disparage the ideas of \"liberty\" and \"self-government.\"  Therefore, he presented the state of Virginia with two choices: to support South  Carolina and engage in potential Civil War or to \"appeal to the States of the Union.\"  He warned that the former of the two choices would result in \"fire-side altars bathed in blood,\" and that the latter decision would enable \"the maintenance of...harmony.\"  Floyd presented the two options as having completley different consequences.","Virginia had a task: historian William Freehling explains that ultimately \"the Virginia legislature, even while sending [an official commissioner] to stop South Carolina from nullifying [the tarrifs], affirmed that any state could legally secede.\"  Although Virginia remained in the Union until the fall of Fort Sumter, it did not condemn the actions of the secessionists around it.  This somewhat conciliatory legislative action, as Floyd suggested, would have less severe effects. Interestingly, though, Floyd eventually became a promoter of secession, a Confederate general, and as historians note, \"resigned under charges of financial cheating and transferring arms to the South.\"  Overall, it is evident that Virginians initially took a moderate stance, hoping to avoid confrontation.

Like many Southern newspapers, <em>The Camden Confederate</em> tried to provide people on the home front with as much information as possible regarding the progress of the war, but the information available was not always plentiful or completely reliable. No matter the status of the troops at the time, the newspapers continued to remind the citizens that they were \"fighting for home, property, liberty, life-everything.\"  The papers urged Southerners to hate the Yankees and accept nothing less than success in the war.","            The nationalism found in this newspaper was part of a movement that had begun even before the Civil War to present a strong, united South. As talk of secession began in the late 1850s, leaders in the South began to push for citizens to identify with their state or region rather than the United   States. Once southern states began to leave the Union, this loyalty became even more important to allow the new nation any chance of success. During the Civil War itself, there was little more important than presenting a united home front dedicated to the triumph of the Confederacy. Newspapers such as <em>The Camden Confederate</em> played a key role in advocating Confederate nationalism. This nationalism, extremely strong at the beginning of the Civil War, was not enough to hold the Confederacy together, and as the war drew to a close, so did the intense Southern unity. This is, however, a disputed analysis of Confederate nationalism. Other historians claim that the South remained a united front throughout the war, and a loss of unity has no place in the discussion of the South.

We will be pleased to know that the unpleasant matter is settled.\" ","On December 30, 1885, Phillip Haxall, President of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, penned the preceding sentences in a letter to Chairman William H. Mullen of the Boycott Committee of the Knights of Labor. This statement expresses the significant influence the Knights of Labor had achieved in the areas of labor relations and social reform by the end of the 1880s. The organization, noted for its official motto, \"that is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all,\" was established on January 1, 1869 as a secret society in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Knights of Labor prided themselves on establishing a diverse and integrated membership that was committed to the preservation of working-class rights.  ","Before the industrial influence of the Knights of Labor can be explained, it is important to first understand the underlying premise of the boycott staged against the Haxall-Crenshaw Company. Due to racism still evident throughout the Reconstruction Era, black prison populations had vastly expanded in size. State governments attempted to capitalize on this situation by instituting a system of convict labor. Historian Edward Ayers describes the structure of the state prison labor system, stating, \"for a small fee, a railroad builder, a planter, or a mine owner could use the labor of state convicts with little financial risk and with no labor troubles.\" In Richmond, the Haxall-Crenshaw Company used convict laborers to produce the barrels that contained company products. The Knights of Labor, dedicated to free labor and economic justice, believed convict labor competition infringed upon the rights of the free working class. In order to counteract this practice, the Richmond Knights of Labor devised a boycott, one that was ultimately successful.","The founding principle of the Knights of Labor is nowhere more evident than in the surviving papers of William H. Mullen. Commissioned as \"Organizer\" for the Richmond District Assembly, or \"DA 84,\" on November 28, 1885, he was authorized by decree from the General Master Workman (T.V. Towderly). Historian Peter J. Rachleff described Mullen's immediate impact on the city of Richmond when he noted Mullen's order of \"a boycott of the products of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, which packaged these products in convict-made barrels.\" This boycott, instituted in order to protect the interests of black coopers in the Richmond area, was sanctioned through Mullen's power to \"exercise all the authority conferred upon him by the Constitution, Laws, and Usages of the Order.\" Mullen's papers documented the Richmond District Assembly's creation on January 1, 1878, and the continual desire to protect rights of the working class from corporate abuse through the five principles of \"JUSTICE, WISDOM, TRUTH, INDUSTRY, and ECONOMY.\" Thus, the boycott of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company was an opportunity to stimulate social change through non-violent means, drawing upon the strength of an integrated and unified working class.","Perhaps it was the Knights of Labor's superior efficiency in mobilization that led directly to industrial reform in Richmond. Under General Master Workman T.V. Towderly, the labor organization rose to prominence in the 1880s, becoming, as Craig Phelan observes, \"the most significant and ambitious labor organization of the Gilded Age.\" In a document describing the \"Great Seal of Knighthood,\" found among Mullen's papers, the Knights of Labor were instructed to \"hear both sides, then judge.\" Through the work of Chairman William H. Mullen, the Richmond Knights of Labor were able to preside over the \"public court of labor\" on behalf of their working class constituency.

The article also gave insight into the fact that many Rockbridge  County residents were unsure the new bill would protect industry and decrease the treasury's debt at the same time.  They hoped the bill would not pass through the House because the tariff would hurt their agricultural society.

The dispute over tariffs boiled down to the Northern Republicans against the Southern Democrats.  The Republicans claimed they were protecting American industry but they were actually protecting themselves, since Republican voters owned the majority of the industrial United States.  Democrats countered with the fact that tariffs only brought harm to the South. Southerners had to buy imported goods at high prices and they had to buy expensive domestic goods as well because American manufacturers were raising their prices in response to no foreign competition.  In addition, Southerners had difficulty selling their agricultural goods in an angry foreign market.  The Southern Democrats fought hard against any and all tariffs because they knew it was the key to the South's survival.

In January 1884, Mrs. James Bennett argued in Kentucky's legislature that women should receive the vote in presidential elections. She provided several arguments, including the fact that men of poor morals and low status in society were able to vote whilst a \"noble Christian women\" was not. In addition, she cited the Thirteenth Amendment and emphasized that a state could not make or enforce any law that shall abridge the privileges or immunities of \"citizens of the United states,\" which was defined as persons born or naturalized in the United States. However, her main argument was a religious one; she claimed that God wanted women to vote and thus argued that men who opposed suffrage and women who accepted their disenfranchisement were disobeying God.","Mrs. James Bennett cited an argument by Herbert Spencer, an English philosopher, who argued that happiness can be achieved only by the exercise of one's faculties. According to Bennett, God wills everyone's happiness, which means exercising one's faculties. Subsequently, as women have the faculty to vote, it follows that God thus wills that they vote. After this Bennett drew on passages from the Bible to show that it does not oppose female suffrage, as was commonly thought. She argued that the passage, where wives are told to \"submit themselves unto their own husbands, as unto the Lord; for the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is head of the church\", supports the submission of wives to their husbands but it does not justify men ruling over them. God gave the world to both men and women, even if women are weaker and more dependent on men. Bennett also described the important role many women played in the Bible and the spread of Christianity. This all shows the equality of men and women before God and supported Bennett's view that God wills female suffrage.","As Bennett herself acknowledged, she was not the first to argue for female suffrage but was part of an ever growing movement that had begun decades earlier. Bennett explained that she only became convinced of the need for female suffrage after she heard Susan B. Antony talk in Richmond. Susan B. Antony was an important leader in the suffrage movement, she founded the National Woman's Suffrage Association with Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1869 and later served as its president. The movement for suffrage was national, but Bennett described how she had little support in Kentucky. Kentucky was the first state to give school suffrage to women, but according to Madeline McDowell it lagged behind many states in other areas. For example, in 1888, four years after Bennett's speech, Kentucky was \"the only state that did not permit a married woman to make a will and a wife's wages might be collected by her husband.\"","Not only was the suffrage movement slow to develop in Kentucky, but also the South as a whole lagged behind the North. The suffrage movement started in 1848 at the Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention, but it spread to the South much later. Elna Green accounts for the slow adoption of suffrage in the South by the fact that \"southern women trailed a generation behind their northeastern sisters in the critical experiences that produced support for woman suffrage.\" The critical experiences she cited were the result of industrialization, which occurred at a slower pace in the South.","Despite little support in Kentucky, Bennett claimed that men could not ignore women's demands for suffrage for much longer. In fact, women were only granted suffrage in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, 36 years after Mrs. Bennett's speech. However, the suffrage movement had been successful in Kentucky, as it was only one of four states in the South that ratified the amendment."],"display_date":"January 1, 1884 - January 30, 1884","search_date":"1884-01-15","locations":[{"id":4828,"lat":38.2391019422,"lng":-84.877038419,"zoom":10,"place":"FRANKLIN, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3976,"title":"West Virginia Refuses Reunification\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-03-01","end_date":"1866-03-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["West Virginia would not consider reunification in 1866. In 1866, Governor Boreman of West Virginia responded to Alexander H. H. Stuart's letter, which had asked Boreman for West Virginia's stance on reunification and the settlement of state debt. Boreman wrote that if the Virginia commissioners, whom Stuart numbered among, had presented themselves in front of the West Virginian legislature they would have been \"met with a most respectful and courteous reception at the hands of the members yet I think I am not mistaken in saying that a proposition for the reunion of the states would not have been entertained for a moment but would have been rejected by the unanimous vote of both houses.\" Boreman then went on to write that the legislature would have been happy to consider the debt question, but \"not being advised of any movement in the General Assembly of Virginia they delayed the matter until it was dropped.\" ","Secession from Virginia was the result of long-held divisions within Virginia but it would not have happened without the Civil War and Virginia's decision to secede from the Union. It was only following this decision that a convention was held to declare West Virginia separate in May 1861. This started the process which eventually led to Lincoln's recognition of the division of Virginia in 1863. West Virginia was not interested in reunification in 1866 as they had long seen themselves as separate from the rest of Virginia. They resented the fact that east Virginia had better representation in Congress, as its constituencies were smaller. In addition, the tax breaks of those in the slave-holding east angered the west, as slaveholders were exempt from paying taxes on their slaves. Geographic divisions further helped create a feeling of separation and an unwillingness to defend their neighbors in the east against the Union.","Debt became a problem for Virginia following the Civil War as Virginia had been the battleground for the war and was now devastated as a result. In addition, West Virginia's secession had deprived Virginia of a third of its tax-paying population. Virginia thus needed to ensure that West   Virginia shared the burden of debt from costs incurred before the Civil War.

On May 1 1856, the <em>Nashville Union and American</em> published an article criticizing the party. The article claimed that the aim of the recently created Know-Nothing Party was the abolition of slavery and, in particular, to \"defeat any attempt to introduce Kansas into the union as a slave state.\"  Know-Nothingism was further blamed for \"the creation of new political secret organizations, heretofore unknown in our country's history, and incompatible with our institutions and the spirit liberty.\" The writer then praised the Democratic Party, as it was the only party that offered \"guarantees of order and tranquility. It is a tribute due to genuine patriotism and to unfaltering attachment to republican principles.\"","The Know- Nothing Party grew out of a secret society formed in New York in early 1849 by Charles B. Allen called the \"Order of the Star-Spangled Banner.\" Its original aim was to control nominations for elections rather than stand independently in elections, but in 1852 it merged with a new party called the American Party and it became directly involved in politics. The members of the American Party were nicknamed Know-Nothings, which referred to the response that they were meant to give when asked about the society's activities. The Know-Nothing Party was originally opposed to Catholic involvement in politics and the increasing numbers of foreigners in the country.  However, there was a split between Know-Nothings in the North and South, as those from the South played down their hostility to foreigners or Catholics as, on the whole, these issues were not as important to southerners. In some areas of the South, such as port cities, nativism was an important factor behind the growth of the Know-Nothing Party but elsewhere the Know-Nothing popularity \"was instead dependent on long-standing rifts between Democrats on economic policy and the sectional conflict.\"","The party did not last a long time but in the 1850s it was believed that they would become the official opposition party to the Democrats. The Know-Nothing Party was originally meant to be bi-partisan, but increasingly became involved in partisan politics, with the Democrats accusing them of being \"whiggery in disguise.\" The Democrats felt threatened by the Know-Nothings and so accused them of being against slavery, as this would ensure that the Know-Nothings would loose support in the South. <em>Nashville Union and American</em>, was resolutely Democratic and consistently criticized the Know-Nothing Party. In 1855 it even adopted the slogan \"let's get more European immigrants to settle in the South to help swell our numbers to defend slavery\" However, as Erik B. Alexander has argued, in reality, most Know-Nothings in the South were against the abolition of slavery.","In 1857 the Know-Nothing Party's influence in Tennessee politics ended. In 1856 their candidate in the presidential election came third, and in 1857 they lost Tennessee's Congressional elections. The Democratic Governor, Andrew Johnson, who was hostile to the party, had argued that all abolitionists were Know-Nothings. After another loss, the members dismembered the Know-Nothing Party in Tennessee and associated themselves with different opposition parties."],"display_date":"May 1, 1856","search_date":"1856-05-01","locations":[{"id":11953,"lat":36.1785835172,"lng":-86.867295434,"zoom":9,"place":"DAVIDSON, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":3984,"title":"Virginia in the Nullification Crisis of 1832\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-10","end_date":"1832-12-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"They have gone so far, that it is even more difficult to recede than go on; and they had rather see the Union dissolved tomorrow than that their own proposition should be accepted,\" proclaimed the Lynchburg Virginian in reference to South Carolina's actions in December 1832.  It all began in 1828 when Congress enacted the so-called Tariff of Abominations. Many Southerners thought the highly protective tariff was detrimental to agrarian interests.  Under the leadership of John C. Calhoun, South Carolina stated that a national tariff was unconstitutional when it benefited some states and not others.  To ease tension, President Andrew Jackson lowered the tariff in July 1832.  It was not enough.  ","In November of 1832, South Carolina's Nullification Convention met and pronounced both tariffs unconstitutional as well as unenforceable.  If the national government made any attempt to enforce the tariff, South Carolina would secede from the Union.  In response, Jackson sent the tactical strategist Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott and \"five additional companies of Artillery and two companies of the fourth regiment of Infantry\" to Charleston.  On December 10, 1832, Jackson sent a message to South Carolina declaring its actions \"inconsistent\" and \"incompatible.\"  ","While South Carolina reacted vehemently to the tariff, many Virginians demurred.  South     Carolina's governor James Hamilton mentioned that Nullification was a \"peaceful and constitutional\" remedy.  The Lynchburg Virginian, however, scoffed at his diction and saw war and revolution ahead, not peace.  Governor Hamilton readied the State Guard in Charleston and requested the removal of U.S. troops from the state citadel in Charleston.  The paper claimed, \" war is no children's game - least of all, civil war, in which personal revenge is so apt to mingle with the public quarrel.\"  Though Lynchburg was against the actions of its Southern neighbor, Whigs in Richmond were inclined toward Nullification.  In the coming years, Virginia's divisive tendencies would play a more important role."," After the threat of military action, South Carolina agreed to compromise and a much lower tariff was passed in 1833.

Hampton, a former Confederate general, was playing on Southern sentiments to urge Virginia to back Democratic presidential candidate Winfield Hancock, a Union general.  Fifteen years after the close of the Civil War, politicians were still coercing voters to elect candidates on sectional lines.  ","    Despite Hampton's speech, the Republican ticket won and James A.

","    Because tariffs were the only real issue of the 1880 election, the politicians spun the debate to the polarizing issue of North and South.   The Lynchburg Virginian held that the Republican Party \"held out to the people that a Democratic victory meant a restoration of the \"rebels\" to power, and the dunces who heard this balderdash seemingly swallowed it as if it were divine inspiration.\"  Republicans knew that they would draw more support if they made it appear as if the South was once again attempting to unite against the North.

Woods wrote a letter to the Rector of the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia about reapplying to the Commissionership of Accounts.  A year earlier in June 1885, Woods, an attorney from Charlottesville, was appointed and was \"in sympathy with the political tenets of the majority of the board...and recommended by some of the professors.\"  Now, he was worried about his reappointment because he feared that it would \"be decided on political principle.\" If he was not reelected, Woods let the rector know that he understood it would be \" a direct reflection upon my efficiency as an officer or upon my political standing.\"  His own political party in the past nine months of office came into conflict with the University and he adamantly stated that he would believe it a direct reflection of his political affiliations if not reelected.  By acknowledging the influence and the consequences associated with political leanings, Woods understood that merit alone was not worth much in the corrupt world of nineteenth century politics. ","    Whether or not he received the position, Woods expressed a realistic fear of the late nineteenth century.  Corruption was rampant in the 1880s, especially in the political arena.  Political machines and party bosses abounded and the civil service was a mess of personal favors and nepotism.  In his first term as President from 1885 until 1889, Grover Cleveland worked to bring an end to such corruption.  In the wake of fraudulent Boss Tweed and in the presence of the powerfully corrupt Tammany Hall machine, Cleveland's campaign of political honesty appealed to many citizens.  These citizens voted for his morality in the election of 1884 that pitted Cleveland, a Democrat, against a bribe-accepting Republican candidate. As president, Cleveland was able to convince the Republican dominated Senate to repeal the Tenure of Office Act.  When Cleveland came into office, many inept Republicans dominated the federal bureaucracy.  He wished to replace the incompetent with the worthy.  The act dictated that the Senate had to approve dismissals and appointments.  This was problematic for Cleveland since Republicans had the majority.  Arguing that the act was unconstitutional, he got his repeal and the additional executive powers the Constitution provided.  Though he did not bring an end to corruption, Cleveland's little steps led to more significant changes in the future.","    It is no wonder that citizens like Woods would worry about the effects of political leanings when political favoritism was everywhere.  Gradually, the corruption and patronage so ubiquitous in late nineteenth and early twentieth century politics subsided, due in part to the example President Cleveland set in both of his terms.

However, the men of the South did not agree with southern women.  They believed that women were not suited for politics, as it was seen as unfeminine.  Nevertheless, southern women continued to work towards the vote through reform efforts and conventions - the first being the Women's Rights Convention in South   Carolina in 1870.

As a whole, Republicans of the 1890s believed in using the federal government to direct economic expansion. Most felt that it was the business of the government to take complete control of the country's economic development. This activist position was illustrated in the Republicans' support of the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which increased the protective tariff for American businesses. According to historian Davis Dewey, for Republicans, \"restrictive duties were no longer regarded as a temporary stage in the arduous journey toward industrial freedom, but a principle which ought to be permanently adopted.\" The McKinley Tariff was a source of great discontent for many Americans because it raised the prices of goods while lowering the wages of lower- and middle-class Americans. In contrast, Democrats of the 1890s believed \"that it was the duty of the people to take care of the government; that the just function of the government was to protect every man in his rights and allow him the freedom to achieve his density in his own way.\" The Democratic opposition to protective tariffs illustrated their anti-government attitude. According to the <em>Campaign Text Book of the Democratic Party for the Presidential Election of 1892</em>, \"Democrats firmly believed that protective tariffs favored foreigners at the expense of Americans.\" Thus, Democrats argued that the government had no right to impose such tariffs, and those that transcended this limit were essentially guilty of robbery.

The tariff placed a high tax on foreign goods to stimulate domestic manufacturing, and, in turn, placed strains on the Southern economy as the British reduced their imports of cotton.  Many declared the tariff unconstitutional and thought that it infringed upon the individual states' rights.  To quell the South's angered reaction, Jackson issued the Tariff of 1832, which made some reductions on tax rates.  This did not satisfy everyone, however, and South Carolina acted against the federal government by calling a state convention.  The convention voted for nullification of the tariffs, viewing them as a threat to liberty and founding principles of the United States ","While some Southerners were appalled at the rash decision for nullification and saw the tariffs as simply an element of the democratic style of central government, many also shared feelings of resentment and frustration.  No other Southern state explicitly defended the constitutionality of South Carolina's nullification decrees; rather, many defended the states' right to judge and interpose against federal laws that they perceived to be unconstitutional.  The Western Carolinian of Salisbury, North Carolina, warned people to \"take no step to strengthen central power, but that you do all you can to sustain sinking liberty.\"  Some asserted the opinion that the North was a tyrannical majority that taxed the South for its own benefit, fearing that \"the South must take the yoke, bear it, and become slaves.\" North Carolina will \"Never\" stand to see South Carolina be \"crushed down, and, reduced to degrading vassalage\"  Many newspapers showed that the tension between the North and South was apparent and escalating in the early 1830s."],"display_date":"December 1832","search_date":"1832-12-16","locations":[{"id":9771,"lat":35.7371590314,"lng":-80.5230825706,"zoom":9,"place":"ROWAN, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4014,"title":"A Democratic Division: Florida and the 1860 Presidential Election\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1860-04-09","end_date":"1860-04-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["With the Election of 1860 just months away, the Democratic Party in Florida began working on its strategy to defeat the Republicans.  Hoping to gain momentum before the upcoming election, Florida began appointing officials to represent the Democratic Party in the late spring of 1860.  Delegated wanted to insure that democratic values were integrated into the current federal government, so Florida delegates met in Tallahassee and discussed representation at the Charleston Convention.  Each county of Florida was present, and participating counties included: Walton, Jackson, Madison, Duval, Dade, Hillsborough, Monroe, Franklin, Calhoun, Liberty, Gadsden, Leon, Wakulla, Jefferson, Alachua, and Columbia.  At the preliminary convention, the delegates also discussed how each county would be represented and determined that the ratio of voters that each county was entitled would be based on its size.","After a motion from the Honorable T.J. Eppes, the committee elected delegates to permanent offices.  Organization and a system of order were critical to the delegates at the Tallahassee Convention.  Thus, they decided to run their body with the same rules as the House of Representatives.  ","While the Democratic Convention gained support from the Southern states, the Republican Party worked on its own presidential ticket.  The Republican Party boasted an platform against the expansion of slavery led by Abraham Lincoln in its 1860 convention.  Growing animosity towards the North caused numerous tensions within the Democratic Party of the South.  Suspicions and \"mutual mistrust\" arose towards Lincoln and his platform and in the 1860 election no Florida voters cast a vote for the Republican candidate.  However, the splintered Democratic Party was too weak to compete with Lincoln on the national level.  In his book, <em>The Slave States in the Presidential Election,</em> Ollinger Crenshaw points out that the South never had a chance to rival the Republicans because of the \"defeatist\" attitude at Charleston.  Furthermore, with \"...no concerted plan of action, no well organized strategy...the election was lost [for the Democrats] in the initial cleavage at Charleston.\"  Never able to recover from this division, the Southern Democrats failed to triumph over the Republicans, thus allowing Lincoln to become the sixteenth U.S. president in 1860.  ","It was only a matter of time before Floridians felt that their demand for representation at the preliminary convention in Tallahassee was not met by Lincoln and his Republican party on the national level.  Thus, shortly after Lincoln's election in 1860, Florida followed the rest of the South and discussed secession.  Finally, on January 10,1861, Florida seceded from the Union and joined the other southern states in forming the Confederate States of America.

As the headline so boldly announced, the days of the Confederacy were severely numbered as General Robert E. Lee was forced to abandon Goldsboro, NC and proved unable to hold the city of Raleigh. In reality, of course, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia remained in Virginia, but was trying to reach North Carolina after abandoning Richmond on April 2. A gloomy sentiment laid beneath the description of Lee's retreat as \"highly detrimental to the discipline of the force which has the final destiny of the Confederacy in its keeping.\" Lee's troops were backed into the state of Virginia and essentially surrounded by the forces of General Grant and General Sherman. Here the paper rallied that Lee would need to \"fight out the last battle of the rebellion or to ignominiously surrender.\" However, the paper seemed to acknowledge and allude to a certain valor in General Lee by claiming that he recognized \"the impossibility of achieving the independence of the Confederacy by the sword.\" With this comment, it seemed as if the people of the South recognized that they would fall under the weight of the Union army but that they would fall with dignity and pride.","    In the final days of the war, the citizens of the Confederacy were aware that their days were numbered and that they could not hold out against Union forces for much longer. Only two days after this article was published, Robert E. Lee surrendered his troops at Appomattox Court House in Virginia, bringing an end to the bloody conflict that had raged on between the divided nation for nearly four years. Although this was an unhappy ending for the citizens of the Confederate States, who had battled so hard to gain independence, according to Stephen Ash, \"even among those who were still prepared to bear the costs of victory there were growing doubts about the instrument they had forged to secure that victory.\" Since the majority of the battles were fought on Confederate soil, the war had severely disrupted family life, tearing families apart and causing many of those on the home front to constantly be surrounded by troops and the destruction they caused. Though many Southerners entered the war with the desire to see the Confederacy prosper as an independent nation, by April 1865, they were willing to accept defeat if it meant that they would be able to put their lives back together.

Instead, the publication printed both South Carolina and President Jackson's addresses, presenting both sides of the issue. Although it expressed its belief in the sanctity of the Constitution, the newspaper never alluded to whether it approved more of Jackson or South Carolina's constitutional theory. Virginia, like several other Southern states, often struggled to reconcile her beliefs in state sovereignty and in preservation of the Union. However, fearing the damage a military confrontation would cause, the paper expressed desperate desire for compromise stating, \"In common with our countrymen, we shall consider civil bloodshed as to be the most direful calamity that can possibly befall this free and happy land.\"  "," Early in President Jackson's administration, Congress passed the protective tariff of 1828, which quickly came to be known to the South as the \"Tariff of Abominations.\" The tariff intended to protect Northern industry from competing European goods by placing a higher tax on such products. Cotton planters felt the tariff explicitly alienated them because it made their cost of living more expensive and greatly diminished Great Britain's cotton imports. Although the tariff was abrasive to all Southern states, under the leadership of Vice President and states' rights champion, John C. Calhoun, South Carolina led the rally against it. Calling the tariff unconstitutional because it failed to promote the general welfare, Calhoun called for nullification, a doctrine that allowed states to void federal legislation if it breached the constitutional contract made between the states and the federal government. Taking an immediate stand against nullification President Jackson exclaimed, \"...the power to annul a law ... is incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the...Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive for the great object for which it was formed.\" "," At the start of the crisis, most Southern states shared South Carolina's hatred of the tariff, but never quite embraced the radicalism of nullification. The attitude the <em>Virginia Herald</em> took in December 1832 was characteristic of the rest Southern states' feelings about the crisis. These states relied on their representatives in Congress to rectify the tariff issue instead of taking matters into their own hands.  While they were ardent supporters of states' rights, most were unwilling to risk bloodshed, or worse, separation from the Union in favor of nullification. Most Southern states viewed this method as Alabama's legislature did, \"unsound in theory, and dangerous in practise.\" Instead, the majority of the South favored a logical compromise to the sectional controversy. Nevertheless, December 1832 marked a volatile month in politics, giving birth to unprecedented radicalism, thus stimulating a call for Southern rationality.

Bramlette agreed that the \"evil necessity\" had become an \"incumbus upon our energies, a burden to our advancement, and a negative to our prosperity.\" ","As a border state, Kentucky lacked the labor-intensive staple crops, such as cotton and tobacco, that were necessary to support slavery, and the average size of slaveholdings in Kentucky was the fourth smallest in the South.  With a long history in the antebellum years of moderation and compromise, Kentucky provided an atmosphere conducive to antislavery advocates.  However, even such advocates lacked a willingness to take firm action.  Most believed that slavery was a necessary instrument for controlling the state's black population.  During the war, Kentucky became firmly committed to the Union yet remained governed by a coalition opposing all policies that challenged slavery.  State officials denounced the Emancipation Proclamation as unconstitutional and refused to recognize the liberty of any black person claiming or pretending to be free.  It is this very resistance that General Brisbin so ardently disfavored in his letter: \"slavery is at an end, and why deny it, or, by withholding proper State legislation, seek to retain longer the shadow of an institution that was always worthless?\"","Brisbin advanced his argument by describing the condition of slavery and labor in Kentucky.  He wrote, \"the master can no longer hold his slaves or depend on their labor for a single day, so that producers cannot calculate their crops or pursue agriculture with any degree of certainty.\"  Indeed, the war undermined the exclusive authority of master over slave.  Slaves quickly learned that authority and protection resided with the Union army when unionist slaveholders could not protect their slaves against Confederate invaders.  Conversely, when federal military lines moved into areas previously held by Confederate forces, slaveholders who had sympathized with the Southern army fled, leaving property and slaves behind.  Most of these abandoned slaves immediately assumed the stance of free blacks.","By December 1862, Kentucky slaves were moving in such numbers that it became impossible to exercise control over them.  Brisbin related this occurrence: \"having become restless or dissatisfied, the slaves leave their homes, and setting their faces toward Louisville, journey for days over long miles to these headquarters, as the Mecca where freedom may be found....\"  By this time, it had become common for Kentucky slaves to ask for wages in return for their labor.  When denied, slaves often fled the plantation.  ","Over time, slaves had begun to make personal decisions without regard for the authority of the slaveholder.  Another popular movement of slaves was the enlistment of black men and boys into the army.  These enlisted slaves became freedmen, a circumstance that in itself weakened the institution of servitude in Kentucky.  Brisbin also noted that \"Negro enlistment has bankrupted slavery in Kentucky, over 22,000 of the most valuable slaves having gone into the service.\"  Indeed, by war's end, Kentucky had mustered 23,703 blacks into federal service.  ","The departure of slaves from Kentucky to the Northeast as wage earners, movement of blacks to towns and cities, and enlistment of the Kentucky slaves in military service all combined to create an acute labor shortage in Kentucky by 1865.  Indeed, Brisbin reasoned, \"Kentucky needs what black labor she has left to till the soil, and her slaves can now be of more service to the nation in the corn fields than in the army....\"  He concluded his letter by proposing that freeing the slaves in \"one blow\" would end the questionable status of labor in Kentucky.  Brisbin wrote, \"the sooner Kentucky makes up her mind and accepts the new order of things, and to establish labor upon a free, paid basis, the better it will be for her.\"","Though the formal emancipation of slaves in Kentucky did not take effect until the United States adopted the Thirteenth Amendment, it had ceased to be a \"viable institution\" long before then.  It had suffered such afflictions that left no hope for its reestablishment as it had existed before war.  Still, slavery had been more deeply entrenched in Kentucky than elsewhere in the border region.  At war's end, more than sixty-five thousand slaves remained in bondage, and it would take decades of further persistence for Kentucky to embrace racial equality."],"display_date":"April 27, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-27","locations":[{"id":4979,"lat":38.1872796075,"lng":-85.6593965884,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4035,"title":"Male Competition and a Female Audience\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1887-01-26","end_date":"1887-01-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" On January 26, 1887, the <em>Virginian Weekly & Carolinian </em>reported with little excitement that the Senate had rejected a constitutional amendment for women's suffrage. Paying more attention to the Army Appropriation bill, funding for public building, and the Railroad Attorney's Bill, the article hardly focused on women's perpetual disenfranchisement. While one senator presented the petition and stated his favor for suffrage because it would make \"Washington the best illustration of the republican idea of self-government,\" another discarded the resolution asserting, \"He would not degrade woman by giving her the right of suffrage.\" Following this short exchange of ideas, the Senate voted on the measure, defeating it 34 to 16. The <em>Virginian </em>delivered the result of the vote, gave no commentary on the issue, and immediately resumed discussion of the public buildings' appropriation."," In 1887, Southern men still retained the idea that it was their duty to protect women's virtue, one of the most significant aspects of the prevailing honor culture. Men saw politics as too intense for ladies to concern themselves with, for it often embodied corruption and uncensored dialogue. Women were the ethical compass in Southern households, thus many men thought involvement in politics would not only taint their image, but their moral fiber as well. Furthermore, as Horace Bushnell points out, men commonly held the belief that women were incapable of making sound decisions when voting because they went \"more by feeling than men, they feel every thing more intensely, and with more liabilities to excess.\" ","It was also still common for many families to ascribe to traditional gender roles of the antebellum period. Nicholas Bromell's book, <em>By the Sweat of the Brow</em>, also notes that men were usually the primary providers while women occupied their own \"sphere,\" remaining in the home to be the family's religious authority and caretaker. Thus, at the time there was no place for women in politics because the defining characteristic of their \"sphere\" was that it made a clear distinction between \"home and world.\" The cult of domesticity continued to have a heavy influence on Southern life in the 1880s, therefore delaying women's right to vote. "," The <em>Virginian Weekly & Carolinian's </em>apathetic attitude towards women's suffrage was synonymous with the majority of Southern male ideas on the issue. Things like internal improvements and government funding were much higher priorities at the time. Men were not ready to conflate the gender spheres and include women in self-government because they saw them unfit to do its bidding. The voting booth was a male arena; women were the spectators.

In the Raleigh<em> Register</em> the attack on Sumner was characterized as necessary to preserve the dignity of the Senate \"in order to command the respect of the public.\"  Yet at the same time, criticism in the <em>Daily Herald</em>, another newspaper in North Carolina, showed that all Southerners did not support Brooks's actions because they gave more momentum to the \"freesoilers\" of the North.  So while some Southerners did not approve of the actions of Senator Brooks, they more so disliked the aforementioned actions because they felt it gave abolitionists and freesoilers more power in the United States Senate than because they felt sympathy for Sumner.","The Slave Power Conspiracy griped the minds of both Southern and Northern Americans at this time, but it was more powerful and influential in the Southern United States, where slavery was an everyday aspect of life.  This spilled over into the dialogue and actions that took place in the representative bodies of the population, especially in the closely divided House of Representatives and the United States Senate.  Historian Edward Ayers addressed the idea of Southern honor in <em>Vengeance and Justice,</em> commenting that \"Southern violence possessed its own rules and unfolded on its own schedule.\"  The Southerners feared that the North would outnumber them in Congress, then take away their right to take their \"property\" with them into the new territories, and eventually bring about an end to their entire way of life; slavery.

This deceptive process of marking ballots incorrectly and giving them to illiterate blacks who would have voted in a different manner became common in the early 1880s. Race played a prominent role in the elections of the late 1870s and early 1880s, when African Americans traditionally voted Republican. According to Edward L.

But in December of 1832, most Southern states--like Virginia--felt that nullification was a threat to \"this blessed Union.\"  The Enquirer stated that it was the wrong  \"time, and circumstance\" to throw off the laws of the Union.

The treaty, or rather collective of three treaties signed at Medicine Lodge, Kansas in October of 1867, was a comprehensive peace settlement between the U.S. government and the Plains Nations of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho.  Major provisions in the treaty were that the nations would move onto reservations in the Indian Territory and that the United States would help them become \"civilized,\" providing them with necessary supplies and instruction.","            At Medicine Lodge, most of the Native American nations wanted peace, but did not agree with the constrained reservation system that limited autonomy and pushed white civilization upon them.  Among the more outstanding spokesmen of Medicine Lodge were Chiefs Ten Bears and Satanta, who represented two of the most prominent nations, the Comanche and Kiowa, respectively.  Their two voices well addressed specific problems with the proposed reservations, but also addressed broader issues of Native American identity, prospects, and the nature of their relations with whites.","            Satanta, one of the major figures in the armed conflicts leading up to Medicine Lodge, argued very emotionally and emphatically: \"I love the land and the buffalo and will not part with it. I want you to understand well what I say.  Write it on paper.\"  Satanta argued that the land, the hunt, and the independence from \"medicine lodges\"-the churches and schools advocated by whites-were essential elements of his culture, his means for happiness.  Secluded from this lifestyle, he said, \"We grow pale and die.\"  He also emphasized the way in which whites interacted with Native Americans, saying that while he was open and honest with the commissioners, they were deceitful and unreliable.  Yet far worse for Satanta were the U.S. troops who, he said, \"cut down my timber; they kill my buffalo.\"","            Ten Bears was more ready for peace and as such his speech was gentler in tone, beginning with an expression of warm feelings towards the commissioners.  Yet he too blamed the United States for a great deal, saying that it was they who started the conflict: \"There has been trouble on the line between us...but it was...you who sent out the first soldier and we who sent out the second.\"  Ten Bears also broadly criticized the plans of the commissioners, rejecting the reservation scheme with houses and medicine lodges.  He stressed the freedom and happiness of life in the prairie and contrasted it with living and dying as the whites suggested, hemmed in by \"walls\" and \"enclosures.\"  ","            Ten Bears reiterated Satanta's consideration of culture, saying: \"I lived like my fathers before me, and like them, I lived happily.\" He further defended his right to this life based on the promise made by the \"Great White Father\" (the President), which guaranteed the permanence of land rights as they then stood.  Finally, Ten Bears argued that far from removing his people to a better location, the proposed reservation site was \"too small\" and that the Texans had taken away the land and timber that best supported prosperity.  The final words of his speech summarized the plight of Native Americans in powerful, fatalistic terms, saying, \"The white man has the country which we loved, and we only wish to wander on the prairie until we die.\" ","            Though not actually faced with extinction, the nations of Medicine Lodge were in the midst of such upheaval that the period could justifiably be called the end of an age for their peoples.  Arguments like those of Satanta and Ten Bears at Medicine Lodge were not new; Native Americans had long defended their essential rights, sovereignty, and freedom-political rhetoric that is itself very telling as it specifically caters to Western ideology.  Yet the virtue of these values were not enough to protect Native Americans in a seemingly intractable clash of cultures, wherein they were opposed by both U.S. governmental policy and the very real \"shock of civilization\" that saw the buffalo hunted almost to extinction while frontier settlements swept across Native Americans' lands, dominating them in trade and constantly fighting with them.  In the twenty years after Medicine Lodge, Native American sovereignty and their free, unsettled lifestyle, as espoused by Satanta and Ten Bears, were both rejected by the United States.  The two major blows came in the shape of a Congressional act in 1871 that ended treaty-making with Native Americans, and the Dawes Severalty Act in 1887, which divided up the communal land into individual allotments and made Native Americans U.S. citizens."],"display_date":"October 19, 1867 - October 20, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-19","locations":[{"id":4553,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Unorganized, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4082,"title":"Desertion Plagues the Confederate War Effort\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-15","end_date":"1865-02-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In February 1865, the <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> printed a general order for those who had lost faith in the Confederate war effort and deserted, offering them a way to honorably rejoin their fellow Confederates in the fight. As many Confederate soldiers deserted and returned to their families, General Robert E. Lee appealed to their \"honor and duty\" by presenting only two options: \"war [or] abject submission.\" The only logical choice seemed to be a continuation of the fight for self-government at any cost. Lee offered pardon to any man \"improperly absent\" as long as he returned \"within the shortest possible time within 20 days.\" He declared that \"no general amnesty [would] again be granted\" in this final effort to reabsorb deserters into the Army of the Confederacy. Unfortunately for Lee, offering a sweeping pardon did not significantly recoup his dwindling supply of men still willing to fight.","Historians have pointed to desertion as one of the primary reasons for the South's defeat in the Civil War. The notion of the Civil War being a \"rich man's war, and a poor man's fight\" was a huge factor in desertion rates. One school of thought believes that as the war progressed, the yeoman farmers who were doing the majority of the fighting came to resent the planter aristocracy that was often exempted from military service due to various Confederate policies. The war became increasingly difficult, and many soldiers deserted due to economics, family, and personal sentiments. The less a man identified with the cause he was fighting for, the more likely he was to desert. Yeoman farmers did not own slaves, and the principles of slavery were not worth fighting and dying for as the war proceeded. In the final months of the war, desertion rates escalated as it became clear that the South would not emerge the victors.","James McPherson examines the Confederate soldier's experience through various diaries and letters and disagrees with this position. McPherson claims that Confederate men did not gain the conventional disillusionment and cynicism that would logically lead to desertion. The sources that he examines show soldiers continuing to assert the importance of the ideals they were fighting for throughout the conflict. Reasons for fighting would include defending their government, their manhood, their families, and their comrades. Although the reasons for desertion are clearly a subject of great debate among historians, it is clear that desertion made it increasingly difficult to pursue the collective goals of the Confederacy on the battlefield and inevitably contributed to Lee's surrender several months later."],"display_date":"February 15, 1865","search_date":"1865-02-15","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4083,"title":"Proof of Allegiance\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-05-27","end_date":"1865-05-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 25, 1865, John Herbert Claiborne took the oath of allegiance to the United States at the Office of the Provost Marshal in Petersburg, Virginia. He served as a surgeon with the title of Major in the Confederate Army during the war and continued to practice medicine after the surrender. In the terms of the oath he swore to \"support and defend the Constitution\" and to support all laws including \"the emancipation of slaves\" from that time forward. By taking this oath, he secured amnesty for serving the Confederacy during the war, considered an act of treason. That day he received a slip of paper noting that he had taken the oath, but he returned six days later to request a letter from the Provost Marshall confirming his allegiance and giving him permission to purchase a pistol for his own protection. Almost a month later, on June 26, he returned yet again for a duplicate certificate of his Oath of Allegiance. Papers such as these restored J.H. Claiborne and other former Confederates to their status of citizens of the United States during Reconstruction, a time when a Confederate war record often excluded men from the political landscape they once ruled. Generals Lee and Grant determined the terms of the surrender at Appomattox, but this agreement did not begin to address many of the questions created by the end of the struggle. Politicians determined the terms of reunion during the era of Reconstruction. The status of Confederate veterans proved to be a controversial issue in the halls of Congress as well as throughout the South. On one hand, Southerners needed to be punished for their rebellion, and it would be irresponsible to place the same white aristocracy back in power post-war. However, to suppress almost the entire white male population would leave few educated men to rebuild the southern governments.","President Johnson laid out the terms for Confederate amnesty in May 1865 through a proclamation that gave amnesty restoring all rights and property (except for slaves) to ex-Confederates who would take an oath of loyalty to the Union. Exempted from the proclamation were top ranking Confederates, as well as owners of more than 20,000 in property. These southerners who were not given amnesty in the proclamation would have to swallow their pride and appeal to the President Johnson for amnesty. Inevitably Johnson pardoned almost anyone who requested one, a much more lenient policy than the previously proposed Wade-Davis Bill of June 1864 that required men to swear that they had never aided the Confederacy in order to participate politically.

This experience was later able to transfer in women's work for suffrage. Belle Kearney, a leader within the WCTU and later a women's suffragist, wrote about the beginning of her career in the WCTU in her autobiography, <em>A Slaveholder's Daughter</em>. In this work she analyzes the affects of the Civil War on women in the South and discusses her own experiences as a daughter this post-Civil War society. Kearney desired to be well educated and to pursue a life beyond the domestic sphere of women. She stated that women in the South had assumed responsibility while the men were at war yet when the men returned, women were expected to return to the female domain. For Kearney, remaining in this womanly sphere was not acceptable. In 1889, she was given her chance for public work when her father encouraged her to listen to a speech given by the President of the WCTU, Frances Willard. After this, Kearney accepted a position in the WCTU which became, for her, an outlet to the public sphere and prepared her to later serve in the women's suffrage movement.            ","According to historian Louise M. Young, this experience in the WCTU was not exclusive to Kearney. Women's promotion of temperance was seen as acceptable public work for them because temperance fell into the womanly sphere of \"protecting the home.\" This allowed women in public work to become more acceptable and thus gave women the courage and ability to work for more radical causes such as women's suffrage.  So, women took the training hat they received in the WCTU and applied it to the suffrage movement. Temperance also opened other avenues for suffrage in that supporters of temperance wanted to give women the vote so that they would have political power to enforce temperance. For the South, this was important because Southern women had not participated in the abolition movement in the North which had prepared women for the first wave of the women's suffrage movement. Thus, in the South the WCTU served to prepare women for the women's suffrage movement as the abolition movement had in the North."],"display_date":"April 1, 1889 - August 18, 1920","search_date":"1904-12-09","locations":[{"id":7161,"lat":32.6346973664,"lng":-90.0338114186,"zoom":9,"place":"MADISON, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4090,"title":"A Plea for Peace Within the Union\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-01","end_date":"1832-12-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Thomas GrimkÉ wrote a letter to John C.

Things began to fall apart when a tariff was introduced and Calhoun believed it would make it more difficult for the South to conduct foreign trade through cotton.  Calhoun denounced the abominable tariff saying, \"the great geographical Northern manufacturing interest in order to enforce more effectually the system of monopoly and extortion against the consuming states.\"  In March of 1825, Calhoun became Andrew Jackson's vice president, but drew controvery by writing <em>South Carolina Exposition and Protest</em>.  He defended a states' right to nullify a Federal law that impeded a states' interest, while he was the vice president.  He soon realized he had limited power as the vice president and resigned to be elected Senator of South Carolina.  On November 24, 1832, South Carolina held a contitutional convention and nullified the tariffs of 1824 and 1828, with Calhoun's full support behind his state.  Andrew Jackson's response to the convention came in December of 1832 when he declared nullification as being \"incompatiable with the existence of the Union.\"  This is the time in which GrimkÉ is writing his letter to Calhoun.

This objectivity began with the discussion of women's suffrage in order to keep a white majority in the voting arena. While the Atlanta Constitution did not completely accept women's suffrage, the discussion of it as a solution to curb the African American vote is at least an effort to entertain its possibilities. In 1890, the Constitution ran an article which discussed the debate in Mississippi over women's suffrage as a solution to secure a white majority. Mississippi politicians, according to the Constitution, were in agreement property and education requirements would ensure that less African American would vote and that the women who then were allowed to vote would be educated and would then eliminate the votes of the African American. The concern that Mississippi had though, was that women would not be interested enough in voting rights to actually use them. The Constitution sympathized with Mississippi's problem, but did not support the idea of women receiving the vote. Still, this article shows that people in the South were willing to entertain the idea of women's suffrage. ","            This was not exclusive to Mississippi as many states began to consider women's suffrage so as to keep a white majority of voters. When Southern women took up the suffrage cause, many argued for suffrage in order to keep the white majority within suffrage. These women also wanted to establish suffrage through state amendments rather than national amendments and thus they made suffrage seem more acceptable in the South since they advocated it within the established social structure. Because of this and because of the debates that suffrage as a solution to African American suffrage began, more people started considering women's suffrage as a possibility and women were able to use this as a vehicle to further the cause.

Families owned slaves and continued to throughout the Civil War. Opoethleyohola, a Muscogee Creek Chief also known as Gouge, wished to remain neutral. Many other neutral Creeks followed him North of Indian Territory, which is now Oklahoma.","Colonel Douglas H. Cooper had been persuaded that 'Gouge' was a threat and had been offered support from E. H. Carruth, Indian Agent for the USA. He took 2000 troops, and began pursuing the refugees. His spies told him that there were more followers than first believed, so the Ninth Texas Cavalry joined them in their pursuit. Their Commander, Lt. Col. William A. Quayle, believed there \"to be 1500 strongly posted\" Indians, including 500 Jayhawkers, but later they numbered 9000. The Confederates numbered 2500; both they and the refugees were \"ill equipped for the winter march or for military action.\"","Gouge camped with everyone near the Creek Council at Thlobthlocco when he heard about their pursuit. He began to \"fire the prairies,\" leaving nothing to be foraged; thus slowing down Cooper. With the burning, it was still \"so dark [they] could not distinguish an Indian from a white man at three paces,\" which didn't help any whites, but it was easier for Indians as they are better at seeing in the dark. The flickering of the many bush fires and the moving of the tall grasses contributed to the confusion.","Late November 19, the front of Cooper's men, believing they had made contact with Gouge's pickets, followed the fire-trailers who lead them into an ambush. Near to Round Mountain the Texans gave chase. They were fired upon by the fire-trailers and dogs were sent through the ranks to disturb the men; they got into rank as quickly as the situation allowed. The Indians fired the bush to surround and shepherd Cooper and his men to where they wanted them, a \"timber-lined, horse-shoe-shaped prairie,\" where Cooper was welcomed with hot lead and whizzing arrows. They were \"fighting by the flash of the enemy's guns … on three different sides,\" but this did not affect the death toll. Six Confederates died, four were wounded, while one went missing; Opoethleyohola lost approx. one hundred and ten men. Cooper also lost six horses, some killed, and some stampeded.

Most of his decisions as a judge in Georgia favored state over federal laws. In 1831, however, Clayton declared unconstitutional a Georgia law that prohibited Indians from digging gold on their own land. After this decision he was not reelected for another term. Clayton was curious about his loss at reelection and suspected that it was a consequence of his decision in his last case. He wrote a letter to Chancellor James Kent, a prominent New York lawyer, asking whether he was correct in assuming this. Kent agreed with Clayton's assumption. In addition, he offered a detailed opinion as further explanation and proof of how Native Americans were being treated and why there was so much opposition against them at this time."," Opposition to the Cherokee tribe had begun in 1828 in Georgia. Clayton was elected to judgeship that same year, thus many of his trials were about the struggles between the Cherokees and Georgia. At this time, the Cherokee Indians still had possession of northern Georgia. However, later in 1828, Georgia's government issued new legislation extending its reach over Cherokee land. This new legislation was issued even though the Cherokees had written their own constitution in 1827, in an effort to claim they were a sovereign state. By doing so, the Cherokees tried to deny the state of Georgia any right to their land. The state of Georgia ignored the Cherokee constitution and tried to take their land anyway. The result was a bitter struggle between the Cherokee Indians and the state of Georgia. Judge Clayton's initial opposition to Cherokee rights is an important example of how many people felt at this time.

Finally, an agreement was reached.  In September of 1850 the provisions that would become the Compromise of 1850 were passed.  About a year later, on September 5, 1851, Winchester Graham, a representative from South Carolina, gave a speech in Barnwell, S.C. that defended his support of the Compromise measures.  In the beginning of his speech, Graham called the compromise \"...the greatest legislative victory to be found in the annals of our country and that the institutions of the South are now resting on firmer foundations than they ever had before...\"  Next, Graham gave an overview of the major pieces of the compromise.  First, Graham talked about the abolition of the slave trade in Washington, D.C.  He argued that this was of no consequence to the South and that the Congress had the power to regulate the commerce of the District of Columbia.  Second, he talked about the admittance of California as a free state.  He dispelled the myth that this was a policy of the Free Soil Party intended to entrap the South, and argued that slavery would never have come to California because of its climate and terrain.  Graham supported the admittance of California as a whole, instead of divided at the 36' 30' line of the Missouri Compromise, because if it had been split it would allow two free states to come into the Union instead of one.  Third, Graham argued that the Texas-New Mexico border act, long viewed as an assault on the slave state of Texas, was proposed by a southerner, Pearce of Maryland, and was beneficial to the Southern cause.  This measure helped the South because it paid of the debts of Texas and also gave the South \"40,000 miles of free territory\" to establish new slave states to bolster Texas and the South.  Finally, the Fugitive Slave Act was a major victory for the South because it allowed for greater protection and return of their property, the slaves.  In conclusion, Graham said that the Compromise led the nation away from the brink of succession; this succession would have caused a costly war that would have taken a horrific toll on the South. ","    The debate over the Compromise of 1850 was one of the most contentious and heated debates in the history of the United States Senate.  Political fanatics, from the North and South, objected to the measures, bringing the nation to brink of disunion and hostility.  Author John Waugh argues that the compromise was built on the back of the \"political middle\" with measures that were meant to appease the North, the admittance of California, and ones to appease the South, the Fugitive Slave Act.  While the other measures, especially the Texas-New Mexico border act, represented a political quagmire, from which both sides refused to relent.  In his defense of the Compromise, Graham interpreted all of the measures as strengthening the South, even the concessions to the North.  His speech was an appeal to his constituents, making them realize that the compromise, and his support of it, led them away form the disaster of succession while also helping the Southern cause.  Graham wanted his constituents to view the measures as a victory, not as a compromise, because it helped avoid the destruction of the Union and reinforced slavery in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1851","search_date":"1851-09-05","locations":[{"id":11437,"lat":33.2565006284,"lng":-81.3960341006,"zoom":8,"place":"BARNWELL, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4142,"title":"President Jackson Responds to Nullification\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-10","end_date":"1832-12-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    The crisis threatened to tear the nation apart.  This crisis was the passage of the Nullification Ordinances by the South Carolina State Assembly in November of 1832.  The unity and survival of the nation depended upon President Andrew Jackson's response.  On December 10, 1832, President Jackson presented his response to the Congress, arguing that the justification for state nullification of federal laws was misguided, unconstitutional, and treasonous to the country.   Jackson began his proclamation by outlining the reasons and reservations that led South Carolina to pass the ordinance; their major concerns were the tariffs of May 29, 1828 and June 14, 1832.  South Carolina believed these measures were unfair and didn't fall within the constitutional power of Congress to raise revenue; they proclaimed the laws null and void and threatened succession.  In his address, Jackson showed that the doctrine of nullification was \"incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.\"   First, he posited that South Carolina's objections based on stated powers and fairness were misguided and incorrect because the Constitution gave Congress the \"discretionary power\" to raise revenue by taxation.  Next, Jackson argued the Constitution joined the states into a single nation, and \"in becoming parts of a nation...they surrender many of their essential parts of sovereignty.\"  Thus, secession was wholly unconstitutional because it is an affront to national authority.  Finally, Jackson warned the people of South Carolina, who he believed were tricked into nullification by political and social leaders, that any action of \"disunion, by force, is treason.\"  He made an emotional appeal for these people to see the error of their position.  His address ends with a hope that the nation will survive and be reconciled by reasonableness and harmony, but also an assurance that it will be reconciled by force, if necessary.  ","    President's Jackson's speech came at a crucial time during his presidency; he had just been elected to a second term, but already his popular and political support was flagging.  But, according to historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Jackson's handling of the nullification crisis and his resolve to ensure the survival of the union, both evident in the December speech, gained him temporary \"popular acclaim,\" making him the \"country's hero.\"  Jackson, a shrewd political, turned his new popularity into a political weapon to further the other policies of his administration, most notably his continued war against the Bank of the United States.  Jackson's speech and eventual handling of the nullification crisis were viewed, by the majority of the nation, as the actions of a strong leader dedicated to the nation and its survival; he used this renewed trust to further the political goals of his presidency.

This was a road that led to economic prosperity for the South.  This was the Blue Ridge Railroad.  In 1860, the President of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, Edward Frost, in a report to the stockholders and the state legislature, reported on the condition and growth of the line, proposed a plan for its expansion, and requested renewed assistance from the government of South Carolina.  Frost started his report with a proposition to finish the railroad form Walhalla, S.C. to Clayton, S.C. Then, he reported on the past development of the railroad; noting that from 1859 to 1860, the government instructed and only provided the company with enough of a grant, 310,000, to finish the line up to Walhalla.  The railroad was initially planned to run all along the Southeast, from South Carolina to Knoxville, Tennessee.  But, the company ran into work stoppages and reduced state funding in Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.  In this report, Frost proposed that the South Carolina legislature provide funding to finish the line to Clayton.  He argued that this would provide the other surrounding state governments with the incentive to fund the completion of the other proposed sections of the railroad, the sections in western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and northwest Georgia.  But, the railroad would have to be finished to Clayton, because it was a connecting city to these other areas.  According to the report, the completion of the road would be a major economic advantage, linking markets throughout the South.  Frost argued that the completed road would make this section of the South competitive with Northern industry and transportation.  Frost estimated the cost of the line from Walhalla to Clayton at about 1.5 million to 2 million and the total cost of the road to Knoxville at 4.5 million.  He asked the state legislature to provide 1 million in bonds to continue construction to Clayton.  Finally, Frost made a plea to his stockholders:  \"...in case the work should be discontinued, the officers of this company should be exempt from any aspersions of bad judgment or ill faith...\"  This report was intended to show his proposition and his plan, but if the state legislature didn't grant the bonds, Frost wanted to ensure the security of his position. ","    There was a major disparity in railroad transportation between the North and South; this lack of a developed transportation system would later be seen as a major cause of the Southern loss during the Civil War.   The case of the Blue Ridge Railroad Company is indicative of this trend of struggling railroads in the South.  Historian James Ward showed that Southern railroads, especially in the 1840s and mid-1850s, received less government aide and investment than their Northern counterparts.  He argued that this disparity in financing was due to the long-ranging effects of an economic depression in 1839, the reduced market price of cotton, and finally weakened European markets in the mid-1850s, due to the Crimean War.  These events depleted government resources in the South, creating this decline in government support of transportation infrastructure.  The reduced funding led to the work stoppages that hindered the completion of the Blue Ridge Railroad, and many other railroads in the South.  When the state had money to reinvest in railroads, the South was already technologically trailing the North by a decade or more.   The Civil War was approaching and the South didn't have enough time to complete the development of its railroads. If the South had more peace time to catch up with Northern technology, the Civil War could have played out very differently.

After the Civil War, the North wanted to ensure the abolition of slavery, recognition of the rights of African Americans, and that the South would remain a part of the nation; these were the major goals of the Reconstruction policies.   To meet these goals, The North required all former Confederate states to write a new state constitution, incorporating these measures, in order to be readmitted to the Union.  From January 14, 1868 to March 17, 1868, delegates met in Charleston, South Carolina to formulate a new South Carolina State Constitution.  This new constitution incorporated the goals of the North.  Article I included provisions that:  stated the equality of all men (Sec. 1), abolished slavery (Sec. 2), asserted that the Union was \"indissoluble\" (Sec. 5), and pledged \"paramount allegiance\" to the United States Constitution (Sec. 4).  While Article I abolished slavery and dictated equality, the new constitution also had to have provisions that ensured the political and social rights for African Americans.  Article VIII Sections Two and Eight ensured the political freedom of universal male suffrage regardless of \"race, color, or former condition.\"  While, Article X Section Ten, which ensured that \"all public schools...shall be free and open to all children...without regard to race or color,\" was intended to provide the social right to education.   With these new statues in the state constitution, the North felt that South Carolina had met the provisions to be readmitted to the Union; the North hoped these new laws would end the discrimination and disenfranchisement of the African American community in South Carolina.  ","    Historian Richard Zuczek argues that while the constitution provided a new government and new protections for African Americans, \"State whites rejected out-of-hand the constitution and the government it would establish.  For Carolinians, although the new constitution 'may have the authority of law...it has not and never can have the moral sanction of right, truth, or justice...\"  Because the new constitution was written mainly by African Americans and white Republicans, most of the white citizens of South Carolina saw the constitution and the government as illegitimate and longed for the reinstallation of a society based on white supremacy.  This attitude represented the major failure of Reconstruction; it ended de jure political and social discrimination against African Americans, but could not address the de facto discrimination based upon the attitudes and culture of white Carolinians.  These attitudes led to actions that disrupted the government and ensured that African Americans were not given the equality or rights the new constitution guaranteed them.  Southern whites used extralegal forms of violent or economic coercion to continue the discrimination of African Americans; the new rights, provided by the law, were being circumvented by a society that hoped for a return to the antebellum culture of racial superiority.  Thus, the goals of Reconstruction could not be fully applied to a society that was not ready to embrace a culture of racial equality."],"display_date":"January 14, 1868 - March 17, 1868","search_date":"1868-02-14","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4217,"title":"The Attempted Assassination of Secretary Seward\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-15","end_date":"1865-04-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On an early April day in 1865, Secretary of State William Seward decided to take a ride with his family throughout the countryside around his home.

To Mrs. Virginia Clay, wife of Senator Clement Clay of Alabama, the fifty-five year old Houston was a \"Senatorial Hercules\" and a \"roughish old hero\".  In her book, <em>A Belle of the 50's</em>, Mrs. Clay explains Houston's whittling habit saying that \"a seemingly inexhaustible supply of soft wood was always kept in his desk [in the Senate] and out of it he whittled stars and hearts and other fanciful shapes.\"  One day, she received an envelope while she watched in the gallery of the Senate and \"within a tiny, shiny, freshly whittled wooden heart, on which the roguish old hero had inscribed, 'Lady I send thee my heart Sam Houston'\" (99).  She further mentioned his youthful nature as she explained that \"nothing amused him more than to reduce to a confused silence those who surrounded him, by suddenly addressing them in all sorts of unknown words\" in a number of Indian dialects (100).  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Sam Houston to Mrs. Clay she found in his attire as \"he wore a leopard-skin vest, with a voluminous scarlet neck-tie, and over his bushy grey locks rested an immense sombrero... wrapped around his broad shoulders he wore a gaily coloured Mexican <em>serape</em>, in which scarlet predominated\" (98- 99). ","Numerous reasons explain why Sam Houston would wear a serape as Marion Wisehart in <em>Sam Houston: American Giant</em> wrote, \"Senator Houston wore a bright Mexican serape to protect his back and chest from drafts\" (497).  Or perhaps with the time he spent near Mexico, Senator Houston became more comfortable in that clothing style.  Regardless, the same man that Mrs. Clay describes seems very different than the General who led an army of Texans to victory at San Jacinto.  Sam Houston acted as statesman, politician, and soldier.  He fought in the War of 1812, governed Tennessee and later Texas as Governor of two different states, became elected twice as the President of the Republic of Texas, and worked as a Senator for Texas fighting against succession (though a slaveowner himself).  Wisehart describes another aspect of Houston as \"he could talk extemporaneously for two or three hours and hold his audience in thrall.  After sleeping all night on the cold, damp ground, he could sit on a log and write powerful appeals to stimulate patriotic ardor or eloquent petitions in his own defense\" (vii).

The issue of this debate was participation in the Democratic Party National Convention at Baltimore, Maryland-where the party's Presidential nominee was to be decided.  The Baltimore Convention was the second such attempt; Democrats had met earlier from April 30th to May 3rd in Charleston, South Carolina for the same purpose.  There, the majority of the Lower South delegation (as well as a few from the Upper South) felt that the convention had grown hostile to their interests and had failed in its duty to protect the Constitutional right to slavery.  They cited as evidence the primacy of Stephen A. Douglas supporters at the convention and the establishment of a platform that ambiguously endorsed his idea of popular sovereignty for determining territorial slavery.   The disaffected delegates withdrew from the convention and set up their own caucus nearby.  From there, most \"bolters\" expected that they could negotiate their interests with greater leverage and, ultimately, rejoin the National Party.  However, the decision of the National Party Convention to adjourn from Charleston and reconvene on June 18th in Baltimore forced confrontation.  The decision made clear that the National Convention would not just submit to Southern demands.  Yet probably the move's most powerful, and inadvertent, impact was that it removed the breakaway delegation's ability to quietly conduct talks while maintaining overt separation.  Suddenly, Democrats from both the Upper and Lower South were under tremendous pressure to take a stand in what many deemed a choice between polar alternatives of submission or a genuine party split.","            It was in this context that the debate began between <em>The Charleston Mercury </em>and <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em>, both Democratic newspapers that usually agreed with each other.  The issue of location proved to be particularly important in their debate, as one may infer from the fact that their cities' hosted two of the three conventions in question.  The <em>Enquirer's</em> native state of Virginia was largely the head of the Upper South states who, at the time, were still members of the National Convention.  Furthermore, though the <em>Enquirer</em> itself was not usually so ambivalent, Virginia had a history of behavior that was at times unfaithful to the Deep South platform, especially in regards to slavery.  <em>The Charleston Mercury</em>, for its part, was a first-rate example of the South Carolinian persona-a zealous and unrepentant champion of slavery and the South; it was not afraid to say \"secession.\"","            The debate began in a May 10th article from the Charleston Mercury challenging <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em>.  The <em>Mercury</em> wrote that the <em>Enquirer </em>should have rebuked their delegates for not withdrawing, and further criticized the <em>Enquirer's </em>proposal that the Richmond Convention should wait to act until after the Baltimore Convention.  The <em>Mercury</em> ridiculed this idea that would leave delegates with nothing to do but \"suck their fingers.\" On May 18th, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>had much to say in response.  First, it said that Virginia wanted to participate in the Richmond Convention, but that as it was, they and other likeminded states wouldn't be able to nominate delegates in time.  Next, the <em>Enquirer</em> said that the Southern delegates should participate in the Baltimore Convention.  It said that the temporary fracture of the party was likely enough to restore a majority that was supportive of Southern interests. At last, the <em>Enquirer</em> argued that the obdurate pursuance of the Richmond Convention's current course was not only dangerous to the Union, but also to the unity of border slave states with the Deep South.","            <em>The Charleston Mercury</em> rejoined with what would be the final words on the matter.  Immediately, the <em>Mercury</em> challenged the idea that other Southern states wouldn't have time to join.  Also, to the suggestion that the National Party would change its position, <em>The Charleston Mercury </em>replied that, \"the <em>Enquirer </em>may dismiss from its patriotic anxieties all such romantic anticipations.\"  Finally, the <em>Mercury</em> laid great emphasis on the discussion of Southern unity.  The <em>Mercury</em> defended sole participation in the Richmond Convention as better securing the interests of the South.  At the Baltimore Convention, some Southern delegates would invariably be tempted to compromise Southern interests and side with the Northern Democrats.   This claim, along with <em>The</em> <em>Richmond Enquirer's </em>final thoughts, penetrated the core of the debate, a struggle between identification foremost as a citizen of the South or of the Union-in a political climate wherein it seemed that one of them was bound to be overthrown."],"display_date":"May 10, 1860 - May 23, 1860","search_date":"1860-05-16","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4229,"title":"Charles William Truehearts Account of the Battle of the Crater:  Reconsidering Black and White\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-08-28","end_date":"1864-08-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            When the Civil War broke out, Texan Charles William Trueheart was at the University of Virginia studying medicine.  Despite initial reservations about secession, he joined the multitudes of southerners who rushed to enlist.  At first an artilleryman, by 1864 Trueheart had finished studying medicine and was an assistant surgeon in the 8th Alabama Infantry of the Army of Northern Virginia.  It was in this capacity that he experienced the Battle of the Crater on July 30, 1864 in Petersburg, Virginia.","            As Charles W. Trueheart recalled in an August 28, 1864 letter to his brother, Henry Trueheart, the level of death and destruction at the Crater was horrific.  He tells his brother, \"I have never any where seen such a slaughter as there was enacted,\" the dead and wounded were spread across several acres and, \"in many places you couldn't walk without stepping on their carcasses lying one two or even three deep.\"  The \"Crater\" was the result of an attempt by Union forces under Ambrose Burnside to smash the Confederacy's heavily fortified position at Petersburg by tunneling under their location and setting off a major explosion.  To this end, the Union effort was a success, but in the ensuing struggle, the Union attack lacked coordination and became log jammed at the Crater.  The Confederate forces under Robert E. Lee quickly capitalized on this error and inflicted a severe defeat on Burnside's forces, notably including the 4th Division of the United States Colored Troops.  For most Confederates at the Crater, this was their first encounter with black soldiers, here represented in major proportions.","            The black soldiers' presence was Charles Trueheart's main focus in recounting the aftermath of the battle.  His first mention was of the \"Negroes\" that lay dead and wounded with the \"Yankees[,] those vile deceivers and ruiners.\"  Throughout the letter, Trueheart looked at the relationship of these two entities. He said that the injured blacks \"bore their sufferings much better than the Yankees;\" that they complained less and displayed greater Christian devotion in their sufferings.  Moreover, Trueheart wrote that the main complaints that the blacks had were that the Yankees abused them and that the slaves among them wanted to return to their masters.  Trueheart then described the heroism and ability of the blacks, almost equal to the Confederates' and far surpassing the behavior of the white Yankees.  He noted an instance wherein, \"one black fellow...had a regular duel with the Sergeant Major of our reg't.\"  Trueheart says that they traded several shots, that the black soldier, in fact, landed the first shot, hitting \"the Sgt. in the forehead.  Fortunately his head was as thick as his heart was brave, and the ball glanced upwards.\"  A Confederate at last shot and killed the black soldier.  In another notable encounter, an \"officer in our Brigade, having captured a negro in the trenches, told him to turn and fire upon the retreating Yankees; which he did rapidly.\"","            It is impossible to determine how much of Trueheart's account was true, but certainly there is a pervasive slant.  Indeed, many others reported with sadistic pleasure the widespread massacre of black troops by soldiers encouraged to execute them rather than take any prisoner.  The purpose of Truehearts' revisions seems almost inherent within the letter.  It reflected an interest, at the very least, in a temporary realignment of social inclusiveness that would incorporate blacks (40% of the Southern population) and thus engender support for the war efforts against \"those vile deceivers and ruiners.\"  The value of blacks to the war effort was undeniable; loyalty of slaves on the plantations was a major issue, but their presence on the battlefield could be even more potent.  Around 200,000 black soldiers served in the Union, almost 25% of the number of men thought to have fought for the Confederacy-an especially impressive figure considering the comparatively small proportion of blacks in the Union, as well as their exclusion from enlistment until more than two years after the war began.  ","            By the Battle of the Crater in 1864, confidence in the ultimate success of the Confederacy was waning and there was considerable agitation for inclusion of blacks in the war effort.  Significantly, most supporters of a black soldiery also espoused emancipation, which they saw as an unfortunate but necessary accomplice.  By 1865, even top Confederate officials like Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee came out in support of the plan. Yet the time had passed for such a move.  With the Confederate States' defeat in spring of 1865, it became a moot point.  The fragile wartime overture of Southern whites was rendered little more than a moment's retreat from racist agendas that defined much of the South's history."],"display_date":"August 28, 1864","search_date":"1864-08-28","locations":[{"id":13779,"lat":37.0780637097,"lng":-77.6286065028,"zoom":9,"place":"DINWIDDIE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4232,"title":"Alexander Rives Asks James Madison for Advice about Nullification and Secession\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-12-28","end_date":"1833-01-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the early 1830s two of the most pressing questions in the nation were the issues of nullification and secession. A common trend among politicians was to use the ideas of the founders to argue both for and against these ideas, hence it is not surprising that on December 28, 1832 Alexander Rives, a Virginia lawyer, wrote to James Madison, one of the last surviving Founding Fathers, seeking council on this issue. Rives and Madison had never met, but Rives felt the matter so pressing that he forewent the usual formalities apologizing for his forwardness and the disruption of Madison's retirement. Of greatest concern to Rives was the fact that secessionists often referred to the writings of Madison in defense of their position, particularly the Virginia Resolution of 1798. Rives thought this to be a misinterpretation and hoped to be able to, \"Lay before my acquaintances some public evidence of what I conceive a fatal and insidious error,\" and thereby prove that Madison's writing did not endorse secession."," The main conflict arose due to Madison's argument in his Virginia Resolution that ultimate authority lay within the state and not the national government. Madison had always been a champion of the union, but political turmoil near the turn of the century caused him to endorse ideas that were more states rights oriented. The Virginia Resolution was a response to the Alien and Sedition Acts which Madison found to be extremely unpalatable and in direct conflict with the Constitution. He argued that in such cases states were obliged to nullify these laws for they were so unconstitutional that they threatened the rights of the citizens in those states. As Kevin Gutzman explains, \"Madison's document asserted that the state had a 'duty' to maintain its 'rights and liberties' within its boundaries.\" But Madison made clear that such actions were not to be taken without careful deliberation and only when the government overstepped the powers granted to it by the Constitution."," Rives believed that these words did not grant the states the power to arbitrarily secede nor did he believe that this was Madison's intention. He stated, \"That the opinions of the chief architect of our political systems should not be misconstrued or perverted to sinister purposes.\" Rives hoped that Madison could clarify his intentions and in doing so dissuade any improper use of his ideas.","In his response Madison agreed with Rives sentiments. He stated that, \"I do not consider the proceedings of Virginia in '98-99 as countenancing the doctrine that a State may <em>at will</em> secede from its constitutional compact with other states.\" The grievances of 1832, Madison felt, were not dire enough to constitute secession. Moreover, Madison argued that secession required the consent of the other states and not simply the whim of a single state. This confirmation made Rives's interpretation all the more legitimate in the eyes of the people this time. Thus, Rives letter to Madison portrays a desire of the people of the 1830s to qualify their political actions with the intentions of the founders who still held great authority in the people's minds."],"display_date":"December 28, 1832 - January 12, 1833","search_date":"1833-01-04","locations":[{"id":13595,"lat":38.0230931541,"lng":-78.5555505707,"zoom":9,"place":"ALBEMARLE, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4235,"title":"The Black Warrior Affair Exposes U.S. Tensions with Spain\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-02-28","end_date":"1854-03-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 13, 1854 the Charleston Daily Courier ran a series of correspondences from Havana which reported on the escalating Black Warrior affair. These correspondences explain that on February 28 the ship Black Warrior stopped in Havana on its way from Mobile to New York as it had done numerous times in the past and upon arriving delivered its manifest to customs as was required. The captain listed his cargo only as ballasts as he had ordinarily done since all other cargo was in transit. However, the Black Warrior also carried 1000 bales of cotton and the customs officer, upon learning of this, seized the ship and cargo without giving the captain an opportunity to change the manifest. The correspondence explained that the outrage stemmed from the fact that under Spanish law a captain had twelve hours from the time the ship arrived in which he could make corrections to the manifest if an error had occurred, a time which had not elapsed when the ship was seized. The captain immediately informed the U.S. Consul in Havana who attempted to resolve the matter by petitioning the Captain General of Havana to release the ship and cargo. But the correspondence states that the Captain General responded \"the law must take its course\" and so made a speedy end to this affair impossible.","Normally such a minor customs battle would hold little importance for the people of Charleston and the nation as a whole, but the escalating political interest in the affair is best explained by tensions between the United States and Spain around this time. The bulk of this tension was the result of the United States' continued interest in acquiring Cuba from Spain; a sentiment especially strong among Southern Democrats who saw it as an opportunity to create another slave state out of Cuba and among some moderates who hoped that the acquisition of Cuba would ease the growing tensions between the North and South. Also, some hoped that a war with Spain over Cuba would turn the nation's attentions from internal divisions onto national affairs and so alleviate the growing regional crisis in the United States. Thus, it is not surprising that in his essay Henry James tells \"Of the sensation created throughout the length and breadth of the Union by the detention of the Black Warrior.\" Many newspapers portrayed the \"Black Warrior Affair\" as an outrage and a slight against American honor that deserved retribution. Strong political pressure was exerted on President Peirce to act, and Peirce himself was not totally indifferent to the political possibilities this crisis created. While sentiments in the correspondence were not so strong, the author did emphasize the idea that the United States had been wronged in some way. He too called for action by the government to intervene in this \"outrageous affair.\" However, the Spanish government, realizing the political implications, quickly resolved the issue by releasing the ship and cargo. While there were some lingering political repercussions, American interest in the affair ebbed with this resolution and emphasis shift back to the problems of the nation.

The first Transcontinental Railway had only been completed a few days earlier but already there were calls from southerners for a route that was more suited to their needs. A southern transcontinental rail route was not a new idea though, and, in fact, there had been serious discussion about choosing it as the primary route before the Civil War. A Southern route became feasible after 1848 with the annexation of Texas and the vast territorial acquisitions from Mexico and in 1853 with the Gadsden Purchase. Moreover, this region's geological features seem exceptionally good for rail building. As the editorial notes, surveys conducted during the early 1850s painted the southern route as the far superior when compared to the northern or central routes that had been proposed. And southerners during this time had their own motives for preferring this route. Many hoped a southern transcontinental railway would liberate the South economically from the North by making the North reliant upon the South for access to the Far East. Additionally, it was hoped that a Southern route would open up the West to southern political influence and possibly pave the way for the spread of slavery. As it was though northern influence put plans on hold and politics leading up to the Civil War were enough to kill the idea for a period.","But shortly after the war hopes for a southern route were renewed. Many still believed that the southern route was the most feasible and efficient route, and the concerns voiced by the author of the editorial about the First Transcontinental Railway were valid ones. Snow has always been a challenge for trains and winters in the Rocky Mountains always have an abundance of it. The conditions the author describes of high, impenetrable snow drifts were not uncommon and long delays were always a possibility. Another problem not mentioned in the article was that of avalanches which could bury or destroy tracks and any locomotive unlucky enough to be in their path. The railroad companies did erect sheds and snow fences in an attempt to alleviate these problems but often times, as the author describes, these proved ineffective. More importantly these structures were expensive to build and maintain and only added to the costs of the already expensive railroads. Even so, the author's hopes for a southern route were not met quickly, for it was not until December of 1881 that the Southern Pacific railway was finally completed.

The article explains that the reasoning behind the author in the <em>News</em> editorial was that the \"'more intelligent and reasonable citizens must rule'\" no matter whether they are the majority or not and that suppressing the Negro vote was the only way to ensure this. The problem the <em>News</em> editorial author saw was that the current method of violence and intimidation seemed to violate the law and went against the sentiments of many people both in the state of South Carolina and outside it. Moreover, the current method was inconsistent in its effects, whereas an indoctrinated system would be much more systematized and effective. ","The concepts expressed in the News article were a precursor to future action by southern states. In 1890 Mississippi enacted laws such as literacy tests as a method of \"legal\" disenfranchisement, and as the <em>News</em> article predicted these laws worked amazingly well. They were so effective, in fact, that by 1900 all but four southern states had enacted some form of literacy tests and in those states that had them the black vote was all but extinct. The reason these literacy tests worked so well on the black population was that most slaves had never been taught to read or write and only some progress had been made in educating them after Emancipation. ","The successful imposition of these literacy tests was due in part to the fact that there was wide support for them across the country. The author of the New York Times article, in fact, voiced his support for literacy tests as \"a simple and natural method by which a community can protect itself against serious abuse and dangers.\" The problem the author saw was that these laws would not be administered equally or impartially and were simply a tool for suppressing the black vote. Under this premise \"an educational test becomes merely an instrumentality of wrong and fraud\" and so cannot be tolerated because it interferes with the democratic process. ","One must conclude in reading this article that Northern politicians were well aware of Southern intentions to disenfranchise blacks using legal tools long before they were ever able to enact them. The question is why did they let them? Part of the reason lies in the fact that the Democratic Party returned to national dominance in the mid 1880s and undid much of the Reconstruction legislation meant to ensure black rights. But Richard Valelly in his book <em>The Two Reconstructions</em> argues that it was also the fact that the Republican Party lost interest in the black community as a political group. As he states, \"The enormous and rapid growth of the Republican Party in the late 1890s outside the South substituted for lost black voters at the margin.\" So despite the fact that Republicans in the North knew that Southerners sought legal means to disenfranchise blacks they lacked the legal power and political interest to do anything about it."],"display_date":"February 7, 1880","search_date":"1880-02-07","locations":[{"id":11459,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4262,"title":"The Centennial &#40;un&#41;Celebration\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-07-04","end_date":"1876-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["July 4, 1876 should have been a day of extraordinary celebration throughout the nation as the United States of America's Centennial birthday.

","Perhaps Southerners felt as if they had nothing to celebrate.  Divisions were hidden away, simmering just below the surface in honor of the occasion.  Republicans feared that every Southern Democrat was a traitor. Southern Democrats feared that every Republican wanted to remake the South in a subservient Northern model.  Some Southerners were still without full political rights and James G. Blaine aggravated the problem by proposing Jefferson Davis' exclusion from the Amnesty Bill.  The Civil War had not put an end to racial conflicts, especially in the South.  While the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan fought openly and violently against all efforts toward racial integration, the Union League pushed newly freed slaves and other blacks into political office, employing black militias for protection.  Southerners felt as if they were losing independence, order, equality, and freedom.","In sharp contrast, the North had just won a war, and black slaves had finally received their hard-earned freedom.  By 1876, the United States proved it would last as a nation, despite the Civil War.  Public education was on the rise, and the World Fair showcased American ingenuity and increased world interest in the nation.  Scholar John Gladstone claimed that \"the grand Centennial Exposition of 1876 [in Philadelphia] managed to divert the attention of the country away from the 'moral collapse in business and government.'\"  Other Northern celebrations were devoted to industrial progress, education, and humanitarianism, to show the greatness of America's becoming.  For newly liberated blacks, the Centennial provided the first opportunity to prove to the nation their extreme importance in its formation.

Abraham Lincoln appeared as a tyrant to many Confederates when he revoked the right of <em>habeas corpus</em>.

This incited fierce patriotism and nationalism within the South, as Confederates sought to define Kate Stone's \"terrible tragedy.\" To commemorate feelings of patriotism, military leaders, such as Robert E. Lee or the Confederate soldier were viewed as people of honor, which reflected Southern virtues of courage, honor and integrity on the home front.

It was these values that idolized the memory of the South before the war and created a superior opinion of the southern home front. The idea of protecting the \"grace and gentility\" of home life in the Confederate states was reinforced with the news of Lee's surrender and the emancipation of the slaves. The home front became the next battle ground for the conservation of southern values. These thoughts would create much of the tension between the white South and the North as plans for Reconstruction took place. Kate Stone's journal entry provides a look into the Southerners' identity as Confederate defeat became a reality. Kate represents the insecurity of the Confederates as they experienced a period of mourning and remembrance at the end of the Civil War.

Henry W. Grady was born in Georgia and was throughout his career a spokesman, a proponent, and an ambassador for the South to the rest of the world. Growing up in the disenfranchised and embittered South, Grady had a vision of a reintegrated South that would take its place of glory and prominence in the newly restored nation. Harold Davis describes how Grady, who was barely in his thirties when his career took off, became a \"household [name] in the homes of most educated Americans.\" His most famous and influential speech came in 1886 when he addressed the New England Society in New York. In that renowned speech he referred to what famously became known as the \"New South.\" It was a speech and a phrase that would forever change the perceptions and views of the South.","One of the chief editors of the Atlanta Constitution and a key politician in the city of Atlanta, Grady was a very influential man. Davis describes that despite his poor health, Grady, in 1886, accepted an invitation to speak for the annual New England Society's convention. Lots hype was created and centered on this southern politician's coming to New York and speaking in front of such a prestigious group. Grady was not to disappoint. As soon as he began his speech, the audience was rendered spell-bound. The Atlanta Constitution reports that the speech was \"the best speech that [had] been delivered in years\" and that its \"triumph was instant.\"  Delivered with great zeal and charisma, the speech spoke of a \"New South,\" one of redemption and glory. Davis tells of how Grady invoked his audience to remember the \"prophecy of [Daniel] Webster when he said that 'standing hand to hand and clasping hands, we should remain united...all united now and united forever.'\" Davis retells how when the speech was over, Grady was \"mobbed where he stood.\"","On the home front in the South, the speech was met with similar success. The Constitution relates how both Louisiana and Virginia \"cordially approved\" of the speech. Also in Tennessee the speech was \"well received\" and \"the sentiments therein [were] heartily endorsed.\" All in all, the South was pleased that it was so well represented by Grady and that \"the ideas that prevail[ed]\" throughout the South \"made such a favorable impression\" upon a northern audience. A brave and bold yet caring and cordial man, Grady was the champion that the South needed at that point in its history.

A summary of the Lincoln Assassination case in the New York Times on July, 21 1865 proves that Fort Jefferson, the Dry Tortugas would be home to several of the Lincoln conspirators.  ","Ponce de Leon made a discovery in 1513 that would later serve as home to a group of men connected to the assassination of an American President.  The island chain would later receive the name of the \"Dry Tortugas\", each word in reference to an identifying feature of the islands as noted by early explorers.  The \"dry\" depicts the lack of a fresh water source on the islands, an essential piece of information that sailors relied upon.  \"Tortugas\" was a maritime term for sea turtles, and these creatures also happened to be the main source of meat for anyone inhabiting the islands; such as the crew of the HMS Tyger did in 1742 after they were shipwrecked and stranded for 55 days.  The extreme isolation of the Dry Tortugas along with its strategic location, not unlike that of Gibraltar, made them the target for a US Fort that would serve to protect shipping lanes and carry out the Monroe doctrine.","Construction of Fort Jefferson began in 1846 and was never completed.  The massive structure covered 11 acres of land on Garden Key, the only island in the Dry Tortugas suitable to serve host to the large mason building.  The American Civil War caused Fort Jefferson to double as a military prison and housed several hundred inmates in the second story gun casemates.  ","In April, 1865 John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Lincoln and fled Ford's Theatre.  After breaking a leg, he sought medical attention from Dr. Samuel Mudd, a prior acquaintance, and proceeded to dodge the authorities for several more days before being shot.  Dr. Samuel Mudd, Edmund Spangler, Samuel Arnold, and Michael O'Laughlin were all sentenced to life in prison for their alleged roles in the assassination of President Lincoln.  Following their sentencing, the Lincoln conspirators departed in July, 1865 for Fort Jefferson in the Dry Tortugas.  ","In the fall of 1867 several cases of Yellow Fever broke out amongst the troops garrisoned at Fort Jefferson and by mid-September an epidemic gripped the fort.  After the medical officer passed away, Dr. Mudd volunteered his services which saved many of the soldier's lives.  More extraordinary was the fact that Dr. Mudd himself had Yellow Fever and he continued to labor through the disease.   Despite Dr. Mudd's best efforts, his comrade in chains Michael O'Laughlin passed away from the epidemic along with a handful of soldiers.  The NCOs of Fort Jefferson wrote President Johnson a letter praising Dr. Mudd's heroic medical feats despite being a prisoner.  ","As a result of the letter that President Johnson received from Fort Jefferson he granted a pardon to Dr. Mudd on February 8th, 1869 and subsequently pardoned Samuel Arnold and Edmund Spangler on March 1st, 1869.  The strategic value of Fort Jefferson waned throughout the later part of the 19th century until being abandoned in 1874; but the strategic value of Fort Jefferson and the Dry Tortugas caused the fort to be re-activated and armed during the World Wars.

The President's train will depart from the Baltimore and Potomac Depot at 9:30 A.M. this morning. ","            Garfield was originally elected to the House of Representatives as a Republican from the state of Ohio.  He immediately distinguished himself as a very competent and likable person.  His tendency to try to please everyone helped him win the Republican Presidential nomination in 1880 but would eventually hinder him during his presidency.

Only William Henry Harrison had a shorter term in office.

The civil service reform movement capitalized on the assassination by a \"deranged office seeker\" by blaming the spoils system for Garfield's death.  The Pendleton Act has had a significant effect on the civil services in the United   States.  It forced presidents to make appointments based on merit instead of patronage.  This helped eliminate corrupt practices inherent in the spoils system and also made the civil services more efficient because the new appointments were better educated and more experienced.

According to the New York Times in July of 1888, there was \"a vast army of men and women and a few children in New York engaged in making clothes.\" Historically, the clothes industry had undergone many tariff protections. For instance, all the parts of a woman's dress or a man's suit were \"protected\" by astronomical tariffs: on such items as \"raw wool, the cotton yarn, the print cloth, the thread, the buttons, linings, trimmings and woolen cloth.\" The article, \"Clothes Makers and the Tariff,\" argued for the Mill Bill, a bill that would allow for laborers to enjoy higher wages and, consequently, a better and cheaper standard of living. This piece of legislation hoped to encourage these positive alterations by making wool \"free,\" like cotton, which already enjoyed freedom from large duties. ","    In 1888, cotton's rate of duty was approximately 40 percent, compared to the 69 percent experienced by the wool industry. The New York Times discovered that this increase in duty did not benefit the wage earners. Instead, it merely added to the profits of the companies. Meanwhile, there were large numbers of people smuggling foreign goods into the country, which only further increased the problems instilled by the current duty. The Mill Bill hoped to take positive actions to \"excel\" in the worldwide clothing manufacturing market, a foreign idea in the \"cloth making business\" in the late 19th century. Instead, countries such as England dominated in these areas because of the United States' high duties. ","    The factories, which should have been filled with the \"music of contented labor,\" were instead filled with the miserable sounds of the \"poverty-stricken.\" The introduction of the Mill Bill would allow factories to become happier places, with lower costs to the manufacturer and lower costs of materials. With the reduction of duties as proposed by this bill, the United States and New York City would be able to compete with foreign competitors, have happier employees, and extend the clothing market. ","    The sentiments expressed through both this article and the Mill Bill were supported by the women and the Democrat Party's campaign throughout 1888 and 1892. Women worked in these clothing factories in an 11:1 ratio of females to males, and shopping and consumerism had continually become a female duty. The Democratic Party and the tariff reform movement involved both working-class women and middle-class women, whose voices strove to be heard through the ballots of their husbands. The Democratic Party employed moral arguments for economic reforms as Democratic women argued that these tariffs were stealing incomes from hard-working families, and they blamed the Republicans for this insanity. Through reforms such as the tariff reform, women gained their political voice as they marched their husbands to the ballot boxes. As reported by the Woman's Tribune, \"political parties [began] to take note of what will be women's wish.\" In the 1890 election, women's influence and the tariff issue seemed to dominate the Democrat's \"sweeping victories,\" as women gained political power through the ballots of their men and under the pretext of tariff reform and legislation, such as the Mill Bill.

This conflict, however, arose between the Executive and Legislative branches. It is quite possible that only a man of Lincoln's strength could have succeeded in handling the Reconstruction crisis that led to the feud, and Johnson, his successor, was unfortunately not of the same cut. As will be seen, given the nature of the crisis, few people would. ","Generally speaking, Reconstruction is divided into several phases, with the distinction between two of them being Presidential and Congressional Reconstruction, both of which are self-explanatory regarding who was in charge. When Lincoln, the helmsman of the former phase, was assassinated, his successor, Andrew Johnson, took it upon himself to follow through with Lincoln's plan for an amicable and (especially) rapid restoration of the Union. Unfortunately for Johnson, the so-called \"Radical Republicans\" that controlled Congress at the time abhorred the Southern States' passage of Black Codes and attempted to slow their reentry into the Union as punishment. Johnson, of course, still had speed as his priority and refused to back these punitive measures. When Congress realized they would get no help from Johnson, they decided to take matters into their own hands and proposed the Freedman's Bureau Bill in late 1865. The Bureau itself had been a temporary entity founded by Lincoln immediately after the war with the intention of assisting the newly freed slaves. Under the Bill proposed by Congress, however, the Bureau's longevity and powers would be greatly increased. While this was ostensibly to give more and better aid to the slaves, it was by no means coincidental that the Bill's passage would transfer <em>de facto</em> control of Reconstruction from Johnson to Congress.  ","From Johnson's point of view, this was a dilemma in the fullest sense of the word: oppose the bill and gain enemies or allow it and lose power. He chose the former and vetoed the passage of the Bill in February of 1866. According to <u>The New York Times</u>, Johnson gave several reasons for this, although the largest one seemed to be that passage of the Bill did not put enough faith in the abilities of the Southern leaders to handle Reconstruction on their own. Furthermore, the article states that Johnson claimed to believe \"that the question of the Union is paramount to all others.\" Taken together, these statements reflect an attempt by Johnson to rally the nation behind him more than anything else. Specifically, in the latter statement he seems to be likening himself to Lincoln and trying to take advantage of the late Lincoln's popularity in the North, with the former statement obviously being an attempt to put him on the good side of the Southern leaders. In the end, this would not help him, as Congress passed the Bill over his veto and basically used their new powers to make life miserable for Johnson, who would go on to have the dubious honor of being the first US President to be impeached.  ","In Johnson's defense, it cannot be denied that Lincoln, a popular man-of-the-people even before he was martyred, would have been a tough act to follow.  In that regard, it is not surprising that Johnson would remain so adamant on his quest to follow through with Lincoln's plan, as to change said plan would have seemed disrespectful to Lincoln's memory and therefore political suicide. The true irony of the situation becomes apparent here, as it was not changing the plan that would turn out to be the real suicide. Specifically, Johnson's unwillingness to deviate from Lincoln's hope for a fast rebuilding-even in the face of the Black Codes-led to Congress trying to seize Reconstruction authority via the Freedman's Bureau Bill, which in turn led to the lose-lose position that Johnson occupied in February 1866."],"display_date":"February 20, 1866","search_date":"1866-02-20","locations":[{"id":1276,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":4361,"title":"Southern Opinion on the National Union Convention of 1866\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-07-11","end_date":"1866-07-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["    \"The object of the convention is to sustain the President and reunite the country on his policy of Reconstruction.\" With this statement, the Wednesday, July 11, 1866 edition of the Montgomery Daily Advertiser outlined the purpose of the upcoming National Union Convention that was to take place on August 14, 1866. With the end of the war, the issue of reuniting the country was topic of both local and national interest. The prospect of joining the nation under a common ideology and purpose was one that was imperative to piecing together the broken nation. However, the fact that the country has just emerged from a long and arduous civil war entrenched in the ideas of varying ideologies made this repair a daunting task. Although Montgomery was located deep within the former Confederacy, the Advertiser's outlook of the upcoming convention was positive. The paper described an idyllic prospect, claiming a \"spectacle of men from the North and South mingling together in harmonious counsel will go a long way towards sustaining him [Andrew Johnson] and breaking down the power of those who are alike, enemies to him and to constitutional liberty.\"","    Upon the end of the Civil War, many people, both of northern and southern origins and loyalties, had become weary of the war. Families longed to be reunited and there was a hope for a return to a normal and stable way of life. As the Advertiser described, there was the hope that both Northerners and Southerners would be able to find common ground through support of Andrew Johnson, but, Johnson's blatant opposition to proposed legislation such as the 14th Amendment and the Civil Rights Act made it unclear exactly how dedicated Johnson himself was to fully reuniting the nation. ","    Although there was a feeling among Americans that the country was in need of repair, there were many Southerners and delegates to the National Convention from Alabama and other former Confederate states who, \"though willing to concede defeat at the hands of the Union army...would not, as the unionists demanded, admit wrong doing in 1861.\" This failure to accept war guilt also extended into other facets of life as well. Many southern states refused to acknowledge the rights of blacks following the end of the war. Governments across the South instituted Black Codes to restrict the rights and lifestyles of African Americans, or simply tried their best to return freedmen to a status as close to slavery as possible.

He talked of how the government became recognized as the State Government of Louisiana only after they passed a bill to set another election.  He also visited the fact that this government was trying to get the right people into office with people resigning and people filling these positions.

Hickman was outraged at the conduct of President Buchanan which he believed had violated the Constitution of the United Sates - particularly in relation to the issues of slavery and popular sovereignty.  \"Suddenly,\" said Hickman, in order to carry the election in his home state of Missouri, \"he became transformed from the sympathizer with down trodden freedom, to the open and shameless defender of aggressive and law defying slavery.\" There is \"an eternal antagonism between <em>freedom</em> and <em>slavery\", </em>said Hickman. Buchanan, according to Hickman, exceeded the powers granted to him as President by the Constitution by usurping powers of Congress. His policies had driven the country to the point of insolvency by not providing for proper supervision of the country's finances. Public property, Hickman contended, sold for less than its value and high wages were paid to workers who do nothing because they are friends or supporters of Buchanan. The Post Office had been poorly managed and also the victim of patronage. As a result of their own policies, said Hickman, the administration had become unable to act they are so afraid. Hickman next attacked the advisability of the acquisition of Cuba particularly in light of the fact that it will add to the strength of the slave states.

The Confederates appeared utterly defeated, and yet some still were willing to fight. But the South was not the only problem for the North. Corruption was rampant in Forts Smith and Gibson (Indian Territory, now Oklahoma); safe havens for both southern and northern refugees, from brutality, but both Government officials and Union officers practiced fraud, deception and robbery. They took livestock, and sold it back to the government to be given to those they took it from. Officers of the Indian regiments added names of dead, deserted or created soldiers to their rosters and collected their pay, but with the reinstatement of Colonel William A. Phillips, his command and agents were cleaned up. He had agents watched by trusted men, and made some seek political refuge.","But this was not Col. Phillips' only problem. General Ulysses S. Grant had ordered that all Indian troops must be mounted, but by this time Phillips had only forty useful horses left to give to his men. Scouting remained entirely necessary with the Confederates still fighting; with little bands of brigands and bushwhackers destroying everything and rumours abound that Confederate General Cooper was putting an army together for one last offensive into Missouri.

Beautiful women adorned the balconies that hung over the Place d' Armes. Each country, represented by its own amount of officials and military, watched as the France flag descended and the American flag ascended succinctly down the pole, meeting halfway to acknowledge exchange of powers. President Thomas Jefferson instructed William Claiborne, Mississippi's current territorial governor at the time and General Wilkinson, commander of the United States Western Army to receive Louisiana from France, who just received it from Spain within the same year. The transaction happened in a time frame of less than 20 days. With the documents signed making the Louisiana Purchase official, Governor Claiborne made a speech to the inhabitants that promised their way of life would not be disturbed. The United States received the \"keys\" to the city and thus the elected William C.C. Claiborne began to act as governor of the territory of Louisiana.","            The Portrait of Governor Claiborne was painted in 1840, 23 years after his death. It is probable that E.B. Savary chose to paint the Governor at a time where New Orleans had a growing population. According to U.S. Bureau of the Census for Population of the 100 Largest Urban Places, New Orleans was the third largest city in 1840 with a population of 102,193 persons. Aside from the rise of popularization of New Orleans, many Louisianans favored Claiborne due to his passiveness in government. Many considered Claiborne qualified for governor because he had served as assistant to a Congress clerk, opened a law firm, appointed as a Tennessee Supreme Court Judge, and selected by President Thomas Jefferson to preside as Mississippi territorial governor. From the very beginning Claiborne sought to appease the people of New Orleans. He adopted their style, delayed the necessary revisions to the laws, and appointed locals to the political office.  This led to a number of critics including that of Andrew Jackson, major General of U.S. forces. In his opinion, he thought of Claiborne as \"much better qualified for great pomp and show, and courting popularity-quiet life- in civil walks- than military achievements amidst peril danger\". Vincent Nolte, a local German-born merchant described Claiborne as \"a weak, intriguing, and gutless man who had not the energy necessary to give a great impulse to the population of Louisiana and cared only for his popularity and preeminence\". Claiborne resented Jackson upon his arrival into New Orleans because now he would be forced to take orders from a man whom had absolute authority and Claiborne considered Jackson to be inferior. ","            According to the painting, one would assume that Governor Claiborne symbolized a man with great military strength, but on the contrary he was not known for fighting battles. Perhaps the military uniform shown speaks of Claiborne's desired image to be taken seriously, but his smirk in the portrait speaks volumes of how the governor was gullible. Although Governor Claiborne aided the U.S. military with war supplies during the Battle of New Orleans, he did not directly win its victory. Despite his shortcomings on the battlefield, Claiborne is remembered for his numerous contributions in advancing Louisiana such as building new roads, establishing a mail service, and developing a public educational system. After serving as Governor of Louisiana he was elected into the U.S. Senate, but died before ever taking office. Claiborne, as a result of his serene administration is prescribed honor and place in the history of New Orleans, thus he is remembered by this grand portrait to credit his contribution."],"display_date":"January 20, 1840 - August 20, 1840","search_date":"1840-05-05","locations":[{"id":5597,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":29,"tag":"New Orleans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":47,"tag":"Governor Claiborne"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":56,"tag":"Battle of New Orleans"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4457,"title":"Zachary Taylor Grapples With the Wilmot Proviso\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-01-01","end_date":"1848-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As soon as the Mexican War ended and the Mexican Cession granted the United States even more land for the nation, a common contemporary issue posed the question: would these new territories be free soil or allow slavery? David Wilmot, a Democratic representative from Pennsylvania at the time, added a proposal of how to settle the slavery question once and for all, known as the Wilmot Proviso. The proviso called for an end to slavery in any new states admitted to the Union. In 1848, the people elected Whig Zachary Taylor for president over Democratic contender Lewis Cass. So how did President Taylor really feel about the proviso?","    An excerpted news source in Augusta, Georgia, reported that some Democratic papers had published a letter said to be written by General Taylor in the Spring of 1847 regarding the proviso. The contents included in the 1848 pamphlet state that the letter was susceptible of a construction that would make General Taylor seem to favor that doctrine. That letter was later proven to be false and possibly fabricated, as the editor who received the letter and interpreted it to mean that President Taylor would favor the Wilmot Proviso had abandoned the issue, and General Taylor with it. This sampled article is one of several pieces in a anonymously published pamphlet from 1848 that look at whether Taylor actually believed that Congress had the constitutional power to settle the slavery question with the Wilmot Proviso. ","    Scholarship from 2006 suggests a split between the Northern and Southern Whigs on Taylor's intentions. James Brewer Stewart, Professor of History at Macalester College, argues that in 1848, the Southern Whigs claimed Taylor despised the Wilmot Proviso and if elected, he would successfully oppose it; yet Northern Whigs guaranteed that the moment that Congress passed the Proviso, Taylor would sign it.","    Towards the end of the pamphlet, the anonymous author found direct testimony of Taylor's opposition to the Wilmot Proviso through strained readings and comparisons. The language found from an exchange between southern statesman Joseph Segar and Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise in Hampton, Virginia stated that Taylor would exercise the veto on any bill containing the provisions of the Wilmot Proviso. Historian Holman Hamilton also adds that Taylor and Cass occupied the same ground, that the Proviso should not be adopted.

In the article, Douglas defended his opinions on the much derided and disputed issue of popular sovereignty.","He explained his interpretation of popular sovereignty with two basic arguments.  First, he contended that the position of the people of the territories, in regards to the issue of slavery, was similar to the position of the colonies under British rule, who were denied the right to stop the importation of slaves.  As an example, he described a letter sent to the King of England in 1772 citing a clause in the Virginia Constitution adopted in June, 1776, claiming as justification for Independence, \"the inhuman use of the Royal negative in refusing us [the Colony of Virginia] permission to exclude slavery from us by law\" (Douglas' brackets)","His second argument justified both Congress's role in the territories and the ability of a territorial government to decide the issue of slavery.  To accomplish this, Douglas referred to the clause in the Constitution which gave Congress the power to \"make all rules and regulations respecting the territory,\" of the United States.  This gave Congress the power to appoint a territorial government, as in Kansas and Nebraska, which would regulate the slavery issue on the basis of popular sovereignty.  Douglas also claimed that the founders often referred to the territory as \"States\" or \"new States.\"  Thus, if the territories are considered to be \"States\" or \"new States,\" then they, like any of the states, have the power to permit or deny slavery in their territory.","Douglas published the article in <em>Harpers Magazine</em> after a tumultuous decade of sectional bickering over the issue of slavery, in which he was personally responsible for the violently controversial Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854).  According to historian James McPherson, Douglas' \"parliamentary legerdemain pushed the bill through the Senate,\" despite strong free-state Democrat and Whig opposition.  The bill permanently tied Douglas' name to the doctrine of popular sovereignty, which Douglas dubbed, according to Nicole Etcheson, the \"great principle of self-government.\" The Kansas territory was the proving ground for Douglas' pet project, and when, according to McPherson, the situation there began to deteriorate, Douglas' attachment to popular sovereignty became a political liability.","With this in mind, according to historian Robert Johannsen, Senators Albert G. Brown and Jefferson Davis of Mississippi and James S. Green of Missouri confronted Douglas in 1859 and urged him to defend his controversial doctrine.  Brown demanded clarification because Douglas \"was emerging as the strongest contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1860.\"","A fierce defender of the doctrine, Douglas shall always be remembered for what he said, as quoted by historian Eric Dean, of popular sovereignty, \"I will follow that principle wherever its logical consequences may take me and I will endeavor to defend it against assault from any and all quarters.\""],"display_date":1859,"search_date":"1859-07-02","locations":[{"id":15199,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"UNORGANIZED TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4461,"title":"Thomas Nast Draws a Political Statement at the Chicago Convention\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-09-03","end_date":"1864-09-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Twenty-four year old Thomas Nast made known his support for incumbent President Lincoln in a work in the September edition of Harper's Weekly. The cartoon entitled \"Compromise With the South\" was one of his most powerful and effective cartoons, and one of his personal favorites that he dedicated to the Democratic Chicago Convention in particular. Harper's Weekly, the first periodical to achieve national circulation, featured the cartoon on its front page on September 3, 1864. Nast's staunch Unionist stance, including those of the Republican editor and owner of Harper's, helped to earn the periodical its reputation in the North and earning him threatening letters from the South. One admirer declared: \"Nast would have been burned at the stake had he been captured on one of his visits to the front.\"","    The cartoon itself depicts a possible grim outcome from the Democratic convention. Nast paints the Democratic convention as a betrayal against the principles for which Union soldiers fought. On the left, a defeated and disabled Union soldier, his face hidden in shame, extends a feeble hand of surrender to a triumphant Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy. Davis stands with one boot disrespectfully on the grave of another Union soldier, while Columbia kneels mournfully. In the upper-left, the American flag is hung upside down as a sign of distress. Nast's point in his cartoon was that if there was going to be a compromise with the Confederacy, Union soldiers will have died and served and lost limbs for nothing. He also believed the Democratic platform would return blacks to slavery, as there is a despairing black Union soldier in the cartoon. Overall, the cartoon made a statement against the peace wing of the Democratic party (who were also known as Copperheads).","    The 1864 campaigns and convention was the event that helped Nast earn his national reputation.

His crusading ardor can be attributed to his upbringing: his father fled from Europe rather than be faced with compromising his political ideals and carried from that a sense of conscience rather than a spirit of compromise which was the dominant thought pattern in the country in the Civil War era."],"display_date":"September 3, 1864","search_date":"1864-09-03","locations":[{"id":2539,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"COOK, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4465,"title":"Smilin&#39; Schuyler Rails Against The Laws of Kansas\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-06-21","end_date":"1856-06-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1850, the Midwest remained largely undeveloped and in the eyes of many New Englanders it seemed a very profitable proposition.

He worked to help slaves and promote abolitionism in his lifetime, including spending his own money for the cause.  In a letter to a friend, Smith described how he had posted bail on different occasions for a man named Chaplin, who was being punished for enticing slaves away from their southern masters.  Gerrit Smith felt that the money he spent on bailing Chaplin out of jail, though costly, was necessary because it was for a good and just purpose.  He wrote, \"I am robbed of these 12,000.  I have been robbed of a great deal from time to time, in the sums which I have felt myself morally compelled to pay in the purchase of the liberty of slaves.\"","As described by historian M. Leon Perkal, Gerrit Smith, along with other radicals of the Liberty Party, advocated an idea that interpreted the Constitution as providing abolition of slavery in all states, and guaranteeing the equality of African-Americans.  As a whole, the Liberty Party did not completely accept this novel interpretation; however it did represent the stances of some of its members on slavery.","Having the leader of a political party bail someone out of jail for trying to illegally free slaves demonstrates the contrasting range of political views in the 1840s and 1850s.  The radical abolitionists in the Liberty Party wanted to free all slaves, and believed they were constitutionally empowered to do it.  At the same time, law enforcement had every right, according to the Fugitive Slave Act, to put someone in jail for aiding in the escape of slaves.  One can only imagine the conflicts that might have arisen when an abolitionist politician paid to have someone removed from jail who helped southern slaves escape.

It turned out that Burnside's plan of campaign was sufficient on paper, but, as the after action report of Fredericksburg shows, the execution of the plan shattered Burnside's hopes for success. ","                As noted by Howard, Burnside planned to move small numbers of his army as McLellan had planned toward Chester Gap and Culpepper, but to use these marches as a feint to the Confederates so that he could move the majority of his army to Falmouth and cross the Rappahannock to Fredericksburg and gain control of Marye's Heights for future movements.   This plan required the repair of the railroad and delivery of pontoon bridges to the crossing very quickly, which was left in the hands of General Halleck in Washington. The element of surprise was a key for the success of this plan. ","                Burnside's plan did not turn out the way that he had hoped as shown in the after action report. He commented that he moved sooner than he had told the President, Secretary, and General Halleck. The reason he gave for this was that he had seen that the enemy had moved his forces down the river and he hoped by having a \"vigorous attack\" across the river at Fredericksburg that he could separate the troops of the Confederates which would cause them to violate one of the well-known rules of war: never divide your troops in the face of a superior enemy. Burnside and his army were unfortunately unable to accomplish this due to the \"fog and unexpected and unavoidable delay in building the bridges.\" This gave General Lee enough time to assemble his troops at Marye's Heights to defend against Union attacks and ruin the element of surprise Burnside needed. ","                Burnside admitted in his report that he and the army had failed, but had a few things been different, such as the pontoon bridges arriving on time, they might have won a victory for the Union. He reported on the over 10,000 casualties in the battle, but said that he was \"glad to represent the army at the present time in good condition\" which seem to contradict each other. Burnside expressed sympathy for those killed and praised the braveness of those who fought in the battle. The sentiment in the after action report was that Burnside knew he had acted hastily at the wrong time and was willing to take the blame for the loss, and it felt like he knew he would be demoted after this defeat because he thanked the government for their support and confidence almost as a farewell."],"display_date":"December 17, 1862","search_date":"1862-12-17","locations":[{"id":14293,"lat":38.1882210605,"lng":-77.65248979,"zoom":9,"place":"SPOTSYLVANIA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4645,"title":"<em>What do you do when the Klan is after YOU?</em>","course_id":22,"status":"P","start_date":"10/1/28","end_date":"11/10/28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Major Harwell Goodwin Davis is sitting at his desk and he hears the distinctive ring of the telephone.

He decided to not continue with his current office, and instead run for Congress in 1928. Just two weeks before the election, the man who headed the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama, Jim Elsdale, called to offer him membership into his very publicized group. Before Davis could even respond, Elsdale explained even further that it was Hiram Evans, the chief of all of the klans in the United States, which gave him the authority to do so.

Davis explained the proposition he received, and Beck did a strange thing. The shop owner immediately went to his cash register to contribute the fifty-dollar membership fee to Davis’ campaign. Davis was absolutely dumbfounded with the sight of a Jewish man actively persuading his friend to join an organization that publicly despises his religion.

They still talk of states rights…but still, state rights means the right…to deprive people of their liberties.\"","  President Lincoln and his colleagues in Congress differed greatly on how to punish the South for the past five years, and Congressmen like Henry Winter Davis, Benjamin Wade and Newell were adamantly opposed Lincoln's more \"forgiving\" approach and demanded more strict punishment. Wade and Davis concocted the Wade-Davis Bill of 1864, which called for a more stringent plan than Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan.

Today it is not that big of a deal that a black man is running for president, or for any office in the government.  However, one hundred and fifty years ago, a black man was not even considered a person, much less someone who could run for political office, especially Secretary of State.  Fredrick Douglass, a former slave, was about to change all that.  Facing much persecution, he ran for the office Secretary of State of New York in 1855.  This idea had been opposed by many.  As it is said in the <em>Macon Weekly Telegraph</em>, \"the whole thing is supremely ridiculous and can only issue in increasing the feeling in New York against this class of people.\"  Most did not think or believe that a black man should be allowed to hold such a position.","Douglass's race would be a big issue in his run for office.  In the mid 1800's a black person was not considered a whole person, much less a candidate for a government office.  Under the Constitution an African American was only considered three-fifths of a person, and was sold like property.  Also, most African Americans had limited access to education.  As a former slave, Douglass taught himself how to read and write in many different ways.  He educated himself and then escaped to freedom.  After he became free, Douglass became an abolitionist, fighting to end slavery for all blacks.  He would play a huge role as one of the few abolitionists who had actually been through slavery before.  This would help him in his run for office.  It allowed people to know his name, and know what he stood for before he ran.    ","Douglass's run for high office brought him a lot of unwanted attention, though.  The more people who became informed of Douglass's goal, the more people who would try to stop his progress.  It is written in the <em>Macon Weekly Telegraph</em>, \"if the Negroes cannot vote, they can be voted for and if under a social ban, they can be ennobled.\"  But since blacks could not vote yet, Douglass had to rely on whites to vote him into office, and the chances of a white man voting for a former slave, or any black man, seemed impossible.  Although Douglass did not receive the position of Secretary of State that he longed for, he did write books about his life.  He wrote about his thoughts, his slavery, and his freedom using what education he gathered through the years.  After documented his life as a slave and made aware of many of the brutal things that slaves had to do, he used his writings to help end slavery."],"display_date":"October 1, 1855","search_date":"1855-10-01","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"American Civilizations to 1877","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":20,"school_id":9}},{"id":4593,"title":"&quot;Northerner&#39;s Reaction to Lincoln&#39;s Assassination&quot;","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-04-16","end_date":"1885-04-16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Benjamin Stouffer lived in Poughkeepsie, New York and attended school at the time of President Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865.

Many southerners saw Lincoln as the cause for their most of their problems, and blamed him for the war and extreme destruction of their land and livelihoods.

The poem followed the coffin throughout the country where you could see the remains of the devastation caused by the Civil War. The country women were still mourning for their own family members. They seemed ready to mourn for their president, as they were already wearing black veils and the images of past battles haunted men's thoughts. The poet addressed his despair, not knowing how to mourn such a leader properly. Was he to mourn like he would for a family member? A part of the country was disoriented by this assassination, only adding to the trouble caused by the new situation of the country after the Civil War. The poem itself seemed to show that even nature was disturbed by the death of Lincoln and willing to honor the president. Although Whitman did not mention Lincoln's name in the poem, it clearly expressed the disarray of this loss: they described the country with full of promises to come in the following seasons, and left at a loss of a leader in a time when he was clearly needed, as he was the one that had the people behind him, and to have paved the way during the war, for the reconstruction to come.","This poem about the assassination of Lincoln echoes <em>Captain O my Captain</em>, also written by Whitman.

The men in charge of loading the helicopter “in addition to maintenance on the aircraft would blindfold the prisoners, holding the blindfold on with heavy wire, safety wire.” The soldiers would tie the hands and feet of the prisoner, then held a contest to see who could toss them the farthest off the aircraft. This was done in the company of high-ranking military officials. Nothing was done to stop these actions because officers felt they were doing nothing wrong.

Brauer.  Whigs were also apprehensive about the possibility of war with Mexico.","The South was not keen to point out how advantageous the annexation of Texas would be to the furtherance of their interests and the continuity of slavery, but rather attempted to persuade the North that the annexation of Texas would work to preserve the Union and expand Northern industry.  Hudson addressed this as he discussed the argument made by Southern Congressmen that “the commercial advantages to be derived from a connexion [sic] with Texas would be immensely great.”  Hudson quickly saw through the possible advantages of acquiring Texas for the North, as he points out that “the very annexationists, those new-born friends of Northern manufacturers, have been constantly in the habit of assailing manufacturers.”","Besides these attempts to persuade the North that annexing Texas was in its best interest, Hudson stated that the House of Representatives received little information on why they should annex Texas.  Congress only received threats that it was important to annex Texas, because if not the South may secede as they had more to gain through affiliation with Texas than with the North.  This can be observed, according to Hudson in Mr. C. J. Ingersoll’s opening of the debate on the admission of Texas as he stated “that he should offer no argument in favor of the measure, till he should hear it assailed!”  Further, Hudson pointed out that during meetings regarding the annexation of Texas throughout the South, “annexation or dissolution were the only alternatives presented.”","Hudson quickly dismissed these arguments as he argued that the annexation of Texas “is a device, got up by Messrs. Upshur and Calhoun, to place slavery on a more permanent foundation, and to give the South a balance [of] power.”  Texas would be annexed in “an attempt, in one part of the Union, to build itself up at the expense of another.”  He wanted to argue that the annexation of Texas could also have possibly led to war, and a great accumulation of debt, and would not have provided any of the advantages that the Southerners discussed.  In essence, the annexation of Texas would tear the Union apart, as “the admission of Texas into the Union would sow the seeds of discontent and alienation and do more to jeorpard[ize] the peace and endanger the perpetuity of the Union.”","Regardless of the problems Texas potentially caused the Union, Congressmen such as Hudson were succumbed to defeat, as Texas was annexed to the Union in 1845."],"display_date":"January 20, 1845 - December 29, 1845","search_date":"1845-07-10","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":34,"tag":"Crime/Violence, Economy, Law, Slavery, Urban Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4914,"title":"<strong>Purifying the Ballots: Women’s Entrance into The Political Sphere</strong>","course_id":41,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-01-01","end_date":"1868-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In a society where women were becoming the majority, they still stood bounded by political and social restraints. Rather than seeing this as a setback, American women grew more aware of their limitations and demanded the right to vote. <em>The Social Elevation of Woman</em>, refers to a time when patriarchy was most apparent and women’s voting rights remained undervalued. Men of the early nineteenth century, feared that women would gain such power in society, which might later jeopardize their status. On the other hand, some believed that women, viewed as the picture of <em>perfection</em> and <em>purity</em>, would become tainted when coming into contact with men in the voting polls. The article shows a clear shift towards a more <em>gender equal </em>society. While many men decided to avoid this claim, they knew that <em>old</em> ideals were being left behind and that women were now taking on the role of both the domestic and intellectual head of households. Not all men disagreed with the right of women’s vote in government, believing that this can only empower them to help cultivate <em>better</em> <em>dinners</em> at the table. This meant that through the intellectual awareness gained within social involvement, women could also enhance their roles within the household and bring to the table more intellectual conversations, while expanding both their social and domestic skills.","Meanwhile, in Elsa Barkley Brown’s, “<em>To Catch the Vision of Freedom”, </em>included in the book <em>Unequal Sisters</em>, she poses the idea of what it means to be freed, experiencing full political right. Freed women, while sometimes being accepted into society, were denied many rights, including the moral right to vote. Suffrage, as presented in the reading, was thought of as a God-given right for women and that there should be a clear distinction between the <em>right</em> to suffrageand the <em>right </em>for liberty. While many white Southern men experienced the right to vote, freed women were denied such liberty, showing that they never reached a point of full freedom. As the reading suggests, that since much of the field work was done by women, who were left to take care of the home, agriculture, and religious duties while their husbands were away, could have used their time more wisely by participating in the polls. Simply, a woman engaging just in controversial conversation was not enough to compensate for fair political participation.","Both readings, focused on women’s fight towards gaining voting rights, help support the idea that voting was not merely a right for one class nor one gender, but a universal privilege. Women also helped <em>purify</em> the polls, with their moral and trustworthy decisions. Women proved to be successful both intellectually and domestically, and were ready to take advantage of their full rights as lawful citizens. Overtime, women have also confirmed that they do take into consideration the importance of discussing political issues outside the home, but that their participation is needed to help alleviate the country from <em>portentous warnings</em>."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"1849 - 1868","search_date":"1859-01-01","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":523,"tag":"voting"},{"id":524,"tag":"white women's rights"},{"id":525,"tag":"African American Sufferag"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":41,"school_id":2}},{"id":4953,"title":"The Proclaimed Truth behind the Erie Canal","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-02-07","end_date":"1821-02-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 7, 1821, an article in the <em>Geneva Palladium</em> attempted to vindicate the claims of the progenitor of the Erie Canal.  The author of the article claimed that while DeWitt Clinton was often credited with the creation of the Erie Canal, Philip Schuyler and Elkanah Watson are in fact the true progenitors of this magnificent waterway.  With the help of Robert Troup’s pamphlet published in 1821, the author claimed that because the construction of the Erie Canal would not have been started without the Lake Canal Policy, whoever drafted this policy was indeed the true creator of the Erie Canal.  Troup’s pamphlet issued “a vindication of the claim of Elkanah Watson, to the merit of projecting the Lake Canal Policy, as created by the Canal Act of March, 1792; and also a vindication of the claim of the late General Philip Schuyler, to the merit of drawing that act, and procuring its passage through the Legislature.  The author of the article agreed with Robert Troup’s claim that the policies of the late 18<sup>th</sup> century were responsible for implementing a new mode of transportation in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.  This article addressed the conflicting views behind the projection of the Erie Canal in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century.","Both Robert Troup and the author of the article in the <em>Geneva Palladium</em> firmly believed that General Philip Schuyler was responsible for drawing up the Canal Act of March, 1792, and that Elkanah Watson was responsible for carrying out the Act itself and making sure it was passed.

Emerging in the early 1900s, it expressed women's opinions about social, economic, and political aspects of life in the rural New England town of Beverly Massachusetts. The women writers of the newspaper, <em>The Beverly Beacon</em>, expressed the fears they had for their children, gender inequality and the political, social and economic concerns of everyday women. They urged their readers to \"wake up and be more alive\"[i] to the needs of their communities, and encouraged other women to get more involved in public life.","   The early 1900s witnessed new voices in the cry for women's rights.

However, while the <em>Beacon's</em> articles address issues important to their readers, they walk the fine line between acknowledging women's equality and campaigning for political change. For example, the editors claim that there is no need for a political section in their newspaper because they \"are neither Republican, Democratic, nor Progressive;in fact we care very little about politics and the chief aim of women is to get things done. It is not party nor principle nor platform but performance that counts in the forum of the home.\"[ii] However, the editors did include articles about the fight for women's suffrage and the need for advancement in political society. As one article noted: \"There is no good reason why women should not\"[iii] vote as an American citizen born with the same unalienable rights as a man. The Declaration of Independence of the American nation proclaims that all men are created equal, and \"if the term men is used figuratively, meaning the human family as comprising both men and women, then our present form of government is in flat contradiction of that time honored document.\"[iv] With its common vision of equality for women, <em>The Beverly Beacon </em>and similar publications helped create awareness of women's problems and concerns while advocating for women's voting rights. As one scholar noted, papers like the <em>Beacon</em> were a \"chance to help women see their own problems, help bring out the things that are true in the traditions that have bound them; help show up the things that are false.\"[v] The publication of <em>The Beverly Beacon</em> initiated the rise of women's voice in the New England area by creating an impenetrable bond between mothers, sisters, daughters, and friends.

For example, he went to medical school and became a doctor, was married, and had four children.  He spent the last portion of his life in Oklahoma."],"display_date":"October 25, 1864","search_date":"1864-10-25","locations":[{"id":4432,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"OSAGE, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4988,"title":"Anti-Abolitionists are Antagonized in <em>The Herald</em>","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-08-31","end_date":"1835-08-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["When residents of Geneva, New York acquired their daily copy of <em>the Herald</em> on August 31, 1835 they had no idea they were about to read a prophetic vision of the United States’ future. After acknowledging an anti-abolition meeting that had taken place in the town just a few days prior, the anonymous author of the front-page article went on to denounce the meeting as foolish and to predict the gradual alienation between the North and South, until the point where the South no longer wanted anything to do with the Union. To this anonymous author the separation between the North and the South seemed almost inevitable; South Carolina had already expressed desire for independence in the Nullification Crisis in 1832 and the South, with the preference for states’ rights over federal ones, was already uncomfortable with the North having so much power. It became clear that the author hoped to garner support for the abolitionist movement in defaming its opposition; the meeting, the author asserted, was a “farce” populated by “third-rate lawyers” who were attempting to fight an impossible battle in Geneva. With no economic connections to the South, residents of Geneva saw no reason to support the anti-abolition movement.","The issue concerning states’ rights and the extent of states’ powers in relation to the Federal government dates as far back as the Articles of Confederation which gave states a great deal of power; a more powerful Federal government was eventually instituted, though the arguments over the rights of the states continued. This issue became a core concept in the discussions of slavery in the South, where intellectuals, politicians, and plantation owners defended its position in the Southern economy. The United States had not yet faced the possibility of adding more slave states to the Union, but the precedent was tested in 1819. Just fifteen years prior to the anti-abolition front’s meeting in Geneva the United States had become embroiled in disagreements over the introduction of new slave states after the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory, which exacerbated the animosity between the North and South. The Missouri Crisis constituted one of the first open clashes concerning slavery and states’ rights: the debate centered around the creation of a new state, Missouri, as a slave state. Prominent Northern politicians such as Rufus King violently opposed this idea and fought against Missouri’s admittance as a broadening of Southern slavery. Eventually a compromise was reached, allowing Missouri to enter the Union as a slave state and Maine as a free one. This compromise only served to delay the eventual confrontation even further, and allowed for problems to continue to surface between the abolitionists in the North and slaveholders in the South."],"display_date":"August 31, 1835","search_date":"1835-08-31","locations":[{"id":8962,"lat":42.8528904967,"lng":-77.2997890257,"zoom":9,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4989,"title":"<strong>Elizabeth Ricord Opens Female Seminary in Upstate New York </strong>","course_id":35,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-05-01","end_date":"1829-05-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In May, 1829, the Geneva Female Seminary opened for its first school year with only about 15 students. It continued to grow and develop under the leadership of Elizabeth Ricord, the founder and principal of the school, and six years later, enrolled over 120 students. During the early American republic period, hundreds of female academies sprang up throughout the nation in both cities and the countryside, proving that these institutions were becoming an important part of American life. The growing opportunity to earn an education helped redefine the role of women as it gave them the knowledge and skills to participate in American civil society.","Ricord designed her academic courses to teach students how to think and reason. The school offered basic courses like spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic, history, botany, philosophy, chemistry, algebra, geometry, rhetoric, and political economy. There was even a course specifically designed for preparing students for the “duties of society,” called Practical Knowledge. Ricord encouraged her students to “seek more lofty objects” and use their education in a constructive way. She also placed a special emphasis on religion and mental philosophy, as she was especially interested in these topics. Ricord and other teachers at the seminary believed it was very important for young women to develop strong morals. In fact, this was one of the main purposes for women to earn an education at Ricord’s seminary.","Ricord wrote there was an “uncommon degree of order, regularity, and moral rectitude” among the students. The laws of reason, conscience, and the Bible ruled the seminary. The middle-class women who graduated from these seminaries claimed to have “female moral superiority,” which influenced the way they engaged in civil society. Female seminaries during the early republic era helped cultivate the position of women as moral agents whose job was to raise virtuous children and teach them the ways of the Bible. After earning an education, many women became school teachers to fulfill this new role.","Female academies played a significant role in pushing women into the public sphere and helped them become active members in the developing civil society. Many of the women who graduated from these academies went on to become reformers and worked to help abolish slavery, to petition for women’s suffrage, to help feed the poor, and to combat men’s dominant role in politics.  The teachers in the female seminaries trained a new generation of women to be able to engage in politics and form individual opinions on local and national issues. Elizabeth Ricord’s commitment to educating women transformed the lives of her students and helped redefine the role of women in American society."," "],"display_date":"May 1829","search_date":"1829-05-16","locations":[{"id":8961,"lat":42.899208773,"lng":-77.359355699,"zoom":8,"place":"ONTARIO, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":642,"tag":"Civil Society"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":539,"tag":"Women's Seminaries"},{"id":552,"tag":"women's education"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Early American Republic","school":"Hobart and William Smith Colleges","course_id":35,"school_id":32}},{"id":4994,"title":"<strong>Resurrecting Madison's Vision, 200 Years Later</strong>","course_id":42,"status":"P","start_date":"5/20/92","end_date":"5/20/92","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It would seem that James Madison had risen from the grave. Or at least one of his 12 original Constitutional amendments had been resuscitated. With near unanimity (Senate: 99-0; House: 414-3) Congress showed its support for the Twenty-Seventh Amendment on May 20,1992. The Amendment prohibits adjustments to Congressional salaries from taking effect before an election intercedes. Yet the vote was largely meaningless, as earlier in the month Michigan had become the thirty-eighth state to ratify the proposal – thus giving it the three-quarters proportion needed to amend the Constitution. Six states originally ratified the proposal between 1789 and 1791; Ohio became the seventh in 1873. Only one other state (Wyoming, in 1978) would endorse it before a legislative aide in Texas named Gregory Watson stumbled across the amendment in 1982 and initiated a campaign for its revival. By 1988, a total of 25 states had ratified Madison's motion.","But had the 203 years between its proposal and ultimate adoption rendered the earliest states' approval invalid? No, according to Don Wilson, Archivist of the United States, who certified the Amendment's validity six days prior to the vote in Congress. (It has become practice recently for proposals to contain a sunset clause – typically seven years – but this was not the case with Madison's amendments.) And thus it became law. Although why – after having lain dormant for two centuries – should this proposal suddenly take on such importance?","There is a theory as to how “structural” amendments such as the Twenty-Seventh arise. An event triggers widespread awareness of a problem with how government works. In response, a coalition forms that amends the Constitution to resolve the problem. In 1989, Congress implemented pay raises that saw Senate salaries increase 14 percent – and House salaries go up 40 percent – by 1991. Over this same time frame, public confidence in Congress fell significantly. There was little public appetite for Congressional pay increases in the face of growing perceptions of arrogance and allegations of corruption against some members of Congress. It is no surprise then that the elections of 1990 and 1992 revealed strong anti-incumbent sentiments amongst the electorate. Combined with Watson's drive, this led 15 states (including the linchpin, Michigan) to endorse the resolution between 1989 and 1992, as a means of restoring some legitimacy to the governing institutions in the public’s eye. It is also why when Congress backed the resolution on May 20 – given it had no legal impact – the vote was seen as largely political.","The Twenty-Seventh Amendment has been described as amendment by “stealth,” given the lengthy delay between proposal and ratification. Nevertheless, it is an example of the tradition of using the constitution to correct a structural problem of government, one even the Founding Fathers recognized as an issue. “James Madison saw something wrong with members of Congress increasing their own salaries, unchecked by their constituencies...

Hummel, General Robert Edward Lee reflects on the Civil War and his role in helping heal the wounds between North and South in an attempt to mend the shattered Union.  In Lee’s own words he spoke of the South’s role in re-entering the Union, “What course I shall pursue I have not decided upon, and each man must be the judge of his own action.  We must all however resolve on one thing not to abandon our country.  Now more than at any other time, Virginia and every other state in the south needs us.  We must try and with as little delay as possible go to work to build up their prosperity.”  Lee further encouraged the south in its position toward peace with the North in stating, “To secure such a peace it was not only necessary that the south should abandon its arms, but abandon also all enmity and negative position, and accept with cheerful alacrity the changes of the time.”  Lee’s surrender at Appomattox ended the bloodiest war the U.S. has ever seen, and it is difficult to imagine that this task could have been carried out by a man with more honor and respect than General Lee. “Robert E. Lee had no bitter words for his former enemies.  By word and personal example, the general continued to lead the South—not to hatred and defiance but to reunion and reconciliation.”","                One of the most intriguing aspects of the interview was Hummel’s discussion on Lee’s indictment to the federal court of Norfolk for treason by President Andrew Johnson.  Proceedings for Lee’s indictment were stalled however due to General Grant’s demand that the charges be dropped arguing that treason charges would compromise the arrangements for surrender made at Appomattox.  Though revered by the nation after the Civil War, Robert E. Lee remained unscathed to the analyses and criticism of many historians.  In his book Lee Considered, Alan Nolan offers a different side to the Lee phenomena as if to emphasize that much of what is known about Lee has been recorded by historians and journalists biased toward the Confederate general.  Nolan offers a different approach to Lee's role in helping mend ties between north and south arguing that his role was in fact quite limited and insignificant.","Ever the gentleman, Lee earned the respect of his foes as well as the love of his officers and soldiers.  Hummel depicts a portrait of Lee in the aftermath of Appomattox by stating, “ All men admitted his high sense of honor, his unostentatious practice of all the Christian virtues, his true religious feeling, his calm endurance of untoward results, and his quiet observance of the duties of life.” "],"display_date":"April 9, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-09","locations":[{"id":13628,"lat":37.3722533013,"lng":-78.8121458288,"zoom":9,"place":"APPOMATTOX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":657,"tag":"Appamattox Court House"},{"id":656,"tag":"Robert E.

He was writing to Mary about the highly contested election for the Mayor of Greenville. This was something that Mary could not join in on simply because she was a woman, nonetheless it was very important to her and her community so she was excited to hear all about it."," ","Luther wrote that there was so much excitement downtown because of the election, and he included the African-Americans in his letter stating that, “the blacks became so much excited that they got to fighting among themselves some for Cleveland and some for Mr. Stradley”. It is interesting that he mentions this fact since this was one of the first elections that African-Americans could vote in after the implementation of the Fifteenth Amendment, yet there appears to be no friction between the whites and the African Americans. Luther goes on to say that since it had rained all day, this had kept some people from coming out and voting, primarily the older men of the community. There ended up being a two vote split between the two candidates, William C. Cleveland and Samuel Stradley, and Luther blamed that on the fact that they lost some of their voters due to the rain. Cleveland then claimed the election since he believed that “the students did not have a right to vote here and says he is going to have it contested and talking of carrying it to court”. The people gathered also started to consider fraud on all counts since they assumed that the election should have been an easy win for Cleveland.

Taylor says he has “scrupulously avoided any interference in the wars and contentions which have recently distracted Europe.” This was demonstrated in the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty signed by the United States and Great Britain.","President Taylor believed in a strong government banking system and wanted to express that the federal government should encourage agriculture, commerce and manufacturing.","Taylor's short term was dominated by the issue of slavery. Although a southern war hero who owned slaves, Taylor felt he needed to take a moderate issue on slavery. Although, he did not mince his words when talking about hanging anyone who broke the law. However, slavery does not appear as an issue in his address. The only way it comes up is when he mentions that people have been buying American-made boats in Brazil and using them for the slave trade. The idea behind The Compromise of 1850 was formulated during Taylor's time in office, yet he died while it was being debated.","Taylor was not a very effective president himself and most of the men he appointed were not very competent and effective either. Taylor, although running and winning as a Whig, did not completely suscribe to the Whig ideals and was not inclined to be a follower or puppet of the Whig Congress majority and it was that, combined with his own and his administration's effectiveness that caused his short presidency to be remembered mostly for his unusual death."],"display_date":"December 4, 1849","search_date":"1849-12-04","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":743,"tag":"Compromise of 1850"},{"id":742,"tag":"Inaugural Address"},{"id":741,"tag":"Taylor"},{"id":740,"tag":"President"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5083,"title":"Whigs: Nationalism &amp; Publication","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-06-01","end_date":"1846-06-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Although the Whig Party was already in trouble by the late 1840s, they remained vocal on a host of issues through print publications, such as <em>The American Whig Review.</em> One particular article of interest was written in June of 1846 and dealt with “Supply and demand,” which the author believed “must ever be the governing rule of prices.” The article also discussed how speculation ruins the equilibrium of the market. Interestingly, Whigs on the whole favored protective tariffs, which arguably interfere with the free market and supply-demand processes.","In the <em>Review</em>, the role of government was also discussed; building upon the Hamiltonian nationalist tradition, the Whigs largely argued against nullification. Daniel Webster’s performance in his debates with Robert Y. Hayne was applauded by the journal. One writer commented, “Mr. Webster might regard this achievement as the chief honor of his life.” Indeed, the Whigs drew upon nationalism for other topics of debate, not just nullification.","The rise and fall of the American Whig Party is a story which has been thoroughly documented and analyzed; its split over the issue of slavery is of particular interest to historians.

As such, especially in Washington DC, there has always been a battle between local identity and the identity of a nation. This was evidenced especially by Arthur Singleton, who ended up traveling across the United States and wrote predominantly about the growing identity of the new country. In his 1816 letter to his brother he captured his feelings about America, exclaiming “How enobling to be the feelings of an American president, to stand upon Capitol-Hill, and to cast his thoughts northward, and southward, and westward, over our vast and free continent, and to reflect that he is the chosen monarch of all he surveys, and whose right there is none to dispute.” His thoughts convey a sense of awe towards American national identity and seek to glorify its various institutions of law and governance.","Singleton uses a fairly constant and glorifying tone to describe America by stating so much as simple facts in a grandiose way. He writes that “The Federal City is nearly equidistant from the northern and southern extremities of the confederacy, from the cold Saint Croix, to the warm Sabine... yet is there but one vast expanse, one peopled tract, over which delegated parental domination extends.” He expresses physical facts in such a way and at such a time that he shows that he, at least, looks up to the state and sees it as something glorious and magnificent. Further, he showcases not only a form of nationalism, but a distinct one. Singleton writes disapprovingly about two times when George Washington met Congress – first, “it is said, he went on foot, in a plain domestic suit” and “the second year, he went in a costly foreign velvet dress.” The implication is that there is prominent European influence on America or that American culture is changing as a result of its rising prosperity. Further, the simplest explanation for Singleton’s discontent with Washington adopting European customs is the idea that America is somehow superior or “freer” than other states, which is supported throughout the text via the heavy use of simile.","This heavy emphasis on nationalism was not confined to Washington DC, however. Bart Bonikowsky explains that “Partisan conflict abated considerably in the [early] ... 19th century, giving way once again to a shared “national feeling”. As would be the case time and again throughout American history, the population was united by military conflict. The War of 1812 brought Americans together military service, [and] created animosities toward the British that matched those that had existed against the French.” Thus, the War of 1812 may have been one cause of the immense love for his country that Singleton writes about. This seems to make sense, especially given the fact that he wrote his letter just one year after the war of 1812 ended – the right time at which not only to capture the feeling of animosity towards the British during the war that persisted but to capture feelings of pride for America as a strong force.  As such, nationalism was strong in the years following the war and contributed to a self-image of greatness."],"display_date":"January 17, 1800 - September 15, 1816","search_date":"1808-05-17","locations":[{"id":15677,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":787,"tag":"Urban Life"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5219,"title":"United Textile Workers Ready to Strike","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"9/1/34","end_date":"9/1/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The textile workers had had enough. On September 1, 1934 at 11:30 p.m. they went on strike. Francis J. Gorman, Chairman of the National Special Strike Committee of the United Textile Workers of America, sent a telegraph to Alabama Governor Benjamin Miller to make him aware of the strike and the reasons behind it. Gorman reasoned that the workers themselves provided the authority for the strike and that it is a “result of abuses no longer bearable.” He listed several grievances of the textile workers and asked Governor Miller for the “protection which you are required to give all citizens.” Gorman sought protection from the “forces of employers” and, interestingly, “the insidious and disruptive forces of communism.” Gorman assured Miller that the strike will be “an orderly lawful and democratic procedure.” He concludes the telegram by requesting that the Governor ensure that they be treated fairly during the strike.","Historian Robert Ingalls discusses the plight of union workers and communist agitators in Birmingham during the 1930s. He asserts that the communists worked to provide equality between the classes and the races but were victims of the status quo. Big businesses, the employers Gorman feared, covertly promoted violence against communists in order to keep themselves in power. Ingalls writes that the communists wanted to improve workers’ rights and promote unions. Yet, in this telegram, Gorman spurned the communists. This is a unique perspective that historians have not fully studied. Ingalls acknowledges how the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People rejected any association with the communists, even as they attempted to help end racism and discrimination. However he doesn’t mention any tensions with unions. According to Ingalls, by 1934 Birmingham was “in the throes of strike fever.” He notes as labor unrest grew, so did anti-communist violence.  In fact, the crackdown caused some union spokesmen to argue that communists were being used as scapegoats to distract the public from the real cause of the strikes. Ingalls provides evidence that the communists and unions were on the same side yet this document opposes that belief. Perhaps pro-union men like Gorman simply did not like being associated with such an unfavorable group as the communists, even if they did share some beliefs.

It centered around Emerson Bentley, a white editor for a local newspaper called <em>The Landry Progress </em>and an influential schoolteacher who promoted the education of black children. Bentley wrote an article that local members of the Seymour Knights, a branch unit of the white supremacist group The Knights of the White Camellia, deemed offensive. The backlash to the article led three men to take the attempt to intimidate and severely cane Bentley, causing him to flee St. Landry. Local blacks were told that Bentley had been murdered and banded together to retaliate. While marching towards Opelousas with arms in hand, efforts were made to inform the freedmen that Bentley had not been murdered but escaped; causing some of the men to retreat, while others continued to march.","The freedmen were met by armed whites determined to defend their town. Shooting occurred by both sides and twenty-nine black prisoners were captured. On September 29, all of the captured prisoners, with the exception of two men, were taken from the prison and executed. The violence at Opelousas continued for weeks to come. The death toll of the massacre resulted in some controversy. Three white Radical Republicans and two Democrats were killed in the assault. Republicans stated that around 200-300 blacks where killed whereas the Democrats denied this claim as fraudulent and stated that only twenty-five to thirty were killed. Historians today have deduced that the Republicans were more correct in their number range.","The Freedman’s Bureau ordered Lieutenant Lee to investigate the atmosphere of Opelousas. In an article written on October 8, Lee described the cause of the riot and the death count. He gave a low estimate in regards to the number of blacks killed, stating that only five died, but expressed his opinion that the death toll would increase due to blacks being unwilling to give up their arms to whites. Ultimately, Lee was positive in his reports, he believed that peace had been restored overall and stated, “no further trouble is apprehended.”","The end of the Civil War resulted in widespread violence in the South due to racial and political tensions. A majority of newly freed African Americans strongly supported the Republican Party, angering prominent southern Democrats. The inability to accept racial equality led to the growth of white supremacist groups, the most noteworthy being the Ku Klux Klan. White radicals sought to silence African Americans and those who supported them through various scare tactics and physical violence, such was the case at Opelousas.","Historian Carolyn DeLatte argued that the white Southerners acted in the same manner that they had for many years. This time, however, “the vengeance visited upon the Negroe population was greater, as blacks were no longer protected by any consideration of their monetary value.” The riot echoed its influence in the political as well as social arena, where whites bounded together to protect their rights from black infringement, and blacks stepped away from their right to vote in order to evade persecution."],"display_date":"September 28, 1868 -

Gantt spoke to his fellow citizens of Arkansas, but also to all of the citizens of the South in his 1863 address.  The message in this address is that the Confederacy was fighting a war that they could never win and that the southern states would have more power and property if they would just return to the Union.  The General blamed several of the problems in the Confederacy on Jefferson Davis, for whom he had little respect.  He described Davis as “Cold, selfish, and supremely ambitious.”  Gantt also pointed out that the Confederacy was not sufficient in terms of foreign policy and he called Davis’s ideas “a stupid failure.”","Gantt urged those in the South at the time to give up the fight and return to the Union.  He felt that surrender was sometimes the best option and that southerners should look past ideas of humiliation.  He explained his reasoning by saying, “Our armies are melting and ruin approaches us.  Will continuing this struggle help us?”  The General also felt that the North had too much invested in the war to give up the fight and that it was foolish of southerners to think that they ever will.","Gantt sought to reason with citizens of the South by claiming that, “Each day makes new graves, new orphans, and new mourners.  Each hour flings into this dreadful whirlpool of wrecked hopes, broken fortunes, and anguished hearts.”  He also explained that, “Negro slavery has accomplished its mission here,” in an attempt to show southern whites that slavery was not something that could continue to be sustainable.","The most interesting thing about E.W. Gantt was that he had been an ardent supporter of the secessionist movement prior to the war.  Even before the secession of the southern states Gantt proclaimed, “My life, my all, and laying them upon her altar, offering them up freely in defense of her insulted honor, wounded pride, and priceless freedom.”  It is interesting to hear Gantt’s thoughts about the South prior to the war and his decision to become a Union loyalist.","Despite Gantt’s pre-war beliefs it is apparent that he would stick to his newfound Unionist ideology.  He became the Arkansas state prosecutor for the Little Rock Reconstruction authorities.  The former General also served as a supervisor for the Freedman’s Bureau in Southwest Arkansas from 1865 to 1866.   Gantt ended his life working on a state law digest for Arkansas for which he was appointed by the Governor to complete.","Bruce S.

After the surrender of the Confederacy, Breckinridge feared the possibility of the Union bringing charges against him for his participation in the rebellion. To escape potential prosecution, Breckinridge fled to Havana, Cuba. From Cuba, he traveled to the United Kingdom, and then to Canada, where he wrote this letter in Niagara, Ontario.","Breckinridge did not mean the focus of his letter to revolve around his post-war travels. Instead, he meant to inquire about his “faithful colored servant, Thomas.” Despite the fact that Thomas had been a slave and servant to Breckinridge, the former master spoke of his servant in a fond manner. He seemed nostalgic when he wrote of his and Thomas’s parting before Breckinridge left for the U.K. Neither of the men seemed happy about the parting, but Breckinridge thought it best for Thomas to return home. “I succeeded in sending him back to his friends from Havana, although he wished to remain with me.” According to Breckinridge, Thomas felt such loyalty to his master that he promised to once again live with Breckinridge upon his return to the United States.","This letter penned by Breckinridge to “a gentleman” in Columbus unusual in two respects. Some instances were recorded during the Civil War of slaves remaining with their masters after emancipation; however, the extreme loyalty that Thomas possessed towards Breckinridge was not the norm. While impossible to verify, the devotion from Thomas that Breckinridge wrote of, if true, was an exceptional relationship between and servant. Thomas only left Breckinridge’s side at his insistence.","The location of the letter’s composition also made it unique. Men having served in the Confederate Army were known to have left for other countries after the war. Most, however, did not flee to Canada as Breckinridge did. While Canada was not the first sanctuary Breckinridge found, his relocation to it was uncommon. Many Confederates that left the U.S. immigrated to Mexico and others to Brazil. Brazil served as an appealing option because the country still permitted slavery at the time. The United Kingdom, which Breckinridge did travel to, was also a much more popular destination than Canada for Confederate expatriates."],"display_date":"January 24, 1869","search_date":"1869-01-24","locations":[{"id":2102,"lat":32.5099595434,"lng":-84.8770433037,"zoom":10,"place":"MUSCOGEE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":1147,"tag":"John C.

To do so, they needed to relocate to areas that were less populated than the North. Despite their admiration for South Carolina’s “lands and climate,” northerners feared living in the state, because of the potential violence. During this time, South Carolina began enacting black codes to restrict the freedoms and movements of freedmen. Northerners believed it to be only a matter of time until blacks started protesting the laws. While other states in the South enacted similar codes, these northerners thought South Carolina’s to be the harshest. Because of this, they chose to settle in the northwest rather than the South.","White residents of South Carolina did not believe the state had a lack of migrants due to the black codes. Instead, they expressed the opinion that white northerners were apprehensive to live among such a large number of free blacks. A writer for the <em>Nashville Press </em>article vehemently denounced this claim. “It is not true white immigrants will not go where there are negro laborers, or where there is negro competition. The sole condition of immigration is embraced in the word security.”","For these settlers, the number one concern was safety. They believed that as long as the codes were in effect, security could never exist in the state. Settlers, or emigrants, were not the ones negatively affected by the codes. They found suitable land for their intended purposes in other parts of the country. The people who the codes hurt, the article argued, were the residents of South Carolina. As long as the black codes were in place, immigration would not occur. If the codes were abolished, there would be “unprecedented progress of the South” as a result of new settlement.","South Carolina began passing black codes immediately following the war. The state ratified a constitution in 1865 that forbade blacks from voting. In order to prevent blacks from combating the laws, South Carolina set up racial restrictions for entering office. This way, no black person could enter South Carolina’s legislature and attempt to do away with the codes.","Besides preventing blacks to enter political office, the black codes in South Carolina stopped freedmen from becoming an “artisan, mechanic, or shopkeeper” without the proper license from a judge. This license cost more than $100, making it unlikely a free black could afford one. Perhaps the most restrictive of all parts of the codes, was the section that limited black migration to the state. If a black person moved to South Carolina, he or she was required within twenty days to enter into a contract and bond to a white master."],"display_date":"December 8, 1865","search_date":"1865-12-08","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"},{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":366,"tag":"Migration"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":477,"tag":"Black Codes"},{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"},{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5349,"title":"Freedmen and Republicans Murdered in New Orleans","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-07-30","end_date":"1866-07-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The New Orleans Riot occurred on July 30, 1866 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Whites instigated the riot and targeted freedmen. However, this riot was different from those of its time because it centered primarily on disagreements regarding Reconstruction policies. Radical Republicans were unhappy with former Confederates gaining power and influence under Governor Wells. Wells himself eventually noticed the power shift and became uncomfortable with it as well. In 1866 the legislature of Louisiana called new elections, allowing for a former Confederate mayor to regain his title. The state legislature overturned Wells’ veto. As a result, Wells gave his support to a Radical plan to reassemble the constitutional convention that occurred in 1864. The Radical plan would grant power to blacks, prevent former Confederates from voting, and lay the foundation for a modified state government for Louisiana.","Those opposed to the idea of Louisiana becoming a “revolutionized” state, the city police force of New Orleans, which was comprised of Confederate veterans, was supposed to maintain order during the convention but supported the opponents of Radicals. On July 30, twenty-five delegates and 200 black supporters, consisting primarily of former veterans, convened in New Orleans. When the two sides met, fighting broke out followed by gunshots. The delegates took cover in the convention hall. Those who tried to escape were immediately shot, the white flags they held in their hands as a sign of surrender were ignored. The total death toll consisted of thirty-four blacks and three white Radicals to be killed. Around 100 people were injured in the riot.","The <em>New York Times</em> described the event as a dispute between angry radicals and thugs, the police force, describing them as, “unprincipled scoundrels, thirsting for blood, whose every moral sensibility had been blunted by lives of desperados, were maddened to informal rage by injudicious harangues from men who follow in the stormy wake of Sumner and Stevens.” Republicans reported that the death toll was around 200 men, a fact in which the article questioned.  The Military Commission went  in to investigate the riot and the <em>Times </em>argued that the instigators would be deemed guilty due to the close allegiance that members of the Commission had with the Radicals.","Historian Eric Foner argued the significance of the New Orleans riot, stating, that it completely took away any hope of Presidential Reconstruction in Louisiana. Supposedly, before the riot occurred, the local military commander stationed at New Orleans warned the President of the violence that would occur if the convention happened. Johnson did not adequately prepare for the violence or take the warning to heart. Foner summed up the New Orleans Riot, stating, “But the stark fact remained that nearly all the victims had been blacks and convention delegates, and that the police, far from preserving order, had joined in the assault.”"],"display_date":"July 30, 1866","search_date":"1866-07-30","locations":[{"id":5599,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5350,"title":"Attorney General William on Enforcement Acts","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1875-04-02","end_date":"1875-04-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Colfax massacre of 1872, believed to be the most devastating occurrence of racial violence during Reconstruction, resulted in the death of around 150 freedmen at the hands of white supremacists. The events at Colfax resulted in only three men to convicted. However, disagreement led to the case entering the Supreme Court in the form of <em>United States v. Cruikshank </em>in 1876. The case brought in to question the constitutionality of the Enforcement Acts. It questioned if the federal government had the jurisdiction to enforce these acts on the state level.","The Enforcement Acts were issued in 1870 and 1871; they sought to prevent intimidation of voters and discrimination based on one’s skin color. The Acts also issued specific crimes committed by the Ku Klux Klan as federal offenses and those who committed them would be punished based on federal standards. Many white Southerners believed the Enforcement Acts were a violation of State’s rights. During the <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank </em>Supreme Court case, Attorney General Williams argued that the Enforcement Acts were necessary to protect the right to vote for African Americans. Williams argued that government could not exist without votes from its citizens, and as citizens, African Americans deserve the opportunity to cast their vote. He stated, “If Congress has no power to protect the voters, then the White League of Louisiana, a minority of the people, can stand around the polls and prevent the majority from voting.”","The results of <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank</em> were devastating for those in support of the Enforcement Act. The men were charged with using their power to halt African Americans from voting. However, the government did not charge them with using race as a motive in the massacre. The error in wording resulted in the three men to going free, leaving no one held responsible for the horrific massacre against the freedmen.","The Court went further to state that the federal government only had the right to prohibit the violations of black rights in states only, they did not hold the power for punishing criminal acts committed by individuals, the state and local authority held this right. Historian Eric Foner commented, “In the name of federalism, the decision rendered national prosecution of crimes committed against blacks virtually impossible, and gave a green light to acts of terror where local officials either could not or would not enforce the law.” The devastating result of <em>U.S. v. Cruikshank</em>, allowed acts of violence against freedmen and republicans to escalate in the following years because of the inability of the federal government to try individuals."],"display_date":"April 2, 1875","search_date":"1875-04-02","locations":[{"id":1277,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5352,"title":"Display of the Confederate Flag in Richmond Sparks Anger in Congress","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-02-17","end_date":"1867-02-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 17, 1867 the <em>New York Times</em> reported on an act of reoccurring rebelliousness that happened within the city of Richmond, Virginia.  The incident that sparked all of the emotion was the display of the Confederate Flag during an event within the city.  Members of Congress and other Union loyalists decided that this act of rebelliousness proved that some of the southern states such as Virginia were, “utterly unfit for reconstruction” and that “the rebellious spirit still lived and raged in the South.”","Many called for legislation that would put the southern states under complete military rule.  The article went on to explain that the incident in question was actually just two young boys, one white and one black, pretending to be soldiers with an old faded flag that did not resemble that of the Confederate battle flag.

Unlike other paramilitary groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and the Knights of the White Camellia, the White League attempted to garner the sympathy of the southern news media. While the White League in its original form no longer exists today, its use of force aided in contributing to Southern legislatures being run by southern whites just as they had been prior to the Civil War."],"display_date":"November 3, 1880","search_date":"1880-11-03","locations":[{"id":5508,"lat":32.7325690363,"lng":-91.2350753374,"zoom":9,"place":"EAST CARROLL, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5395,"title":"National Women's Rights Convention: Maria Varney's letter emphasizing natural rights","course_id":81,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-10-20","end_date":"1850-10-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 23, 1850 the first annual National Women’s Rights Convention commenced in Worcester Massachusetts. For two days more then a thousand women and men from eleven different states listened to speakers. The speakers emphasized the right to vote, to own property, to be admitted to higher education and to choose their occupation or profession. Newspaper reporters from all over attended, but the majority of the press coverage the convention received was derisive and scornful. The criticism did not hurt the convention, but rather brought attention to it on a national level and built support for the movement.","Maria L. Varney wrote a letter to the National Convention of Women’s Rights in Worcester, Massachusetts. The letter expressed her regrets for being unable to attend the convention and put forth a few fundamental propositions about women’s rights. Her argument is founded on two principles. First, all people have certain inalienable rights including: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And second, women are human beings. Therefore, women are entitled to a right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. She declared that a right to life implies “not only a right to the means of a livelihood, but a right to <em>one’s own person and property</em>.” And that a right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness implies “a choice of location, occupation, and self-government.” Varney concluded that any law that violates these rights of <em>people</em>, male and female, is unjust and must be immediately repealed. In order to be just and fair the government and laws must be blind to gender.","Varney’s emphasis on natural rights reflected the fact that ideas about who could claim such rights had been expanding and evolving since the American Revolution. The language of natural rights first identifies with the Declaration of Independence. While the Declaration of Independence specified Man, only ten years later, in1787, the language in the Constitution is gender-neutral, using the term “person.” In 1792 Mary Wollstonecraft wrote <em>A Vindication of the Right’s of Women</em>, in which she builds off of the principle of natural rights. She claimed that because natural rights are given by God they are universal and inherent to all people and therefore undeniable. The authors of the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments followed the same pattern and adapted the Declaration of Independence in 1848 at the Seneca Falls convention. They applied it specifically to women’s rights. By the early nineteenth century some of women’s civil liberties were recognized. This is important because it acknowledged that women are human beings who possessed rights. By recognizing that women were entitled to certain rights and that the government had a responsibility to protect the women’s rights, the government inadvertently acknowledged that women were separate and distinct individuals in the eyes of the law."],"display_date":"October 20, 1850","search_date":"1850-10-20","locations":[{"id":1176,"lat":41.0633875895,"lng":-73.4206530083,"zoom":9,"place":"FAIRFIELD, Connecticut"}],"tags":[{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":81,"school_id":2}},{"id":5587,"title":"Sumner Takes Command of The Department of The Pacific","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-03-22","end_date":"1861-04-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["With hostilities breaking out between Confederate and Union forces in the east, a secessionist uprising in California was feared.  In command of the U.S. Army’s Department of The Pacific, was Col. Albert S. Johnston; an adopted Texan with questionable loyalties. Believing that Johnston posed a risk to Union control in California, General Winfield Scott dispatched Brigadier General E. V. Sumner to replace Johnston as the commanding officer on the Pacific coast.  On March 22, 1861 General Scott wrote to Sumner “Prepare to sail from New York the first of next month to relieve Bvt. Brig.-Gen [A.S.] Johnston, in the command of the Pacific department…” Scott also decided to keep the orders confidential and followed with “The order to sail, ect., will reach you by next mail, but will remain unpublished till you are on the Pacific Ocean, for confidential reasons.”  Despite the secrecy of Sumner’s deployment, word of his coming reached San Francisco a day ahead of him; this did not produce the uprising that Union authorities feared, but allowed Johnston to submit his resignation from the Army.","Upon his arrival in San Francisco Sumner issued the following statement: “In compliance with special order No. 86, dated War Department, Adjunct-General’s Office, Washington, March 23, 1861, I hereby assume command of the this department. All concerned will govern themselves accordingly.”  In a letter to Washington, Sumner described the command being turned over “in good order.” Sumner also commented that even after issuing his resignation, Johnston “continued to hold command, and was carrying out the orders of the government.”  Johnston’s actions were professional and in accordance with the orders of his superiors. It did not appear that he was in anyway prey to his southern sympathies.","While Johnston made no actions towards supporting secessionists in the region, the movement was there and it was a threat to Union control. In his work <em>Frontier Service during the War of The Rebellion</em>, George H. Pettis writes that secessionists were moving to take control of governmental property across San Francisco, ultimately using the military stores in the city to defeat the loyalist citizens.  Pettis claimed that is was the unannounced arrival of Sumner that dashed this plan, forcing the secessionists to delay, and then give up after Sumner consolidated western forces to fortify San Francisco.","Though there was a Secessionist plot afoot in San Francisco, Sumner reported to Washington that there was “a strong Union feeling with the majority of the people of this state.” He claimed that though a minority, the secessionists were “the more active and zealous party, which [gave] them more influence than they ought to have for their numbers.”  Despite the actions and schemes of the confederate sympathizers, California remained fully in support of the Union cause.  Johnson, however, was later named commander of the Confederacy’s western theater; and viewed as one of the best Confederate generals in the war, before he died at the battle of Shiloh."],"display_date":"March 22, 1861 - April 28, 1861","search_date":"1861-04-09","locations":[{"id":967,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":10,"place":"SAN FRANCISCO, California"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":715,"tag":"Military"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5559,"title":"California Opposes Slavery on Grounds of Social Idleness","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-05-12","end_date":"1850-09-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By the late 1840s American feelings on slavery smoldered.  According to historian James McPherson, the southern states were pushing for a pro-slavery constitution in California, and western slavery not just as an abstraction, but as a legitimate southern goal.  As the debate raged in congress over the admittance of California as a free or slave state, the Californians in San Francisco had all but settled the issue for themselves. The May 24, 1848 issue of the<em> Californian,</em> a newspaper out of San Francisco, published an article expressing local views on slavery; “Wherever slavery exists it is invariably accompanied with a supineness and stagnation of the vital blood of a nation, consequent upon the prevalence of the short-sighted idea that to work for a living is ungentlemanly.”  The population of California had largely lived under Mexican rule, under which slavery had been outlawed for some time. The previously Mexican population, combined with a lack of major immigration from southern states, yielded a territory in which free labor was the dominate system.  Not only did slavery not develop in California, the working Californians held a resistance to the institution, which considered physical labor the domain of slaves, and not of gentlemen.","The<em> Californian</em> continued to attack the institution of slavery, holding it responsible for a perceived lack of southern motivation: “Take, for example, the state of Georgia, one of the best lumber regions in the United States. Thousands of pine trees are rotting in her forests, while the lumber used in house-building is imported from Maine.” In the author’s view, the unmotivated whites in southern states made up a “class of ‘unproductive consumers,’” that was “fearfully large.”","The labor system in the North was much more akin to the ranch and farm life in southern California and the mines in the northern part of the territory.  This similarity, in contrast to the clash with southern values, helped firmly place California’s ties with the northern states and the free labor system.","Like many free states, California’s resistance to slavery did not stem from a moral stance, as much as from a desire to protect free labor.  According to historian David Lavender the legislators banned slavery as much because they were opposed to the idea of free men working beside blacks as they were against the institution of slavery.  He also reported that several of the state-makers considered barring all blacks from the state, free or slave.","In 1850 congress settled the debate over California through the famed compromise of that year, in which the South was pacified with a new and tougher Fugitive Slave Act, and the reorganization of Utah and New Mexico into territories that could determine whether or not they would allow slavery on their own.  However, California was admitted to the Union as a free state, a state that reflected the opinions of its people, not a State brought into the Union as a simple means of balancing power between two competing factions."],"display_date":"May 12, 1848 - September 20, 1850","search_date":"1849-07-16","locations":[{"id":15203,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"TERRITORY, Territory"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5601,"title":"The “Me” Generation: How Shirley Chisholm, Harvey Milk and the Weathermen Fought Against the 1970's Fantasy of Perfection","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The 1970's became fertile ground for public outrage and violence against the American establishment due to national economic stress, assassinations of public figures, the Vietnam War, and other political scandals. By the 70's it seemed to a significant amount of Americans, that what the government wanted to portray and what they were realistically taking care of were two very different truths. What the U.S. wanted American society to consist of were upper middle class or rich white individuals (preferably male) with conservative, Judeo-Christian beliefs. That these people would pray and worship a God that often times were one and the same as the American government. The ideology of the American mentality included not just a warped view of a uniquely American religious stance, but a stance where all Americans should be the same and think the alike. Where there was no poverty, no back talking or disagreeing with the government and everybody was heterosexual with one wife and their 2.5 children living in suburbia. And if in fact, “those” types of people did exist Americans should do everything in their power to either push them aside or make them disappear completely. The American government did not want or feel that they needed blacks with opinions let alone a black woman making her way through Congress. America only saw the “sin” in the power that the gay community and its leaders held in California. And when America was tired of minorities of all kinds, it was looking towards a vibrant, educated white youth to carry the torch, what they got instead were empowered white kids enraged by a government unwilling to pull out of Vietnam. While America was working hard towards a “Me” generation where the majority's problems did not matter and a fantasy of “what ifs” was put in its place, there were several, gutsy individuals and groups desperately trying to break that mold.","In 1972, Shirley Chisholm, the ultimate physical symbol fighting against the ideals of a “Me” generation, became the first African-American woman running as part of a major-party candidacy for the Democratic ticket and nomination of President of the United States. In the 1970's, America was overflowing with an ignorance towards racial divides although physical, up close and sometimes violent proof stated the opposite that things in fact were not alright. Her running came during a time where racial tension was high and what was considered an equal and fair opportunity for all held different feelings and definitions for both blacks and whites. The backdrop of her run was politically marked by examples of attempted equality like the Voting Rights Act which created an effort to integrate race relations in the South and outlaw voting discrimination against African-Americans and the Civil Rights Act which outlawed major discrimination against minorities. But what the United States wanted to project and achieve was not the social reality of what seemed to be a very bleak existence of blacks dealing with unemployment rates three times higher than whites and black anger increasing with the establishment of black militant organizations such as the Black Panther Party. Her very physical being, went against what made the American government and a dominating white society comfortable. She was a woman and she was black, to put both of those “concepts” together was a whole complex and intense conundrum for the American people to deal with. On the one hand she explains how entering into Congress for the first time, the white Congressmen had never had a black woman enter into their political platform and she was automatically shunned. On the other, even among black groups and the black community she was shun due to black men being intimidated and threatened by the fact that she was a woman. To bring that together and give her an intelligent mind and voice to state what was wrong with American society and give her a national platform on which to speak, broke the mold of a society with a “it's all about me” mentality to realize there was great unjust among blacks and sometimes equal discrimination against women. So what she needed black Americans to do, especially black women, in such a time of confusion and hardships was to go against the grain as she had done and use their power to fight not physically or violently but to use what many whites dreaded...their vote. She brought to the forefront what was not being said in Congress, that over 50% of the nation's budget (her estimate was 75%) was being used on a foreign, immoral war yet the true war raged on domestically with a nation divided amongst itself.","Unlike Shirley Chisholm, who was a more obvious example for minority groups that made white people uncomfortable, was the less obvious Harvey Milk. At first glance he is who the American government and society wanted to continue to uplift. He was a financially comfortable, white male, a veteran from the U.S. navy, running his own business in a middle class neighborhood. However his ideals and sexuality both directly and indirectly did not line up with what society was supposed to be like. Harvey Milk was a gay man which in and of itself went against the traditional Judeo-Christian idealism of America. To make matters worse, he was also the first openly gay politician in San Francisco which also went against what American society. What society wanted and expected was if a person was indeed gay, he or she should keep it themselves because to be gay in the 1970's was taboo and illegal. In the backdrop of the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York which set off the modern, openly gay liberation movement, Harvey Milk would become a main leader in San Francisco's newly gay political community. But America did not want to deal with gay people they in fact wanted to get rid of them with political bills such as Proposition 6, which was a state wide gesture that allowed the firing of any teacher in public schools who was gay and any other public school faculty that was pro-gay. Milk fought against such openly discriminative political documents but wanted to make it clear that while he fought for gays, lesbians and transgendered/transsexual peoples, his political fight was for all peoples who were considered minorities and were underrepresented in San Francisco. He said what so many Americans at the time were afraid to speak of which was the realization that gays walked among them and no, they did not have signs written on their foreheads to let others know of their whereabouts, so the American people needed to learn to have respect and tolerance for all no matter who they came across. Milk's perfect example of the political and religious agenda set against gay Americans came in an interview where he said that he understood who he was up against but that the “white, wealthy, non-gay establishment would have to deal with him; that is truly an incredible and powerful position to be in.” Harvey Milk and his political position would not allow an ignorant mentality to continue to place its hold over the minds of the American people but wanted instead to change what Americans felt so uncomfortable with concerning gays in the first place. Although he was assassinated in 1978 by another San Francisco city supervisor, Dan White, his ideals would leave a permanent mark in California, especially in the San Francisco area. This mark would go on to change the political ideals, when a decade after Milk's assassination, a poll would show that San Francisco's gay community felt that they had a “moderate amount” or “a lot” of influence over local government compared to only 48% of the straight respondents who believed the same sentiment. And only two years prior to that poll, a gay San Francisco columnist wrote, “Politicians can be destroyed by the gay vote. As long as we keep our vote, they're going to kiss our ass for a long time.”","Probably the most confusing to the American government and public was the formation of the Weather Underground also known as the Weathermen. They were a part of the anti-draft and anti-war movement of the late 60's to mid 70's with extremist views that believed in “bringing the war home” by bombing banks and government buildings. Their ultimate goal was to overtake and overthrow the U.S. government due to their refusal to pull out of the Vietnam War and their abuse towards blacks. What made them so confusing to the American public was because of what they stood for due to who they were. They were not black like Shirley Chisholm nor were they gay (for the most part, not including their sexual experimentation with the same sex during orgies) like Harvey Milk, trying to organize a type of LGBT rights organization. These were mainly upper middle class college students with rich parents (some of those parents were even local politicians) who basically had the world at their feet and if they wanted to live a comfortable lifestyle, they could very well do so. There only real issue was being drafted into the Vietnam War but even if that happened with the connections and the money there parents had they were more than likely to gain “cushy” jobs that did not require front line action. Unlike their poorer, black, Hispanic, and Asian counterparts who constituted more than 80% of American ground troops. So what was there problem? They had everything they wanted and they were everything that the U.S. wanted to portray their young people as. The U.S. did not want to deal with underprivileged, ethnic youths, but who they wanted ended up being the kind of people that constituted the Weathermen. As President Nixon continued to ignore the peoples cry that the conflict in Vietnam was immoral and unjust, the Weathermen, once a non-violent group who took after the teachings of peaceful demonstrations from Martin Luther King Jr. were now taking after the Black Panther Party, sharing in their anger and setting up recruitment just like them and even supporting them by endorsing them to the mass public. Their point was not to do the complete opposite of what was expected of these young white kids just for the sake of rebelling but because this white ideology was destroying the nation. They were going to side with the black community and they refused to allow their privileges as whites to add to the problem in America anymore. It was hard for Americans to understand the terrorist actions of other Americans bombing their own buildings but the message behind these attacks were not just for the sake of blowing up a building it was to get people in the U.S. to realize that this was not just a foreign war that did not effect them unless they were drafted, but that if they refused to stop the war then indeed it did effect them because they were part of the problem. And the problem was very much real no matter how much Americans wanted to ignore it with companies such as Dow Chemical, for example, using technological and chemical warfare like napalm, used to kill innocent and impoverished Vietnamese. Or the U.S. government breaking and entering into one of the leaders of the Black Panthers home, Fred Hampton, and assassinating him in his bed while he slept. These were kids who were angry with what their white government was doing both to its own people and internationally; kids who were willing to recruit white youth to join in, taking down what many would say as their “own” people (other whites). The Weathermen were trying to put the issue of what was going on in the faces of Americans first by peaceful marches and when the problem only escalated domestically and internationally, they felt they had no choice but to show them a tiny part of the violence occurring in Vietnam by turning to domestic terrorism. The acts they committed were only a physical embodiment of their ideals which as one of the faces of the Weathermen, Bernardine Dohrn stated, “I believe that there will come a day when white people will have to make uncomfortable decisions and learn to side with the Vietnamese and Black people.”","The United States in the 1970's has been argued to be a “Me” generation and while it did strive hard to get there and in many ways and areas of the country it was, there was a much stronger argument for all of the things that went wrong. As the nation continued on a one noted idea of what it wanted to be and portray to what they believed to be a corrupt world, the American people were becoming excessively bothered by a communism induced paranoia the country held. Since that was its main focus everything and everyone else fell by the wayside. What the people needed was stronger leadership and a sense of an empathetic community so that all might understand each other and gain an equal political foothold. So people with a voice, whether they had extreme views like the Weathermen or more subdued ways to fight like Shirley Chisholm and Harvey Milk rose to power not because they were trying to divide or disrupt the country as many thought (including the government) but to stop the advancement of a country that had let its people down and were allowing them to believe, on top of all the problems they had, that they were a perfect society at the center of a very inferior world."," "],"display_date":1970,"search_date":"1970-07-02","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":34924,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"}],"tags":[{"id":546,"tag":"Homosexuality"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":1556,"tag":"Anti War"},{"id":1554,"tag":"Vietnam War"},{"id":1557,"tag":"Terrorism"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5618,"title":"<strong>The Murder of Senator Benjamin Franklin Randolph</strong>","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-10-17","end_date":"1868-10-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Benjamin Franklin Randolph was born a freeman in Kentucky in 1820.  He graduated from Oberlin College and became an ordained minister.  After college, he joined the U.S. Colored Troops and served as a chaplain.  B.F.

Harding as one of the worst U.S. presidents, he was a very modern and innovative thinker even before becoming president.  His presidential campaign in 1920 is a prime example of this.  What historically has been called his “front porch” campaign captured the imagination of the public.  It was the first campaign to be heavily covered by the press, receive widespread newsreel coverage and use the power of Hollywood and Broadway stars.      Movie Stars, conservative businessmen and common folks traveled to Marion, Ohio for photo opportunities with Harding and his wife.  Big name public figures such as Al Jolson, Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Douglas Fairbanks, Harvey Firestone and Mary Pickford were among the many celebrities to travel to his home from across the country.","Considered handsome and very photogenic, the campaign drew upon Harding’s popularity with the women and more than a few Republicans thought with his looks and his charm would attract enough women voters to win the election.  However, it was Harding’s support for women’s suffrage in the Senate that actually made him extremely popular with women.  The ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in August 1920 brought huge crowds of women to Marion, Ohio to hear Harding.  This would be the first election in which women voted.","Having won the Republican Party nomination on his wholesomeness, common folk attitude and good looks, Harding’s campaign was seen as having a distinguished presidential profile.  The Republican Party platform condemned the Wilson administration for its handling of World War I and opposed the League of Nations.  Sensing the nation’s fatigue, Harding used the slogan “A Return to Normalcy” throughout his front-porch campaign. Given that “return to normalcy” is a Harding cliché made-up by him when he should have used the word normality, this “return to normalcy” phrase is still used today by many in the political world. Deciding that he liked the sound of the word, he made “Return to Normalcy” a recurring theme in his campaign.  Harding promised to return the nation to more normal times – i.e., renewed isolationism in reaction to World War I, a resurgence of nativism and a turning away from government activism of the reform era.","On election night November 2, 1920, which by the way was Harding’s 55<sup>th</sup> birthday, the first commercial radio broadcast coverage of election returns was heard.  Radio broadcasts and commercials ushered in a new style of campaigning and reached a wider audience – radio had become a new political medium. Harding won the presidential election in a massive landslide victory and became the twenty-ninth president of the United States. It is interesting to note that he carried the state of Tennessee – the first time a formerly Confederate state voted Republican since Reconstruction ended.  Even though Harding followed one of the most visionary of all our Presidents, Woodrow Wilson, it is important to note that Harding also brought revolutionary ideas and invoked his era’s technological expertise to use on the campaign trail.  While Harding’s presidency will always be remembered for the first election in which women voted, his presidency helped bring calm and serenity to our nation in a tumultuous time."],"display_date":"June - November 1920","search_date":"1920-08-31","locations":[{"id":20723,"lat":40.5872658903,"lng":-83.1608707945,"zoom":10,"place":"Marion, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5679,"title":"<strong>Top Dog at the White House</strong>","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"3/5/21","end_date":"3/5/21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though there were many presidential pets before him, Laddie Boy was the first celebrity White House pet.  Few people realize that Laddie Boy, President Warren G.

With all this attention, Laddie Boy was named the official presidential pet.  He was treated like a king and even had his own caregiver who gave the dog daily baths.","Laddie Boy was so beloved nationwide that the Newsboys’ Association asked every newspaper delivery boy in the country to donate one penny to a special fund to build a statue of Laddie Boy.  In all, nineteen thousand one hundred thirty-four pennies were collected and melted down.  Laddie Boy’s likeness, made from the copper in the pennies, still stands in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C."],"display_date":"March 5, 1921","search_date":"1921-03-05","locations":[{"id":21755,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5693,"title":"Three Tribes Confederate for Peace","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-10-21","end_date":"1867-10-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The chiefs and headmen of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Indian tribes met with the United States commissioners, such as Nathaniel G. Taylor and William S. Harney, in Kansas to seal their tribes’ fate in America on October 21, 1867. The United States government referred to the Treaty with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache as a peace treaty, but in reality it forced the tribes to conform to the wills and regulations set forth by the United States government. The treaty demanded that the three Indian tribes confederate and “to be placed, in every respect, upon an equal footing.” The three tribes merged together and were required “to accept as their permanent home the reservation described in the aforesaid treaty” and “to pledge themselves to make no permanent settlement at any place, nor on any lands, outside of said reservation.” All aspects of life on the reservation had to be equally shared and distributed such as clothes, jobs, school buildings, teachers, and the educational system. The United States government required the Indians to keep peace with the white men and every citizen under the jurisdiction of the United States government. This treaty also stated that by signing this treaty this treaty, the Indian tribes “give up and forever relinquish to the United States all rights, privileges, and grants now vested in them, or intended to be transferred to them.” The people of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes gave up their culture, independence, and their tribes’ futures when they signed this treaty.","In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, the United States government did not allow Indian tribes to practice their own culture, live freely, and the government did not believe that Indians should be privileged with the common rights of citizens of the United States of America. The government rejected Indians as citizens of the United States. This is evident because the treaty of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache tribes forced the tribes to assimilate with one another and live as if they had always been one uniformed, equal tribe. The Indians’ daily lives were completely changed, and every aspect of their lives was under direct control of the United States government, especially the Native Americans’ educational system. Although this educational system set forth by the government was presented as a gift and a privilege, it is evident that it wasn’t very advantageous, and the educational system did not put the Native Americans’ needs first.","The historian David Adams shows that in reality, these educational institutions created on Native American reservations intended to completely restructure the Native American’s minds and personalities. In attempts to civilize the savage Native Americans, the government forced the children to cut their hair and wear standard American school uniforms, instead of their normal tribal clothing. Some children were also taken from the families and home reservations and transported to other reservations to attend boarding school. In making such drastic changes to the children’s lifestyles, it was inevitable that the children would become more Americanized, which is exactly what the United States government wanted. The rights and privileges of the Native Americans were truly relinquished to the United States government, just like the Treaty with the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache enforced; the Native Americans did not even have control of their children and their children’s education.  These said advantages, like an educational system, given to the Native Americans were not really advantages at all. They were just a ploy in order for the United States government to gain what they wanted, land ownership, and keep the Native Americans out of their way to manifest destiny.<br /><br />"],"display_date":"October 21, 1867","search_date":"1867-10-21","locations":[{"id":4489,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"SHAWNEE, Kansas"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5700,"title":"Native American Education Improves Under U.S. Government","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/76","end_date":"12/31/76","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Third Annual Report to the Congress of the United States outlined the needs, concerns, funding, and progresses of the Indian educational system set forth by the government. The National Advisory Council on Indian Education created this report in 1976 in Washington, D.C. The president of the United States appointed this council in order to assist the 570 native groups affected by the regulations of the Indian educational system. The council comprised of Americans who observed and worked with the native groups. Observations of the council members “revealed that much remains to be done before adequate and equal educational opportunities can be achieved by the Indian people.” The annual report stated that for the Indian people, Indian Education “is a method of teaching that revives an appreciation for Indian heritage and generates a positive self-image so that one accepts and understands the environment and social conditions surrounding him.” This appreciation of Indian heritage and positive self-image was lost many years ago when the American government first intruded onto Indian territories. The council addressed this loss in the report to Congress by stating that the American Indians’ 200 years experience under an authoritarian paternal relationship with the Federal Government has “clearly demonstrated that paternalism is alien to liberty and freedom.”","The Third Annual Report to the Congress of the United States clearly showed how the government progressed and improved upon the Indian Educational System. Historian David Adams exposed that the government originally created the Indian Educational System to civilize the natives, because the natives were believed to be savages. The school system intended to provide the natives with an education that would habituate them to the customs and advantages of a civilized life. The government tried to manipulate the natives into becoming exactly like American citizens, regardless of their heritage, religion, traditions, or tribal affiliations. The government believed that since the native ways of life were different than the traditional American lifestyle, the natives must be less civilized than American citizens. The government most recently formed educational policies regarding Indian Education with goals to respect the wishes and the desires of natives so that the natives may design and manage their own educational programs according to the tribal level. The United States government has allowed the natives to incorporate their own values, beliefs, and culture into the natives’ educational system instead of strictly regulating every aspect of native life. In reality, there has never truly been an American Educational system prior to modern-day; the faux system was based on the standard methods and systems of the non-Indian society and a process by which the government has tried to teach the natives how to become like the white man."],"display_date":1976,"search_date":"1976-07-01","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5759,"title":"Postwar America and the Feminist Struggle for Peace","course_id":117,"status":"P","start_date":"2/6/33","end_date":"2/6/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In a letter written to the Editor of the <em>New York Times</em> on February 6, 1933 by Majorie Hill, Louise Porter and Gwendolyn Thomas (three female students attending Mount Holyoke College), the Geneva Disarmament Conference of 1932 was discussed (16).  The conference was noted to have received twelve million signatures from all parts of the globe, demonstrating the demands of citizens for a change in direction of the way international politics was viewed and carried out.  The year following that conference, and the same date the letter was written, Arthur Henderson, chairman of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, received cablegrams from thousands of Americans who were again advocating for cuts in military weapons.  These demands were in hopes of achieving peace by gaining international support in their efforts to end war.  What is important for one to acknowledge is the fact that the majority of cablegrams were from women colleges, where it was believed that the cause and consequences of war would befall them.","Like Hill, Porter and Thomas, women living during the 1930’s were actively seeking peace and prosperity in postwar America in various ways.  More specifically, World War One brought about death and disruption, greatly affecting the United States; there were huge negative transformations in American politics, economics, and social and cultural systems (Ford 2004, 664), including escalating inequality and increasing marginalized groups within society (665).  American women, being one of the marginalized groups, decided to renounce their stance in national and international politics by exercising their rights gained from the Women’s Suffrage Movement of the 1920’s (Hensley 2006, 150).  With their newly acquired rights, women demonstrated their commitment to peace and equality by forming feminist groups.  According to Melissa Hensley, these organizations conducted rallies and petitions, presented public demonstrations, and gave speeches in regards to the withdrawal of militarism worldwide (147).  Peace activities even filtered through universities and colleges, promoting ideas on campus through student strikes, and national and regional meetings (152).","Having said that, worldwide military disarmament became a main objective for feminists, as it was believed that pacifism would bring an end to war (Hill, Porter, Thomas 1933, 16).  Because during this time men were perceived as being incapable of achieving peace due to their “aggressiveness” and desire for “power and dominion”, women of the 1930’s jumped at the opportunity to organize peace, as they were seen as being well-suited for the cause; they were assumed to be “caretakers of life” and responsible for the preservation and wellbeing of earth (Hensley 146-147).  Thus, it is no wonder then, that students attending Mount Holyoke College wrote that letter to the Editor of the <em>New York Times</em> promoting international disarmament at the Geneva Disarmament Conference of 1932.  Women were taking prominent positions in national and international military politics, and the students attending Mount Holyoke College are just a few of the many women living in postwar America who were greatly influenced by, and participated in various feminist movements in hopes of achieving peace to end war."],"display_date":"February 6, 1933","search_date":"1933-02-06","locations":[{"id":23165,"lat":42.3436165724,"lng":-72.6413336945,"zoom":9,"place":"Hampshire, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":1783,"tag":"Peace"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":117,"school_id":28}},{"id":5782,"title":"A Pittsburgh Journalist Predicts the Annexation of Cuba, Alaska, and Hawaii","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-08-03","end_date":"1854-08-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the years leading up to the Civil War, the North and South both used the annexation of territories as a strategic device to gain political power. In 1854, with both sides looking to add land, one journalist predicted that the Russian territories in North America, the Sandwich Islands (Hawaiian Islands), and Cuba would all be U.S. territory within one year. The anonymous author of the article in the <em>Daily Morning Post</em> also hinted that the territories would all then become states. He reasoned that the Whig Party would respond to the purchase of Cuba by the Democrats by purchasing Russian territories and the Sandwich Islands. Sympathizing with the North, the Pittsburgh-based author wrote \"if Cuba comes in as a slave state, the Sandwich Islands and Russian America will enter as free state and over-balance it.\" Although cast into the context of free soil and slave state balance, the annexation of these territories was not only about that battle. The author also recognized the importance of commerce and Manifest Destiny in the annexation, realizing that the Sandwich Islands could serve as a perfect halfway point for ships travelling from the West Coast to China, Japan, and the Indies. He added that \"adventurous Yankees\" could control the natives and turn the islands into a thriving community.","The South had its eye on the annexation of Cuba as early as 1848, when President James Polk unsuccessfully offered Spain $100 million for the island. If Spain had accepted this deal, historian James McPherson believes it was still unlikely to happen because the North's Whig Party had control of the House and would not have appropriated the funds. Knowing it would come in as a slave state, the Whigs would have opposed this move. In 1854, the Democratic Party again tried to purchase Cuba in a proposal known as the Ostend Manifesto. The journalist referred to this proposal in the article when he said \"events now occurring in Spain give promise of such a result (acquisition of Spain).\" This proposal turned out to be unsuccessful because, according to historian High Thomas, anti-slavery newspapers condemned the proposals once it became public knowledge.","Today, it seems that the journalist may have been wishfully thinking when he predicted the country would be able to purchase the Russian territory and the Sandwich Islands. He thought Russia would be eager to sell the land instead of having it taken by Great Britain, because that were combating one another in the Crimean War at the time. His prediction did come to fruition five years after he penned the article when Russia offered the land to the United States. He was only wrong about the time table. There is also little evidence that reveals the U.S. made an effort to acquire the Sandwich Islands in the 1850s.","Despite the inaccuracy of the writers' time table, his predictions demonstrate the desire for more land beyond the continent.

Zenobia had been the leader of the breakaway Palmyrene Empire. Aurelian sought to reunify the Empire to its former glory and in doing so had found himself at odds with Palmyra and its queen. Aurelian found himself victorious over Zenobia but this was not the source of gossip among the Senate and people of Rome. Aurelian wanted to have Zenobia paraded in a Roman triumph, the greatest military honor.","Aurelian was aware of the gossip back home in the capitol and wrote a letter in his defence. This letter does not survive but it was recorded by an anonymous author in the <em>Historia Augusta</em> which does survive today.  Aurelian wrote in his letter to the Senate that if people only knew what he knew about Queen Zenobia then they would not judge his decision. In fact, Aurelian praised her virtues as a leader and said he spared her life because her rule preserved the eastern part of the Roman Empire. Without her leadership, the Persians might have conquered Roman lands.  Aurelian concluded his letter by saying, “Therefore let those whom nothing pleases keep the venom of their own tongues to themselves.” Needless to say, the triumph went on and Zenobia was marched through the streets of Rome with so much gold and jewelry adorning her that she could hardly walk. After Aurelian had his triumph, it is said that he also allowed Zenobia to live in a villa near Tibur. She even had children and her descendants were still living as of the writing of the <em>Historia Augusta</em>.","It could perhaps be argued that Aurelian embellished the characteristics of Zenobia in order for his victory over her to be more spectacular. However, I believe this argument loses much when the popular views of women in ancient Rome are observed. According to historian, John Balsdon, “the exclusive sphere of a woman’s activity was inside the house” and that women were believed to be “the weaker sex, and… that they lacked the necessary toughness to compete in the rough and tumble of public life.” This traditional view of women was ingrained in the Roman male psyche. Therefore, Aurelian’s praise of his enemy (a female enemy at that) does more than bolster his victories; it proves that he was willing to defend his victory over her on the grounds that she was truly exceptional for a woman in his time.  She would have been a rare woman indeed to have warranted praise from one of Rome’s sternest emperors."," "],"display_date":"April 15, 1999","search_date":"1999-04-15","locations":[{"id":52709,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":1760,"tag":"Gender Roles"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6060,"title":"<strong>The Low-Born Aurelian Rises Through the Ranks</strong>","course_id":122,"status":"P","start_date":"4/15/99","end_date":"4/15/99","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","The day had finally come. Aurelian was to stand before the Emperor Valerian at the Byzantine baths and be rewarded for all of his determination. This was to be a momentous occasion for Aurelian would rise to the consulship which was historically the most prestigious political office of the Roman world. He may well have thought back on his achievements that had led him to this moment. He had risen to the height of the Roman world but his origins were humble. He might well have thought of his poor, peasant family back in Illyria. The Roman Empire had long recruited soldiers from this province and Aurelian had proved why this was so. He rose through the ranks of the military with haste due to his fantastical victories. He had led a group of three hundred Illyrians against a force of Sarmatians that threatened to overrun his province. By the time the invasion was repelled, it was said that Aurelian’s blade had been the end of over nine hundred Sarmatians. Aurelian might well have thought of this and been reminded of his nickname, Aurelian Sword-in-Hand, because his sword was found so often drawn from its sheath. More victories led to more promotions and Aurelian found himself standing before an emperor and with the army as an audience.","The <em>Historia Augusta </em>details the exchange between Valerian and Aurelian on this day. Valerian publicly thanked Aurelian for his service and for a recent victory over a Gothic invasion. Valerian bestowed upon Aurelian the consulship and said that he would have the Senate grant him all of the titles and insignias of his new post. Aurelian (ever seeking to be the subservient soldier) knelt before the emperor in gratitude. He proclaimed to the emperor that, \"As for myself, my lord Valerian, Emperor and Augustus, it was with this end in view that I have done all that I did, have suffered wounds with patience, and have exhausted my horses and my sworn comrades, namely, that I might win the approval of the commonwealth and of my own conscience.” After much bloodshed and victory, Aurelian had gained the gratitude of the most powerful man in the world. And Aurelian was one step closer to his own further rise.","It is remarkable that a man would rise from such humble beginnings to become one of the most powerful men in the Roman state. Indeed it is even more remarkable that this man would one day become <em>the</em> most powerful man in the Roman state. Scholar of the ancient world, John Osier, believes that Valerian’s son, Gallienus, is the reason for so many Illyrian generals rose to prominence. According to Osier, Gallienus needed the support of the Illyrians and so he raised them to the equestrian rank and then restricted military commanderships to those of that same rank. This would have angered the senatorial class but made him many friends with his newly appointed equestrian Illyrians. Aurelian was already rising through the ranks due to his own courage but thanks to Gallienus he gained even greater command. And it was as a general that he would find himself becoming the emperor of a fragmenting empire and eventually restoring it to its former power."],"display_date":"April 15, 1999","search_date":"1999-04-15","locations":[{"id":52709,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Outside US"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":1695,"tag":"Military Service"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6109,"title":"<strong>A Governor Overshadowed by Her Husband’s Ambitions</strong>","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"3/15/68","end_date":"3/15/68","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 15th, 1968, teachers and other members of the Alabama Education Association waited to hear George Wallace speak on the behalf of his wife at the annual AEA convention.

Lurleen had been diagnosed with cancer and she was in Montgomery recovering from a recent surgery. The AEA’s president, Vernon St. John decided to send a telegram to the beloved governor and tell her that “the teachers were inspired by her courage, [...] spirit, and uncomparable devotion to Alabama and her people”","In 1966, the state became aware that their new governor was being hospitalized for a hysterectomy. The administration did not tell the press about Lurleen’s condition, but rumors circulated that she had cancer. George Wallace instructed his staff and the doctors not to tell his wife about an abnormality in her biopsy they had found back in 1961. “His decision was not unusual for its time”, writes historian Dan T. Carter. When Lurleen found out from a mutual friend that she had been misled, she was furious. George had a number of reasons not to tell her; he simply did not want rumors spreading that the governor was dying.","George and Lurleen’s oldest son, George Jr. wrote a book about his famous parents in which he recounts the time when Lurleen followed George as governor. “My mother was not the kind of woman you would have expected to be a Governor,” he writes. It was widely known that Lurleen ran for the office simply because her husband, George, desired a third term in office and he was also planning on running for the presidency. He suggested that she run for the governorship, and she became determined to win the election. The crowd that gathered to listen to her inaugural speech could tell that she was tremendously humbled by the people’s confidence in her. More than likely, she knew that without her husband’s help and his presence, she would never have taken part in public life. “I entered the race for Governor for the purpose of permitting my husband to take our fight to the final court of appeal - the people of the United States,” she told the crowd at her inauguration. Although Lurleen was the one who made the decision to run for the executive office in her husband’s place, George’s decisions and policies ultimately shaped her administration.","The Civil Rights movement of the 1960s compelled the nation to reflect on social issues beyond those of segregation and racism. Women realized they still suffered discrimination and injustice in employment, social security, legal treatment of women, and education. Women made up 40 percent of the work force by the end of the 1960s, and more than half of those women were married. They soon began organizing to acquire equal pay and to end job discrimination. Although young women were joining the fight against these social issues across the South, Lurleen Wallace and her politics did not reflect these changing times.

The population was just over 25,000 people, with 18,000 of them being students and the median income for the city was estimated at $7,700 per year (Warr 1). The economy was starting to stall and inflation was on the rise, and people were just trying to make ends meet to provide for their families. The main occupation was farming, and a crucial part of farming was the accessibility of water to sustain the business.","The main source of water for middle and lower class families’ crops and livestock was Parkerson Mill Creek. In the 1970s, however, there was a large movement to increase the amount of areas, including waterways, to be reverted back to their natural purpose of supporting fish and wildlife. Because of this, William Warr of the EPA conducted a report was conducted on the feasibility and cost of changing a section of Parkerson Mill Creek back to its original purpose. The people of Auburn were understandably concerned about this prospect, because it changed their way of life for the worse and they would be forced to find a new source of water for their farms.","Auburn had always prided itself on its low cost of living, and one component of that was having a combined sewer and water cost of just $81/year (Warr 1). The new repurposing of the creek would add an estimated $10 per month to each household's water bill. That would mean an extra $120 per year that families could use for food, clothes, housing, and other living expenses would have to come from somewhere else. Not only this, but there would need to be another source of water for their crops and livestock. As one would expect, the people of Auburn were very nervous.","The environmental arguments, however, were also undeniable. The runoff and silt from their farms was draining directly into the creek, causing the fish and other aquatic species to die off. In a picture provided by the Alabama State Water Program from 1954, the creek is free flowing, but it looks very cloudy and contaminated. This could become a major problem, and if let go far enough, could become completely unsuitable for use (ASWP). While the residents of Auburn did sympathize with them, they did not think it was feasible to enact this new charge, and neither did William Warr of the EPA (Warr 3).

The first question brought to the House by Mr. Quincy of Massachusetts, was to have the forthcoming meetings on stating the reasons and causes of having a war against Britain be held with “open doors.” The second motion brought to the House was from Mr. Randolph of Virginia, and asked ws whether or not the reading of messages from the President be held with “open doors.” The third and last question before the House was whether or not to reject the bill that would declare war with Britain. Each of these three questions were determined in the negative, and it became evident that the majority of Representatives felt it was necessary for such matters to remain secret for the time being, to remove the possibility of outside influence. Laban Wheaton from Massachusetts, one of the last Federalists to hold a position in Washington, sided the minority on these issues. Wheaton was skeptical about embarking on a war with Britain without carefully laying out the consequences. But was secrecy the real issue at hand?","The impending war with Britain brought various questions to the table. Arguably the most important was whether or not the United States should remain neutral in foreign affairs. The increasing naval surveillance by the British, as well as the non–compliance of the French and British regarding economic relations, represented reasons why the United States should intervene. John C. Calhoun drafted a bill that laid out how the United States should proceed with the war. Many Congressmen felt it was essential for the United States to intervene in order to establish its permanent place in the world as a powerful, revolutionary and prominent nation. However, some felt that if the United States were to engage in battle, it would go against what their predecessors had tried to establish – to remain neutral in foreign affairs. Laban Wheaton and many other Federalists felt the nation was still extremely unfit for such interaction and should proceed with extreme caution.","Throughout all of this debate, the concerns of political parties play an important role. Both sides--the Federalists and Republicans--were concerned with losing control of certain states depending on how the country acted on the war. For example, the Republicans were very concerned with losing the state of Massachusetts, so it was vital that they speak out against going to war. It became clear that the real problem the House was facing was not whether or not to hold the proceedings in secret, but how each party was going to keep their support in their respective states. It seemed that the House was more concerned with keeping the constituents happy, rather than keeping them informed, and more importantly, keeping them safe."," "," "],"display_date":"June 3, 1812","search_date":"1812-06-03","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":2395,"tag":"U.S. Government"},{"id":154,"tag":"War of 1812"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}},{"id":6352,"title":"<strong>Ada James sure showed them!</strong> The ratification the 19th amendment in Wisconsin.","course_id":141,"status":"P","start_date":"11/1/19","end_date":"11/1/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Ada James was a key figure in the women's suffrage movement in Wisconsin.  She and her family played an instrumental part in Wisconsin's ratification of the 19th amendment.  In one of Ada's diary entry's she stated, \"it is unjust to hold mothers responsible for the morals of their children while denying them a voice on municipal conditions making up their environment.\"  Tis quote shows Ada's desire for change and a logical reasoning for a long overdue ratification of the 19th amendment.  It also demonstrates her values which stem from her mother a longtime Wisconsin suffragist and her father a strong supporter of the movement.","Ada's father was in fact the reason Wisconsin narrowly beat their rivals to the south Illinois, in the honor of being the first to ratify the 19th amendment.  David James, Ada's father personally raced to Washington to deliver the ratification papers.  As the article in the <em>Milwaukee Journal </em>from November 2, 1919 so strikingly states, Ada James a descendant of a suffrage family \"showed\" Illinois women that Wisconsin was the first to ratify the 19th amendment.  Noted for her outspoken nature, a key to her success in the ratification, Ada publically claimed Wisconsin's honor and denounced Illinois' false claim as the first to ratify the 19th amendment.","There is a lot of debate over this fact, partly to do with the happening that Illinois was also sending a messenger to Washington to ratify at the same time.  However, there was a problem with the wording of the Illinois bill and they were turned away.  Mr. James entered the state department with the Wisconsin ratification papers in hand as the Illinois messenger was leaving.","Ada \"showed\" them, Illinois, in her public speech held at a victory ceremony held at the Milwaukee Athletic Club.  The applause roared as Ada dispersed any doubt in Wisconsin's rightful title of the first state to ratify the suffrage amendment.  Ada sought equality for women, her impact on the Wisconsin Women's Suffrage Organizations in which she was a leading member of, and her dedication and challenge of leadership changed the course of Wisconsin's women's suffrage movement forever."," "," "," "],"display_date":"November 1, 1919","search_date":"1919-11-01","locations":[{"id":16292,"lat":43.0070321924,"lng":-87.9667286742,"zoom":10,"place":"Milwaukee, Wisconsin"}],"tags":[{"id":2206,"tag":"Wisconsin"},{"id":1710,"tag":"Voting Rights"},{"id":2673,"tag":"Ada James"},{"id":2674,"tag":"19th amendment"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2675,"tag":"Ratify"},{"id":1323,"tag":"rivalry"},{"id":840,"tag":"Illinois"},{"id":2712,"tag":"Milwaukee Athletic Club"},{"id":2713,"tag":"Milwaukee Journal"}],"course":{"name":"Intro to Digital History","school":"University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee","course_id":141,"school_id":68}},{"id":6426,"title":"Women: Citizenship or Idol Worship in the 19th Century","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-10-26","end_date":"1871-10-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["An article from The Idaho World entitled, \"Will A Lady Ever Be President?\" pondered the possibility of a female presidency in 1871, a year before the upcoming election of 1872. The tone in which the author wrote is misogynistic, but also fairly common thought. The author begins by saying, \"Will a lady ever be President? We hope so, if she is pretty.\" Beauty is a central theme in this article, and it is assumed to be the cornerstone quality that makes a good female President. The author goes on to make the assumption that if a woman were to be President, it would open many chances for promiscuous behavior, in the good favor of her inferiors. \"The Presidentess\" would also be a fashion icon, and \"inaugurate an era of love and elegance\" to the political sphere. The author then assembles a picture of the future of politics, where a \"plump, comely\" candidate runs against a \"lean, lank, scrawny\" candidate. The public would be so invested in the excitement of this event that they would parade awful banners around, \"Full Bosoms Forever,\" \"Pretty Ankles are the Nation’s Bulwarks,\" \"To Arms, ye Brave, When they are Fair and Dimpled,\" and “Give the Kissing Candidate a Chance” among the lot. The author assures the readers that this future would be a good time, and that they should hope that they are alive to see it. The article ends in a positive view of women in politics at face value, but the meaning that lies underneath may not be so liberating, especially for the thousands of suffragettes reading it in 1871."," ","The fact of the matter is that women existed in a funny area within society, mostly white women, where they were held to a high standard of respect but were not considered equal and were not given the same rights as men. They were to appear ladylike and to exhibit class and sophistication amongst company. The “New South Lady,” according to David Blight’s <em>Race and Reunion</em>, was the “agent by which the whole South could transcend the legacies of defeat and Reconstruction” (273). This image of a perfectly proper and wholesome woman was meant to steer the country towards morally better paths. The United Daughters of the Confederacy was a group assembled to exemplify just this. The UDC strived to be “guardians of piety, education, and culture” and lead “public activist lives” (273). Women were expected to stay within the confines of their designated roles as wives and mothers, achieving perfection in positive qualities such as doting, peacemaking, respectable, and sensible.","Politics was considered too brutish for the dainty ladies of the states. Many women were not particularly upset by this construct, such as Janet Rudolph, who claimed that it was not fair that women had to give up everything, but were still not able to reach the equal status of their male counterparts. “Do you call this chivalry to women? Is it placing them on that lofty pedestal our opponents so delight to talk of?” Though she recognized this imbalance, she claimed, “I am not a suffragist, but it is just such injustice that will cause the women of Virginia to become suffragists” (279)."," ","The idea of a woman within the political sphere caused backlash from those who could not separate politics from the dirty, rough-and-tumble men that were involved. Or, at least it seemed that way. In order to combine the two worlds, one would have to sacrifice part of its identity. If a lady were President, the Presidency would have to revolve around female-centered activities (e.g. fashion, kissing); likewise, if a lady were to be President, the lady would have to act like a President—i.e. to act like a man. Thus, it was quite comical to some folks to imagine a female President. Though it has yet to happen today, this country has come a long way in securing a place for women in politics—even so far as to allow them to run against men in the Presidential campaigns.

Kennedy a Democratic Presidential candidate composed a personal letter to Eleanor Roosevelt. He wrote, “I note from the press that on last Sunday afternoon, December 7, on the ABC television program College News Conference, you stated…that Senator Kennedy’s ‘father has been spending oodles of money all over the country and probably paid representatives in every state by now.’” Kennedy wrote this letter to Roosevelt hoping she would retract her statement. On December 18, 1958 Roosevelt’s response to Kennedy included the pointed remark that, “building an organization is permissable [sic] but giving too lavishly may seem to indicate a desire to influence through money.” Roosevelt additionally responded to Kennedy’s letter that if the information turned out to be false, she would gladly state so but, “was told that your father said openly he would spend any money to make his son the first Catholic President of this country.” Kennedy, enraged that Roosevelt believed such a fabrication, wrote her a pointed response. According to Allida M. Black, “Kennedy knew that he needed as much party unity as he could muster to win a very close election…Eleanor Roosevelt’s support was crucial.” Kennedy wrote in more of a lecture style on December 29, that Roosevelt should not believe the allegation made against him. “I am aware…that there are good many people who fabricate rumors and engage in slander about any person in public life. But I have made it a point never to accept or repeat such a statements unless I have some concrete evidence of their truth.” In Kennedy’s letter to Roosevelt on January 22, 1959 he stated, “I do hope that we a have a chance to get together sometime in the future to discuss other matters.”  These matters included his Catholicism, and attitude towards McCarthyism.","After the convention in July 1960, when Kennedy won the nomination, Roosevelt gave her halfhearted endorsement to Kennedy. Gary Donaldson disclosed, “Stevenson, Truman, and Eleanor Roosevelt might have thrown their support to just about anyone to keep Nixon out of the White House…Without their support…Kennedy would have a difficult time winning in November.” The importance of Roosevelt publically supporting the Democratic presidential nominee was symbolic because she was arguable as the “Mother” of the Democrat Party in the White House.Roosevelt and Kennedy’s relationship started off argumentative, but progressed into a friendly association. Roosevelt aimed to ensure that her husband’s New Deal legacy continued the Democratic party. She did not trust Kennedy. She remained suspicious of his Catholicism, his lack of criticism of Senator Joseph McCarthy, and she disliked his father, Joseph Kennedy’s, financial meddling in the campaign.  At the time that Kennedy wrote the letter to Roosevelt, she supported the two-time presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson, as the leading Democratic figure. Roosevelt liked the main points that Kennedy made in his inauguration speech about challenging the nation. Roosevelt felt passionate about the Peace Corps, but scolded Kennedy for his impulsive actions. She did not appreciate how Kennedy dodged civil rights because it coexisted as “the domestic matter closest to her heart” and “angered her the most.” Roosevelt, “strongly supported Stevenson’s appointment to the ambassadorship of the United Nations.” Finally, according to Black, Kennedy asked, “her to chair his Presidential Commission on the Status of Women.” Roosevelt attempted to influence Kennedy opinion in a variety of ways, and stayed pro-active in many organizations throughout her last 20 months alive."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"December 11, 1958 - January 22, 1959","search_date":"1959-01-01","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":2469,"tag":"Eleanor Roosevelt"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":2703,"tag":"John F.

Taft, General Dwight D. Eisenhower made an offer to him. If Taft backed away from his isolationist stance and supported the internationalist wing of the Republican Party, Eisenhower promised he would not challenge him for the nomination.  Taft declined Eisenhower’s offer, saying it would go against his conscience to do so.","At the time, Taft was isolationist, and against all foreign alliances.  By contrast, Eisenhower, as the Supreme Commander of the National Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), held internationalist views. He committed to spreading democracy to counteract the perceived Communist threat from the Soviet Union, and because of this, he sought to make NATO successful. Should Eisenhower run for nomination, Walter Trohan reported to the <em>Chicago Tribune,</em> he expected Eisenhower “to support foreign policy, especially as it relates to maintaining the victory won in Europe where he was war time supreme commander.”","Unfortunately for the Republican Party, as the Supreme Commander of NATO, Eisenhower felt duty required him to abstain from running for President. In addition to Taft, Harold Stassen, Earl Warren, and Theodore McKeldin planned to campaign for president, but the internationalist Republicans did not believe any of them could take the nomination away from Taft. They wanted Eisenhower.","The “Draft Eisenhower” Campaign started years before. As early as 1947, President Harry Truman offered to step aside for General Eisenhower to run as the Democratic candidate, with Truman as his running mate. At the time, Eisenhower said ‘no.’ Four years later, Truman again asked Eisenhower if he would run, and again Eisenhower refused. In response, Eisenhower secretly made the offer to Taft.","Meanwhile, moderate Republicans Henry Cabot Lodge and Thomas Dewey asked Eisenhower to run for president on the Republican ticket. Eisenhower, like George Marshall and George Patton, believed generals should be nonpartisan, to maintain the professionalism of the military officer corps. Because of this nonpartisan pledge, Eisenhower never voted in a presidential election until 1948, after he retired.","Eisenhower maintained he had no desire to be president. In March 1952, his conversation with Herbert Brownell, former campaign planner for Dewey, changed his mind. Brownell told Eisenhower that Taft was the frontrunner for the Republican Party, and if Eisenhower wanted the nation to pursue internationalist policies, he must run. After decades of Democratic presidents, the country would likely vote for change. In 1951, Stalin announced the Soviet Union had a hydrogen bomb; by 1952, the cease-fire talks with Korea deadlocked. If Eisenhower wanted to ensure internationalist foreign policy, he needed to run in the primaries against Taft. Shortly after the meeting, Eisenhower renounced his nonpartisanship. He announced he would run for Republican nomination."],"display_date":"December 8, 1951 - April 24, 1952","search_date":"1952-02-14","locations":[{"id":52983,"lat":48.856614,"lng":2.3522219,"zoom":8,"place":"Paris, France"},{"id":52779,"lat":38.9040418,"lng":-77.0388036,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":3161,"tag":"Robert A.

Swift, a writer, social activist, speaker, and pamphleteer, focused on social and political theory.","Germany saw a rise in socialist ideas as they neared the twentieth century. The German Social Democratic Party became one of Germany’s most popular parties, and saw massive gains in the Reichstag since 1890. Socialism also saw a rise in popularity in the election of 1900 in the United States.  Swift said, “The German elections are likely to have a very notable influence upon the American working classes in changing this, by calling their attention to politics as a method far more potent than the strike.” Unfair and dangerous working conditions brought on by rapid industrialization, such as low wages, long hours, and work-related injuries, led to strikes and standoffs between laborers and managers. Swift mentioned the unhappiness of the laborer in society, writing that workers finally realized that there may be something wrong with the interactions between labor and capital.","Between 1900 and 1904, Socialism gained popularity in a region of 20 states bounded by Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, and Maryland. This region accounted for the most socialists in office, along with between 60 percent and 85 percent of the Socialist party vote. This region was also heavily industrialized. Counties known for having unions and industry working against each other tended to vote more Socialists into office and have a more Socialist leaning during the presidential election.","Swift likened the American trust leaders to the German Emperor, William the Second, saying, “Our heads of industry and finance are bearing down on the people in ways as surprising and obnoxious to us as a free nation, as William’s ways are obnoxious and intolerable to Germany as an unfree nation.” Swift predicted that such conditions would unleash a gradual rise in popularity for Socialism. Swift mentioned, “It seems that we should recognize that Socialism is to spring into a great, perhaps huge, practical force in this country in a very short time.” In 1900, the Democratic Socialist Party, led by Eugene V. Debs, had only 0.6 percent of the popular vote, but by 1904 the Socialist Party, also led by Debs, had risen to three percent of the popular vote.","Swift highlighted the fact that Germans saw less industrialization than the United States, yet still ran to Socialism to protect themselves from industrialization. He predicted that the American laborers would run to the arms of Socialism for protection, and that it was inevitable to avoid the revolution. Despite Swift’s predictions, Socialism would decline in popularity and would almost die out after the First World War."],"display_date":"June 29, 1903","search_date":"1903-06-29","locations":[{"id":52989,"lat":42.927205,"lng":-76.1289029,"zoom":5,"place":"New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3176,"tag":"Labor Movement"},{"id":3175,"tag":"1903"},{"id":3174,"tag":"1904 Election"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":1090,"tag":"strikes"},{"id":896,"tag":"Labor"},{"id":2188,"tag":"Socialism"},{"id":2781,"tag":"Election"}],"course":{"name":"History of U.S. Presidential Elections","school":"Wayne State University","course_id":163,"school_id":92}},{"id":6619,"title":"A Voter Reacts to the Kennedy - Nixon Debates.","course_id":163,"status":"P","start_date":"9/26/60","end_date":"9/26/60","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 26, 1960 Henry R.

Henry was a proud Republican and he considered himself a supporter of Nixon’s. Clark was just in time as the two candidates took the stage. Senator John F. Kennedy from Massachusetts was a very wealthy, youthful and intelligent man. He had served six years in the House of Representatives and eight years in the Senate, but had little experience in foreign affairs. On the other hand, President Eisenhower’s Vice President Nixon had many years of experience. During Nixon’s years in the Senate he toured Europe reporting on the Marshall Plan and he served on a committee that exposed a communist spy ring in the United States. After being elected Vice President he had toured thirty countries in the East and was the first diplomat to visit Japan after World War II. He famously debated Nikita Khrushchev during the “The Kitchen Debates.” Unfortunately for Nixon the first debate against Kennedy did not include foreign affairs.

His name was John Breckinridge. This came at a time where the democratic party split. The split came from both democratic runners Breckinridge and Stephen Douglass, the main democratic party holder. Both candidates were for slavery, but Breckinridge was for expanding slavery, while Douglass was for whatever the public felt was needed. This came to a split between southern democrats and northern democrats. Both Breckinridge and Douglass were for keeping the South from seceding, but they were very different on the actual subject of slavery. Slavery was in every nook of this time, which is why most historians will tell you that the whole subject of the Civil War was slavery. It was always the topic of discussion and people back then had strong standings on it, especially those who were actual slave owners.","Breckinridge won southern people because he was for protecting the slave owners and their businesses. Douglass, on the other hand was not so much into protection for the slave owners. This caused the split in the party. When the split happened, Douglass had been nominated for the actual democratic party. This caused an uproar in the South, so Breckenridge technically went third party, but still called himself democrat. This drastically split the democratic vote and gave Lincoln the win in 1860.","After the loss, Breckinridge held a seat in Kentucky legislature. While there, he tried to convince Kentucky officials to secede with the Confederacy. Kentucky ended up joining the Union and Breckenridge fled Kentucky. After leaving, he joined up with the Confederacy and fought through the war and survived. He was an aide to Jefferson Davis. Breckinridge would tell Davis, after signing the official surrender of the Confederacy during the Civil War,  to continue efforts of fighting through guerilla type warfare. He would also push to end the Union even though the fate of the Confederacy had already been decided. He fled to other countries and ended up in Canada where he lived the rest of his life.","The importance of this article is to show how fragile things were during that time period. The Democratic party split because of the rising tensions between the North and the South. Again, neither Breckinridge or Douglass wanted the country to split, but both were clearly for their side. Douglass fought for the North to end the South and their reign. Douglass had to sacrifice his thoughts on slavery for his idea of the greater good. Breckinridge also had to drop his idea of the country not splitting, and fight for what he thought was for the greater good. These stories show that war was a last resort.  War came when there was, obviously, going to be no compromise that the two sides could agree on.

The article brought on a split at the Canadian University Press national conference, although a slim majority of student editors refused to censure the Varsity. The delegates at the Ryerson University eventually voted 12 to 10 against the motion to censure. Despite this the issue doesn’t seem to end here as, the president of the CUP charter is to poll all member newspapers on their opinion of Musgrove’s article and results will be published in the students papers the following month. In the end, the conference is supporting a study of the causes for the discord and finding ways to remove them. "," ","The 1960s introduced many reforms called the “Quiet Revolution” (Révolution tranquille) in Québec under Premier Jean Lesage of the Québec Liberal Party. Some plans included: establishment of a public hospital network, creation of ministries of cultural affairs and for federal-provincial relations, lowering the legal age to vote from 21 to 18. During this time John Diefenbaker was Prime Minister and while dealing with an economic-slowdown after World War II did not seem at ease with this new display of Québec nationalism. Diefenbaker pursued a “One Canada” or “unhyphenated Canadianism” policy, a single Canadian nation for people of all ethnic origins under a government that would respect everyone’s fundamental human rights and would not allow to make special exceptions to Québec’s Francophones. In 1960, his government passed a federal Bill of Rights emphasizing individual freedoms of every Canadian. The political divide at the time was also in due part of Lesage being part of the Québec Liberal Party, and Diefenbaker being part of the Progressive Conservatives. Whereas Lesage wanted to modernize Québec independently with new reforms Diefenbaker’s outlook was to keep Canada united as one entity under the category of Canadians respectively. These ideologies of what it means to be a Canadian or Québecois at the time did lead to people being on opposing sides and expressing their opinions on the matter that sometimes seemed to divide rather than unite people which is reflected in the debate on university campuses caused by voicing conflicting beliefs. "],"display_date":"August 10, 1960 - December 30, 1961","search_date":"1961-04-20","locations":[{"id":53097,"lat":43.653226,"lng":-79.3831843,"zoom":8,"place":"Toronto, Canada"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":3426,"tag":"Nationalism"},{"id":600,"tag":"Media"},{"id":3505,"tag":"Freedom of Expression"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":179,"school_id":28}},{"id":6863,"title":"Daniel Webster Refutes Robert Hayne's Attack on New England in the Great Senate Debate of 1830","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-26","end_date":"1830-01-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 26 and 27, 1830, senators Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina and Daniel Webster of Massachusetts got into a heated debate that captured many of the issues that threatened to tear the nation apart. The main issues involved the tariff and nullification. Two days prior to Webster’s reply, Hayne delivered a speech in Congress that attacked Webster by questioning his loyalty to the Constitution. In this speech, Hayne said that the South had \"everything to lose and nothing to gain.\" He believed the tariff only sought \"the protection of Northern shipping and New England seamen\" while the South reaped no benefits. The audience expected Webster to deliver a reply, and he did not let them down. Webster began his reply by saying, “…It is, Sir, the people’s Constitution, the people’s government, made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people.” Throughout the course of this reply, Webster argued that the federal government provided everything for the country. He stated that the sectional conflict resulted from the claims of state’s rights since the state governments tried to insert themselves into the areas recognized as the purview of the federal government.","Sectional beliefs divided the Senate which emphasized the tensions between the North and the South. At this point, the southern states felt that the federal government violated their rights by imposing the tariff. Robert Hayne advocated for states’ rights. According to Harlow W. Sheidley, he also proposed the doctrine of nullification in which a state could nullify laws that they considered unconstitutional like the tariff. This served as a pretext to the Nullification Crisis that would cause South Carolina to threaten secession. In Webster’s reply to Hayne, he argued that the southern states secede since the Constitution applies to both the North and the South. This debate brought into question the limits of what the federal government could do.","Webster’s reply to Hayne revealed his sense of federalism. His counterargument suggests that he saw a common identity as a country, not just North and South. Clearly, Webster tried to promote federalism over sectionalism. In his reply to Hayne, he implicitly stated his belief that the Constitution created the framework of the federal government. Webster believed that the federal government had the right to handle any conflict between the state and federal governments over an issue not clarified in the Preamble of the US Constitution. This explains his opposition to nullification, which justifies why he argued that states such as South Carolina had no right to nullify the tariff.  A century later, Senator Robert C. Byrd recognized that Webster knew how to appeal to a national audience during a time of governmental polarization. He also knew how to diffuse a situation by changing the subject. And because he possessed this knowledge, he decided to persuade people of the importance of a single democratic union. However, many southerners fully opposed these beliefs. Therefore, Daniel Webster’s reply to Hayne embodies the true sectional crisis that eventually leads to the American Civil War."],"display_date":"January 26, 1830 - January 27, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-26","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.898899496695,"lng":-77.032655531551,"zoom":13,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":1803,"tag":"Sectional Crisis"},{"id":150,"tag":"Senate"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":371,"tag":"Debate"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}}]}
