Moore started his career as an educator in the Brevard County School System in 1925.  By 1934, he had organized and become president of the first branch of the NAACP in Brevard County; by 1946, he was the executive director for the Florida NAACP.  In 1949, Moore learned of a rape charge in a small Florida town called Groveland.  In what quickly escalated to a dramatic case, a white girl, Norma Padgett, accused four black men of raping her.  Her husband Willie said that he and Norma had been on their way home from a dance when his car stalled.  Four black men stopped to offer help, but instead beat him and escaped with Norma.  When Norma returned early the next morning, she spoke briefly to Willie and then claimed that the same four men had raped her.  Moore was among many in the NAACP who believed that Norma was lying to cover for Willie’s repeated abusive behavior.  A few days later, after an outbreak of violence against blacks in Groveland, Moore telegrammed the governor on behalf of the Florida NAACP to demand action to prosecute the perpetrators of the riots.  Nothing was done.","By the time the case went to trial, one of the four men had escaped and been killed.  The remaining three went on trial and were quickly convicted.  About a year later, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the convictions of two of the men – Shepard and Irvin.  In November, 1951, Sheriff McCall, was transporting the men for their pretrial hearing when he pulled over for a flat tire.  McCall claimed that the men attacked him when he opened their door and he was forced to shoot them, but Irvin survived to dispute McCall’s version of events.  Upon learning of this, Moore wrote an angry letter to the governor demanding to know how something like this could have been allowed to happen.","Though Moore never got an answer to his questions, the public was made well aware of his opinion on the mishandling of the Groveland case.  On December 25, 1951, less than a month after Moore’s letter, a bomb went off in his home, killing both himself and his wife.  Despite appeals from the NAACP and eventual FBI investigation, the murder was never solved.  However, the intense emotions surrounding the Groveland case had already incited racial riots several times over. Moore’s criticisms of the case, though they rang true with most blacks, most likely only enflamed the already strong hatred of him amongst racist whites.  It is easy to conclude, then, that Moore’s active involvement in the Groveland case was the final straw that made it seem necessary for civil rights opponents to eliminate him entirely.  "," "],"display_date":"July 1, 1949 - January 31, 1952","search_date":"1950-10-16","locations":[{"id":52955,"lat":28.6652727,"lng":-80.8447766,"zoom":8,"place":"Mims, FL"},{"id":52954,"lat":28.5580546,"lng":-81.8511889,"zoom":8,"place":"Groveland, FL"}],"tags":[{"id":3105,"tag":"Harry T.

In an effort to escape the police’s attacks, many people fled the convention center towards the nearby Pontchartrain Hotel and beyond. Police continued their attacks. “Swinging and jabbing their nightsticks, more than 350 police waded into nearly 800 demonstrators.” Gary Nater, 17, of Birmingham, MI, ended up with facial wounds and a broken arm. “Gary told [his father] he was trying to get away from the group, but was grabbed and beaten by five Detroit policemen.” Nater’s father also conveyed that his son had “respected the police—until this anyway.”","On October 29, 1968, George Wallace held a presidential rally at Detroit’s Cobo Hall. Wallace’s supporters enjoyed a numerical advantage, and fighting took place within the center; but the melee turned from pro- versus anti-Wallace supporters to the Detroit Police versus everyone. “Police ordered the crowd to disperse,” but they did not. Demonstrators on the rooftop “threw stones and other debris at police squads standing below.”","By late October, the presidential campaign was nearing its conclusion. The election was highly contentious. Wallace’s two opponents were the Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey, and Republican Richard Nixon.","As a segregationist and former governor of Alabama, Wallace had strong support in the Deep South. But for a chance of a presidential victory, he had to concentrate his campaign on Northern states, including Michigan. Detroit had long had divisions along racial lines. Factors such as deindustrialization (especially in the post-World War II years) and structural racism in crucial areas such as housing already showed division between many white and black Detroiters.","The year 1968 was not the beginning of Detroit’s racial tensions. On July 23, 1967, a major race riot began in the city of Detroit. Mayor Jerome Cavanagh, a liberal Democrat, had previously taken steps to ameliorate Detroit’s numerous racial injustices. These policies proved inadequate and Detroit’s riot of 1967 showed the dissatisfaction with the progress. Little had improved by 1968. The Executive Secretary for the Detroit National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Robert Tindal, observed that confrontations between police and citizens were usually racially based, due to the overwhelming whiteness of the police department.","The race issue was always salient in Wallace’s rallies, and this was no different in that respect, but it was noteworthy for the violence it engendered. The headlines of the papers following the rally were dominated by the police’s attacks. Despite the carnage of several hecklers being injured and one policemen being hospitalized, many witnesses supported the police’s actions. An elderly man commented, “The police need more freedom in dealing with these youngsters.” Some Wallace supporters opposed any racial integration, and some believed that the civil rights movement was progressing too quickly. The rally highlighted the divisiveness of the 1968 election in Michigan—pitting young versus old, black versus white, and liberal versus conservative."],"display_date":"October 29, 1968","search_date":"1968-10-29","locations":[{"id":52997,"lat":42.3268787,"lng":-83.0496032,"zoom":13,"place":"Detroit, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1596,"tag":"Riots"},{"id":2227,"tag":"NAACP"},{"id":3201,"tag":"George Wallace, Police"}],"course":{"name":"History of U.S. Presidential Elections","school":"Wayne State University","course_id":163,"school_id":92}}]}
