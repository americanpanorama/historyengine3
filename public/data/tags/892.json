First, he wrote about why he came to U.S., “I came to America to see men and women and not simply bricks and mortar, to understand a national life rather than to moan over sooty cities and industrial wildernesses. Hundreds of thousands of healthy Europeans passed annually to America. I wanted to know what this asylum or refuge of our wanderers actually was, what was the life and hope it offered, what America was doing with her hands, what she was yearning for with her heart. I wished to know also what was her despair,” he says. Graham and most of the immigrants believed that in the United States it was easy to get a place and earn an honest living. In the first chapter “The Arrival of the Immigrant”, he described how he and other immigrants arrived in New York. All the approved immigrants were overjoyed. These people were mostly Europeans, such as Germans, Swedes, Italians and Russians.","Graham then expressed how he was impressed by the advanced technology, diversity of language, people’s hospitality and kindness and the natural environment.  He was also impressed by Americans' culture and faith: “America breathed kindness. New York seemed to me more friendly and hospitable than any other great city I had lived in,” he says, “I for my part have to thank numberless farmers, east and west, for kindly interest and good talks, loaves of bread, cups of coffee, and pleasant meals. Several times when I have been cooking by the side of a road a farm wife has come running out to me with something hot from her kitchen, with an ‘Eat this, poor man, and God bless you, you must be hungry.’” Graham was very touched by these kind people and the way they lived.","Graham basically loved America rather than his home country, in every aspect such as culture, religion, society and economy. “We live in a tradition; they live in an expectation. We are remedying the old state; they are building the new. We are loyal to the ideas of our predecessors, they are agape to divine the ideas of generations yet to come,” Graham once says in his book. In the end of the book, he expresses how he thinks of the United States and how the United States is better than his home country.  He says, “Back to Russia! From the most forward country to the most backward country in the world; from the place where ‘time is money’ to where the trains run at eighteen miles an hour; from the land of Edison to the land of Tolstoy; from the religion of philanthropy to the religion of suffering--home once more.”","Graham’s book reflected the image of the United States in the European’s eyes. His experiences perfectly explain why Europeans craved to come to the U.S. during the early 1900s. In the book <em>The Huddled Masses: The Immigrant in American Society, 1880-1921, </em>Alan Kraut explains that the depression of the 1890s greatly enhanced the number of Eastern and Southern European immigrants in United States. By 1910, Eastern and Southern Europeans made up seventy percent of the immigrants entering the United States. Kraut argues that immigration to America was but one of the many choices available to the immigrants, and that individual aptitude and desires were just as influential as cultural, social, and familial pressures to find a better life, which is exactly what Graham was talking about. As Kraut discusses, escaping religious, racial, and political persecution, or seeking relief from a lack of economic opportunity or famine, were the main reasons why they wanted to come to United States. To sum up, what Kraut explains about the immigration of early 20<sup>th</sup> century perfectly illustrates Graham’s experience and the reason why those Europeans were craving to move to the United States during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century."],"display_date":1914,"search_date":"1914-07-02","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":892,"tag":"European immigrants"},{"id":797,"tag":"America in 19th Century."},{"id":759,"tag":"Immigrants"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5192,"title":"The Burden of Defeat: The XI Corps Breaks at Gettysburg","course_id":64,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-07-01","end_date":"1863-07-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Burden of Defeat: The IX Corps Breaks at Gettysburg","     The specter of defeat seemed to hang over the military career of German immigrant and revolutionary statesman turned Republican politician and Union General Carl Schurz and bad luck stalk his every move. Poorly positioned at the extreme right flank of Hooker’s army at Chancellorsville, the Eleventh Corps, especially Schurz’s third division, bore the brunt of General “Stonewall” Jackson’s fierce surprise counter-attack, routing the exposed and outnumbered federals and earning the unit an undeserved reputation for cowardice, especially when considering Schurz’s own personal courage under fire, rallying his division and mounting a somewhat effective resistance against a numerically superior foe. To add insult to injury, the misperception soon featured an ethnic slant: composed of a sizeable German minority, they were branded the “Flying Dutchmen” and the German-Americans’ proud rallying cry “I fight mit Sigel” acquired the sneering addition “and I run mit Schurz,” a taunt that would follow the general and his men throughout the war.","     On July 1, 1863, the Eleventh Corps, temporarily under Schurz’s direct command, marched into combat on the outskirts of Gettysburg to assist the heavily engaged First Corps. Seizing upon a potential opportunity for redemption, Major-General Francis Barlow’s impetuosity, euphemistically regarded as “too much bravery” in Schurz’s memoirs, led him to order his division out of line and onto a small knoll he believed to be a more advantageous position, breaking the defensive perimeter around the city and drawing brutal enfilade fire from confederate musket and cannon.","     Schurz recognized the mounting crisis and dispatched “aide after aide” to establish contact with Barlow, but the damage was done. In short order Barlow was severely wounded and his division driven from the field, leaving a gaping hole in the union line through which charging confederates began to pour, collapsing several portions of the line and forcing Schurz and his staff to stage a fighting withdrawal through the city. In a clear attempt to preserve the honor of his men, Schurz insisted in his report—and maintained throughout his life—that the divisions hotly “contest(ed) the ground step by step.” Moreover, he directly counters allegations that his men “routed…pell-mell” through the city, offering instead a picture of hasty but “orderly” retreat in his memoirs.","     When the smoke cleared and the casualties were tallied, the Eleventh Corps had lost over one third of its entire effective strength. Major-General Schimmelfennig suffered the ignominy of seeking refuge in a pig sty to evade capture following his division’s retreat through the packed city streets, already filled with broken elements of the First Corps. Despite repelling a large Confederate assault threatening two major Cemetery Ridge artillery batteries the following day, this “very spirited hand-to-hand fight” was scarcely remembered and Schurz and his “German” division, though courageous even in defeat and bled white with casualties, remained, to many, the “Flying Dutchmen.”","     The extent of his emotional wounds and defensive posturing becomes apparent when considering his November 1863 press exchange with Leslie Combs, a Kentucky Democrat who openly accused Schurz of personal cowardice at Chancellorsville. Opting to engage in a questionable public honor duel he “deem(ed) appropriate…to stop a slander political enemies seem bent on sustaining,” Schurz brands Combs a liar, demands a retraction and invites him to stand next to him in combat and “not leave for a single moment.”","     Indeed political generals and their reputations often suffered grievously at the hands of the press and public, and Carl Schurz was no different. Though he would go on to hold various high offices throughout the federal government, he never truly ended his apologetics, even justifying his command decisions from beyond the grave through his posthumously published memoirs.  Such was his burden of defeat."],"display_date":"July 1, 1863 - July 4, 1863","search_date":"1863-07-02","locations":[{"id":10806,"lat":39.8715057392,"lng":-77.2179223246,"zoom":9,"place":"ADAMS, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":912,"tag":"Gettysburg"},{"id":321,"tag":"Union Army"},{"id":892,"tag":"European immigrants"},{"id":985,"tag":"11th Corps"},{"id":986,"tag":"Political Generals"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":64,"school_id":4}}]}
