It [was] a country of many and violent diseases” (Nichols, 363). Firstly, becoming a doctor was simple enough to be achieved by virtually anyone. Attaining a certificate as a Medicinae Doctor required solely observing a regular physician or reading about medicine for three years, attending two medical lecture courses, paying a few fees, and passing a \"hasty examination, made by professors who are very anxious that [the test takers] should pass...Any one [could] practise medicine who [chose] to set about it. No diploma [was] needed, and no licence required. This is the American idea of ‘free trade and no monopoly.’” (Nichols, 364). Furthermore, no distinction was made between pharmacists, physicians, surgeons, and midwives; as a result, every doctor was expected to cover the responsibilities of all of these positions.","Most difficult of the incongruities of the medical profession was the lack of standards regarding education. Not only did schools of all 34 states at the time create their own standards for curricula, diplomas, methods, and beyond, but nearly every program differed in theories of disease and methods of treatment. “There is no standard--no real science of medicine--no absolute or acknowledged authority,” wrote journalist, author, dietitian, and reformer Thomas Low Nichols. “Every one may do what is right in his own eyes...I knew one [college] in which the professor of physiology was a vitalist, while the professor of chemistry also lectured on physiology, and based his explanations on chemical theories. The Professor of Theory and Practice was at sword's or lancet's point with the Professor of Materia Medica. One denounced blood-letting, and was in favour of a mild, expectant practice; the other was a sanguinary Sangrado, who held that the only way to get health into a man was to let the blood out of him, and that violent diseases were to be expelled by more violent medicines” (Nichols, 365). Among the numerous modes of medical thought was the “botanic” which was created by Samuel Thomson, who believed in sweating and purging the body rather than bloodletting, and which rejected formal education. Some, mostly German immigrants, practiced homeopathic medicine in the early 1800s which included natural ways of curing disease, advocated for more interaction between patients and doctors, and aimed for medicine to be issued in doses that could be endured. Others, led by physician Russell Trall who founded the New York Hydropathic and Physiological School in 1854 and published <em>New Hydropathic Cook-Book</em> in 1857, practiced hydropathic medicine;  these water-based methods focused on a “program of hydropathy, gymnastics, diet, sleep, and exercise.” Still other physicians believed in Grahamism which promoted vegetarianism, water as a sovereign remedy, regular exercise, fresh air, temperance, and bran. Minister Sylvester Graham, inventor of the graham cracker, was the main advocate for the bran bread diet and strongly encouraged abstinence from alcohol (Finkelman). Interestingly, as a result of adhering to the Graham diet, abolitionist Theodore Weld lived until the age of 92 (Howe, 650). Evidently, the medical profession could have proved much more successful had it united under common goals, theories, and standards. Had doctors of the time chosen to strive toward the same objectives, such as distinguishing disease prevention from treatment, they would have been able to excel and to be more effective in their better defined roles. Had professionals reached a consensus regarding which theories to teach to all medical students, the widely-spread practice would have been homogeneous and therefore more expandable throughout the country. Had they agreed upon uniform procedures, advancements of these procedures would have been easier to implement, and the remedies themselves would have been more reliable."],"display_date":1857,"search_date":"1857-07-02","locations":[{"id":8592,"lat":40.5636337847,"lng":-74.6163625092,"zoom":9,"place":"SOMERSET, New Jersey"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1122,"tag":"Public Health"},{"id":1123,"tag":"1800s"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":75,"school_id":40}},{"id":5826,"title":"Elixirs of Death: Human Health and the Dangers of Pesticides","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/45","end_date":"12/31/62","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The sixties marked a time of extraordinary social change and counter cultural struggle in America, and environmental issues surrounding dangerous chemicals had come to the forefront. In 1962, Rachel Carson, an award winning author, environmentalist, and scientist, published <em>Silent Spring</em>, a popular science book warning the public about the dangers of widespread use of pesticides. Its publication forged a link between urban and industrial issues with feas about degradation of the natural environment. In this small sampling of <em>Silent Spring</em>, Carson articulates her concern that pesticides may have harmful repercussions in humans, whether it be ingestion or accidental exposure to the chemicals. In addition, through the bio-accumulative process, the pesticides work their way into a larger ecological network and directly and indirectly affect the entire ecosystem. Traces of them are found in our soil, the fish we consume, the animals around us, and, most importantly, in our bodies. Due to their “biological potency”, Carson was concerned that pesticides poison our vital systems, destroy enzymes, block the oxidation process, or initiate a malignant change in the human cell.","While some scientists disagreed on the harmfulness of DDT in the human body, Dr. Wayland Hayes of the United States Public Health Service agreed that the presence of DDT in the body interrupts equilibrium in the body. One of the most alarming aspects of DDT was its transferability from one organism to another. Some early studies discovered that hay ingested by cows shows up in their milk. In similar situations, insecticidal chemicals have been found in human milk, which are then passed on to infants, resulting in weakened immune systems. Carson argues that even though immediate harm might not be detected due to exposure of pesticides, the prolong damages are severe.","In the post-war period the U.S. began an extensive utilization of industrial insecticides. The use of these chemicals grew substantially throughout this period up to the publication of <em>Silent Spring</em>, when Carson exposed to the public the gross uses of harmful chemicals by the government and major industries. <em>Silent Spring</em> initiated a moment in the American consciousness when people became aware of the dangers and began to challenge the government.  Carson expressed concern over the results of chemical buildups in humans and animals. The chemical and agricultural industries were strong players on the national stage, but Carson’s book raised a significant amount of awareness, and fear, about the widespread ramifications of pesticide application."],"display_date":"1945 - 1962","search_date":"1953-12-31","locations":[{"id":25150,"lat":42.3649994065,"lng":-70.9800517697,"zoom":10,"place":"Suffolk, Massachusetts"}],"tags":[{"id":87,"tag":"Environment"},{"id":1122,"tag":"Public Health"},{"id":1882,"tag":"Pesticides"},{"id":1883,"tag":"Chemical contamination"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6628,"title":"Trouble with the Fens","course_id":165,"status":"P","start_date":"1884-04-08","end_date":"1884-04-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A place for relaxation, picnics, play, and companionship, the Back Bay Fens lie just outside Fenway Park near the Charles River in Boston. Now a beautiful location, the park, imagined by Frank Olmsted, has a history mired in literal filth.","Construction of the Fens began in the 1880s. Chosen to be the first park in a much larger network of public grounds known as the Emerald Necklace, the Fens were not as they appear today. The Back Bay Fens, as much of Boston throughout its history, was a swampy marsh that had to be formed and shaped to what the park’s designer wanted. Though designed as a positive public health initiative for both city and community, the Back Bay Fens was attacked for causing the “deadly miasma” it was created to combat.","In 1884, <em>The Boston Globe </em>published an interview with anonymous man who had experience in, “landscaping, gardening, and engineering.” Questioning the cost, methods, and possible dangers, he claimed the construction “will be the source of deadly miasma.” He stated that the design of the sewer system did not accommodate for high tide, and that sewage, mud, and filth would fill the artificial pond. The land-forming done had nearly been ruined by the construction of the Boylston Bridge, a costly endeavor by the city of Boston. The anonymous source railed against the choices of Frank Olmsted and H.H. Richardson as designers of the park and its architecture. This anonymous individual challenged the city of Boston on their methods for creating this public green space, questioning the effectiveness on both a financial level, and a public health level.","Twenty-years later Boston would still be paying for their mistake. Backlash from various groups of people halted the construction of Olmsted’s “Emerald Necklace.” Along with landscapers, and engineers like the man interviewed by the Boston Globe, citizens were discontent with their parks. The warning of the 1884 paper went unheard and the consequences were as predicted. In 1905, <em>The Boston Globe</em> again reported on the Fens. This time the article was about Boston’s continued failure to clean the “cesspool” that had developed.","Public health initiatives were undertaken by cities to create more livable and healthy environments, but they also had unintended consequences. The Fens is one example of the conflict that can rise from public health initiatives undertaken by city governments. Even something as seemingly simple as a park experienced unintended consequences that frustrated both citizens and city government for years to come. The Back BayFens are not a failure, but its history as a successful public health initiative is polluted."],"display_date":"April 8, 1884","search_date":"1884-04-08","locations":[{"id":53000,"lat":42.3502648,"lng":-71.0809757,"zoom":8,"place":"Back Bay, Boston"}],"tags":[{"id":3210,"tag":"Parks"},{"id":1902,"tag":"recreation"},{"id":2662,"tag":"Boston"},{"id":1122,"tag":"Public Health"},{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":165,"school_id":94}},{"id":6752,"title":"Dr. Josephine Baker: Baby Savior of Hell's Kitchen","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/02","end_date":"6/1/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Manhattan neighborhood of Hell’s Kitchen was truly living up to its name in the summer of 1902. The oppressive heat and ripe stench gripped at Dr. Sara Josephine Baker as she climbed floor after floor of the crowded tenements, knocking on doors in the neighborhood in search of sick babies as part of her job with the New York City Department of Health. Dr. Baker was faced with all measures of poverty and squalor- cockroaches skittering across the floors, dead flies floating in milk bottles, and “dying baby after dying baby.” At the time, as many as 1500 babies died every week during that summer, and it was Dr. Baker’s job to record and report these statistics. According to her memoirs, Dr. Baker recounted that mothers felt helpless against the epidemics of the day: “[The mothers] were just horribly fatalistic about it while it was going on. Babies always died in summer and there was no point in trying to do anything about it.”","Dr. Baker later collected her recommendations for new mothers based on her years of fieldwork and research into her 1920 book, Healthy Babies. This handbook for mothers does not offer cures for diseases, but instead offers suggestions on how to keep a baby well. In the preface of the book, Dr. Baker makes it clear that “methods of keeping babies well are simple and easy,” and emphasizes many times over that any mother with common sense can provide a clean and safe environment for her child. In clear and concise language, Dr. Baker instructs mothers on what temperature to keep the nursery (66 to 68 degrees in the day), and dictates if babies must have toys, they should be washable. Dr. Baker wrote this book based on the assumption that a mother could positively impact her baby’s health rather than leaving it to chance, and also promotes the idea of “wellness” over simply “not being sick.” The existence of such a book reflects the time it was written. Between her sweltering summer in Hell’s Kitchen and the year this book was published, infant health in New York City improved by leaps and bounds, and much of this can be attributed to Dr. Baker herself.","The years of fieldwork amongst the poorest of New York City’s families inspired Dr. Baker as she rose through the ranks of the Department of Health, where she eventually held the position of Commissioner of Health. In 1908, she was appointed director of the newly formed Bureau of Child Hygiene, the first agency of its kind in the United States, and immediately began efforts to coordinate the programs all of the child hygiene agencies in the city. Dr. Baker’s programs exemplified public health at its best, streamlining and connecting existing organizations to work together towards the common goal of preventing child mortality and improving conditions of child hygiene across the board. Under her guidance, every reported new mother was visited by a public health nurse, who instructed the mother on proper care and feeding practices and gave her informational pamphlets. Milk stations, which provided the city’s mothers with quality milk for their babies at low prices or for free, partnered with Dr. Baker’s bureau and developed into child health stations. These stations not only offered nutritious food for children, but offered education on child care, and later provided vaccinations. By the time Dr. Baker retired in 1923, New York City had the lowest infant mortality rate in the country. Dr. Sara Josephine Baker’s impact on infant health in New York City, and public health as a whole, cannot be overstated."],"display_date":"June 1, 1902 - June 1, 1920","search_date":"1911-06-01","locations":[{"id":53100,"lat":40.7830603,"lng":-73.9712488,"zoom":13,"place":"Manhattan, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3450,"tag":"josephine baker"},{"id":3449,"tag":"infant health"},{"id":579,"tag":"New York City"},{"id":1122,"tag":"Public Health"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}},{"id":6760,"title":"The Irish Potato Famine: Lessons in Epidemiology and Public Health","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-05-30","end_date":"1847-08-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 30, 1847, Robert Whyte was forced to either leave his beloved homeland of Ireland or risk death by slow and painful starvation. Unsurprisingly, he chose the former, fleeing the country with no real possibility of ever returning. Whyte’s only transportation option was an Irish coffin ship, jam-packed with hundreds of other refugees seeking an end to the brutal living conditions of one of the deadliest famines in world history: The Irish Potato Famine. While the coffin ship was intended to deliver the emigrants from the hellish circumstances of Ireland, it instead hastened many of their deaths—as the lack of space and proper ventilation on the ship acted as a cesspool and incubator for disease. During his time aboard, Whyte witnessed firsthand the pestilence that ravaged the ship’s occupants and resulted in mass casualties. He recounted in his diary one such instance:","\"Passing the main hatch, I got a glimpse of one of the most awful sights I ever beheld. A poor female patient was lying in one of the upper berths - dying. Her head and face were swollen to almost unnatural size, the latter being hideously deformed… Her cheeks retained their ruddy hue but the rest of her distorted countenance was of a leprous whiteness… Her afflicted husband stood by her holding a 'blessed candle' in his hand and awaiting the departure of her spirit. Death put a period to her existence shortly after I saw her. And as the sun was setting, the bereaved husband muttered a prayer over her enshrouded corpse which, as he said Amen, was lowered into the ocean.\"","Whyte was just one among the hundreds of thousands of Irish emigrants who fled the nation in search of a better life during the mid-1800s, only to be met by worse living conditions and heightened disease exposure on the cargo vessels carrying them to safety. According to Irish historian, James Donnelly, Jr., the Irish Potato Famine—typically referred to as the Great Famine by Ireland natives—was responsible for the deaths of around one million people and for the mass emigration of about a million more; in effect, the population of the country fell by as much as 25%. However, contrary to popular belief, more deaths were caused by disease than by starvation. In fact, as much as 80% of the deaths that occurred during the famine can be attributed to disease acquisition, says economic historian Joel Mokyr.","Whyte’s story, as well as the stories of all the Irish emigrants of the time period, offer an intense glimpse into what the world looked like in the 19<sup>th</sup> century—more specifically, what the world looked like absent the epidemiological measures and public health knowledge available today. The general public of Ireland’s lack of education on disease transmission was the direct cause of a fraction of emigrant deaths on pilgrimage ships during the famine. At the time of the famine, Irish citizens held many misconceptions on the actual science behind disease transmission, the majority of them believing that sickness had mythical origins. Historians like Donnelly claim that with a simple understanding of how important sanitation and diet are to health, as well as today’s understanding of how diseases are passed from person to person, the number of deaths during the famine could have been significantly lower—and Robert Whyte’s experience may have been an entirely different story."],"display_date":"May 30, 1847 - August 3, 1847","search_date":"1847-07-01","locations":[{"id":53105,"lat":45.5016889,"lng":-73.567256,"zoom":8,"place":"Montreal, QC, Canada"},{"id":53104,"lat":53.3785693,"lng":-6.0570132,"zoom":8,"place":"Howth, Ireland"}],"tags":[{"id":3476,"tag":"disease transmission"},{"id":3475,"tag":"epidemiology"},{"id":3474,"tag":"Irish Potato Famine"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":1122,"tag":"Public Health"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}}]}
