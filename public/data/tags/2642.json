Sex is everywhere. At late night weekend parties. In campus coffee shops as people fill their friends in on their latest hookup. In freshman orientations where free condoms are handed out and safe sex is highlighted. In dorm rooms as you’re trying to focus on your assigned reading and the rhythmic bang bang bang of a lofted dorm room bed hitting the cement wall is all you can hear. But how does college feel about vaginas? Not good, many women fear. Upset with the taboo subject of vaginas, upset that so many people with vaginas know so little about them and are afraid to ask, upset that so many women are subject to sexual violence within the world, and specifically on college campuses where sex is so prominent, Eve Ensler wrote the Vagina Monologues. These were a series of interviews Ensler did with a group of women in which they discussed their experiences and anything related to vaginas.","In 1998, V-Day was created, in which a group of women performed Ensler’s Vagina Monologues in order to spread awareness about and to stop violence against women. This performance led to many similar ones taking place at colleges throughout the United States.","One of these colleges includes Augustana, whose members were inspired by the organizers of V-Day and other students to put on their own performance. In 2003, Jamie Nelson, Scott Magelssen, Emily Chouinard, Amy Fischl, and Ellen Hay all began to organize the school’s very first performance, which was funded by the school’s chapter of Alpha Psi Omega. Taking place in Wallenberg hall, students with vaginas were able to read pieces from the Vagina Monologues, and the school was able to donate its proceeds to the Family Resource Center in order to aid women faced with sexual or domestic abuse. The performances have since expanded into using art, poetry, prose, etc. by Augustana students with vaginas that captures the issues of vaginas, sexuality, and sexual violence.","The creation of the Vagina Monologues, V-Day, and its increased presence on college campuses came in a time period marked by third wave feminism and it’s ideals. Issues of gender violence and reproductive rights were being discussed more and more, something that was particularly relevant to college aged women. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, women between ages 16 and 24 years are at greatest risk for rape, and for college students in particular, 9 of 10 knew the man who raped them (Gross). The issue of sexual violence is something that desperately needed to be addressed for college women. It was a reality that they were faced with, knowing that the danger of rape and violence for them and their female friends could happen, and it could be done by someone they know, someone they share classes with, someone they see everyday on the quad. It is for this reason that the Vagina Monologues took off on college campuses, as it gave these women a platform of protest with which to discuss the issues they were faced with."," "],"display_date":"February 14, 1998","search_date":"1998-02-14","locations":[{"id":41315,"lat":41.4673534696,"lng":-90.5674122327,"zoom":9,"place":"Rock Island, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":2643,"tag":"third wave feminism"},{"id":2642,"tag":"Augustana College"},{"id":2641,"tag":"Vagina Monologues"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6338,"title":"The Role Education Played in Suffrage","course_id":144,"status":"P","start_date":"1895-01-01","end_date":"12/31/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["There she was, standing before Augustana College’s class of 1915 as Valedictorian. Margaret Olmsted gave a speech at commencement on the importance on what it meant to receive a liberal education. Olmsted made the claim that a liberal arts education gave recipients a “broader view and keener insight”[1] to the world. An education such as that comes with a greater reasonability claimed Olmsted; someone that has received a liberal arts education must work to make the world a better place.[2]","At the end of the nineteenth-century and beginning of the twentieth-century women increasingly enrolled into higher education. With the influx in college attendance, women became exposed to worldly views that had been previously less available to them. With the knowledge they were gaining from college, women started to act on that knowledge, which included fighting for more rights such as suffrage.  Part of the movement occurred after the Civil War; due to the role nurses played in the war, nurses started to want more training, more education, and more responsibilities. From 1870 to 1880, white, middle class women enrolled in higher education went from 11,000 to 40,000. Women started to put their progressive education to good use.[3] Education was the catalyst that empowered many women to become involved in movements such as the suffrage movement.","As Olmsted said to her classmates as they were about to graduate, those “who understand things better and know more about the remedies for existing conditions, are more to blame if we do not endeavor to make things right.”[4] Calling to action all that received a higher education, Olmsted wanted her classmates to go forth, making the world’s wrongs into rights. Though Olmsted did not highlight which problems she was speaking of, there is little chance that Olmsted and her classmates had not heard of Alice Paul. Two years prior to the commencement speech, in 1913, college educated Alice Paul led one of the  largest parades of the time through Washington, DC.[5]  Instead of greeting soon to be President Wilson, crowds gather in support of Paul’s suffrage parade which marked the beginning of a campaign that would eventually led to the passage of the 19<sup>th</sup> amendment.[6] Two people and one group that all with college education, fighting for a better tomorrow. Paul and the nurses were clearly working for the passage of women’s suffrage. Olmsted was making broader claims for her class to get involved in bettering the world, showing how college education was a catalyst for social issue involvement.","It is clear that as more and more women began to receive higher education, women became increasingly involved in social issues. Many women had different reasons for becoming involved in the suffrage movement. One reason can easily be that as women became educated, especially with a liberal arts education like Olmsted received from Augustana College, they become more aware of social inconsistences and were equipped with the knowledge to solve those issues."," ","[1] Margaret Olmsted, “A Liberal Education,” <em>Augustana Observer: Commencement 1915 May 1915</em>, Vol. XIII.

I.M. Anderson! Anderson is rotten, rotten, rotten!”  Shouts rang throughout the quad as a large group of students assembled outside the College Building, gathered band instruments, and marched to Dr. C. E. Lindberg’s house and on to the residents of Professor I.M. Anderson, followed by Rev. A. Theo. Ekblad, before returning to the gymnasium for a mass meeting.  All the while shouting, “We want basketball, the board of directors is rotten, milk, milk, rotten, rotten.”  This was the Basketball Demonstration of 1906 during which the students (male and female) protested at the houses of several faculty members and skipped class the following day as a reaction to the Board of Director’s decision to terminate basketball at Augustana College.","The year was 1906 so it can be deduced that this decision only affected the men’s basketball team because at this time, there were no varsity women’s sports teams.  Beginning in the first decade of the twentieth century (1900-1910) Augustana had just began to allow women’s club sports teams such as basketball, and tennis (Boaden, 2011).  So the following questions can be raised about the involvement of the women present during the demonstration: Did women feel invested in men’s sports, such as basketball, because of their own growing interests in sports?  How and why were they punished for their involvement?  What does this say about athletics for men and women and how administration disciplined based on gender.","Meanwhile, at the Ladies Hall, some of the girls wanted to go to Lindblom’s (where some of the protesters were gathering) to drink coffee.  Sister Ineborg said they should stay away from the “rowdy” boys, “I hope you will conduct yourself as ladies.” The girls were not reassuring as they left the hall, “Do we have to tell you every time we go out?” said Signe Holmer, followed by Gladys Wallace, “We do want some fun; this is the deadest place” (Basketball Demonstration, 1906). This short interaction between Sister Ineborg and some of the female students demonstrates a discrepancy in the expectation of behavior for young female students held by faculty members and the young women themselves.  \tThese documents show that a relatively large group of students, including some of the young women under the supervision of Sister Ineborg, gathered and marched in protest causing a “disturbance” and “grievously insulting” faculty and board members.  Furthermore, many of the students continued to rebel into the following day by skipping class.  The administration saw this as insubordinate and unacceptable behavior from the students and assembled a committee to discuss disciplinary consequences.  The committee agreed that students partaking in the demonstration on the evening of October 23rd should be suspended from Augustana College beginning on Tuesday, November 6, until Monday, November 12.  Furthermore, the committee ruled to give additional punishment to the upper classmen involved who had leadership roles during the demonstration, and most interestingly, “the young women who partook in this demonstration”.  It seems as though the committee decided to punish all young women present during the presentation regardless of their involvement.  This could be an example of a double standard protected by the age old saying “boys will be boys”, which society uses to dismiss the poor behavior of males and hold females responsible for their actions.","Why were these women present to protest the termination of a sport they weren’t permitted to play?  Possibly due to the beginning of their own interest in intercollegiate competition, by 1906, the year of the basketball demonstration, women at Augustana had been participating in gym classes for over a decade.  Additionally, at the time of the strike, women were members of club basketball and tennis teams, as well as the Athletic Society (Boaden, 2011). The termination of men’s basketball jeopardized the chances of there every being a women’s varsity athletic team on campus, a threat many of these young women took seriously and were punished unfairly for."],"display_date":"October 23, 1906 - October 24, 1906","search_date":"1906-10-23","locations":[{"id":49835,"lat":41.4673534696,"lng":-90.5674122327,"zoom":9,"place":"Rock Island, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":2659,"tag":"Augustana Athletics"},{"id":2658,"tag":"Women's Athletics"},{"id":2657,"tag":"Womens Roles"},{"id":2642,"tag":"Augustana College"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6343,"title":"Winsome Womanhood: Christianity as a Progressive Influence on Women’s Identity and Values During the Early 20th Century","course_id":144,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"12/31/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“O Lord and Master of us all,","Whate’er our name or sign,","We own Thy sway, we hear Thy call,","We test our lives by Thine.”"," ","Winsome Womanhood, a book written by Margaret Sangster, provided young women of the early 20th century with a connection to God as well as a purpose/identity within the Christian faith. It was Sangster’s belief that all women, regardless of age, could benefit from the teachings of the Bible and understand the meaning of what it means to be a true Christian woman. Living during a time when religion was not at the forefront of what structured society, women such as Sangster were adamant about keeping the ideals of Christianity close and informing women about how the message of God can be used to empower them as individuals at every stage in their life.","The book is broken into sections directed at women of different ages and from different walks of life. A young woman of fifteen, not yet a woman and no longer a girl, would look to this book and find guidance. During this time of transition from childhood to adulthood, the only true source of wisdom cannot come from mothers or teachers alone, but from God, and young women at this stage in life were encouraged to take time for themselves and read the Bible or pray to seek the answers they needed in order to grow into well-rounded women - women of faith. “A room of her very own, a tastefully appointed and comfortably furnished as possible, should be every young girl’s retreat. Here she may enjoy the half hours for devotion which tend to the soul’s growth . . . In this, her den, her nook, her bower, her special fancies may be indulged, and her individuality find fit expression”(Sangster, 25). Winsome Womanhood was not only, then, a guide for women to find faith and keep it, but also a guide for women to find liberation and individuality through their faith as Christian women, as opposed to feeling trapped by it.","She also speaks to working women or, “The Girl in Business.” It was not uncommon for a working woman of the early 1900’s to feel diminished in her role when compared to a working man - making less money, earning less respect - but Sangster’s view on the role of working women was not so. “Many young women belittle their employment by going to it in the spirit of martyrs who pty themselves . . . Self-pity is a badge of weakness, and work done for money alone is never noble work” (Sangster, 67). It was Sangster’s belief that women should take pride in their work, as women of honor and duty within the Christian faith, and not take pride solely in their wages. This assertion was not uncommon among Christian [Protestant] society at this time, as many women and men affiliated with Protestant denominations were involved in social activism and issues such as fair wages and voting rights for women around this time, as pointed out by Lori Ginzberg in her discussion of the “benevolent” work of women. Ginzberg states that, during this era of progression, “tensions about paying wages, centralizing corporate functions, relating benevolence to government, and using funds solely for administrative purposes all came into the open” (Ginzberg, 161). Sangster’s ideas, then, in regards to Christianity as a positive influence in women’s lives could also be interpreted as viewing religion as a force for equality and empowerment during this progressive age.","Overall, the message Margaret Sangster seems to be sending with Winsome Womanhood is that women of all stages in life, all positions, all classes, could be empowered and liberated through the study and adherence to Christian ideals and faith, and that God’s word should not be ignored, even as the world progresses."," "],"display_date":"1890 - 1910","search_date":"1900-07-02","locations":[{"id":2962,"lat":41.4673534696,"lng":-90.5674122327,"zoom":9,"place":"ROCK ISLAND, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":2642,"tag":"Augustana College"},{"id":1269,"tag":"Social Morality"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":1205,"tag":"Women's History"},{"id":228,"tag":"Roles of Women"},{"id":849,"tag":"Progressive Era"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":514,"tag":"Christianity"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6349,"title":"Kappa Epsilon Nu Sorority ScrapbookAugustana College, 1945-1949","course_id":144,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/45","end_date":"12/31/49","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“To our dearest Gene - The KEN pin-up boy.

The too, a pin-up boy has such responsibility to the public (such conceit!) Therefor, insomuch as you demand an affirmative answer, I can do nothing else but accept (and with anticipated pleasure!)”"," ","The letter to the Pin-Up boy and his response both read as very playful and amusing with a hint of sarcasm as well. Accepting an invitation while admitting that some rules may have to be broke in the process (and not caring all the same) is a theme that still resonates with people in the Greek community today. The invitation to the KEN sorority pin-up boy on one page of the beginning of the scrapbook and the cheeky reply on the next is the start of a wealth of historical knowledge about a now-defunct sorority on the Augustana College Campus.","This primary document is a scrapbook from the Kappa Epsilon Nu Sorority that chronicles the years 1945 to 1949. The four years memorialized in the scrapbook saw changes in sorority members, executive board members and sorority traditions. One of their earliest surviving documents, this scrapbook is one clue that helps determine what was deemed important to the Kappa Epsilon Nu sorority and it’s members.","One of the many items in the scrapbook are pictures. There are pictures of the executive board members, pictures of the sorority members, and pictures of Augustana College. These pictures provide context of what the girls looked like, what the campus looked like and the attire of the girls at various events.","Another set of items that can be found in the scrapbook are newspaper articles. These articles make mention of KEN sorority achievements, individual achievements, sports standings and notable school events. These newspapers articles that are saved can show what the members viewed as important. Articles about the standings of the KEN sports teams and their academic standings show that they took both of those things very seriously.","Additionally, there are many items pertaining to new members and rush events. Rushing and pledging are very important to the sorority to keep getting new members and to keep growing and this is shown by all of the invitations to new member rush events and the pictures of some pledges preparing for a themed dance event. Rushing is important and “Sororities expend considerable time, effort and money to stage a ‘successful rush. For a ‘successful’ rush, a sorority must attract the ‘best’ (e.g. most attractive) pledges available to them. Each house must present an attractive image to the pledges they desire” (Risman 1982, 238).","Lastly and by far the most prominent are items related to social events. Formal and informal party and dance invitations are littered throughout the pages. The sheer amount of invitations and party-related notes show the importance of the social events to the KENs. They had annual themed dances with invitations spread throughout the year, homecoming event invitations and wedding invitations from current members and alumni. The previous items showed that they took academics and other responsibilities seriously, but social events were also a big part of the picture.","This scrapbook tells a story of what mattered to sororities in the 1940’s. The war ended, so there was an emphasis on fun and making the most of every activity. After looking at the scrapbook and looking at the stories, it is easy to conclude that the KENs were well rounded and very active in the campus community."," "],"display_date":"1945 - 1949","search_date":"1947-07-02","locations":[{"id":28076,"lat":41.4673534696,"lng":-90.5674122327,"zoom":9,"place":"Rock Island, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":2671,"tag":"KENs"},{"id":2670,"tag":"Scrapbooks"},{"id":2669,"tag":"Sororities"},{"id":2668,"tag":"Kappa Epsilon Nu"},{"id":2642,"tag":"Augustana College"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6350,"title":"Dorm Life at Augustana: Early 1900’s","course_id":144,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/05","end_date":"12/31/30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Ah the college life.  Something many today take for granted.  Back in the early 20th century not everyone had the opportunity to go to college, especially women.  At the time, it wasn’t seen as important for a women to have an education.  But this didn’t stop all women; some desired to be doctors, lawyers, and other such professionals.  So these women needed to go to school somewhere to get this education.  One of the places they could go was a little private Lutheran school called Augustana College.  Located in Rock Island, Illinois, Augustana was a great school with a beautiful campus and a style all its own.  But unfortunately for Augustana’s history, it also had it’s faults.","Gender was a major player in early 20th century America.  We see women pushing for equality harder than ever before but in order to do that, we have to understand the inequalities that everyday women faced.  The everyday woman we’ll look at is the Augustana College woman.  She pushed against the habits of older generations of women and decided to get herself educated.  Where would she see everyday gender discrimination?  In the place she would call her home: the dorms.","Augustana, as a college of high morals and great education, had rules for its students to follow.  While it had a generalized version for all students, which never really mentioned any gender differences, the rules for the dorms, which were separated by gender, painted a much different picture.  There is a series of documents which showcase some of these rules in President Andreens file at Augustana College.  The documents, for the most part, are typed up rules and regulations for men and women at Augustana from 1901-1935.  When reading the rules for men, one can see little difference between them and the rules for all students.  There are some gender specific rules added like “In general, every student should remember that his conduct is ever to be gentlemanly”.  This one popped up throughout 30 years of rules but one that popped up in the late 1920’s was a ruling specifically banning “lady friends… in the private rooms”.  For a lutheran college this isn’t surprising but is still a notable mention on gender.","When you go over into looking at the woman's rules however, one can see much stricter rules about how they should act, what they could and could not do as well as when they could not do it.  For example if an Augustana female wanted to go to the cities for any reason, they had to notify the lady principle.  There was no mention of that in any of the rules for males.  The women also had a rule similar to the “gentlemen rule” mentioned early except theirs was much more specific and was reinforced as the subject of a note written to the ladies in the dorms by the lady principle (during one of the years in 1901-1935).  Women had specially set times for when they could use the showers.  Men had specific times as well but they had over double the amount of hours per week to get into the showers (men at 30 hrs/week, women at 14 hrs/week).  One of the most surprising rules, which was never mentioned in the mens rules, was that in order to go home and visit their parents, the girl in question had to have a signed letter from one of their parents or guardians to do so.  Men, it appears, had no such restriction.","While the amount of rule differences and inequalities might seem a bit intense, it was simply part of the times.  During this time period, the University of Alabama, the college tried to ban certain types of dances at formal events because it caused the older generations, and the students parents, “endless concern”.  Lisa Dorr, a writer about Alabama women in  Alabama Heritage, writes that “Social engagements had changed considerably since the era when [her] parents had be of student age, and many adults feared such activities could lead only to depravity”.  It wasn’t just at Augustana where these kinds of things were happening.  Women of this time were still seen as delicate and pure and a college wanted to do whatever it could to keep its upstanding reputation.  If the parents of students had seen acts of depravity happening at the campus, then they would probably not let their son or daughter to attend."],"display_date":"1905 - 1930","search_date":"1917-12-31","locations":[{"id":49835,"lat":41.4673534696,"lng":-90.5674122327,"zoom":9,"place":"Rock Island, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":2642,"tag":"Augustana College"},{"id":1404,"tag":"Rock Island"},{"id":1758,"tag":"Gender"},{"id":2672,"tag":"Dorm Life"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}}]}
