The neighborhoods revolved around the two main commercial streets of Hastings and St. Antoine. Hastings Street was established in 1927, by Eurotas Parma Lee Hastings. He was born in New York but moved to Detroit in 1925 and named the President of the Bank of Michigan. After that, he was named the assignee in bankruptcy and settled over 660 cases of bankruptcy. He was influential in the beginnings of an industrial and economically driven Detroit. As European immigration rolls on, a large Eastern European Jewish community arises. It isn’t until the early 1910s that a Black community is developed. The origins of Hastings street shed light on the fact that Black Bottom was not originally a black community, its past lies on a conglomerate of immigrants from a variety of nations."],"display_date":1927,"search_date":"1927-07-02","citations":[{"divid":1395013843,"type":"Article","data":["Andy Osterdahl","Eurotas Parmalee Hastings (1791-1966)","The Strangest Names in American Political History","1","October 9, 2011","1"]},{"divid":1395013953,"type":"Article","data":["Orlin James","Hastings Street","Historian for the Detroit News","1","May 20,1926","1"]}],"locations":[{"id":8181,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2075,"tag":"Eurotas Parma Lee Hasting"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1999,"tag":"Hastings Street"},{"id":1914,"tag":"Black Bottom"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}
