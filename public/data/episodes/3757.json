Bruce paid to place an advertisement in the Richmond Whig newspaper on December 12, 1862. The advertisement was a call for people of the county of Halifax to meet for the benefit of their Confederate soldiers. The ad called for the raising of money and clothing for our soldiers in the field. James C. Bruce paid 3 for the ad.","James C. Bruce's call for war donations gives insight into the Confederate Government's struggle to provide enough supplies for the war effort. The South lacked the industrial capabilities that the North possessed. Also, the lack of an adequate rail road system in the South made the distribution of supplies a logistical nightmare. Essential supplies, such as food and clothes, were slow to arrive to soldiers in need. To help counteract this problem, local communities often donated what it could to support local regiments.
