Vann Woodward calls sentimental liberalism' and romantic paternalism.' Instead, Populists appealed to Negros from the perspective of shared poverty and hardship. Populist leaders such as Georgia's Tom Watson declared that his People's party' would offer a platform beneficial to both races and injurious to neither.' In what historian C. Vann Woodward calls a heroic gesture,' Watson carried this vision out by successfully pressing for an anti-lynch law plank in the party's platform in 1896, a year in which Georgia led the nation in lynchings."],"display_date":1896,"search_date":"1896-07-01","citations":[{"divid":1214330603,"type":"Book","data":["C.
