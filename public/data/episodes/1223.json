Republicans generally supported these bills, but the Democrats fiercely resisted them.  An Alabama editor charged that those in the north who were in support of a Force Bill were merely out for the blood of the South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a moment of triumph, the Democrats were able to get the Force Bill set aside, and focused the legislature's energy to work on a financial bill.  This effectively shelved the Force Bill on a national level.  The Republicans were very angry, and charged the democrats with taking advantage of the absence of their members in passing the vote.  Although the measure only passed 34-29, many Democrats were very pleased with the vote.  For quite some time, the Democrats had been unsuccessful in their attempts to end the Force Bill's consideration."],"display_date":"January 5, 1891","search_date":"1891-01-05","citations":[{"divid":1214239267,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","Enterprise and Mountaineer","Greenville","January 14, 1891",""]},{"divid":1214239296,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","Birmingham Age-Herald","","January 1, 1891",""]}],"locations":[{"id":871,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
