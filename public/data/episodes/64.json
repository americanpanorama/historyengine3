The man, John Duberry, was caught distributing the speeches of Senators Sumner and Seward amongst slaves in Columbus, Mississippi.  For committing a crime' such as this, Duberry could have received a sentence of ten years in jail.  Unfortunately though, the newspaper did not print a follow up to this short article, so the fate of John Duberry remains uncertain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With publications by Harriet Beecher Stowe, Emma Southworth and other abolitionists, southerners with share-holdings in slavery became increasingly infuriated with anti-slavery propaganda.'  Southerners blamed northern influence for inciting any unrest that occurred with the enslaved people, always asserting that slaves were content in their roles.  As abolitionism gained strength, white southerners became increasingly protective of their institution, creating a big schism between the two sides.  This schism brought about subsequent secession, followed by war."],"display_date":"August 15, 1856","search_date":"1856-08-15","citations":[{"divid":1213136599,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["Abolition Documents at the South","The Daily Dispatch","","August 15, 1856","1"]},{"divid":1213136624,"type":"Book","data":["Robert O&#39;Brien, editor","The Encyclopedia of the South",null,"New York","Smithmark Publishers","1985","1-2"]},{"divid":1213136668,"type":"Book","data":["Dorothy Denneen Volo &amp; James M.
