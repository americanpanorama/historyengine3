Lee, who died in 1870, the administration of The Virginia Military Academy and the local government of Lexington, Virginia made a grand affair of the arrival of his sarcophagus. &lt;br /&gt;   It seemed the trend of the year to be remembering the man, as similar action happened at Washington and Lee University, where he was buried. The school was selling portraits of Lee in order to fund a grand memorial on the school grounds, and was popular amongst the general public as well as those important men remaining from the Confederacy, including Jefferson Davis. Lastly, a collection of documents from Lee's life including letters and writings was commissioned by the Lee estate and published to widespread publicity and critical raves. Lee's ambiguous personal feelings about slavery allowed the public of the south to hold him close to their hearts without appearing regressive, especially in the eyes of the Northerners and African-Americans."],"display_date":1875,"search_date":"1875-07-02","citations":[{"divid":1217097340,"type":"Book","data":["Douglas W.
