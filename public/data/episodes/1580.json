R. Tillman, the South Carolina House was divided between those democrats for the incumbent, Govener Richardson, and the self-proclaimed \"Farmer's Movement\" which according to The Washington Post on September 6th was comprised by \"dissatisfied elements of the State, ex-Greenbackers, and Republicans\".&lt;br /&gt;The Farmer's movement had been growing throughout the 1880's and in 1888 had for the second time barely lost control of the State Democratic Convention, but they gained power in the house.  One of their main issues was more accessible representation which was denied in the 1888 state primary.  The farmers felt that their voice was being overshadowed by the larger landholders and bankers, and felt that if they had better access to their representative they would be better heard.  They succeeded in passing a bill in the following year that forced congressmen give a speech in each county in their constituency."],"display_date":"November 1, 1888","search_date":"1888-11-01","citations":[{"divid":1215628040,"type":"Book","data":["David Duncan Wallace","South Carolina, a short history, 1520-1948",null,"Chapel Hill, NC","University of North Carolina Press","1951",""]},{"divid":1215628072,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["THE &amp;34;FARMERS&#39; MOVEMENT&amp;34;; Divides the Democratic Party of South Carolina into Factions","The Washington Post","Washington, D.C.","September 6, 1888","1"]},{"divid":1215628115,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["What Mr. Tillman?s Committee Did Last Night","The News and Courier","Charleston, SC","July 11, 1888","1"]}],"locations":[{"id":1154,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
