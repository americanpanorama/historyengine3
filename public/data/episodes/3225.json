In fact, they raided and looted all across Texas in response to the constant threat of losing even more territory. While Indians succeeded by burning stations and driving settlers from their homes, their actions spurred many more debates, conventions, and other attempts to deal with the Indians. One attempt to coexist with the Indians was through the creation of reservations. Some Indians were able to acclimate, while others with a more nomadic lifestyle found it quite difficult. Tensions continued between the Indians and settlers as more settlers encroached on the reservation land and Indians continued to raid and roam throughout Texas and Mexico. In fact, the dangerous raids and attacks performed by the Indians forced several local volunteer units and the United States army to become involved. A convention was later assembled that structured and firmly established the United States and Texas's view of the Indian nuisance. The resolutions of Dr. R. G. Worrall of Jacksboro, adopted in Galveston in April, 1860, articulated the general public sentiment by stating All Indians were hostile and should be exterminated or expelled from the State and that the frontier must not be contracted. By 1860, Texas had decided its involvement with the Indians.
