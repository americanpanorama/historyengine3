Blackmon, estimates that more than hundred thousand African Americans in Alabama alone were arrested and leased out to various private companies and that by the fourth year of the convict lease program, nearly 45 percent of those in captivity died from abuse, disease, and working conditions.  Following the Civil War, convict lease systems, such as Alabama’s, began to spring up all over the South.  They became so popular that by the end of Reconstruction, every Southern state except Virginia had adopted the convict lease system.","What this picture shows is a very real part of Birmingham’s past that most modern day residents are unaware of.  With the abolition of slavery following the Civil War, many just assume that the practice was forever wiped away from the Southern landscape.  Yes, there were laws separating the races and African Americans were second class citizens, but they could not be forced to work against their will.","When many think of Birmingham past, they think of fire hoses, dogs, church bombings, and Bull Conner.  Those were dark and shameful ties that the city’s residents are still dealing with in the present day.  However, that was not the beginning of Birmingham’s controversial past.  The city relied heavily on leased labor both to maintain its roads and to fill the mines and plants which turned Birmingham into a giant."],"display_date":"1909 - 1928","search_date":"1919-01-01","citations":[{"divid":1343239647,"type":"Primary Source in a Secondary Source","data":["Street workers with Guards, 100 Block 24th St. North","August 10, 1909","Birmingham View: Through the Years in Photographs","Pierce, Lewis, and Marjorie L.
