Some of these freedoms include the desegregation of schools and public areas and African American assimilation into society. This great shift allowed women such as Eleanor Mitchell teach in private universities such as Rollins College.

[1]Eleanor Mitchell was the first African-American professor at Rollins College to teach an International Relation courses.  She would later lead the first study aboard trip to explore Africa.  Mitchell goal was “insure that anyone who is interested, could find career opportunity information on international relations.”  During the trip to Africa, student would explore Senegal, Dakar, Liberia’s capital Monrovia, Ghana’s capital Accra, and the last stop Nigeria; which was the “slave coast”, where the slaves would have to wait until they were shipped off to the United States.[2] Following the trip to Africa, she was able to take four students from Rollins to the Model U.N session held at Auburn University, At the Model U.N session these students won a trophy for participating in the French Delegation.Still relatively young at 24, Mitchell opted to continue her studies in political science in Tallahassee.
