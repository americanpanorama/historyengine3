Houston spoke in opposition to the passage of the Nebraska Bill on the grounds of violation of Indian treaties.  The National Intelligencer wrote that he reminded his fellow senators that the good faith of this Government was pledged on more than one occasion to the Indian tribes that the lands included in the contemplated Territories should be perpetually reserved for their sole use and enjoyment, and that even the invasion by traders and other white men of this domain was an infraction of treaties by the civilized upon the savage, by the powerful upon the defenceless [sic].  Even at such an early point in the proceedings regarding the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which would not be passed for three more months, other senators objected to the bill on behalf of their concerned citizens, but no words were spoken for those indigenous people who already lived in the disputed territory.  Southerners feared that the government was encroaching upon the right to own slaves, but the only free people whose rights were immediately being infringed upon were the Native-Americans."],"display_date":"February 15, 1854","search_date":"1854-02-15","citations":[{"divid":1214247151,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","National Intelligencer","","February 15, 1854","3"]}],"locations":[{"id":426,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
