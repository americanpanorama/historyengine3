In the beginning of WWI the United States could only muster up around 100,000 troops who were ready to fight. In order to strengthen our armed forces, President Wilson adopted the conscription act which boosted our armed forces to over 2 million soldiers. With the help of the United States the allied forces were able to take down Germany and win the war.","Detroit was greatly involved in WWI as much as it was in WWII. Detroit production changed from cars to supplying are military with motor trucks and airplanes which Colonel P.S Bond said would play a large part in winning the war. Nearly 40 percent of Detroitâ€™s male population was sent off to fight in the war which brought a surge of women into the workforce. Detroit was a central power in the efforts to help the fight in WWI and the city was rapidly expanding. In a 1917 Detroit Free Press article, they state how Detroit banks were expecting the war and were well prepared for it. They also stated how the automobile industry is evolving and is only going to benefit Detroit in their upcoming expansion of the city."],"display_date":"April 6, 1917 - April 6, 1918","search_date":"1917-10-05","citations":[{"divid":1396322434,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["DETROIT CARS TO DECIDE WAR","Detroit Free Press","Detroit, Michigan","December 25,1917","8"]},{"divid":1396322543,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["DETROIT SENDS YOUTHS TO WAR","Detroit Free Press","Detroit, Michigan","September 10, 1917","5"]},{"divid":1396322613,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["DETROIT'S POSITION IS MOST SECURE OF WORLD'S BIG CITIES","Detroit Free Press","Detroit, Michigan","April 9, 1917","9"]},{"divid":1396322669,"type":"Website","data":["History Channel","U.S. Enters World War I","A&amp;E Network","http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/us-enters-world-war-i","March 31, 2014"]}],"locations":[{"id":8231,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2169,"tag":"President Wilson"},{"id":1918,"tag":"Detroit Free Press"},{"id":665,"tag":"Conscription"},{"id":228,"tag":"Roles of Women"},{"id":240,"tag":"WWI"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}}
