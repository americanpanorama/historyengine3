As an unintended result the maps provide excellent uses for seeing how the area of the city limits of Greenville changed by such things as size, additions in terms of adding to the infrastructure of the city and then removing objects that got in the way of the new places that were trying to either get improved or if a completely new addition was being planned. One of the main things, which we went over in class, was the improving of the roads situation in Greenville, not only were there additions to the road system but there were also improvements made on the exisiting roads to help the infrastructure improve the allure of the city hopefully leading to more people wanting to live there. This map of providing an image where clearly the main part of the city of Greenville placed an emphasis on roads reminded me of the example in class where the image of New York was shown and the main thing that stuck was not the tall buildings which is normally thought of when New York, but it is the roads that were clearly defined and did not have the clutter which is also normally associated with New York. In the article, \"The Urban Development of the South by Walter Mather, he states that \"any study of urban growth must include not only the central political units in urban aggregation but also the suburbs, the satellite cities and the regions of high population density lyign far beyond political boundaries.\"(Matherly 10). This secondary source explores the concept we discussed in class, where does the city limity of Greenville end and should places right outside the actual limits be included when talking about urban Greenville? It was interesting to see the development of University Park, which is something that was touched on in our meeting downtown when we visitied Falls Park, the forging of more public space for the use of all people in a society that allows for more people to flock to an area. the use of unused space to turn it into public space has been a constant theme in the Greenville area and has been a driving force for more development and in some cases renewal of parts of the city that have been broken down. Lastly, one can plainly see that the major part of the city of Greenville has grown more crowded than it has ten years ago. The population growth is also included in this map."],"display_date":"1888 - 1898","search_date":"1893-07-01","citations":[{"divid":1413941294,"type":"Image","data":["Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps","Greenville and 1888 and 1898","","Map","scale: 50ft to an inch","","http://digital.tcl.sc.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/SFMAPS/id/1459/rec/4",""]},{"divid":1414507780,"type":"Article","data":["Walter J.
