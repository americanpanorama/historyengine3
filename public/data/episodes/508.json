On September 15th (in honor of Mexican independence) President Guerrero had sent out a proclamation abolishing slavery throughout the Republic. The object of this was to check emigration from the US. At this time there were over 1000 slaves in Texas, so Houston obviously fought the application of this proclamation in Texas, and in December he succeeded. By the end of 1829 immigration was booming. In November and December alone, 153 new families immigrated to Texas. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after hearing of the suspension of the decree he wrote his brother-in-law, again urging him to move to Texas. I have never been so thoroughly convinced as I now am of the future rapid rise of this country;.This is the most liberal and munificent Gov. on earth to emigrants. After being here one year you will oppose a change to Uncle Sam;all the difficulties as to slaves;are removed;and I have no doubt that in a few years this will be a slave state.' The optimism of Sam Houston towards the future success of slavery in Texas is amazing considering how nearly it had come to extinction merely days before his letter. With such a dogmatic attitude towards the future success of Slavery from Texas' leader it is easy to see how the institution became so important and ingrained in the mindsets of Texans and of the slave holding South in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emigration to Texas was not only encouraged by Sam Houston, but was publicized widely. A man returned from Texas to Franklin, Tennessee and reported the present conditions there. Many Americans were purported to have settled there, and that many have already been well settled.' The society is described as pastoral and wealth is said to be based on how much livestock is owned. Law is also said to be present in Texas with the settlement of four lawyers in San Felipe. Another sign of the presence of law is the statement that many fugitives have been captured there and returned to be punished in the States."],"display_date":"December 31, 1829","search_date":"1829-12-31","citations":[{"divid":1213896174,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","The Western Balance","Franklin, Tennessee","June 19, 1829",""]},{"divid":1213896222,"type":"Article","data":["Eugene C.
