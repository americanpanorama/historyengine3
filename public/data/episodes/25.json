It was a massive project proposal that took many months of negotiations between the Maryland State legislature and the Chesapeake Company. The Maryland Gazette, based in Annapolis Maryland, reported that the cost of the operation to be in the range of five hundred to seven hundred thousand dollars and expected to be completed in Maryland within a ten year time frame.&lt;br /&gt;The railroad line began at the port of Baltimore and ended at what is today,Wheeling West Virginia. The Baltimore-Ohio line shortened the time and distance to transport goods from the West to the East. Before the creation of the line, goods would travel north on the Erie Canal and then southeastwards towards Maryland. This route was long and tedious. The Baltimore-Ohio Railroad was created with the intention in mind to cut the time traveled in half. The full line took about 25 years to complete and eventually, the railway did succeed at providing a faster more efficient route to transfer goods."],"display_date":"July 4, 1828 - January 1, 1853","search_date":"1840-10-02","citations":[{"divid":1213034840,"type":"Book","data":["Richard Walsh and William Fox","Maryland: A History, 1632-1974",null,"Baltimore","Maryland Historical Society","1974","193"]},{"divid":1214317772,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","Maryland Gazette","Annapolis, MD","August 27, 1828",""]}],"locations":[{"id":15,"lat":39.2464830538,"lng":-76.5960396412,"zoom":9,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
