Greeley said that the purpose of his trip was to vindicate the North from the popular opinion that the North was trying to oppress the South and to explain to southerners that the northerners and southerners were all Americans interested in the prosperity of united country. &lt;br /&gt;Southerners did not agree with all of Horace Greeley's report, but they did give him credit for accurately describing the corruption and misrule that was prevalent in the South during Reconstruction. Greeley's report focused on the Ku Klux Klan activity and the carpetbaggers. Greeley admitted that many of the carpetbaggers in the South were in fact thieves, but not all of them were trying to exploit the South while it was vulnerable. Greeley also offered suggestions to the Republican Party for how it could fix some of the problems in the South."],"display_date":"June 21, 1871","search_date":"1871-06-21","citations":[{"divid":1213903070,"type":"Book","data":["Eric Foner","Reconstruction: America?s Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877",null,"New York","Harper and Row Publishers","1988","501-510"]},{"divid":1213903145,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["Horace Greeley","The Louisville Courier Journal","","June 21, 1871",""]},{"divid":1213903178,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["Mr. Greeley on the Southern Situation","The Charleston Daily Courier","","June 17, 1871",""]}],"locations":[{"id":729,"lat":38.162938219,"lng":-79.1288846564,"zoom":9,"place":"AUGUSTA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
