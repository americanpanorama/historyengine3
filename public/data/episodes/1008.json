A similar Bill had been passed earlier in Vermont.  The main conflict in this situation is difference between a state and federal law, which takes precedence etc.  The South was using the power of the Federal government to keep the Fugitive Slave Act alive.&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after these Bills against the Fugitive Slave Act were created, the Free states created Personal-Liberty laws. These laws extended legal rights to fugitive slaves in Northern states.  Wisconsin even went a step further and ruled that the Fugitive Slave Act was void in their state because it was contrary to state law."],"display_date":"January 25, 1851","search_date":"1851-01-25","citations":[{"divid":1213902685,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","Times Picayune","","January 25, 1851",""]},{"divid":1213902705,"type":"Book","data":["James A.
