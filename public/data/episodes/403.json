The leaders, Samuel H. Worchester and Arthur O. Brickman, implored all those who wished to live so as to prepare themselves for the world of heaven to congregate with them and to help form and Association of Societies and eventually a New Church of the United States. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the midst of a time when politics and economic panic seemed to dominate one must not lose sight of the pervasive influence of religion in the lives of Americans, both in the North and the South.  Religion, in fact, many times functioned as a unifier. For, as can be seen in the extension of the invitation to both Slave and Free states, slaveholders and non-slaveholders believed in the same God, belonged to the same New Church. They were anything but opposite; indeed, they were more alike than dissimilar."],"display_date":"November 10, 1857 - December 30, 1857","search_date":"1857-12-05","citations":[{"divid":1214504162,"type":"Manuscript","data":["","To the Members of the Lord&amp;#39;s New Church Broadside , broadside",null,"","","","Special Collections Library, University of Virginia"]}],"locations":[{"id":301,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
