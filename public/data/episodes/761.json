The Cherokees had occupied what McMinn estimated to be five to seven million acres of land between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers.  He encouraged the Tennessee legislature to enact laws to Â“guard the poor against the watchful speculator' (Raleigh Minerva), since there would now be a lot of new land available that the Cherokees had given up in the treaty.  He did not explain how the treaty came about, but it was documented nonetheless. &lt;br /&gt;A commission headed by Andrew Jackson and Tennessee Governor Joseph McMinn sought to solve some of the problems between whites and Native-Americans in the Louisiana Territory.  Problems had arisen when President Thomas Jefferson encouraged the Cherokee Indians in Tennessee to relocate to the Louisiana Purchase.  However, he had failed to specify land that they could have, and much of it was occupied by white settlers.  Jackson and McMinn offered the Cherokees land along the Arkansas River and the White River, in return for the Cherokees vacating their land in Georgia east of the Chatahoochie River and the Sequatchie Valley in Tennessee, and giving up all their claims in the Alabama Territory.  The U.S. government would pay for the expenses of all Indians migrating west.  As they migrated west, they promised to relinquish all claims to the land as they moved off of it.  The Tennessee Cherokees agreed, and the agreement became the Jackson-McMinn Treaty.  Other counties which gained land as a result of the treaty were Grundy, Bledsoe, Van Buren, and Warren."],"display_date":"October 12, 1817","search_date":"1817-10-12","citations":[{"divid":1213661386,"type":"Book","data":["Robert E.
