Grant County is formed from three other counties and they all still remain counties also.  There will be 637 miles that encompass this county.  This formation shows the westward movement that is occurring during this stage of the south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. FLB Goodwin is from Georgia and he wrote to the Atlanta constitution during this time period.  He also moved west, however to California.  He wrote to tell people to stay home where all is comfortable and they do not have to try and start new things.  He flees for the glory of California and says that he believes that the distance is what made it sound so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between Goodwin and the formation of Grant County is a key point.  The difference is that Grant County was formed from three other counties, as mentioned before.
