Alex Manly, the editor of the Wilmington Daily Record, had prior to the event, written an article that directly insulted white men and their ability to take care of their women. The article, which was printed by an African American newspaper company, spurred the racial tensions that already were prominent in the region. In response to the article, Waddell and his supporters surged through the city and ultimately burnt down the Daily Record's headquarters. Fourteen African American men lost their lives in the affair.&lt;br /&gt;In the days following the riots, R.R.
