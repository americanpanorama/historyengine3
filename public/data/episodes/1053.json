One such ruling regarded the Homestead Law, in which the South Carolina Supreme Court effectively ruled that land owners would have their land holdings exempt from repossession in the event of a debt default while those that did not own land would be entitled to no protection at all.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In another ruling, the South Carolina Supreme Court decided to accept the rulings of the Â“Bond Court' created by the state legislature to settle the state's reconstruction era debts.  This ruling effectively mandated that South Carolina would pay back the bulk of the states debt while repudiating 1,126,173 worth of debt. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, both of these ruling signified the consolidation of power by the bourbon elite in the South Carolina government.  In these cases, the court's rulings furthered the interests of the wealthy by protecting their land from repossession, and their bonds from repudiation.  These rulings were in line with the general program of the bourbon Democratic governor Wade Hampton, to end the legacy of reconstruction and consolidate conservative control."],"display_date":"October 28, 1879","search_date":"1879-10-28","citations":[{"divid":1213905453,"type":"Book","data":["William Cooper","The Conservative Regime: South Carolina 1877-1890",null,"Baltimore","The Johns Hopkins Press","1968","24, 49-50"]},{"divid":1213905482,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","The Enterprise and Mountaineer ","Greenville, South Carolina","November 12, 1879",""]}],"locations":[{"id":752,"lat":33.9914893238,"lng":-80.8577865567,"zoom":9,"place":"RICHLAND, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
