This increase in the Mosquito population  helped fuel the 1847 Yellow Fever epidemic only a few months later. ","According to the World Health Organization only approximately 15% of current cases of Yellow Fever reach the second more deadly stage of the virus that is deadly.  Though there is no concrete data that suggests what the mortality rate of Yellow Fever was in 1847, limited medical knowledge about the treatment of the virus probably led to more deaths then is witnessed today.  The Yellow Fever epidemic likely affected many of the plantations around Paul Cameron’s in Alabama.  Slaves spent countless hours outside during the harvest seasons increasing their exposure to the virus.  Charles Lewellyn would have been fighting a losing battle against Yellow Fever during the harvest months because of this.  Though even a Yellow Fever epidemic would not stop the harvesting on plantation of countless amounts of money in crops. "],"display_date":1847,"search_date":"1847-07-02","citations":[{"divid":1258492795,"type":"Website","data":["Dr. Kevin Oliver, Dr. John Lee, Dr. Carl Young","The Plantation Letters","College of Education at North Carolina State University","http://www.plantationletters.com/","Novermber 2009"]},{"divid":1258493033,"type":"Website","data":["Charles Lewellyn","The Plantation Letters","UNC Libraries","http://www.plantationletters.com/lewellyn/Charles_Lewellyn_1847_10_20_TR.swf","Novermber 2009"]},{"divid":1258493191,"type":"Website","data":["Charles Lewellyn","The Plantation Letters","UNC Libraries","http://www.plantationletters.com/lewellyn/Charles_Lewellyn_1846_4_30_TR.swf","Novermber 2009"]},{"divid":1258493257,"type":"Website","data":["WHO Media Centre","Yellow Fever","World Health Organization","http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs100/en/","November 2009"]},{"divid":1258493364,"type":"Website","data":["Wikipedia","List of Epidemics","Wikipedia","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics","November 2009"]},{"divid":1258493451,"type":"Website","data":["Wikipedia","Yellow Fever","Wikipedia","http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever","November 2009"]}],"locations":[{"id":4234,"lat":36.0638291279,"lng":-79.1821891988,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, North Carolina"},{"id":4233,"lat":32.7925598314,"lng":-87.8378038018,"zoom":9,"place":"GREENE, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":417,"tag":"Plague"},{"id":400,"tag":"Cameron family"},{"id":220,"tag":"alabama"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":403,"tag":"Yellow Fever"}],"course":{"name":"Contemporary Issues in Social Studies Education","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":38,"school_id":30}}
