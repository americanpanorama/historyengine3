In 1896, modern women were taking advantage of the liberties to congregate together in clubs as their husbands did. One evening about sixty to seventy ladies, with permission, sat down together at the club to where their husbands usually dined. The food prepared for them and the entertainment provided was 'unluxurious' in comparison to what they figured their husbands enjoyed on a regular basis while they sat alone at home every night. The dinner was an exercise for the women to get out and enjoy the 'glorious' life for one night that they expected that their husbands lived, but they were rudely awakened. However experimental and un satisfying the event was for the ladies, it still shows how in the late 1900s, women were beginning to take advantage of and explore their rights.
