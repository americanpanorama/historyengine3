In 1871, the Chicago fire made it possible for a college to be established in Memphis because the fire destroyed the Brother's Academy in Chicago. The Memphis order now had enough men to establish the Christian Brothers College in Memphis because the fire relieved some brothers from duty in Chicago. Brother Maurelian from Pass Christian, Mississippi served as the first president of the college. The college was founded on Adams Avenue on November 19, 1871. &lt;br /&gt;The Catholic religion was not a predominant religion in Tennessee in 1871. Methodists and Baptists formed the majority religions in Tennessee. Following the Civil War, there was a rapid development of higher education institutions in Tennessee, most of which originated from Methodist or Baptist tradition."],"display_date":"November 19, 1871","search_date":"1871-11-19","citations":[{"divid":1214946594,"type":"Book","data":["Robert Corlew","Tennessee: A Short History",null,"Knoxville, TN","University of Tennessee","1981","395-401"]},{"divid":1214946683,"type":"Online Encyclopedia","data":["The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture Online","Christian Brothers University","http://160.36.208.47/FMPro?-db=tnencyc.fp5&amp;-format=tdetail.htm&amp;-lay=web&amp;entry=1871&amp;-recid=32891&amp;-find","September 13, 2005"]}],"locations":[{"id":763,"lat":38.2154428284,"lng":-85.1947655868,"zoom":10,"place":"SHELBY, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
