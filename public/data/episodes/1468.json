The trial of Alice Mitchell began in Memphis on July 18.  Her defense entered a plea of present insanity.  Many love letters between Freda and Alice were read at the trial, and Lillie Johnson testified that they had plans to elope.  A medical expert believed that Alice Mitchell was a sexual pervert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On July 27, Alice Mitchell was put on the witness stand, and she described the murder without a trace of remorse.  She said that she cut Freda's throat because she couldn't have her.  Her statements helped convince the jury of her insanity.  On July 30, Alice Mitchell was declared insane by the jury after twenty minutes' deliberation.  On this verdict Mitchell was sent to an asylum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trial revealed the public's reaction to homosexuality.  Through the jury's decision, society was saying that romantic relations between two upper class white women were insane.  Alice Mitchell's love for Freda Ward challenged the notion of the traditional white male-dominated households."],"display_date":"July 18, 1892 - July 30, 1892","search_date":"1892-07-24","citations":[{"divid":1215624316,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["Alice Mitchell?s Case","Nashville Banner","","July 18,1892","1"]},{"divid":1215624335,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["The Mitchell Trial","Nashville Banner","","July 19, 1892","1"]},{"divid":1215624372,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["Alice on the Stand","Nashville Banner","","July 27, 1892","1"]},{"divid":1215624458,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["Alice Mitchell Insane","Nashville Banner","","July 30, 1892","1"]},{"divid":1215624861,"type":"Book","data":["Lisa Duggan","Sapphic Slashers: Sex, Violence, and American Modernity",null,"Durham, NC","Duke University Press","2000",""]}],"locations":[{"id":1063,"lat":35.182488505,"lng":-89.8964012565,"zoom":9,"place":"SHELBY, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
