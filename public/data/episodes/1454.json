Reuben F. Kolb, the Populist candidate for governor, led the most formidable opposition to the Democratic Party seen in fifteen years.  The election filled every office, and a wide variety of local candidates attracted much interest.  This election had the largest number of votes cast ever in Alabama's history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Official returns showed the election to be a Democratic success.  Thomas G. Jones, the Democratic candidate for governor, won by a vote of 126,959 to 115,524 a victory of 11,435 votes.  Yet Kolb won in eight more counties than Jones and had received a majority of the white votes.  Jones defeated Kolb because of his huge success in the Black Belt counties.  In these counties, Anti-Alliance Democrats used their control over the election process to manipulate the system and collect black votes.  They threatened, intimidated, and bribed voters and stole ballot boxes.  This was one of the most fraudulent elections in Alabama."],"display_date":"August 1, 1892","search_date":"1892-08-01","citations":[{"divid":1215623547,"type":"Book","data":["C.
