Much of the incentive to leave Ireland was due to the unfavorable living conditions in the Irish countryside According to the Irish who remained in Ireland, many of the women were frustrated by the male dominated agricultural society and had left their homes in hopes of finding luck in the United States.  These oversea journeys were life threatening, but foreigners were willing to take a chance.  To the immigrants, anything was better than what they were leaving back home.[4]","A portion of the women immigrating to the United States via Ellis Island had their voyages paid for by other relatives already living in America; however, it was not uncommon for the father to emigrate first, earn money, and then send it back home to pay for his other family member’s voyages or for a family to emigrate as a group or for single members to travel alone.","These girls faced many difficulties in America, due to the fact that they were uprooted from their homes in Ireland.  Previously, these Irish women were accustomed to working around the house and caring for others, but life in America was going to be much different.  Once the young women arrived, they needed to begin to search for work immediately.  Coming from an area where most people were agriculturalists, their transition to an area in the heart of New York City was drastically different from their familiar surroundings.","Of all the different groups of immigrants, Irish women were of the greatest amount.  This difference was due to the “emergence of the modern Irish family structure”  With the newly evolving land and family forms that were coming about, there was a decrease in the number of children emigrating.  Between the years of 1852 to 1921 the median age for female immigrants was 21.2 years old.  This age was “younger than the median age of marriage”, and therefore explains the reason why so many of the immigrants got married upon arriving in America.[5]","“Emigration was the end of peasant live in Europe; it was also the beginning of life in America”.[6]  Ireland depended on their crops for survival, and therefore life was miserable at home for many of the Irish families.  Providing for everyone became difficult, and as a result many Irish left their familiar hometowns to start a new life in America.  The decision to come to America marked a huge milestone in an individual’s life, because they were leaving their native land and putting their lives at risk. Assimilating to life in America was not going to be easy, and immigrants needed to be taught about the way of life in America.","[1] Diner, Professor Hasia R.. \"The Search for Bread: Patterns of Female Migration.\" In <em>Erin's Daughters in America: Irish Immigrant Women in the Nineteenth Century (The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science)</em>.
