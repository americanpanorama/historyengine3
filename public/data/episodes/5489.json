Therefore, the cottages looked temporary and were overshadowed by four or five story high tenement buildings.  The tenements had no water supply, no fire escapes, and inadequate garbage collection.","The site Addams described in 1910 was her creation.  Hull-House came to life during the time of Jane Addams. Hull-House, founded in 1889, celebrated twenty years of being a place immigrants came to gain knowledge about settling in America. Hull-House located in Chicago on the corner of Halstead and Polk, in 1889 was home to Russian, Sicilian, Greek, and Italian immigrants making up the majority of Chicago’s population. Hull-House’s mission of being a place where immigrants came to learn soon required it to offer classes to meet the immigrant’s needs.  Services came to include classes, such as, English language, cooking, and American government. A public kitchen, nursery and playground were other amenities offered to the residents of Hull-House.  The residents, who paid rent and contributed to the services, took the lead on many Hull-House projects that led to social reforms. After twenty years of operation Hull-House remained a cooperative environment for the immigrant population in Chicago."],"display_date":1910,"search_date":"1910-07-02","citations":[{"divid":1349023379,"type":"Website","data":["N/A","Hull-House- circ. 1910","Social Welfare History","http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/organizations/hull-house-circ-1910/","September 10, 2012"]},{"divid":1349023581,"type":"Chapter/Essay/Encyclopedia Entry  in Book","data":["Jane Addams","N/A","Twenty Years at Hull-House","Jane Addams","New York","Macmillan","1910","97-100"]},{"divid":1349023946,"type":"Website","data":["UIC College of Architecture and Arts","About Hull-House","Jane Addams Hull-House Museum","http://www.uic.edu/jaddams/hull/_learn/_abouthullhouse/abouthullhouse.html","September 4, 2012"]},{"divid":1349024325,"type":"Chapter/Essay/Encyclopedia Entry  in Book","data":["Paul S.
