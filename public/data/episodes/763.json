On February 10, 1893, however, a gentleman wrote her a letter offering the American Red Cross a donation of land in Indiana. On March 18, 1893, Clara Barton replied to the gentleman's letter, thanking him immensely and promising that his gift of land would be used only in ways that promoted the peaceful nature of the American Red Cross. Although she says the business headquarters will remain in Washington, D.C., Barton explains to the gentleman how his land will be used by the American Red Cross, to store as well as produce supplies that would need to be used in the event of a serious emergency.
