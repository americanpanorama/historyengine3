Seminoles in Florida had been involved in long lasting wars with the government and had quickly resolved to violence. A total of three Seminole wars were ignited and the last of which ended in 1858. This third Seminole war or Billy Bowlegs war had many violent encounters, but as with many Indian wars disputes were over land. A new guerilla tactic was used in the third war. \"The Billy Bowlegs War was the final clash of an intermittent guerilla conflict between the Seminole Indians of Florida and the United States\" (Online Highways 2008).  "," A particular guerilla encounter was on the 25th of January 1856, where a group of Seminole Indians attacked a group of White men and their mules. Details of the encounter state that the Indians also shot the mules right behind the ear implying that the Indians had purposefully killed the animals. Although this series of events can be looked at as irrational, it stems from built up frustration over the past two Seminole wars. Mass destruction and reduction of land had finally been expressed through the events of late January. ","     What is interesting about the article is that it is obvious that it had been written from a White individual's perspective. There is an all out attack of the Seminole tribe and the author goes on to state, \"The Seminoles must leave Florida, or the last one be exterminated, is the verdict of the people. To accomplish this, the Indian Territory should be flooded with troops\". Obviously this angered the White settlers, however the struggles of this tribe have to at least be taken into account by the oppressors and this may add some justification to the situation."],"display_date":1856,"search_date":"1856-07-01","citations":[{"divid":1229105992,"type":"Article","data":["Colonel Brown","Latest From the Seminole War ","The New York Times","1","February 8, 1856","1"]},{"divid":1229106085,"type":"Website","data":["U-S History","Third Seminole War: Wars and Battles 1855-1858","Online Highways","http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1156.html.
