Thus began a series of disturbances known as the Garza War or the Tin Horn War in which Garza recruited rebels to fight against the Mexican government by launching attacks from across the border in Texas.  In this way Garza was constantly trying to evade capture, because of the trouble he created for both the Mexican and American governments. Garza and his men were at large for over a year, creating chaos along the border.  For example, The Brenham Weekly Banner reported on September 24, 1891: Â“A special from Rio Grande City says Garza and nearly 200 revolutionists were seen Sunday night sixty miles south of Carmargo, pressing for the Rio Grande river and pursued by Mexican troops.'  US Army troops were sent to patrol the border by December, and on December 21, 1891, one man was killed and another wounded by Garza's revolutionists near Fort McIntosh.  Garza learned that he was wanted by the special rangers and fled Texas in 1892.  On January 21, 1893, a sheriff's posse and US troops captured the surviving leaders of Garza's band about sixty miles from Rio Grande City."],"display_date":"September 15, 1891 - January 21, 1893","search_date":"1892-05-19","citations":[{"divid":1215529872,"type":"Website","data":["Joe R.
