The Central Railroad Passenger Company case. The R.Fox had sued The Central Railroad Passenger Company because it denied him the right to ride on a street car. The jury determined that Negro's had the right to ride based on the enforcement of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments and common-law provisions related to commercial carriers. Judge Bland Ballard awarded Fox fifteen dollars in damages for being forcibly removed from the car. The decision was a victory for African-Americans, but the reaction by whites was something that still had to be faced."],"display_date":"May 11, 1871","search_date":"1871-05-11","citations":[{"divid":1213898235,"type":"Article","data":["Marjorie Norris","An Early Instance of Non-Violence: The Louisville Demonstrations of 1870-1871","The Journal of Southern History","Vol. 32, No. 4","November, 1966","487-504"]},{"divid":1213898279,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["United States Courts","The Louisville Courier Journal","","May 11, 1871",""]}],"locations":[{"id":688,"lat":38.1872796075,"lng":-85.6593965884,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
