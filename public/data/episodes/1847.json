The letter addresses many things, such as the myths about black men wanting white women.  No document better captures the anger that black men from Mississippi reserved for those most directly responsible for stealing the promise of Reconstruction away from them.&lt;br /&gt;An excerpt from the letter: Â“I send a kick in this letter for him and you.  Mississippi is hell and Aberdeen is hell's dark door.  The Yellow fever failed to correct you Southern devils and so in 1880, you will all be totally annihilated and not only defeated.  I am coming to Jackson;to show you how I abominate, abhor, and detest a Southerner.'"],"display_date":"February 1879","search_date":"1879-02-14","citations":[{"divid":1213676091,"type":"Book","data":["Bradley G.
