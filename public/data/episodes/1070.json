Many of these Union men did not have vouchers from the army officers or the treasury department that confiscated their goods. In numerous petitions through bills introduced to Congress, the Treasury Department, the Secretary of War, the Offices of the Quartermaster and Commissary General, and to the Court of Claims, these Union men tried to reclaim their property. Until 1871, there was no legislative recognition of these claims. The Southern Claims Commission was established by Congress on March 3, 1871 which would serve to recognize the claims of Southern loyalists for quartermaster supplies and commissary stores furnished to the Union army during the War. This legislation was the first legislation that recognized claims exclusively from the South."],"display_date":"March 3, 1871","search_date":"1871-03-03","citations":[{"divid":1213906767,"type":"Article","data":["Frank Klingberg","The Southern Claims Commission: A Postwar Agency in Operations","The Mississippi Valley Historical Review","Vol. 32, No. 2","September, 1945","195-214"]},{"divid":1213906819,"type":"Government Document","data":["Journal of the Senate of the United States of America 1879-1873","Senate Journal","March 2, 1871","","","","","The Library of Congress: American Memory","http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?hlaw:3:./temp/~ammem_hGx5::@@@mdb=mcc,gottscho,detr,nfor,wpa,aap,cwar,bbpix,cowellbib,calbkbib,consrvbib,bdsbib,dag,fsaall,gmd,pan,vv,presp,varstg,suffrg,nawbib,horyd,wtc,toddbib,mgw,ncr,ngp,musdibib,hlaw,papr,lhbumbib,rbpebib,lbcoll,alad,hh,aaodyssey,magbell,bbcards,dcm,raelbib,runyon,dukesm,lomaxbib,mtj,gottlieb,aep,qlt,coolbib,fpnas,aasm,scsm,denn,relpet,am"]}],"locations":[{"id":761,"lat":null,"lng":null,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
