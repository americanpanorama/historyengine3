In doing so, the legislators focused heavily on certain aspects of the state laws that pertained to voting rights of African-Americans and poor whites. From 1897 on, almost all of the Southern states were revising or creating their state constitutions. Many of the modifications increased the authority of the legislators and shifted the voting system to an elective rather than appointive arrangement. Similar to the movement in North Carolina, the revisions that took place most significantly disenfranchised African-Americans from their voting privileges. The disenfranchisements that were occurring throughout the South were a movement to suppress the increased amounts of power that African-Americans were gaining in state governments."],"display_date":"February 8, 1898 - February 12, 1898","search_date":"1898-02-10","citations":[{"divid":1213990877,"type":"Online Encyclopedia","data":["Encyclopedia Louisiana","Louisiana Timeline&#58; 1898","http&#58;//www.enlou.com/time/year1898.htm","October 5, 2005"]},{"divid":1213991422,"type":"Book","data":["C.
