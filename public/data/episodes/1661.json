Miller introduced an 1896 bill to Â“create a separate black state-supported college in Orangeburg, the Normal, Industrial, Agricultural, and Mechanical College of South Carolina,' to which he was elected the colleges first president. (The school was later named South Carolina State College in 1954). The state passed the bill of 1896 and agreed to fund the school for African-Americans.&lt;br /&gt;This reveals the drive for segregation which was made possible by the Supreme Court's decision in Plessy v. Fergussen. South Carolina's Governor Tillman's inaction in creating facilities, albeit segregated facilities for African-Americans, shows the growing tension and rise of inflamed race relations in the south during the development of segregation. The opening of schools and other such facilities as this shows segregation was underway. The decade of the 1890s was one of widespread adoption of Jim Crow laws, thus segregation had already occurred. Now, it was de jure segregation."],"display_date":"February 26, 1896","search_date":"1896-02-26","citations":[{"divid":1214498963,"type":"Book","data":["Walter Edgar","South Carolina, A History",null,"Columbia","University of South Carolina Press","1998","448"]},{"divid":1214498991,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","The State","Columbia, South Carolina","February 26, 1896",""]}],"locations":[{"id":1226,"lat":33.9290712834,"lng":-81.2531457905,"zoom":9,"place":"LEXINGTON, South Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
