The remedies were listed as infallible,' secret' and invaluable'.  Often the ads were reprinted for months or years at a time and placed in the same spot everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Most often the ads were structured towards women and those being afflicted by venereal disease. Women were often kept in the dark about medical issues and little was done to educate them about things such as their menstrual cycle.  It was not until the late 19th century that women would become more educated on the matter of their health.&lt;br /&gt;Because of their lack of education women were willing to test out these so called medicines.  Usually the medicines and prescription of doctors were untested and were not based up any scientific findings."],"display_date":"May 29, 1851","search_date":"1851-05-29","citations":[{"divid":1213492166,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","Times Picayune ","","May 29, 1851",""]},{"divid":1213492183,"type":"Book","data":["Judith Walzer Leavitt","Women and Health in America",null,"Wisconsin","The University of Wisconsin Press","1984","28"]}],"locations":[{"id":721,"lat":30.1220750117,"lng":-89.7244851703,"zoom":10,"place":"ORLEANS, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}
