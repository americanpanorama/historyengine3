Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton launched the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869, women did not have the right to vote on factors that affected their lives.  In addition, the majority of women did not have jobs outside the home.  In the home, society expected a woman to keep her household running seamlessly.  However, restrictions placed on women branched into other areas beyond social expectations.  While performing the roles assigned to them by society, Victorian fashion expected women to maintain specific hemlines and necklines.  The clothing that women wore took restriction to another level, and the corset led the way.","The difficulty of performing daily tasks as well as health concerns soon led to the formation of rational dress societies and movements across the Western Hemisphere.  Many of the members simultaneously fought for the right of women to vote, and encouraged them to choose clothing more appropriate for healthy lifestyles.  The rational dress voices represented a minority at the time this trade card was printed.  The fight to loosen the corset raged for several decades, but by the time women won the right to vote in America they were able to show up to polling places in much more comfortable clothing.","<a href=\"http://s647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/?action=view&current=img012.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/img012.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>","<a href=\"http://s647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/?action=view&current=img013.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/img013.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>"],"display_date":1885,"search_date":"1885-07-02","citations":[{"divid":1240189836,"type":"Chapter/Essay/Encyclopedia Entry  in Book","data":["Leigh Summers","Corsetry and the Reality of Female Complaints","Bound to Please:A History of the Victorian Corset","Leigh Summers","Oxford","Berg Publishers","2001","87-120"]},{"divid":1240082029,"type":"Pamphlet or Other Printed Material","data":["Anonymous","The Double Hip \"Ironsides\" Corset","","Warners Corset Co.","1885",""]},{"divid":1240238879,"type":"Website","data":["Sharon Morgan","Photobucket","Photobucket","http://i647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/img012.jpg","4/20/2009"]},{"divid":1240239064,"type":"Website","data":["Sharon Morgan","Photobucket","Photobucket","http://s647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/?action=view&amp;current=img013.jpg","4/20/2009"]}],"locations":[{"id":3620,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"},{"id":198,"tag":"corsets"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}}
