According to the Daily Dispatch, masked men set fire to the cabin of some negroes, compelling the inmates to come out and call aloud their names;.and as he uttered his name they literally riddled his body with buckshot.' Reaction to this event and other like it stirred varied reactions throughout the south. This is because Klan activity had slowly declined during the late 1870s.&lt;br /&gt;However, the spirit of the Klan and its ideals were still present in the South. During the late 1890's in Georgia, it was a point of pride for white men to claim they had been Klan riders of the past. Furthermore, in Texas the late 1870s and 1880s saw an uprising in Klan lynch law practices to enforce vigilante law. Many saw the Klan as a romantic symbol of the Lost Cause' and looked upon it fondly. The violence of whites against blacks would continue as the Klan became reinvigorated in the early twentieth century."],"display_date":"February 1878","search_date":"1878-02-14","citations":[{"divid":1213303850,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","Daily Dispatch","Richmond, VA.","February 18, 1878",""]},{"divid":1213303958,"type":"Website","data":["Jonathan Bryant","Klu Klux Klan in the Reconstruction Era","Georgia Humanities Council","http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-694 ","October 6, 2005"]},{"divid":1213304212,"type":"Website","data":["John R.
