The revivals drew large crowds and lasted for several days. It was so startling and peculiar the Daily Dispatch ran a large article about the uprising in religious activity among blacks. It dramatically stated the revivals had Â“no parallel in our history and is remarkable alike for the suddenness with which it sprang into existence.'&lt;br /&gt;This was part of a larger trend following the Civil War and end of Reconstruction in which the black church started taking a larger role in the community. During Reconstruction black churches were often affiliated with Freedman's Bureau actions to help the community all over the South. The role of the church took form in community issues like education, politics, and religion for the newly freed population of African-Americans and its influence was seen in the presence of revivals and other mobilized actions."],"display_date":"April 1878","search_date":"1878-04-15","citations":[{"divid":1213370473,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","Daily Dispatch","Richmond, VA","April 15, 1878",""]},{"divid":1213370496,"type":"Website","data":["William E.
