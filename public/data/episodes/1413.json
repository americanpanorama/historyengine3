On Christmas 1868, he pardoned the rest, including Breckenridge, Slidell, and Thompson. This was significant because Johnson had just been impeached (in March) and though he hoped he would receive the Democratic nomination at the Democratic National Convention later that week, he was too unpopular with both parties to really be considered as a candidate. &lt;br /&gt;His official proclamation states his reasons for granting pardon, which was to secure a complete and universal establishment and prevalence of municipal law and order.' His pardoning of former Confederates was one of the last presidential acts he would undertake. Though not every state was yet declared reconstructed,' this pardon symbolized the official end of Reconstruction."],"display_date":"July 4, 1868 - December 25, 1868","search_date":"1868-09-29","citations":[{"divid":1213448075,"type":"Book","data":["Rembert W.
