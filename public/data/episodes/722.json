This was the last major clash of arms in the Civil War, occurring even though the war was technically over. On the first day the Union evacuated under pressure, but returned the following morning moving toward their destination of Palmito Ranch.  But the Confederate troops attacked, again forcing the Union troops to evacuate for good, but this time with a good number of casualties. It was a Confederate victory under Col. Ford.  Soldiers of all races were involved in the fighting, Native-Americans, African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, and white Americans. All were united in fighting against for what was left of their party and their country. There were 118 Union casualties and no confederate deaths. &lt;br /&gt;This Battle of Palmito was remarkable because it occurred after the Civil War had been concluded for over a month, and yet both sides fought passionately.  The Confederates were holding onto the last hope of keeping their land, and the Federalists were holding onto their honor and fighting in the name of the united states. It is ironic that the final battle fought in the Civil War was won by Confederates, but it goes to show how both the North and the South were valiant fighters, and a battle can go either way on a particular day.  This battle also demonstrates that the Civil War could have continued after April 9th, 1865 in guerrilla warfare."],"display_date":"May 12, 1865 - May 13, 1865","search_date":"1865-05-12","citations":[{"divid":1219534905,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["","The Daily Picayune","","April 14, 1865",""]},{"divid":1219534918,"type":"Book","data":["E.B.
