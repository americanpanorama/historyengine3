Godding, the 2<sup>nd</sup> superintendent of Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital in Washington, DC, witnessed the autopsy of Charles Guiteau, his viewpoint on the pathology of the insane was solidified and, therefore, resulted in the drastic alteration of the mission, practices, and clinical direction of Saint Elizabeth’s. The hospital was established by an act of Congress in 1852 and opened in 1855 as the first federal mental hospital and the first public mental hospital in DC. It was purposed to be a model of humane care and enlightened, curative treatment practices[1] as it strove to bring high-quality psychiatric attention to the poor.[2]","The autopsy in question was a result of events stemming from the 1881 assassination of President Garfield.[3] On July 2 in Washington, DC, Guiteau shot President Garfield who died 79 days later from botched medical care.[4] The murder trial of Guiteau was the first highly publicized forensic battle, pitting leading psychiatrists and neurologists against each other, as Guiteau said a deity instructed him to kill Garfield for the good of the nation.[5] Guiteau demonstrated other seemingly insane antics throughout his trial hinting that he was “off his nut.”[6] Despite these antics, the prosecution argued that Guiteau’s only affliction was “moral depravity.”[7] At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found Guiteau capable of discerning right and wrong and, therefore, condemned him to death.[8]","After Guiteau was hung, Dr. Godding witnessed the autopsy performed by D.S. Lamb, MD; the results of which were published on July 8, 1882.[9] Despite rejection of the insanity plea, the autopsy found “pathologic changes suggestive of chronic disease of cerebral vessels,” resulting in a flood of articles claiming Guiteau had suffered from a mental illness.[10] Afterwards, Dr. Godding altered his mission for the hospital, to depart “in the direction…of pathological changes left behind by insanity”[11] in order to better understand and treat mental disorders.[12] Dr. Godding’s decision was revolutionary. In the late 1800s, pathology was developing as a basic science, yet neuropathologic correlation with clinical and demonstrable mental health behavior had not developed.[13] To further the new goals and mission of Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital, Dr. Godding appointed Dr. Isaac W. Blackburn as special pathologist to the hospital in 1884;[14] the first full-time pathologist in a public mental health hospital in the United States.[15]","This autopsy and appointment had long-lasting effects on the physical facilities at Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital as Blackburn established a tradition of innovative research and training that flourished at Saint Elizabeth’s for 100 years.[16] Also, Dr. William Alanson White, the 4<sup>th</sup> superintendent, established a psychology laboratory and formed the first psychotherapy department in any mental hospital in the United States.[17] In conclusion, despite the cessation of the research mission at Saint Elizabeth’s, the legacy of this tradition is still mediating the experience of practitioners, researchers, and the mental health population today.[18]","[1] Jogues R.
