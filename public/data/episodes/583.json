Most of the deaths occurred near the city limits.  The Nashville Union sought to control any possible panic by relaying information of the epidemic with this concluding sentence: This is the whole truth up to this time [original emphasis].  They reassured their readers that once the weather changed for the better, the health of the city would repair itself.&lt;br /&gt;Cholera was also a worldwide threat - at the beginning of 1854 a Parisian identified only as M.
