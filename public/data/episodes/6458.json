In the early 1960s, throughout towns and cities in America, Jackie created a frenzy in the media with her impeccable style. Newspapers all over the country showcased her style as “The Jackie Kennedy Look.”  On October 17<sup>th</sup> 1960, <em>The Washington Post </em>documented Jackie’s new hairstyle as the “Modified Bouffant” which was a short voluminous hairstyle that many admired. Within days, other women copied Jackie’s new hairstyle as their own. Women and girls were recreating every little aspect of Jackie’s style, forming a complete “Jackie Look” throughout America. Jackie had her style featured in numerous newspapers such as the <em>Los Angeles Times, </em>which made reference to Jackie’s style as “glamorous” and “confident.” She was an icon to all women who perceived her as flawless and beautiful. She wore items such as her pillbox hat, pearls, monochromatic palettes and trench coats, which the media documented. This signature look that she created helped individuals follow her style more closely. Her designer Oleg Cassini wrote a book dedicated to the outfits she wore at major events during her husband’s presidency. Cassini captured the influence Jackie reflected onto women through her fashion. He even stated, “… the public adulation had built up to such an extent that in the eyes of most Americans, everything she did was perfect.” Her influence was so strong on the American people that it shaped many styles and revolutionized the fashion culture of the 1960s.","Besides Jackie Kennedys fashion, her aura was looked at in a positive manner. The word “icon” coined Jackie Kennedy as an individual. Icons came from high society, which the media created from their fascination with these individuals. Jackie became an icon through press coverage and media attention of which she became surrounded by. She turned the 1960’s fashion into being “youth led” and many younger girls aspired to be like the first lady. Fashion expert Valerie Steele even stated, “Everyone wants to look like Kate Moss. It's the way women felt about Jackie Kennedy in the early '60s.'' Overall, this fascination Americans had with her was truly remarkable. She was able to turn America around as not only a style icon, but as a graceful First Lady who revolutionized the world. "],"display_date":"January 1, 1960 - November 22, 1963","search_date":"1961-12-11","citations":[{"divid":1450026337,"type":"Book","data":["Oleg Cassini","A Thousand Days of Magic: Dressing Jacqueline Kennedy for the White House","","New York, New York","Rizzoli International","1995","30-100"]},{"divid":1450026771,"type":"Online Encyclopedia","data":["Encyclopedia of Clothing and Fashion.","\"Fashion Icons\"","http://go.galegroup.com.online.library.marist.edu/ps/infomark.do?type=aboutBook&amp;docId=CX3427599999&amp;tabID=T002&amp;actionString=DO_DISPLAY_ABOUT_PAGE&amp;version=1.0&amp;source=library&amp;userGroupName=nysl_se_marist&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;authCount=1&amp;u=nysl_se_marist","December 13th 2015"]},{"divid":1450027122,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["\"Icons of Style; Jackie Onassis, Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly: They May Be Gone, but Their Glamour's Not Forgotten.\"","The Record","","December 14, 2006",""]},{"divid":1450027252,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["\"Jackie to Get New Look.\"","The Washington Post","","October 17 1960",""]},{"divid":1450027304,"type":"Newspaper Article","data":["\"The Jackie Kennedy Look\"","Los Angeles Times","","January 8, 1961",""]}],"locations":[{"id":10222,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington D.C"}],"tags":[{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"},{"id":2847,"tag":"Jacqueline Kennedy"},{"id":2848,"tag":"First Lady"},{"id":2849,"tag":"icon"}],"course":{"name":"JFK: Famine to New Frontier","school":"Marist College","course_id":150,"school_id":77}}
