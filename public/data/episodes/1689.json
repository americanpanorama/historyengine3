Before it had fully recovered from the effects of the hurricane, the city was rocked by an earthquake that registered a 6.6 on the Richter scale. Eyewitness accounts report that tremors were felt all over the state. Over 2000 buildings were destroyed and 110 people died as a result of the disaster. Property damages were estimated at what would be around 100 million in today's time. As a result, many would-be investors looked to areas other than Charleston to make their fortunes, and South Carolina's economy was left in shambles. Eventually, however, the city was rebuilt and it remains an iconic city of the South."],"display_date":"August 31, 1886","search_date":"1886-08-31","citations":[{"divid":1215697698,"type":"Pamphlet or Other Printed Material","data":["Clarence E.
