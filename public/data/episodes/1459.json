Many different lines rose up, connecting all major cities.  Competition arose between these lines.

They increased the South's vulnerability to economic fluctuations, especially in the early 1890s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On August 13, 1892, Memphis declared that the greatest rate war ever known among southern railroads had begun.
