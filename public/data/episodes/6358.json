In 1879, the firm of Flynn and Emrich, which specialized in foundry work and the machinist trade, released an advertisement promoting their various products. The firm was headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, also home to the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, the first long-distance rail line in the nation. Flynn and Emrich’s advertisement discusses their long history as a manufacturer in Baltimore and elsewhere including Kentucky. Not only did they specialize in building steam engines, but they produced many other advanced technologies including elevators and steam pumps, to name some of their other products.  The advertisement even included customer endorsements of their products, as well as illustrations of the machinery they manufactured.  Flynn & Emrich appealed to consumers by stating how much care they used in designing and building steam engines and noted that they only hired skilled workman.

During this era, inventors developed railroad locomotives powered by steam that proved to be efficient, as well as reliable and fast. Who would of thought that a pump originally used to push out water from coal mines would eventually become the most commonly use form of transportation in the 1800s. Numerous inventors played a role in the development of steam engines, including Watt and Newcomen, but they all helped make the steam engine better over time. People were now able to travel greater distances because they could not only travel on land via the railroad but on water via steamboats. Until the steam engine was created there was only a few ways people could get around either by land or by boat.

Companies like Flynn & Emrich as well as B& O fed off of the success of the steam engine. Steam would soon be the go to resource to power many modern technology of that time period. The steam engine gave people another way to travel besides boat, horse drawn wagon or land. Steam engines did not only help failing cities like Baltimore from going bankrupt because of the huge competition with the Erie Canal but gave this cities income from letting people travel through their cities.","<br />At the peak of the Second Industrial Revolution in the United States, the steam engine was seen as a truly remarkable and useful invention.
