Judge Judson of New York City ordered Long to be brought back to Virginia.  Much commotion was caused on the trip back to Virginia because of the fear of an uprising of blacks.  Long was guarded by as many as 200 police officers at one time when stepping on to a ferry leaving New York.  Long would make the trip back to Richmond without any interferences.&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after this situation the Shadrack dispute took place.  The large difference was the in Long's situation the police were prepared for an angry mob and in Shadrack's little was done to stop the mob.  Cases such as these sparked tensions and debate between Northerners and Southerners along with the debate over State versus Federal laws.  The Compromise of 1850 left questions unanswered for both Northerners and Southerners alike."],"display_date":"January 14, 1851","search_date":"1851-01-14","citations":[{"divid":1213485593,"type":"Book","data":["Shi Tindall","America A Narrative History",null,"New York","W.W.
