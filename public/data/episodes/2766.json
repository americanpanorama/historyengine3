Though there is not much information given in this record, one can infer that this land was taken by the Union Army upon entering Mississippi.  This case was referred to the Committee on Claims.  Although the American Civil War ended in 1865, it is apparent how long it took for the dust to settle. For many years there would be such petitions and court cases to determine the aftermath of the war. Southerners felt that their land and their livelihood had been taken from them, while Northerners seemed more concerned that slavery did not spread and eventually abolishing it, while also making sure they were in complete control politically.
