Americans’ understanding of freedom, democracy, rights and responsibility evolved in significant ways, leading to a profound change in America’s national identity and international image. The forces that led to the emergence of modern America were both destructive and creative. Disruptions of all kinds reshaped Americans’ relationship with the natural world, the built environment, and the economy. Dramatic shifts in the nation’s demographic composition, fostered by emancipation, immigration, education, urbanization, and industrialization reshaped Americans relationships with one another. Everything seemed new –the new immigrants, the new woman, the new Negro, a new and more expansive federal government. All of these forces led to the establishment of a new kind of “average American life,” one that was more diverse, more urban, more educated and more mechanical than ever before. For many Americans, the “novelties” of the era inspired great optimism, encouraging excited reform of nearly every aspect of American life. For others, such rapid and profound change inspired fear and a sense of bitter nostalgia, spurring movements to control and temper social change. The journalist Walter Weyl captured the mood of this period in his book, The New Democracy: \"America to-day is in a somber, soul-questioning mood. We are in a period of clamor, of bewilderment, of an almost tremulous unrest. We are hastily revising all our social conceptions. We are hastily testing all our political ideals. We are profoundly disenchanted with the fruits of a century of independence.\" This class explores the ways in which Americans were revising their social conceptions and testing their ideals between 1877 and 1945. Many of the conflicts and contradictions faced by the Americans who witnessed the rise of modern America continue to resonate in public discourse. Our emphasis will be on the social and cultural dimensions of American life. We will have an opportunity to explore the extent to which individuals and coalitions were able to affect social and cultural change and to influence policy and political discourse. We will also pay attention to voices of dissent and disillusionment. We will ask questions about the impact of political, economic and social turmoil on everyday life. We will seek to understand why the expansion of democracy and freedom is so often met with violent resistance. We will arrive at a deeper understanding of the experiences and beliefs that shaped everyday life in America."}]},{"id":64,"name":"University of Michigan","url":"http://umich.edu","courses":[{"id":118,"title":"Environmental History in Detroit","school_id":64,"term":"Winter 2014","abbr":"HIST 303","url":"","description":"Environmental history is the study of how people have both affected and been affected by their physical surroundings over time. In urban spaces, those physical surroundings take the form of both the built environment and the geological and biological aspects of the landscape. Urban environmental history, then, is the study not only of conservation and parks but also of how people use, access, and think about physical space; how food is cultivated or obtained; how different populations have reacted to industrial or urban development; the relationship between environmental conditions and demography; and how land use physically changes over time. In this course, we will learn to look at the world around us with a historical eye, thinking about how Detroit landscapes got the way they are today and how our perceptions of those landscapes have been shaped by cultural and social ideas about the urban environment. Readings, discussions, workshops, and mini-lectures will give you the broad tools and theories of environmental history, but it’s up to you to discover the details of Detroit’s past. The class is structured around an in-depth group research project, culminating in the creation of a multimedia website (using images, maps, text, video/audio, etc.) which will be made available to the Detroit community. Through this project you will come to understand how historical changes in the material world, and the ways people think about that world, have had concrete impacts on peoples’ lives. In addition, the websites you create will help local residents better understand the ways in which their city has changed over time and how their personal experiences are connected to larger stories about the relationships between people and their environment."}]},{"id":9,"name":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","url":"http://www.uncp.edu/","courses":[{"id":31,"title":"African-American History from 1863 to the Present","school_id":9,"term":"Fall 2009","abbr":"HIST 3620","url":"","description":""},{"id":20,"title":"American Civilizations to 1877","school_id":9,"term":"Fall 2008","abbr":"HIST 1010","url":"","description":"Students wrote their episodes using newspaper articles they found on the database America&#39;s Historical Newspapers.
