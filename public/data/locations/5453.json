It also contained a dining hall that could accommodate 140. Rooms were available as singles or as a suite-style. These rooms came almost fully furnished. Wright Hall also contained numerous parlors, a large reception hall, and rooms for socializing, especially for the literary societies.

Board in the Wright Hall dining room was $2.25 per week. Wright Hall also contained sick rooms that were available at a cost of $1 per week. The Dean of Women at the college had direct supervision over Wright Hall. She was responsible for assigning rooms and supervising the personal health of the students.","In the fall of 1956 Gelston Hall was built for women, allowing 200 males to move into Wright Hall. Four years after later, there was an unexpected fire that broke out; however, the building survived and remained in use for another twenty years.","In 1963, a proposal was made to President Swanson concerning the future use of Wright Hall. Ideas varied from complete or partial renovation of the hall, or to destruction of the hall. In 1976, the college decided that it was no longer needed as a dormitory and tore it down.","For twenty-eight years, the lot remained vacant. However, in the early 2000’s the college decided that they wanted to rebuild Wright Hall for upperclassman. In the spring of 2004, ground was broken and in January of 2005, upperclassmen moved in to the new Wright Hall.

Bath Glasson (1898) continuing through Doctors Eugene Grove (1943-1953) and Brian Winter (1979-1983) and into the arrival of the present conductor Doctor William Nichols, to name a few.  The Alma College Choir still tours annually and alternates between a national and an international tour every other year.  Originally touring during Christmas time around the Northwest United States, the choir would perform mostly for churches and stay with the church families.","The Alma College choirs have been responsible for bringing much joy to the college and communities around the world due to both the talented leadership and vocalists’ dynamic effort during daily practices, concerts, recordings and tours.  Janet Zeilinger Wolf, class of 1956, describes her four-year choral experience as a “grand time” and holds close to her heart the choir’s “family feel;” she remembers specifically the a cappella choir’s tour to Niagara Falls, New York.  From touring around Canada to singing while serving dinner in Tyler VanDusen, former students, including Nancy Dederer of 1985, have long enjoyed the unique atmosphere the choirs project and the lasting fond memories.  Music major Alan Watterworth, President of the a cappella choir in 1957, experienced one of the choirs’ overseas trips to Europe and expressed the “sense of belonging” the program offered.","With a variety of choral groups, Alma College has been able to offer students an enjoyable elective where they can exhibit their talents and spread the “soul” of Alma College across the state of Michigan, throughout the nation and around the world.  The current program consists of three groups, each with their own inimitable characteristics that make it unique in the Alma College community;

he was the facilitator that brought together the Alma India Program where students are persuaded to experience that culture at Mathen Mappilai Memorial Public School in the village of Ayroor, Kerala.  In providing opportunities for Alma College students to grow abroad, he also taught classes that educated the students on Eastern Christianity and eventually broadened the topic to Eastern and Western Christianity;

The college was in desperate need of a performance center. Designs and drawings of such a center were first seen in a 1962 yearbook. However, the construction did not begin until over thirty years later.","The center would cost over six million dollars, almost half of which came from individual donors, primarily from the Beck family. Lawrence Beck, an Alma college trustee, and his family provided a gift of two million dollars to the college for the performing arts center. Lawrence Beck chose the name “The Heritage Center for the Performing Arts” to honor his Danish family and all immigrants for their roles in shaping our country and bringing their dreams to America.","A planning committee was formed prior to the construction of the building that met regularly to decide the policies that the center was going to uphold. This committee comprised mostly of Alma College professors.

The committee hired graphic designer Jan White Arvanetes to create the logo for the Heritage Center.","Construction began in March of 1992.

The growing dislike for their current mascot was the motivation for the name change due to the limited cheers of “Go Presbyterians” or “Go Campbellites,” in support of the current football coach, Royal Campbell.  According to the article, anyone who wanted to submit a suggestion needed to give it to the Almanian office by November 21 when the competition closed. The winner would receive $5 cash.","The two and a half week contest concluded with a student vote on the final suggestions picked by the selection committee. The three person committee was made up of President Crooks, Dean Mitchell, and Coach Campbell.

Several of the players earned All-MIAA honors, American Women’s Sport Federation Fast Break All-American honors and All-Tournament honors from the NCAA playoffs. Coach Goffnett was also given Coach of the Year by the American Women’s Sport Federation.","The Lady Scots were predicted to be number one in the MIAA by the coaches’ preseason poll and led off the year with a Baldwin-Wallace tournament win, in which they beat Rio Grand (Ohio) 74-60 in the final game to win the tournament for the third straight time. The Lady Scots finished the season only losing one league game and winning the MIAA by beating second place Adrian College in the final game of the season 68-65. The win gave Alma an automatic berth into the NCAA tournament, which was the first time the NCAA had given an automatic tournament bid to the winner of the MIAA. The days leading up to the tournament were not without controversy, however, as a mistake by the NCAA failed to give the MIAA champions a home court advantage in the tournament, which they would normally have deserved. Consequently, throughout the playoffs, Alma played on the road, including in the first game at Adrian, a lower tournament seed. Some thought the reasoning was because Adrian had a wood floor and Alma had a ”Tartan” artificial floor, but a more plausible reason was discovered later. The NCAA made the mistake by using the wrong criteria when deciding home court advantage, using Division 1 criteria instead of Division 3. After an appeal, the NCAA upheld its original decisions and proceeded with the tournament as planned. The Lady Scots were only motivated by the disadvantage and used it to fuel their playoff run.  Coach Goffnett was quoted saying “You could see it in our player’s eyes. They were just not going to be denied.” Alma won three road consecutive road games to earn a place in the NCAA Division III Final Four.","The Lady Scots then went on to defeat Luther, an unranked team going into the tournament, in the semifinals 81-80, and played Moravian, a team which was on a forty-three-game winning streak, in the finals.  Alma was down at the end of the first half, but after a very physical second half came back to defeat Moravian 79-75, winning the NCAA Division III Championship."],"display_date":"November 1, 1991 - March 24, 1992","search_date":"1992-01-12","locations":[{"id":41547,"lat":43.2926870754,"lng":-84.6047678086,"zoom":9,"place":"Gratiot, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":984,"tag":"1991-1992"},{"id":983,"tag":"Alma College Athletics"},{"id":982,"tag":"Women's Basketball"},{"id":981,"tag":"NCAA Div III Championship"}],"course":{"name":"Histories of Alma College","school":"Alma College","course_id":68,"school_id":45}},{"id":5249,"title":"Alma College Homecoming","course_id":68,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/17","end_date":"12/31/42","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The origins and starting date of the homecoming tradition are largely debated, but the yearly Harvard-Yale football game is said to have been inviting alumni to return since 1870.

From 1889 to the mid 1900’s a popular activity was the pajama parade, which started when shopkeepers would give gifts to students who paraded down the streets in their pajamas. This later turned into a freshman hazing event, in which all freshmen would don their pajamas and report to the gymnasium. Hazing originated as a way to create group unification and respect for an organization. Unfortunately, many serious injuries and fatalities have occurred over the years, causing hazing to be such a serious issue that it has been outlawed in forty-four states including Michigan.

Prior to that year, students were only required to complete a general degree of study, such as a Bachelor of Arts or Sciences. The 1908-1909 catalog states, “in order to secure to the student the advantage of intensive work, he is required at the proper time to choose two subjects in which he must secure a total of from 36-40 hours” (pg. 14).In that first year, options included: Ancient, Languages, History-Economics, English-Modern Languages, Mathematics-Laboratory Science and Chemistry-Biology. The requirements were altered in 1920, requiring students to choose two majors offered by eighteen different departments. In 1924, students were required to complete one major of 24 credit hours. In the years following up to 1965, there were only minor changes. In 1965, the college established a minimum GPA of 2.0 that students must maintain in their area of study.

Since 1945, there has no longer been a requirement for the number of areas of studies a student needed to have.","To encourage Alma students to be unique and creative individuals, the college created a program in the 1973-1974 academic year that allowed students to create their own major. This option, known as a Program of Emphasis, can be especially helpful to those individual students who know exactly what they want to do with their lives, but cannot find an academic major to assist them in fulfilling their dreams. Initial Programs of Emphasis included Anthropology, Child Development and Communications.
