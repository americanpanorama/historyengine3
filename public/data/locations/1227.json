He was expected to make an appearance in Louisville, but to the dismay of many he did not show up. The brooding anxiety between the gold men' and the free coinage advocates pointed to the growing tension over the issue.&lt;br /&gt;Secretary Carlisle went to Kentucky and delivered a speech to his hometown Covington, Kentucky. His sound money' speech was met by the free silver supporters, who responded by pelting him with rotten eggs. The situation caused this occasion to be his last public speech. Afterwards, he left Kentucky, his work in politics having fallen victim to the issues that were dividing the commonwealth. The reaction of the free silver supporters reveals their anxiety over the money issue, and the need to meet the temporary deficiencies of revenue the nation was facing. They wanted the government restore the full money function to silver and some way, and do it speedily.'"],"display_date":"May 9, 1896","search_date":"1896-05-09","locations":[{"id":5002,"lat":38.9334173629,"lng":-84.5331462731,"zoom":10,"place":"KENTON, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}]}
