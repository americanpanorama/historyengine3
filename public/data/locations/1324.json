By 1850, the Louisa Railroad was built east to Richmond and west to Charlottesville. As the railway extended, it was renamed the Virginia Central Railroad. Desiring to move forward with internal improvements, the Commonwealth of Virginia allotted money to continue to expand the line. Moving westward, the Virginia Central moved through Gordonsville, past Staunton, and towards Covington. To finish the line across the mountainous territory of the Alleghany Plateau, the Commonwealth chartered a state-subsidized railroad called the Covington and Ohio Railroad. However, by this time, the Civil War would break out, and the westward expansion of the railway stopped. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the Civil War, the Virginia Central Railroad was one of the Confederacy's most important lines, carrying food, troops, and supplies constantly. By war's end, though, the line would be torn apart and wrecked completely. In order to rebuild the railway, funds had to be sought outside of the economically devastated South. Through a chief New York entrepreneur, Collis P. Huntington, Virginians were supplied with the money to complete the railway to the Ohio River as the Covington and Ohio and the Virginia Central Railways were already previously consolidated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the completion of this railway, many perceived the line as the great route establishing a significant connection between the tidewater of Virginia and the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. Virginia was now in a quick and direct union with rich coalfields and wealthy mineral deposits of the Ohio River valleys. Thus, this railway was vastly productive for Virginia and the South in general. Furthermore, this achievement benefited many of the Western states, whose huge shipments had grown to such magnitude that existing railroads were scarcely able to accommodate the teeming freights."],"display_date":"January 29, 1873","search_date":"1873-01-29","locations":[{"id":13918,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":50,"title":"The Political Struggle of Virginia is Forecasted\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-04-09","end_date":"1873-04-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As the controlling Radical Republican Party mainly legislated reforms during Reconstruction, Virginia virtually avoided the reconstructive efforts because the Republicans never actually gained complete control over the state. Initially, Republicans shared power with the Democrats in the state. However, with state elections approaching in November, both parties began to prepare for the significant political contest. Essentially, most of the state and local administration was under election, as the positions of Governor, delegates of the Legislature as well as county officers, except clerks, were under contestation. Furthermore, the following winter of 1873 brought the necessity to choose a State Senator by the newly elected Legislature. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As The Baltimore Sun revealed, both political parties were very much divided on railroad, local, as well as personal issues. As a result, the Sun predicted a strong calling for a very lively struggle, and that the State will be stumped from one to the other.' No doubt, looking at an already divided state administration, electing in a Republican controlled governorship as well as legislature maintained to be quite difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, with Democratic-Conservatives already partly in control, they did not have to overthrow an entrenched Republican administration.  In the gubernatorial race, the color line was the central theme for Democratic candidate, James L. Kemper, who ran on a ticket promising Virginia for the Virginians.' Kemper strategically sketched an indelible line between the Democrats and his radical Republican opponents.  This assertive maneuver proved effective in rallying the Virginian white-liners. By the end of 1873, Republicans completely lost control of the State, and power fell into the hands of the Democratic-Conservatives."],"display_date":"April 9, 1873","search_date":"1873-04-09","locations":[{"id":13918,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":52,"title":"The Publishing of Abolitionist Literature\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-10-07","end_date":"1856-10-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Harriet Beecher Stowe just published Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp in 1856.  In the book, Stowe posits that slavery caused the corrosion of society.  Dred is the second book by Stowe that centered on the topic of slavery.  Stowe's first work, Uncle Tom's Cabin which was published in 1853, also addressed the issue of slavery and highlighted the institutions' inadequacies.  Raised in Connecticut, Stowe was the daughter of a minister who preached against slavery and from him she most likely acquired her abolitionist sentiments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to Stowe's work, India or Pearl of Pearl River, another novel denouncing slavery was published in 1856 by Emma Southworth.  Neither Southworth nor her novel received as much attention from the press and general public as did Stowe, but she still managed, like Stowe, to incite southern whites who viewed her work as insidious and malignant (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 6, pg. 1).'  In response to her work and other work of the same vein, one southern writer cautioned southerners to ;keep a vigilant eye on these Northern publications, and notice no book favorably till it has satisfied itself of the soundness of its contents (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 6, pg. 1).'  In other words, do not allow any books to come to the South if they criticize the southern way of life, which centered around slavery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The works of Stowe, Southworth and other abolitionists succeeded in disseminating anti slavery propaganda to the masses and drawing more adherents to the abolitionist movement.  In this time period, an increasing number of people were becoming more vocal about their opposition to slavery and Stowe was prominent among them.  Stowe was such a prominent figure in the abolitionist movement that it is rumored that Abraham Lincoln called her the little lady who made this big war.'

Police officers caught Henderson in an illegal assembly of eleven other blacks, trespassing over private property and carrying fire arms.  Henderson probably faced punishment by the law following his arrest, and then subsequently by his master once released from confinement.  Slave rebellions generally always ended in death for the rebellion's participants.  Since this thwarted attempt did not even carry to fruition, Henderson did not have anything to show for his punishment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slave revolts like the ones lead by Denmark Vessey in 1822 and Nat Turner in 1831 were still fresh in the minds of slave holders.  There was the ever present fear among slave owners that their slaves would revolt and possibly lead a revolution similar to that which the people of Haiti successfully led.  Like one southerner said because the history of [Haiti] is written in characters so black, so dark, so prominent, we cannot be ignorant of the fate that awaits us (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 19, pg. 1).'  In instances such as this one, with the capture of the plotting slave, slave owners made sure to bring their full wrath upon the accused so as to prevent another attempted insurgence from the slave in question and to dissuade others from trying anything similar.  Slave holders always liked to attribute rebellions to northern interference or a bad slave out of the bunch because to accept that slaves were unhappy in their positions would have called into question the institution itself and therefore the livelihood of these southern plantation owners."],"display_date":"August 10, 1856","search_date":"1856-08-10","locations":[{"id":13916,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":72,"title":"Southern Interpretation of Increasing Sectionalism\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-08-19","end_date":"1856-08-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an article written on August 19, 1856, The Daily Dispatch commented on the growing sectionalism between the North and the South in the United States.  In a then recent speech by a Missouri Senator it was stated that there existed more comity between any two foreign nations now on the face of the earth than there exists on the part of the Northern States towards the South (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 19, pg. 1).'  A similar speech given by a Louisiana Senator declared the North did not care about the South, except to attack its honor and interests.  These sentiments are noticeably one sided, but nevertheless the fact remained that hostilities and resentment were breeding between the two sides, creating an ever growing rift between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Southerners tended to cast all of the blame to the North.  In the eyes of southerners, northern rabble rousers were to blame for slave unrest and northerners' motivation for the abolition of slavery stemmed from the desire to completely control the South.  Northerners wanted ruin and desolation spread over fifteen of the States of the Union' (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 19, pg. 1), according to southerners and by abolishing slavery, the North would achieve this goal.  In the end, Southerners' fears were realized when the abolition of slavery did completely uproot the southern way of life.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The South was fighting for property, honor and safety, all that was due to man (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 19, pg. 1)' but of course when they said this they meant all that was due to white men with money.  Southerners at the time increasingly felt that the Constitution was a tool employed by the North to subjugate the South.  Sectionalism in the United States continued to grow until it reached its pinnacle in December of 1860 with the secession of South Carolina from the Union.  By the middle of 1861, ten more states followed South Carolina's lead and seceded from the Union."],"display_date":"August 19, 1856","search_date":"1856-08-19","locations":[{"id":13916,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":73,"title":"Reports of Runaway Slaves\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-07-02","end_date":"1856-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Fugitive Slave Act passed by Congress as part of the Compromise of 1850.  The Act pleased southerners not only because it allowed slave owners to retrieve their property from anywhere in the country, but it gave other people the power to retrieve them as well.  In fact, if officials did not turn in fugitive slaves, they could be fined 1,000.  This measure of the act served to directly overturn the decision in Prigg vs. Pennsylvania which formerly declared that states did not have to aid in the recapture of slaves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Fugitive Slave Act was a source of strife between the North and the South because many northerners did not feel the law was warranted nor justified.  Consequently, some northerners chose to directly disobey the act and not aid in the seizure of runaways at their own risk.  As a result, posters and advertisements for runaway slaves like the ones that appeared almost daily in The Daily Dispatch, were abundant.  In one advertisement, a runaway named Armistead Clarke had fled his mistress in Richmond only to be caught in Henrico County.  One broadside offered a reward for the capture of a slave named Lewis; although Lewis, as reported by his owner Thomas Clagett, had a crippled leg and a hernia, he had still fled enslavement.  Clagett's description of Lewis not only demonstrates the lengths to which slave owners would go to recover slaves, but also the lengths to which slaves would go to try and escape; even though Lewis was physically debilitated he still attempted to escape bondage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The use of advertisements and posters to retrieve runaway slaves was widespread in the 1850s and created an extensive web of people being vigilant over the property of their fellow neighbors.  This sense of community might have been heart warming if this community had not been created to protect slavery.  The community although did not extend to the majority of the North because many northerners did not want to be responsible for returning slaves to their masters.

From political forums to private discussions people tried to come up with ways to solve the problem of the state debt and to hopefully to not increase taxes. In an open letter to the women of Virginia, Miss E. Maury came up with a plan to fix the state's problems by the mobilization of women. She reasoned that since the legislature refused to tax whiskey and tobacco that women should put up our shoulders to the wheel and see if we cannot move this heavy burden' according to The Lexington Gazette. Proposing that in each county a woman be appointed to be in charge of the Woman's Fund for Liquidation of the State Debt,' she envisioned a system in which women saved money and donated it to erasing the state debt and challenging peers to match their contributions.&lt;br /&gt;This proposal of a women's fund to take action in the government was part of a larger movement in the South that had taken root in the conflict of war. The war had lifted previous barriers to responsibility for women and after its end employment opportunities such as teaching were opened up to women. This newfound freedom was especially controversial in the South were according to William J. Cooper in The American South: A History, ladies were not supposed to unsex' themselves by stepping into the masculine world of politics, work, saloons, and such.'

Cotton consumption grew sevenfold between 1880 and 1900, the value of mills in the South multiplied nine times to about 95 million and the number of men employed in the industry grew from about seventeen to nearly one-hundred thousand. Cotton was unquestioningly the largest industry in the South, significantly outperforming the iron and steel factories and the tobacco industry.

This bill became an Act of the Confederate Congress on February 27, 1864.  The Act stated that all treasury notes greater than five dollars would be taxed four percent.  Bonds purchased before the month of April would be subject to a tax of thirty-three and one-third percent tax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Currency Act was passed in response to the highly inflated Confederate money.  However, the immediate effect of the Currency Bill seemed to have taken the mass of the people by surprise.  Prices rose instead of going down, despite what Congress had intended.  In addition, a large portion of the currency was in the form of one hundred dollar notes, and those notes needed to be funded.  They could not be exchanged at the same rate as the other dollar notes, but if they were kept back until the first of April, most of them would presumably disappear before then.

However, the General Assembly in Virginia was in opposition to the civil rights bill that was currently being debated in Congress because they contended that it would break the law as set up by the 14th Amendment.  The members of the Virginia General Assembly felt that the bill would unlawfully limit the rights of the states and that it would cause damage to whites and blacks because of its sectional' nature.  Among other things, the Assembly argued that this bill would have a negative influence on educational institutions, deter immigration, encourage emigration, and reopen the wounds now almost healed' causing long-lasting racial hostility.  The Democratic newspaper The Atlanta Constitution acknowledged Virginia's attack of the civil rights bill and supported them wholeheartedly:  We sincerely trust that this measure of iniquity is scotched.  It would prove a most destructive matter to Southern progress and civilization.  Its results for evil could not be calculated.  The madmen and fanatics who are seeking to force it upon the country know little of the detriment it would work.  These men are seeking to improve on the Almighty's handiwork.'

This had been a highly controversial issue and many continued to disagree with the black involvement. Black soldiers were seen as inferior in ability, and Confederate generals and soldiers did not want to fight along side them, and they didn't trust them.  However, the law was passed and signed by President Davis, and black soldiers, in retribution for fighting were given their freedom. Able bodied black man could fight, and they were able to secure independence and receive the same rations, clothing, and compensation as white soldiers.  Black soldiers in the Confederate ranks were compiled of both slaves and previously freed blacks. Many cried out against the integration, but General Lee stated, If we do not need the negro soldiers, the enemy will.' However, the bills to pass integrated soldiers didn't get to every state, and many prolonged the process, so by the time the Civil War ended on April 9th, there was very little integration of blacks into the army which had occurred.&lt;br /&gt;Congress passes the integrated soldiers bill out of desperation of troops to fight, the South is continuously finding itself at a disadvantage in numbers, and by adding the abundant race of blacks, the odds for a turnaround in the war were more probable. Confederacy integration of black troops was a huge step for southern states as it demonstrated that they could not fight the war alone and needed the help and numbers of black soldiers. Though most Confederates were opposed to the idea, if they wanted a chance in the war, numbers needed to increase. This was also a significant step in Confederate Congress' realization that blacks were able beings who could fight beside white soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;For African-Americans, the integration bill was a ticket to freedom. Slaves had nothing to lose by joining the war as soldiers, and they saw their chance out when laws of integrated troops were passed. The blacks were not interested in fighting for the Confederate Cause; they cared mostly about their fighting as a means to its end. This was the first time blacks could fight for their freedom, it gave them a goal and motivation to succeed as a soldier in order to survive the war and live as freed men."],"display_date":"March 13, 1865","search_date":"1865-03-13","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":609,"title":"Southern Reaction to Senator Stephen A.

Johnson's commutation ignited a tumultuous debate and uproar throughout the state of Virginia.  On the night of the commutation, a violent and unruly crowd of over 2,000 whites gathered outside of Richmond's City Hall to denounce Johnson and his commutation.  The untamed mob began to damage property and threatened to storm City Hall.  Some factions of the crowd began to demand that either Hatcher be released to the crowd to be lynched or the crowd would threaten Governor Johnson.  The Virginia Guard had to be deployed to subdue and disperse the crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequent gatherings to protest the commutation ensued over the following weeks.  Legislation censuring the Governor and overriding his commutation were contemplated, but eventually abandoned after appeals for Democratic unity from prominent politicians.  Several weeks of debate in the Virginia General Assembly were devoted to commutation fallout.  While Democrats were eager to vilify Hatcher as a murderous beast, they were reticent to denounce Johnson as this may have been perceived as sanctioning the lawless mob.  As in North Carolina, slaveholders were extremely concerned about uncontrolled lynch mobs of lower class whites who may seize or damage their property. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several gatherings were also held in Richmond to denounce the mob riots of 7 May.  The firestorm over Johnson's commutation exposed rifts in the Virginia Democratic party between the largely slaveholding Eastern counties and the recently enfranchised and largely non-slaveholding Western Counties.  While Eastern slave-holding Democrats in the General Assembly called for the imposition of stricter controls over Virginia's slave population, most notably to prohibit slaves from living away from their masters, no meaningful laws were passed in response to the commutation.  In fact, leniency toward slaves convicted of capital crimes developed as a pattern in Virginia jurisprudence over the next eight years.  Slaveholders were united in their opposition to lynch mobs and considered government interference in their administration of their slaves as an encroachment on their right to own, discipline and govern their own slaves."],"display_date":"May 7, 1852","search_date":"1852-05-07","locations":[{"id":13916,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":962,"title":"Condition of Public Schools in Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1871-01-13","end_date":"1871-01-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dr. William Ruffner, the Superintendent of Public Instruction for Virginia, published a report in Educational Journal of Virginia about the condition of the public school system in Virginia in 1871.

In order to get funding, the state issued three modes of taxation for public schools that required schools to be partially funded by a county tax. County school districts were not eligible to receive state money if the county did not provide some of the funding. In Henrico County, not one African-American cast a vote, for or against, the local school tax when it was put to a vote because most of the African-Americans in Henrico were not property owners. The white voters determined the local tax would be initiated in Henrico County and as a result the white voters essentially allocated all of the tax revenue to the white schools. &lt;br /&gt;The state also had to determine how it would allocate its teachers. The Richmond Board of Education session of 1871-1872 needed to decide on how to allocate its teachers. It needed twelve teachers for white schools and fifteen teachers for Negro schools. The teachers with the highest scores on the teacher examination were sent to the white schools and the teachers with the lowest scores were sent to the Negro schools.

In Virginia, the process began smoothly but became more complicated in 1867, after the meeting of the Virginia Constitutional Convention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Representatives from every county wanted to be a part of the re-drafting of the constitution.  In Nelson County, W.C. Carrington announced his candidacy in a letter addressed broadly, To the voters of Nelson County.'  Carrington had been a Confederate soldier.  Elsewhere, on the day of the October 22 election, John L. Marys, Jr. and Frederick C.S. Hunter asked for the voters of Spotsylvania, Caroline, and King George counties to cast ballots in their favor.  All three men, however, included information in their correspondence to voters that they would not vote in favor of a constitution that would bring harm to Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On November 2, 1867, the US Army 1st Military District of Richmond, Virginia published a notice that the constitutional convention would convene at the Hall of the House of Delegates in Richmond at 10 am on December 3.  This letter also included the names of the winners of each of the local elections.  Through this documentation, it can be seen that while Spotsylvania and its surrounding counties had chosen John Marys and Frederick Hunter to represent them at the constitutional convention, W.C. Carrington had not one the election in Nelson County.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the fact that the Virginia's convention began in 1867, the constitution itself was not submitted to a statewide vote until 1869.

The Readjuster Party won the election on a platform of repudiating state debt, expanding education, and promoting the interests of African-Americans.  They framed their message around rhetoric of class conflict that contrasted the interests of average Virginians against the interests of wealthy bondholders.  This message was reflected in a pamphlet of the 1878 Readjuster Platform that stated that, The bondholder shall pay taxes as well as the farmer and the laboring man,' and that, The money assessed to free schools shall not be stolen from the treasury and given to the bondholder, but shall be sacredly applied to our schools white and colored.'   Although the Readjusters were short of a majority after the election, they were able to assemble a governing coalition after a series of November demonstrations by leaders of the Richmond African-American community pressured 14 black, Republican legislators to join their caucus on December 13, 1879.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in power, the Readjuster party embarked upon an ambitious reform program.  This program included the repudiation of state debt, the abolition of the poll tax, extensive investments in public education that doubled the number of schools, teachers, and students, as well as the creation of Virginia State University to serve African-American students.

In addition to the 14 black Republicans in the Readjuster caucus, the party also elected 12 black delegates under the Readjuster party label.

After Lincoln made a call for troops immediately after Fort Sumter, a majority of Virginians voted in favor of secession feeling that the Federal government of the Union was becoming too coercive.

The recommendation was urged in response to the North's infamous and reckless breach in good faith when addressing the issue of past prisoner exchange.  Not only was Davis perturbed at the Union's ability to manipulate the South into releasing important Colonels in exchange for random Rebel privateersmen [recently considered POWs] in February of 1862, but greater frustration was felt when the Confederacy had released around 300 prisoners from South Carolina with no response from the Union at all, even from the prisoners of war taken in the defeat at Fort Henry and Donelson.  Not only had Federal forces not yet paroled the POW's, but instead taken them into the interior; by no means a gesture of release.  As Davis stated in his message, this was an act of retaliation called for by an act of flagrant perfidy.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two inferences can be drawn from this act, both of which illustrate the greater passion for which the war was going to be fought by the South.

The Revolution in transportation systems was incredibly important to the history of the American nation. Although canals would persist in certain areas, railroads became the main transportation method. With the improved technology of steel rails, automatic air brakes and larger, sturdier rail cars, trains provided transportation that was quick, reliable and quite inexpensive. As opposed to canals, which could be disrupted by ice in the winter and unsuitable water levels at various times of the year, trains could operate year round with dependability.

The Daily Richmond Examiner described Davis' desperate conditions in jail, detailing, he, is languishing in a long and unjust confinement that arouses the keenest emotions of the southern heart.'  After being convicted of treason, Mr. Davis remained imprisoned for two years and then returned to Richmond.  He accepted that secession was not a viable option for the south at that time, but remained a staunch opponent of strong central government.  Although Jefferson Davis was resented by some and his leadership during the war was often questioned, his trial and subsequent indictment served as a rallying point for the South.  When he was on his death bed in December 1889 people constantly stopped by his residence to see if his condition had improved.  Jefferson Davis died on December 6, 1889.  The funeral on December 11, was one of the largest in southern history, attracting by some estimations upwards of two hundred thousand people.

Essentially, General Orders No. 69 held that every exempt and detailed agriculturists' (i.e. plantation farmers, mainly) was to provide 100 pounds of bacon, or at the options of the Government, its equivalent in pork, and 100 pounds nett. Beef for each able bodied slave on the plantation between the ages of 16 and 50 years.'  The order also directed that these agriculturists sell at fair price any marketable surplus of grain and other provisions on hand' to the government or directly to soldiers' families.&lt;br /&gt;Written in conjunction with this General Orders, this circular explicitly indicates that several southern planters paid but little respect to the obligations they had contracted,' namely provision of resources in exchange for exemption from service.  This unwillingness towards, as the order says, diligently employing in good faith his skill, capital and labor, exclusively in the production of grain and other provisions' indicates a potentially deep rift forming between wealthy slaveholding land-owners and the poor white farmers that were fighting in the trenches.  This suggestion seems substantiated by the circular's indication that these exempt agriculturist sought profit by becoming speculators in food and provisions' while others openly affirm that they do not mean to have any surplus' that year.&lt;br /&gt;Looking back at the conditions that Confederate soldiers faced during the war, it is often contended that a lack of arms, munitions, food, or other resources never contributed directly to a major defeat.  In fact, many prominent schools of thought argue that the Confederates did not quit fighting until they had been absolutely destroyed physically, economically, and morally.  The hatred many southerners had more to feel towards the Yankees and the profound embarrassment that they anticipated if they should lose were often enough to keep southerners on task no matter how dire circumstances may have seemed.

Rosser, this release of general orders is meant to warn against and dissuade poor behavior within the Confederate forces.

Responding to such indiscretions as breaking rank during battle for the purpose of plundering or desertion of command by an officer, the order mandates that no officer or enlisted man will be allowed to sleep out of camp without a certificate from the Surgeon of his Regiment.'  Furthermore, along with a mandatory three roll calls per day, all areas surrounding camp were to be scoured in such of absentees, who would then be arrested and punished.  For example, one of the main punishments for a cavalry member or officer was a demotion to the dangerous front lines with the infantry.&lt;br /&gt;It must be remembered that this order was written during a period of extremely high stress for the Confederacy and its leaders.  In the wake of Union victories in Atlanta and the rest of Georgia and throughout Tennessee, the South was beginning to experience crushing defeats on its own soil with greater and greater frequency. This additional disaster' of which Brigadier General Rosser writes is additional' to that which Union Generals William Tecumseh Sherman and Ulysses S. Grant were inflicting across Georgia and northern Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the widespread Confederate desertions were devastating the South's chances on the battlefield against a bigger, stronger Union force.  By 1865, 104,000, or ten percent of the entire Confederate army had deserted.  These desertions were due mainly to the increasingly poor conditions that met the young, non-slaveholding backwoodsmen' that were conscripted into the army.  Many of these men had little desire to fight such a war, and they were often pulled away from the battle lines towards their families, who also desperately needed them.

Writing to Bryan, Barbour talked about political life absorbing his every moment, and wrote I am sick of politics. At this time, Barbour was going through a contested election to the House of Delegates in Virginia, which no doubt was a source of much of his frustration with politics.

With this allegiance, he opposed the man occupying the presidency after Adams, Andrew Jackson. When Jackson was elected president in 1828, after a long and passionate campaign, the National Republican party came to a stand-still for the a short period, and it was during this period that Barbour decided he had taken enough of the political world. It seems that the campaign for president in 1828 (and the overall struggle for power among parties) had been too rough on Barbour.

The Legislature of Virginia authorized the sale of only 250 maps, and required citizens of Virginia to submit an application in order to obtain a copy. <em>The Richmond Enquirer </em>claimed that the map reflects the highest credit on the science and skill of the persons immediately concerned in its publication and must prove highly gratifying and useful to the public. It cost 20 dollars to buy a copy of the <em>Map of Virginia</em>. <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em> asserted this to be a moderate price for a map of such fine quality. The sale of the <em>Map of</em> <em>Virginia </em>coincided with improvements in transportation; roads and use of waterways. This made it extremely popular among Virginians to own a map of high quality in order to have a coherent understanding of the land around them."," To produce the <em>Map of Virginia</em> cartographers and printers in Richmond used the process of planographic printing. This process made map printing faster and far less expensive. According historian David Woodward, to produce the <em>Map of Virginia </em>printers used lithographic ink or chalk to draw on stone. Printers accentuated the contrast between the inked and un-inked regions of the stone by washing the stone with a weak solution of nitric acid. This increased the porosity and water absorbing capacity of the un-inked regions. The stone accepted ink within the drawn images and characters, and rejected ink within the moistened areas when a roller covered with greasy ink passed over the stone. In the final step of reproducing of the <em>Map of Virginia</em>, printers placed a sheet of paper in a frame that they brought in contact with the inked surface. Printers transferred the image from stone to paper by applying pressure between the paper and inked surface. "," The <em>Map of Virginia</em> resulted from many years of labor, as well as at a great cost of care and money, on the part of cartographers and printers. <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em> wrote that no map of Virginia before this had surpassed in variety and accuracy of detail, or in beauty and elegance of execution. With an inadequate supply of maps in the early nineteenth century, Americans had a poor concept of their surroundings apart from the locations of plantations and stores in their local area. Maps in circulation tended to be unreliable and too expensive for most citizens to own. Beginning in 1820, it became increasingly important for Virginians to own maps as transportation improved with development of roads and use of waterways. Improvements in transportation coincided with the development of the new printing process, planographic printing. The development of planographic printing made maps far more accessible, accurate and affordable. Planographic printing allowed for Virginians to have a far greater understanding of the land in which they lived."],"display_date":"December 18, 1827 - December 19, 1827","search_date":"1827-12-18","locations":[{"id":13913,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1965,"title":"Mills and the Woolen Industry\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-05-11","end_date":"1821-05-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["M.H. Rice posted an advertisement in <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em> titled <em>Wool Wanted</em>. Rice claimed that cash will be paid for good, clean wool. In the expanding population of the early nineteenth century the demand for woolen cloth kept well ahead of its productive capacity. In response to the increased demand for wool, a boom in mill construction occurred across America. According to James A. Morris, southern mills had no advantage in raw wool production over the North. Instead, their competitive edge resulted from lower wages created by the presence of slavery that bolstered the economy. "," Virginians used four basic types of mills. According to Morris, in undershoot wheels water flowed against the bottom of the wheel. Undershot wheels depended upon the use of dam and a dependable stream volume. The overshot wheel used a flume or race that brought water against the top of the wheel. Breast wheels received water above the axis. Water set pitchback wheels into motion by running against the back of the wheel. Nature dictated where Virginians built their mills. Men constructed mills wherever a creek had a ten-foot drop or sufficient flow to sustain a dam or millrace. Most mills produced less than forty horsepower since power depended upon water flow multiplied by the height of the fall. Morris claims that mill owners most commonly used the high-breast design. Unless mills used a large wheel, only 60 percent of the streams power could be used. Water proved to be an unreliable source of power, mainly due to droughts and floods. As a result, wool production could not keep up with demand because the South did not have sufficient resources to produce the valuable commodity."," In addition, problems with the insufficient supply of wool resulted from a minimal supply of sheep. The increased market for vegetable and dairy products pushed sheep into grazing lands of the West. Americans used Merino sheep, the only breed of sheep present in America that produced quality wool. However, these sheep required a large amount of grazing land. The other types of sheep present in America in 1821 produced coarse wool that created undesirable, poor quality fabric. Problems also resulted from a lack of effective transportation to carry wool from grazing lands in the West back to cities in the South. The demand for wool exemplified a recurrent problem in the South at the time of Rice's advertisement; the South lacked a sufficient supply of resources to meet the demands of its growing population.

Most visitors stayed for many days, since family gatherings happened only a few times each year. Saturday was Christmas, and the celebration began with a visit to the huge Christmas tree outside the Fitzhughs' home. While the adults laughed and talked, the children rushed to the presents underneath the tree. Willie, Oscar, and Edward, Lizzie's brothers, received Roam candles, candy, and nuts. Bessie and Fannie, Lizzie's younger sisters, combed the hair on their new dollbabies.

When the Virginia planter died in January 1835, he left his entire Henrico County plantation and all its contents to his son, Randolph, to deal with however he saw fit. As the executor of his father's estate, Randolph decided to turn his father's gift into a fresh start by selling off everything from farm machinery and supplies to animals and utensils. He also put up for auction the most valuable part of his father's household: his slaves. ","In an advertisement published in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser, the younger Harrison outlined his father's possessions and invited all those interested to attend an auction. Randolph boasted he would be selling, 60 or 70 valuable Negroes...More valuable slaves are not to be found. Along with the slaves, Randolph allowed neighbors to bid on barrels of corn, feed, oats, work horses, mules oxen, cattle, sheep, pigs, and machinery: all the remains of a successful plantation in its prime.

Typically, slaves entering the market were divided into categories (No. 1, Second Rate, and so on) based on physical traits, temperament, and skill. Slave traders had an interest in portraying their wares as best they could. When buyers compared nominally similar slaves in search of a few to serve their purpose, appearance could often make or break a deal.

At a time when massive advancements were being made in the areas of agriculture, factory production, transportation, and communication, Richmond's General Assembly was still reeling from the logistics of such a massive overhaul. In early January, an advertisement was taken out in the Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser alerting the public to a petition about to be presented to the Assembly. If passed, the newspaper said, the petition would allow a railroad to be constructed, from the Coal Mines in Chesterfield, to some eligible point on James River, below Whitby bar as well as a line that would end near Belona Arsenal, in said county. At the time this issue was being voted on, Richmond (like the United States) was at a crossroads of economic growth. More than ever, industrial success depended on tying resources, markets, and people together in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Railroads were becoming the preferred way to do this, and any effort by the legislature to build an expensive railroad needed a lot of public support. ","But why was the General Assembly so eager to link coal mines with industrial centers (like Richmond) on the James River? The answer reflects an underlying fear that plagued many Virginians in the early nineteenth century: economic inferiority. Virginia had been a dominant producer of coal in the early decades of the nation's history, but by the 1830's the state was beginning to feel the strain of economic division. Rather than devoting itself completely to the production of one good (like states in the deeper South who depended on cotton), Virginia had diversified. As a result, coal miners in the west found themselves in competition with planters in the east for slave labor and transportation resources. This strain resulted in high prices and poor quality, setting Virginia behind other coal-producing states further north. Railroads represented a possible remedy for this problem, and would give entrepreneurs the ability to move coal from the mines to Richmond fast enough to be competitive with other states. Unfortunately, even the infusion of new technology brought on by the Industrial Revolution could not save Virginia's mining business. Although officials in Richmond tried to revive the industry (and gain public support), coal mining in the state was destined to remain the victim of arrested industrialization."],"display_date":"January 9, 1835","search_date":"1835-01-09","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2125,"title":"Runaway Slave Advertisement in Richmond, Virginia","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-01-09","end_date":"1835-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Walk down the streets of any major city in America today and it is hard to miss the fliers.

He also spoke with a slight stammer and had a scar near the corner of his right eye from a horse's kick that had barely missed blinding him. Billy's angry owner, Eliza S.

The Richmond Whig and Public Advertiser was hardly unusual in publishing notices of runaways like Billy.

The Randolphs of Richmond were one such family. In 1830, William Randolph and his clan maintained several houses and a handful of slaves across the state, living prosperously in the antebellum Virginia. Judging by records left behind, Randolph provided very well for his family, feeding, clothing, and educating them according to the standards of a wealthy southern patriarch.  ","One of Randolph's daughters, Elizabeth, received the same upper-class Southern education given to most wealthy females at the time.

This routine of music lessons, drawing, and other instruction expected of an antebellum housewife was standard fare for wealthy girls in the process of receiving their training. Rarely did girls get the kind of classical education in philosophy, history, and the sciences that their male counterparts received. Still, at the time Elizabeth wrote in the 1830's, women's education in the South was beginning to undergo a profound change - one that would make her form of schooling obsolete.","     Immediately after the Revolutionary War, female education was valued very highly. Educational reforms at the time favored higher education for women in order to prepare them to become republican mothers and pass on classical schooling to their children.

Higher education for women would not regain its former popularity until the 1850's when a new wave of reform swept over the South.

Originating in India in 1826, the world's first cholera epidemic traveled over trade routes and down polluted waterways - spreading through Asia, Europe, Canada, and the northern United States in the span of just a few years. Unable to identify a cause much less a cure, doctors were powerless to stop the advancing death toll that claimed thousands of lives around the world. By the time cholera had spread southward to Virginia, the epidemic had already killed 2,200 of the 2,800 permanent residents of Quebec and decimated the populations of Detroit and New York City.

Before the disease had hit Virginia's capital, Elizabeth's father, George, had left the city to spend some time in the countryside, leaving his daughter in the care of her grandparents. Once cholera began to spread across the city, it was too dangerous for George to return to his family.

Valentine, an overseer in the wheat trade, regularly made the long wagon trip from the wheat farms near Richmond to the mill in Louisa to deliver bushels of grain to be ground into flour.

If a farmer, city-dweller or plantation owner wanted a little light reading, for example, they could always crack open a book or leaf through the local newspaper. Printing in the years leading up to the Civil War was more advanced than ever, and as a result, printed material began to blanket every corner of the United States.","Even with books, journals, newspapers, and pamphlets encroaching on all aspects of daily life, the most popular literature to roll off the antebellum presses was the almanac. Almanacs were known as the poor man's Bible because of their practicality and widespread use among all classes. Leafing through the latest edition, a farmer could learn just about anything, from how to plant and harvest crops to how to break ill news. Almanacs also contained more civic-minded information, such as a list of the members of the General Assembly and a schedule for sessions of the local and federal courts.","Almanacs included so much useful information that many families kept a copy in their homes at all times (since they never knew when it might be useful). The Watson family of Richmond was no exception. One summer night in 1843, Caroline Watson was at her grandmother's house entertaining a visitor when the light started to fade. As the sun fell below the horizon, word was sent down from the house that grandma had gone to sleep for the night. A family servant told the visitor, Mr. Davis, that it was time for bed and offered to make up a room for him to stay the night. Much to the surprise of Caroline, the young man said he had not intended to stay and was actually planning on riding over to a neighbor's house that night on business. This created a problem because it was pitch dark outside. Mr. Davis suggested that if he waited at the Watsons' until the moon rose, he could find his way along the unlit roads. Immediately, Caroline consulted the family almanac, which said the moon would rise around nine o'clock that night. While they waited for the moon, Caroline and Mr. Davis were frequently interrupted by messages from her tired (and angry) grandmother, who eventually concluded the two were going to stay up all night.","By reading Caroline Watson's account of her family's evening visitor, it is clear just how often and in how many situations the almanac was consulted. Just as families today will use the internet to quickly look up information on any subject, families of the nineteenth century relied on the almanac in the same way - as an all-purpose reference manual for everyday life."],"display_date":"August 19, 1843","search_date":"1843-08-19","locations":[{"id":13915,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2134,"title":"Southern Reaction to the Nullification Threat\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-06-28","end_date":"1832-06-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was the summer of 1832, and tension hung over Richmond like a thick fog.  National unrest had been building throughout the United States for quite some time, and sectional pressure between the North and South was nearing its boiling point. Those people living in Virginia's capital sensed the impending conflict more than most. Mere months before the South Carolina nullification crisis erupted, John Campbell, a politically active Virginian, returned home to Richmond after extensive travel throughout the country. Immediately upon arriving in the city, Campbell was struck by the attitude of the Virginians he encountered. From all I see and hear since my return home [to Virginia], he wrote to his friend Claiborne Watts Gooch, I think the people of the South (SC included) will support, by a strong vote, the [Presidential] nominee of the [Democratic] Convention. President Andrew Jackson's power, he believed, could not be shaken by any foreseeable event. Campbell immediately gauged the attitude of the South and saw fit to place his faith in the extremely popular Jackson, who would be indirectly nominated for a second term by the first-ever Democratic nominating convention held in Baltimore in 1832.","Campbell did admit to himself, however, that Henry Clay (a Whig) and John Calhoun (a secessionist) would do just about anything to destroy Martin Van Buren, who was then serving Jackson's Vice President, and Jackson himself. Calhoun, he believed, was pushing for disunion in a vain grab for power, hoping to become the eventual king or emperor of a Southern republic. This attitude was surprising coming from a Southerner at a time when regional solidarity was growing, and Calhoun was seen as the face of an increasingly separatist movement. Campbell also voiced his sneaking suspicion that the secessionists (Clay and Calhoun) had a personal interest in separation and were not representing the will of their constituents. Jackson, he felt, could harmonize the Union and preserve American liberty as he had done before. Our Liberty is gone when our Union is dissolved, he wrote. Why should we throw away the fruits of the toil and blood of the fathers of the Revolution? Is it because a Clay or a Calhoun wishes to be President, and the people are too slow in gratifying their ambition? "," Campbell's own opinion after returning to Richmond is significant not only in its foresight (the Union eventually dissolving) but also in its point of view. Campbell was a Southerner living in what would become the capital of the Confederacy, yet he had reservations about nullification and great faith in national unity. In the course of studying the antebellum period, we often assume that all Southern males, for example, thought alike. In reality, there were those that disagreed with nullification and those who did not trust the so-called spokesmen of the South. John Campbell's letter serves as an interesting study of Southern dissent mere months before the North/South divide came sharply into focus."],"display_date":"June 28, 1832","search_date":"1832-06-28","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2135,"title":"College Life Before the Civil War\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-04-13","end_date":"1837-04-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Without question, higher education in the antebellum South was a luxury reserved primarily for the wealthy. Only the rich sent their children to college, and even among the upper-class, a college education was not a prerequisite for success. Many wealthy Southern families considered a college education to be an extravagance or even a threat to a social order where social class and racial superiority defined individual standing. Higher education before the Civil War was only for gentlemen and those destined for skilled professions.","Because college was viewed as such a luxury, those families that did send their sons to American universities tended to expect a certain degree of influence and control. Claiborne Gooch, an upper-class Virginian living outside Richmond, sent two of his sons, Richard and Phillip, to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. during the 1830's. Things did not go smoothly, however, and Richard (the youngest Gooch boy) routinely got into trouble with his professors. One day, as punishment, he was forced to kneel in front of the professor and the whole class in order to be publicly humiliated. The professor's intent was to shame his brash young student into behaving. This tactic, however, did not make Richard's father happy. ","In a scathing letter to Dean Thomas Mulledy, Claiborne Gooch denounced his son's treatment as a, disgraceful punishment...to the amusement of the whole class. Any humiliation of his son, he fumed, would not be tolerated. Gooch reminded Mulledy, in a not-so-subtle way, that college was a luxury he had decided to pay for against his better judgment, and was therefore owed some measure of influence. Gooch acknowledged that sending his oldest son Richard to college was the right decision. In Philip's case, however, Gooch had taken particular pains in letting Mulledy know what kind of trouble his youngest child could cause and the best way to deal with him. Those instructions had their limits, however. Any attempt to disgrace him in the estimation of his fellows or to blunt his sensibilities must have a tendency to defeat the very objects I had in view in putting him under your care, Gooch wrote.","In the 1830's, when the Gooch boys attended Georgetown, the University was a primarily Southern institution. As Claiborne Gooch's letter of protest demonstrates, college was not the same place it is today. Parents expected to get what they paid for from an opulent college education - and any type of humiliation of their gentlemen-in-training was out of the question."],"display_date":"April 13, 1837","search_date":"1837-04-13","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2577,"title":"The Elite South are Immune\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-09-07","end_date":"1832-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A cholera epidemic struck the United States in 1834, affecting southerners in every social standing. However; elitism and negative racial attitudes ultimately influenced perceptions about the transmission of the disease. Todd Savitt, a historian specializing in nineteenth-century medicine and disease stated that white Virginians often related high morals, clean living and orthodoxy to immunity during the cholera epidemics. White paupers, free blacks, and slaves because of their sinful ways, degraded condition, and filthy habits were viewed as the prime targets for cholera. Whites, who may have revealed symptoms of Cholera, were often diagnosed with diarrhea, dysentery, or fever rather than to be diagnosed with the poor man's disease. When the <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> reported the first case of malignant cholera in Richmond, it was not surprising to Virginians that the first victim was a slave boy. The master of the young boy wrote an urgent letter to the Richmond Department of Health describing symptoms of cholera and the condition of his dying slave. The young boy, an eleven year old subject to fits of diarrhea and incredibly dehydrated died a few hours later in the tobacco factory of his master. The young boy exhibited the principle symptoms of cholera: bouts of profuse diarrhea. The Richmond Board of Health traced the cause of cholera to the young boy's consumption of contaminated pears. The Richmond Board of Health would later publish statements connecting the supposedly crude eating habits of the underclass to cholera. "," Location rather than race and class attributed to the prevalence of cholera among free blacks, slaves, and lower class whites. According to Dhiman Barua and William Greenough, medical professors specializing in cholera epidemics, the cholera bacterium thrives in water ecosystems and transmits through the ingestion of water or food contaminated by fecal mater. Those living close to cities express high rates of vulnerability to the disease.  Transmission rates of cholera in the nineteenth-century South rose because of unsanitary conditions in newly developing cities. In Richmond, the James River and the Kanawha Canal provided opportunities for cholera to spread through low income homes and slave quarters. Free blacks, urban slaves and lower class whites throughout the South faced increased susceptibility to cholera that was attributed to densely populated housing, inefficient waste management systems and close proximity to local rivers, rather than race and class."],"display_date":"September 7, 1832","search_date":"1832-09-07","locations":[{"id":13914,"lat":37.539209631,"lng":-77.4101814026,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2589,"title":"Foreign Goods are Southern Delights\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1835-09-11","end_date":"1835-09-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Elite southerners adorned themselves in European imports as a means of showing ones status.

According to the Volos', Americans prized every connection to European nobility and believed that old American families should receive the same prestige as those of European families. "," The wealthy antebellum planters saw themselves and their class as the natural leaders of the community. Southern politics reached a balance by the early nineteenth century when the public order resided on the rule of the elite. Planters invented pseudo mythologies about the blue blood of wealthy southern families. According to the historian Richard Bushman, those seeking to bring European aristocracy into their blood line named their children after English Monarchs, in hopes of securing a better future, increase marriage prospects, and reflecting an image of wealth for their children. When the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em> announced the importation of dried food from Europe, wealthy elites sought to connect themselves to their imaginary noble pasts. The newspaper reported that in Market Bridge, Richmond dry goods from France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and India arrived. Over 150 packages of goods from the country were to be held in the safe storage of the city.

During the antebellum period, the practices of medical doctors were not always well regulated. Doctors were considered quite knowledgeable but most of their remedies were local in nature and chosen over pharmaceuticals. Steven Stowe, author of Doctoring the South, portrays southern medicine as a mixture of medical school background, country or conventional orthodoxy, personal experience, and even folk cures. The Encyclopedia of the Antebellum South reports that the medicines often prescribed were just as likely to kill as they were to cure the patient; they were often ineffective and allowed the illness to progress for too long before alternative procedures were started. Therefore, much of the development of medicines were not in a lab at a medical school, but rather by the trial and error of educated men on their own time."," Authenticity was a concern for newly developed medicines. Druggists and all other dealers of medications were allowed to sell Cephalic Pills but only the genuine product has the signature of its creator. Not only was the authenticity of the drug an issue, but also the advertisement's claims as to its effects. An ad in the Richmond Daily Examiner in August of 1861 promoted cephalic pills to cure sick headache, nervous headache- even all kinds of headache They are made entirely of vegetable extracts and the ad claims these pills to be the result of much research and experimentation. This ad, like many others of its kind, primarily targeted literary men, students, delicate females, and all persons of sedimentary habits. These pills were said to double as a laxative, restoring the natural elasticity and strength of the whole system. "," The scientific basis for the development of these pills was not yet advanced. Pharmacology in general was still in the early stages of development. Pills were considered more proper than potions, for relief of the head because they remained in the stomach longer before they were able to dissolve. They are also not considered weak or strong and therefore are very agreeable to the digestive system. The basic fundamentals of chemistry were not even solid at this point. It was not until 1897 that JJ Thomson discovered the subatomic particle known as an electron Medicine had just now begun to evolve towards more modern and scientifically based techniques."," The second half of the nineteenth century was a groundbreaking time for biomedical science. The development of germ theory and establishment of fields such as pharmacology paved the way for significant advances in medicine and pharmacology. There was no laboratory instruction for students of pharmacology before the Civil War, and it was not until some pharmacy schools became state supported in the 1860s, that science held an integral role in pharmacology.

Four out of every five southern men left their homes and family to fight for the Confederate cause. Families were torn apart and more often than not, because of death, not able to be put back together. "," Most Confederate men joined the army to protect their lifestyles - their families and their land. They wanted to protect their liberty and their homes from attack. However, as the war progressed, many men felt that they would be almost better served at their homes, protecting one piece at a time. By 1864, Union armies occupied every Southern state and they began taking over. Desertion by Confederate soldiers resulted because they feared so much for their family's safety. In William Cooper's The American South, he quotes a desperate wife's forceful case saying there is no use in keeping a man thare to kill him and leave widows and poore little orphen children to suffer...

Violators of this ordinance were subject to fines of twenty dollars a day. "," In the absence of copious amounts of potable water, Americans consumed alcohol in large quantities during the nineteenth century, becoming a strong target for social reform. Alcoholism continued to become more and more common - husbands abusing or raping their wives, drinking away all of their pay, leaving their children with nothing to eat... and eventually women had had enough. "," Women held an important role in the beginning of the temperance movement. They increasingly became discontented with their place in society. They formed prayer groups and rallied against saloons, preaching that temperance meant purity, marital stability, economic improvement and prosperity, and religious salvation. Women wanted to resettle their lives and rid society of the substance that caused such economic disparity. "," Petitioning continued. Newspapers often ran stories of bar fights, domestic violence, and street scrambles caused by alcohol. Political cartoons published in magazines such as HarpWeek, featured wives with their young children, minus their drunkard father who never returned to provide for his family, leaving them in the cold. Temperance reformers insisted on total abstinence from alcohol and demanded legal prohibition. Many brewers and liquor producers organized public campaigns against women's rights because they knew that once women had a vote, prohibition would not be far behind. "," Temperance became a fight for peace on the home front. Many women felt that their lives had been disrupted by the repercussions of alcoholism. Some Christians believed drinking was sinful against God. Families were falling apart. Something had to change. "," Richmond passed the no sale of alcohol on Sunday's law to appease those who favored prohibition. Limiting the sale of spirits was at least a step in the right direction for reducing the stresses alcohol caused. Many were angered by the passage of the bill. It decreased profits for restaurants and bar owners. Most viewed this act as the precursor to nation-wide prohibition."," Temperance began by encouraging moderate use of hard liquor, but the movement turned quickly into complete elimination. Prohibition by law became a hot topic in every political campaign at every level of government. The Prohibition Party was created to support a candidate for the prohibition efforts. Religions divided between wets and dries. Strong Methodists, Baptists, and Quakers were strongly in support of temperance, while the wets including Episcopalians and Catholics, did not believe that the government should have the power to define morality. "," The war temporarily interrupted the movement simply because everyone was preoccupied with a larger struggle. Nevertheless, after the war, the Women's Christian Temperance Union was founded in 1874 forming one of the largest woman's organizations in the world. Due-paying membership exceeded 200,000 in the late 1800s. Its message was education, if it could 'get to the children' it could create a 'dry' sentiment leading to prohibition."," Temperance was a nationwide issue after the war. Virginia was not alone in restricting the purchases of alcohol. The numbers of women who joined temperance was overwhelming, proving their rising concerns. Women slowly started to gain a voice in government and not long after in 1919, nationwide prohibition came into effect with the passage of the eighteenth amendment.

On January 11, 1868, HarpWeek published a two-picture political cartoon entitled The Pleasure of Tobacco. The first picture featured a young man in bed enjoying his pipe. The caption under the drawing said, To which young and promising Tom Smudger abandons himself. He wasteth the midnight oil. Quantities of Killikinick, and himself simultaneously. However, the second picture is a casket covered in a sheet with a pipe on top. The casket is resting in the grass of the graveyard; captioned Smudge becomes a martyr to his Love, and the Object of the Devotion is buried with him. This cartoon warned against the fatal consequences of smoking tobacco. "," George William Curtis, editor of Harper's Weekly, used to smoke himself but stopped in the 50s. In 1867, he submitted his own editorial to warn his readers of the negative effects of tobacco use on their health. He said that tobacco contained poisons that were harmful to our bodies and that if we quit, we will soon feel in better health. The deadly politics of tobacco was certainly a struggle- on one hand it was the second most profitable cash crop in the South, but on the other, people were dying from it as well. "," HarpWeek published many advertisements for tobacco products as well as those for quit and get fit campaigns. But in the man while people die prematurely of palsy of the heart, cancerous stomachs, and diseased lungs from its excessive use; and they will continue to do so if half the world is depopulated by this vegetable tyrant. Lack of scientific evidence regarding tobacco's harmful effects caused much controversy over the topic. Some claimed that everything in moderation was fine, including tobacco use and that it in no way could be linked to disease. "," Even the last great tax on the luxury of cigars and pigtail, by Congress, which seemed likely to limit its consumption, has had no more effect than beating an elephant with a feather. Efforts were made by governments across the country to tax tobacco more heavily in hopes to reduce its widespread usage; however, it's use continued to only expand. Some saw tobacco as a drug, a killer, and others as just something to do to pass the time. Even a hundred years before Surgeon General warnings, we already had begun to understand tobacco's effects. "," Tobacco was more prevalently grown during the colonial period, than during the years after the Civil War, but it certainly had not disappeared from the scene. Seventy-five percent of cotton came from plantations along with other crops such as sugar, rice and tobacco. Richmond was one of the largest producers of tobacco in the world during this time. The slave trade experienced increased activity and more profitability than any other time thus far and therefore provided even more labor for fieldwork. The new railroads connecting the rest of the country also allowed tobacco to be traded and sold great distances. Tobacco remained a very important cash crop in North Carolina and Kentucky. Meanwhile plantations in Virginia and Maryland were not so fortunate; they suffered from depleted soil and decreasing profits. "," Tobacco was an extremely soil depleting crop. While plantations thrived, small farmers were hard pressed for money for such large-scale productions. They would often plant small plots of lower quality tobacco and rotate with other crops like sweet potatoes and cowpeas to allow the soils to recoup. These small farmers rarely could afford to own slaves because prices had sky rocketed in upwards of 2,000 a slave. In order for plantations to succeed, planters not only had to have plenty of acreage but enough cheap labor to work it. Needless to say, the plantation economy was not the norm for most southern whites but was responsible for the production of the majority of tobacco for the entire nation. "," The years preceding the war, cigarettes became the most popular form of tobacco- both hand rolled and machine rolled. The tobacco industry continued to boom from Virginia all the way down to Georgia. Durham and Winston-Salem North Carolina, Louisville, Kentucky, and Richmond, Virginia became major centers for cigarette production and brought wealth to the areas. The invention of the cigarette rolling-machine and the manufacture of cigarettes so close to home increased the demand for the plant immensely.

Penn, a prominent white man, with favor as they suspected him of committing a rape and two murders. In Danville, Virginia, Penn raped ten year old, defenseless Lina Hanna. Penn, her owner, badly injured Hanna, an African American, who was very lucky to have survived. The rape was not the only disaster in this story. The biggest mystery of all was the disappearance of Lina Hanna's mother and sister. Many suspect that Penn, in order to silence the witnesses, murdered both women. Some townsfolk believed that he discarded of the bodies in another state. Regardless, Penn was successful in covering up his actions and destroyed any way of himself being accused of such a violent crime. Penn terrified Hanna's mother and sister, and they did not want to accuse him in fear of the possible consequences. ","White masters raping their young black workers was a frequent occurrence, before, during and after the Civil War. This instance involving Hanna and Penn was just one of many situations in which sex crossed the color line. Some were voluntary actions of both parties, while some, such as the story of Lina Hanna, were rapes. ","Beginning around the 1890s and continuing on throughout the decades, interracial sexual relations and marriage became less prevalent. Whites opposed interracial relations because they believed that venereal disease was widely spread in blacks; this discouraged white men from approaching black women. Black men and women began to try to stop the abuse; whenever a black woman would enter a store where a white man would be, there would be a group of black men waiting outside for her. "," Although its prevalence declined, interracial sex did not stop; it moved from the plantations to the towns, where there were more opportunities for a sexual act to go unnoticed. The populations in towns were constantly changing, and the chance of an intimate moment between two people of different races, who were unacquainted, was far more common without the possibility of affecting the lives of either person. "," The rape of Lina Hanna is different from the trend at the time, because it occurred on a plantation. This specific instance became less common after slavery ended and time went on. Although the trend was changing from plantations to towns and less defined areas, rape was still happening between the white masters and their black slaves.

The first lynching happened just five days into the new year. Each week the names, race, alleged crimes, place lynched, and date of the lynching were listed for all those who had been lynched during that year. Each week someone picked up the newspaper to see if anyone had been lynched since the previous week. "," For the week of May 29, 1897, there was not a new lynching listed since the past week, but there had been 28 since the beginning of that year. Lawrence Brown, an African American, accused of arson near Cranbury, South Carolina, was the first one to be lynched in 1897. At least one out of the 28 lynched were white. Two of the 28 were women, Mollie Smith and Amanda Franks, both from Jefferson, Alabama. They were accused of using poison and as a result were lynched. Out of all 28 of the people who were lynched, only one survived, William Clement, a black man of Cambell County, Virginia, who was accused of striking a white man.","Lynching increased in the late 1800s at a steady rate. During the 1890s, according to William Brundage, a growing number of conservative whites, concerned that lynching threatened the social tranquility and economic future of the state, agreed that lynching must end. They discussed whether certain crimes deserved mob vengeance or if they should be handled at the courts' discretion. Lynching affected the region, the state and the south as a whole, as it disrupted the economy. "," During the early 1890s, African Americans debated how to protest using appropriate measures and desperately searched for a way to protect themselves from violence. A picture depicted a few lynched men in the Richmond Planet, the question is posed: Shall this barbarity continue until the God of retribution marshals his strength against the barbarians? The idea growing in Virginia was that lynching was unnecessary and need not be tolerated. Some whites also hoped to end lynching and the violence, believing that it hurt their economy. Many blacks and whites did not want lynching to continue, and yet the there was an increase in the numbers lynched in the 1890s. "," Lynching increased in the south after 1880 through the 1950s, where 80 percent of the nation's lynchings occurred. The number lynched each year did not drop below 100 until several years after the turn of the century. Lynching was a community event, in which mothers and children watched, and the lynchers were very rarely arrested. According to William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E. Terrill, lynching was community-sanctioned murder, and death was usually accompanied by torture and mutilation. Lynching did not start to decrease until the 1950s.

This greatly disturbed Judge Buchwalter, and the next time Kentucky asked him to send his prisoner to their state, he worried about what would happen to the prisoner. He first contacted Kentucky and pleaded that the prisoner, before being harmed, be given a fair trial."," Reverend A.H. Hampton, Buchwalter's prisoner, was accused of shooting and wounding a white man with intent to kill. Kentucky once again asked Judge M.L. Buchwalter to send the prisoner to Kentucky for the decision of what to do with him. Buckwalter hesitated in sending this man to Kentucky. He first wanted to make sure that the prisoner would be protected until the court made a decision, and that he would be guaranteed a fair and impartial trial in accordance with the provisions of the constitution of the United States. Judge Buchwalter did not want to send the charged man to Kentucky and have him lynched before he even had a chance to defend his life. "," When Kentucky could not guarantee such a request, Judge M.L. Buchwalter discharged the prisoner. In this case, Judge Buchwalter represented the beliefs of Ohio as a state. According to The Richmond Planet, Ohio refuses to act as an agent for murderers and will not deliver a black man into the hands of lynchers. "," This article, published in Richmond Planet, an African American newspaper, showed the North's beliefs on lynching without a fair trial. It also showed the difference of opinion in Virginia and the South as well. The disapproval or support of lynching seemed to have reached a peak in the 1890s and newspapers all over the nation, such as this one, stated their opinion on the situation. "," Southerners, however, maintained the argument that the lynching was not unwarranted or unexpected. They wouldn't lynch a black man for something that was not harmful, such as communication with a white woman. According to William Brundage, that was only a trivial infraction of racial etiquette. But there were different levels of what was deserving of lynching. Mob vengeance was incited by more serious infractions. Theft was more serious, although it did not elicit mob violence. Minor and implicit sexual crimes incited mobs sometimes. Murder, however, got whole white communities together to lynch blacks. "," The emotions derived from each crime determined the severity of the actions. Rev. A. H. Hampton's actions would probably elicit a strong emotion from a group of whites in Kentucky, and thus he would probably be lynched. Judge M.L. Buchwalter was probably right then, to have not sent him back to Kentucky, because he would not have received a fair and impartial trial, as the Judge had wished he would, before the mob decided that he was undeserving of such a trial.

One is that Hay went out of his way to state that the blow was given by a fellow servant. Whether or not this is true (it is entirely possible that Hay himself was responsible for the blow, as the physical abuse of slaves was prevalent), this wording was likely used to avoid a situation where another would find Manuel and take pity on him for being an abused slave. Secondly, he used the word servant to describe Manuel. Richmond (in comparison to other parts of the south) in the early 1800s was not an especially harsh environment for a slave or any African-American. Also, in other texts in the <em>Enquirer </em>this term is used for slave. Thus it is likely that some of the people were not in favor of slavery. By using the word servant as opposed to slave, Hay attempts to avoid bringing up the moral issue of slavery to those people whom he hopes will assist in returning his lost property."," Also interesting is that Hay posted this reward in the <em>Enquirer </em>multiple times (it shows up again on August 9, 12, 23, and 30). Fifty dollars was a substantial sum in 1815, one of the higher rewards offered for a runaway slave, and the fact that Hay would offer that type of reward, as well as continue to buy space in the newspaper to advertise this fact, shows how valuable a slave was for a white person.

Gooch wrote a letter in the winter of 1825 on the issue of slaveholding in Virginia and the South. Gooch believed that the subject of slaveholding states rights' was not getting enough attention from southern politicians. Throughout the letter Gooch argued against the intrusive interference of our northern neighbors on that of slaves, saying that they knew nothing of the cultural state of things among us [the South]. He also argued that there is little difference in the state of African-Americans in the north and the south, except that of political rights, which were hardly rights in the north. Slaves had better lives than their poor northern brethren, he stated. Gooch did not defend slavery's virtues in this letter; instead he argued against the north forcing its ways upon the south. He even stated that the southern states themselves are affording a devise gradually to get rid of the evil [slavery], but that they were doing it their way, on their time. At the end of his letter, he focused on the independence of Virginia as a state, and that as such the state has its own rights to run things the way it sees fit, under its own timetable."," In this letter much is seen about the way Virginians thought of the institution of slavery in the first half of the nineteenth century. While slavery in the inner-city of Richmond was not embraced as it was in much of the plantation south, Virginians still defended their right to have it everywhere, and resented the northern states attempting to end it. Gooch's statement that the northerners know nothing of the state of things in the south (and that slaves were better off than their northern counterparts) showed that southerners in Virginia honestly have believed that their institution of slavery was not in fact the evil it was made out to be. At the end of his letter, Gooch's emphasis on Virginia as a state and the rights that it thus had foreshadowed the Civil War that was still over thirty years away. The attitude that the northern states could not tell the southern states what to do, specifically with regard to slavery, would eventually be a key factor in dividing the country and leading to war. This would be very important in Virginia, a border state in the North-South conflict.

This line of stages and steamboats was most likely intended for the middle to upper class of society in Richmond.

The sale consisted of all household and kitchen furniture as well as horses several negroes. All items were slated to be sold to the highest bidder. Credit was to be allowed for the purchase of some items; however the more expensive items (presumably the negroes) required the use of cash. The house of Thomas Blackwell was then to be rented for one year, with several negroes being hired out for the balance of the year. The last thing Wren mentioned in the notice is for anyone who had a claim against Blackwell's estate to come forward before the sale, so that they could be compensated after the sale for the balance that is owed."," The direct sale of slaves in Richmond during the early 1800s was frowned upon if it split up families or was deemed cruel in anyway. Richmond differed from plantation Virginia in this aspect, as in a city fewer slaves were needed and conditions were somewhat better. This specific sale is unusual because the enslaved people were being sold off due to the death of their master. Blackwell's estate was being auctioned to pay off debts that he had incurred during his life, and the slaves would bring in a substantial sum of money for this purpose. This episode is significant with regard to slave sales because it shows that while the sale of slaves may not have been the economic force it was in the deeper South this early in the nineteenth century, it was not so taboo that a man would shy away from posting about a sale in a commonly read newspaper."," This episode also shows how information was passed in this time period in a large city such as Richmond. The newspaper was used as a public forum for information such as this, for no better medium existed through which to inform the masses of current events. This was very important for Richmond, as the common events of daily life in the city would generally be recorded in the newspaper, making all aware of events going on in their city's daily life.

On April 18, 1831, a duel took place in Richmond, Virginia, between a Mr. Prior and a Mr. Rae. Both gentleman resided in the central Virginia region and were of the wealthy class among their local communities. The fight began over a dispute about the Hampton Academy, a topic of much debate over the past 18 months. Mr. Prior suffered no injuries during the incident while Mr. Rae was shot in both legs. He then was carried many miles to safety which only aggravated his injuries even more and brought him closer to his death. "," This story of Mr. Prior and Mr. Rae, published in the Virginia Herald newspaper, illustrates an important idea concerning the personality of southern white men during this time period. Above all else, honor was the most essential characteristic a white man could have. It was what separated him from the blacks, and what helped him gain the respect and admiration of his peers in the community. Kenneth Greenberg, in Honor & Slavery, describes southern white men as superficial. He states that They were concerned, to a degree we would consider unusual, with the surface of things-with the world of appearances. Southerners took pride in their words as well as the general appearance they displayed to the world. The quarrels often originated from accusations, insulting words, or verbal disagreements. If a man questioned another man's words or negatively commented on his outlook, many were willing to fight to the death over it. ","It is very important to see how Mr. Prior and Mr. Rae were willing to put their lives on the line for what we would see as trivial instances of name calling and verbal disagreement. For them, these were profoundly important instances that called into question their trustworthiness and honor. Greenberg recognizes the minor importance of death when he says, Free and honorable gentlemen were not afraid to die because they believed that mastery over the fear of death seemed a precondition for life as free men.

The board highlighted the state's abolishment of slavery, the demand for a range of skills, equal rights accorded without regard to political affiliation, and low mortality rate. The pamphlet also emphasized the assurance of hospitality, and there was special mention of the Christian character of Rev C. L. Clausen, commissioner of immigration. Immigrants, often targets for fraudulent offers, would be in safe hands with Rev Clausen, who could sell farms at low fixed prices, and upon the most accommodating terms of payment. "," This advocating of immigration can be traced to the New Departure movement of the Reconstruction period. Supporters of New Departure promoted the idea of an economic, self-sustaining New South, which rejected overdependence on plantations and favored agricultural modernization along with industrialization. Under this theory, immigrants would become the new source of labor and contribute to a whiter South by replacing blacks.

We will be pleased to know that the unpleasant matter is settled.\" ","On December 30, 1885, Phillip Haxall, President of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, penned the preceding sentences in a letter to Chairman William H. Mullen of the Boycott Committee of the Knights of Labor. This statement expresses the significant influence the Knights of Labor had achieved in the areas of labor relations and social reform by the end of the 1880s. The organization, noted for its official motto, \"that is the most perfect government in which an injury to one is the concern of all,\" was established on January 1, 1869 as a secret society in the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Knights of Labor prided themselves on establishing a diverse and integrated membership that was committed to the preservation of working-class rights.  ","Before the industrial influence of the Knights of Labor can be explained, it is important to first understand the underlying premise of the boycott staged against the Haxall-Crenshaw Company. Due to racism still evident throughout the Reconstruction Era, black prison populations had vastly expanded in size. State governments attempted to capitalize on this situation by instituting a system of convict labor. Historian Edward Ayers describes the structure of the state prison labor system, stating, \"for a small fee, a railroad builder, a planter, or a mine owner could use the labor of state convicts with little financial risk and with no labor troubles.\" In Richmond, the Haxall-Crenshaw Company used convict laborers to produce the barrels that contained company products. The Knights of Labor, dedicated to free labor and economic justice, believed convict labor competition infringed upon the rights of the free working class. In order to counteract this practice, the Richmond Knights of Labor devised a boycott, one that was ultimately successful.","The founding principle of the Knights of Labor is nowhere more evident than in the surviving papers of William H. Mullen. Commissioned as \"Organizer\" for the Richmond District Assembly, or \"DA 84,\" on November 28, 1885, he was authorized by decree from the General Master Workman (T.V. Towderly). Historian Peter J. Rachleff described Mullen's immediate impact on the city of Richmond when he noted Mullen's order of \"a boycott of the products of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company, which packaged these products in convict-made barrels.\" This boycott, instituted in order to protect the interests of black coopers in the Richmond area, was sanctioned through Mullen's power to \"exercise all the authority conferred upon him by the Constitution, Laws, and Usages of the Order.\" Mullen's papers documented the Richmond District Assembly's creation on January 1, 1878, and the continual desire to protect rights of the working class from corporate abuse through the five principles of \"JUSTICE, WISDOM, TRUTH, INDUSTRY, and ECONOMY.\" Thus, the boycott of the Haxall-Crenshaw Company was an opportunity to stimulate social change through non-violent means, drawing upon the strength of an integrated and unified working class.","Perhaps it was the Knights of Labor's superior efficiency in mobilization that led directly to industrial reform in Richmond. Under General Master Workman T.V. Towderly, the labor organization rose to prominence in the 1880s, becoming, as Craig Phelan observes, \"the most significant and ambitious labor organization of the Gilded Age.\" In a document describing the \"Great Seal of Knighthood,\" found among Mullen's papers, the Knights of Labor were instructed to \"hear both sides, then judge.\" Through the work of Chairman William H. Mullen, the Richmond Knights of Labor were able to preside over the \"public court of labor\" on behalf of their working class constituency.

These naval transit routes, specifically a possible Nicaraguan canal, would better enable the United States Navy to protect the nation from the threat of other nations.  Of particular interest to the United States was the Straight of Isthmus, which connected North and South America, for \"to us, on account of its geographical position and of our political interest as an American State, of primary magnitude, that Isthmus is of peculiar importance.\"  This strip of land was of great much importance to the maritime nations as it could potentially provide a water passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  ","At the time of this article a new Nicaraguan president, William Walker, was elected.  He called for an alliance with the United States, including an initiative of annexing Nicaragua to the United States as a slave state.  Soldiers from the United States went to Nicaragua in an effort to aid Walker in his bid to power for the Isthmus as a maritime transit route that would benefit both Nicaragua and the United States. William Mason, who went to fight in Nicaragua from the Virginia Military Institute, was passionate about the Nicaraguan issue and journeyed through Mississippi and Louisiana to gather other men who wished to fight for this cause.","Nicaragua's call for annexation to the United States was clearly an important issue at the time.  Its acquisition would have given greater power to the United States in its effort to obtain this transit route that would ultimately have given more power to the nation.  Ultimately the unstable political situation in Nicaragua posed too much of a hazard to the United States' troops and therefore the United States looked for different options in an acquisition of a canal.  The Nicaraguan issue's prevalence in the newspapers and in the passions of men such as William Mason, who willingly gave his life in Nicaragua, gave insight to its importance and the importance of a maritime transit route to the American people.

The articles captured the South's passionate desire to defeat the abolitionist Republican Party. They called upon all southerners who \"cherished the principles of their revolutionary fathers, to unite [against the Republicans].\" An article published on May 6, 1856 entitled, \"The Staunton Convention\", warned southerners to seize immediate political control, claiming that a Republican victory would lead to total destruction of the South.

The author of the editorial aimed to inspire political support for the Democratic politician Grover Cleveland while describing the fundamental differences between the Democratic and Republican Parties of the 1890's. According to the author, Cleveland's ability to provide justice without offering paternalistic help or hindrance, coupled with his bold stance on tariff reform, made him a human embodiment of Democratic principles.","Overall, the editorial distinguished the political philosophies of the Republican and Democratic Parties preceding the American presidential election of 1892. As a whole, Republicans of the 1890s believed in using the federal government to direct economic expansion. Most felt that it was the business of the government to take complete control of the country's economic development. This activist position was illustrated in the Republicans' support of the McKinley Tariff of 1890, which increased the protective tariff for American businesses. According to historian Davis Dewey, for Republicans, \"restrictive duties were no longer regarded as a temporary stage in the arduous journey toward industrial freedom, but a principle which ought to be permanently adopted.\" The McKinley Tariff was a source of great discontent for many Americans because it raised the prices of goods while lowering the wages of lower- and middle-class Americans. In contrast, Democrats of the 1890s believed \"that it was the duty of the people to take care of the government; that the just function of the government was to protect every man in his rights and allow him the freedom to achieve his density in his own way.\" The Democratic opposition to protective tariffs illustrated their anti-government attitude. According to the <em>Campaign Text Book of the Democratic Party for the Presidential Election of 1892</em>, \"Democrats firmly believed that protective tariffs favored foreigners at the expense of Americans.\" Thus, Democrats argued that the government had no right to impose such tariffs, and those that transcended this limit were essentially guilty of robbery. Clearly, the issue of protective tariffs illuminated the key differences between the free-market Democrats and protectionist Republicans."],"display_date":"December 22, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-22","locations":[{"id":13920,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4006,"title":"The Arrest of Anthony Burns\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-02-01","end_date":"1854-05-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At the beginning of 1854, Anthony Burns was a slave in Richmond, Virginia.  He also worked as a deliveryman for a druggist named Mr. Millspaugh. One February day, after a delivery, Anthony secretly boarded a \"Baltimore clipper\" headed to Boston with the goal of finally attaining his freedom.   He spent three grueling weeks balled up in a space hardly big enough for his body, fighting the cold and the rocking of the sea. Upon arrival in Boston, he was relieved, believing that he had finally become a free man. ","On May 24, 1854, fugitive slave hunter, Asa O. Butman, approached Burns on a street in Boston and accused him of stealing from a jewelry store. He subsequently arrested Burns and escorted him to a room where his former master, Charles F. Suttle, was waiting for him.  Under the authority of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act, Suttle explained, Burns was being arrested and taken back into slavery. Burns' arrest sent shockwaves throughout Boston, and on May 26, a mob attacked the Boston courthouse, attempting to free Burns. They were unsuccessful in their efforts, and Anthony Burns went to trial with his freedom at stake. The judge, U.S. Commissioner Edward G. Loring, ultimately ruled in the master's favor, and on June 2, Anthony Burns boarded a ship back to Virginia as a slave once again.","            Upon his return to Richmond, Burns was incarcerated, remaining in jail for four months.  After he had served his term, a plantation owner from Rocky Mount, North Carolina purchased him from Mr. Suttle, and they stole away shortly after, during the middle of the night. The public was completely ignorant to his whereabouts, and Burns was afraid that he might have lost any chance he might have had to achieve freedom. \"Buried thus in the obscurities of slavery, Anthony remained for some months wholly lost to the knowledge of his northern friends.\" He, however, did not have to wait long for help to arrive.  The Reverend Leonard A. Grimes, who had tried to purchase Burns after his initial arrest, had been tipped off as to the slave's situation and offered the owner 1300 dollars for Anthony's freedom.  The owner thus sold Burns, who was quickly transported back to Massachusetts where he received a hero's welcome.  ","            Anthony Burns was the last famous slave to be returned to his owner under the Fugitive Slave Act. \"His trial in Boston in 1854 sent fifty thousand people into the streets in protest and invigorated the abolition movement in the United States.\" But Burns' legacy did not fade. His story is still used today as an example of the unfairness of the Fugitive Slave Act.  Every week in Boston's federal courthouse, a rendition of the trial is acted out for middle and high school students.

Sure, the camp itself was not at war, but daily life and responsibility started to wear on the soldiers in Henrico County, Virginia.  John B. Tate communicated in a letter to his superior officer, Jacob van Lear, that the men were restless.  Embroiled in a military chess match with Britain on their own soil, this was an awful time to have depressed soldiers.  At any time, the men at Camp Mitchel might be called to duty.  So, maintaining a high morale was equally important as remaining sharp in battle.  Nevertheless, feelings of anger and frustration abounded, and some officers, like Tate, sought to appease the soldiers, if for no other reason, than to boost morale and spur victory against the very deadly British and Indian forces.","For those camps not at war, everyday chores such as guard duty were a necessity.  Even so, men like Bob Beard detested it.  Assigned watch in the pouring rain, Beard's increasing disenchantment with his place in the war hit its tipping point.

In an effort to do something to change his situation, Beard rallied the men in camp to support a bill in the House of Delegates that would discharge them from duty.  His efforts did not fall on deaf ears.  Other men, like Andrew Seat, begged for higher wages.  The unhappiness throughout the camp incited change.

The issue of this debate was participation in the Democratic Party National Convention at Baltimore, Maryland-where the party's Presidential nominee was to be decided.  The Baltimore Convention was the second such attempt; Democrats had met earlier from April 30th to May 3rd in Charleston, South Carolina for the same purpose.  There, the majority of the Lower South delegation (as well as a few from the Upper South) felt that the convention had grown hostile to their interests and had failed in its duty to protect the Constitutional right to slavery.  They cited as evidence the primacy of Stephen A. Douglas supporters at the convention and the establishment of a platform that ambiguously endorsed his idea of popular sovereignty for determining territorial slavery.   The disaffected delegates withdrew from the convention and set up their own caucus nearby.  From there, most \"bolters\" expected that they could negotiate their interests with greater leverage and, ultimately, rejoin the National Party.  However, the decision of the National Party Convention to adjourn from Charleston and reconvene on June 18th in Baltimore forced confrontation.  The decision made clear that the National Convention would not just submit to Southern demands.  Yet probably the move's most powerful, and inadvertent, impact was that it removed the breakaway delegation's ability to quietly conduct talks while maintaining overt separation.  Suddenly, Democrats from both the Upper and Lower South were under tremendous pressure to take a stand in what many deemed a choice between polar alternatives of submission or a genuine party split.","            It was in this context that the debate began between <em>The Charleston Mercury </em>and <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em>, both Democratic newspapers that usually agreed with each other.  The issue of location proved to be particularly important in their debate, as one may infer from the fact that their cities' hosted two of the three conventions in question.  The <em>Enquirer's</em> native state of Virginia was largely the head of the Upper South states who, at the time, were still members of the National Convention.  Furthermore, though the <em>Enquirer</em> itself was not usually so ambivalent, Virginia had a history of behavior that was at times unfaithful to the Deep South platform, especially in regards to slavery.  <em>The Charleston Mercury</em>, for its part, was a first-rate example of the South Carolinian persona-a zealous and unrepentant champion of slavery and the South; it was not afraid to say \"secession.\"","            The debate began in a May 10th article from the Charleston Mercury challenging <em>The Richmond Enquirer</em>.  The <em>Mercury</em> wrote that the <em>Enquirer </em>should have rebuked their delegates for not withdrawing, and further criticized the <em>Enquirer's </em>proposal that the Richmond Convention should wait to act until after the Baltimore Convention.  The <em>Mercury</em> ridiculed this idea that would leave delegates with nothing to do but \"suck their fingers.\" On May 18th, the <em>Richmond Enquirer </em>had much to say in response.  First, it said that Virginia wanted to participate in the Richmond Convention, but that as it was, they and other likeminded states wouldn't be able to nominate delegates in time.  Next, the <em>Enquirer</em> said that the Southern delegates should participate in the Baltimore Convention.  It said that the temporary fracture of the party was likely enough to restore a majority that was supportive of Southern interests. At last, the <em>Enquirer</em> argued that the obdurate pursuance of the Richmond Convention's current course was not only dangerous to the Union, but also to the unity of border slave states with the Deep South.","            <em>The Charleston Mercury</em> rejoined with what would be the final words on the matter.  Immediately, the <em>Mercury</em> challenged the idea that other Southern states wouldn't have time to join.  Also, to the suggestion that the National Party would change its position, <em>The Charleston Mercury </em>replied that, \"the <em>Enquirer </em>may dismiss from its patriotic anxieties all such romantic anticipations.\"  Finally, the <em>Mercury</em> laid great emphasis on the discussion of Southern unity.  The <em>Mercury</em> defended sole participation in the Richmond Convention as better securing the interests of the South.  At the Baltimore Convention, some Southern delegates would invariably be tempted to compromise Southern interests and side with the Northern Democrats.   This claim, along with <em>The</em> <em>Richmond Enquirer's </em>final thoughts, penetrated the core of the debate, a struggle between identification foremost as a citizen of the South or of the Union-in a political climate wherein it seemed that one of them was bound to be overthrown."],"display_date":"May 10, 1860 - May 23, 1860","search_date":"1860-05-16","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4750,"title":"All Quiet on the Petersburg Front ...

Hagood, commander of the First South Carolina Infantry, skirmishes continued even during “quiet” times and often proved deadly.","Historian A. Wilson Greene points out that Grant’s next strategy, following the Union’s mass casualties at the Battle of the Crater, was to target the transportation routes into Petersburg, cutting off the critical supply line of Weldon Railroad and exploiting the “weakened and divided Army of Northern Virginia” in August of 1864.  Hagood’s regiment arrived in Petersburg on August 23, and kept themselves busy “throwing up field-works in its vicinity” until September 28, when Grant went on the offensive once again and ordered Union forces to attack Fort Harrison – also known as “Battery Harrison.”","The strongest fort on the Richmond-Petersburg line, Fort Harrison was overtaken by Union troops on September 29, in spite of a “personally organized” campaign by Lee to regain Confederate control of the fort.  According to Hagood’s report in <em>The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies</em>, Confederate forces made preparations on September 30 to regain Fort Harrison.  Historian Richard J. Sommers writes that Lee’s foot soldiers were his only hope in recapturing the fort, and a plan to converge regiments from Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina was put into play.","As another regiment ran toward the confrontation, Hagood noted that this was a waste of energy that could have been saved for the more important “struggle on the parapet.”  He wanted the record to show he was not in agreement with this decision, but “believing it to be an order, [he] acquiesced.”  What Hagood did not realize at the time was that Confederate commander “Tige” Anderson had failed to explain the plan to his men, and once the Georgia regiment charged forward, it was too late for the South Carolinians to get into position.  “Timing and tactical skill” were crucial to the success of this plan, reportedly devised by Lee, and one without the other resulted in chaos.","The Union forces opened fire, and, according to Hagood, what followed was mass confusion – as one brigade “gave way, and rushing through our line caused immediate confusion.”  Many of Hagood’s brigade had already abandoned the battle, leaving only a few men who remained with him as he moved within 60 yards of the fort.  After waiting 10 to 15 minutes for reinforcements that never arrived, Hagood decided his only remaining choice was to “fall back.”  Frank Mixson, a private in Company E of Hagood’s 1st South Carolina Volunteers, stated that Hagood returned to the open field to retrieve his regiment’s colors from the clenched hand of a dead fellow soldier, making such an impression on the Yankees that they did not fire on him “while he was doing this gallant deed.”  Hagood later received orders to “advance again on the enemy,” but upon executing the command, he found there was no enemy.  On October 7, however, Hagood’s regiment made a daybreak attack on Union forces “on the Darbytown Pass and drove [them] from the line of works.”","Hagood’s report revealed that he was often frustrated by what he perceived as lack of rational explanation for decisions sent down to his brigade.  On the October 7 charge, his orders were to move on the enemy’s artillery, which he did.  But after a “long delay, which has never been explained” to him, Hagood and his men re-engaged Federal troops, who by now had reinforcements and were able to fight back.  Hagood’s men eventually withdrew, losing all the ground they had gained that morning, but on November 27 they drove back Federal troops on Williamsburg Road and captured “30 or 40” as prisoners.  On December 9, Hagood moved his men down Darbytown Road to the enemy’s position, and “after considerable maneuvering (for which purpose and with what effect I [Hagood] have been unable to learn),” the brigade “withdrew in the night and returned to camp.”  Again, Hagood’s tone was one of frustration over what he believed was poor planning and use of time and resources – but being an “obedient servant,” he followed his orders.","The Union army later changed the fort’s name to Fort Burnham, after Union Brigadier General Hiram Burnham of the Sixth Maine Infantry who was killed in the attack at Chaffin’s Farm, near Richmond, on September 29.  The battle at Fort Harrison resulted in 37 deaths, 209 injured, and 19 captured or missing Confederate soldiers – nearly half of Hagood’s regiment.  Compared to major battles such as Gettysburg or Vicksburg, the fight for control of Fort Harrison seems somewhat insignificant.  But in the lives of Colonel James R. Hagood and his 572 men, it was not only significant – it was a matter of life and death, and a story that deserved to be recorded."],"display_date":"September 28, 1864 - December 9, 1864","search_date":"1864-11-03","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":338,"tag":"Petersburg campaign"},{"id":339,"tag":"Fort Harrison"},{"id":340,"tag":"Fort Burnham"}],"course":{"name":"American Civil War Era","school":"Furman University","course_id":34,"school_id":4}},{"id":5077,"title":"<strong>A Jewish Rebuke to Confederate Anti-Semitism in Richmond </strong>","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-03-27","end_date":"1863-03-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 27, 1863, Reverend M.

In the sermon, Michelbacher responded to accusations that Jewish Southerners were not properly devoted to the Confederate cause and were instead speculating and engaging in selfish business practices.  Michelbacher denied these accusations and spoke of Jewish honesty and support for the Confederacy.  He argued that Confederate leaders like Robert E. Lee never questioned Jewish patriotism, and that many Jewish Southerners were fighting in the Confederate army.  He also prayed for the Confederacy, entreating God for food, a renewal of spirit and

Confederates, </em>Robert Rosen examines the role of Jewish citizens in the Confederacy.  He argues that Jewish Southerners, being white, of small number, and often of the merchant class, were safer and more accepted in the American South than the North.  If true, this would help to place Michelbacher's sermon in the context of a community currently undergoing criticism but safely within and

a pressing need for medical services, Sally Tompkins established a hospital after the First Battle of Bull Run that became the best hospital during the Civil War.  Running the hospital was not always easy; Tompkins faced pressure from many people to close down the hospital.  In June of 1864, Dr. Carrington, an inspector of hospitals for the South, filed an order to have the Robertson Hospital closed.  Fed some misinformation, Carrington was under the impression that Tompkins was admitting too many soldiers into her hospital.  In a letter dated June 9, 1864, Tompkins replied, “Dr. Garnett’s endorsement on the morning report of June 5<sup>th</sup> ‘that this Hospital, limited to 19 patients, numbered 44’ was written under a misapprehension of the facts.”  Tompkins was not one to be pushed around.  She was a knowledgeable woman with a strong record to prove it.  Later in the letter, Tompkins states, “I think the register of this Hospital will show as great success in its management of the sick and wounded as any other.  Since the 1<sup>st</sup> of last June, we have had 337 patients and but 8 deaths.  Many of them sent to us were (by the statement of Dr. Garnett made to myself) the worse cases.”  Tompkins understood the vital role her hospital played in the war and did not want to see it closed.","Even as a child, Tompkins tended to those who were ill.  She had a helping heart and desired to put it to good use.  As infirmaries quickly filled after the battle, an intense need for more hospitals arose.  Tompkins knew she could provide a solution, so she asked her friend Judge Robertson if she could use his house to provide medical care to wounded soldiers.  He agreed, and Tompkins readily set to work preparing the building and recruiting staff members.  The first patient was admitted to Robertson Hospital on August 1, 1861.","The hospital was first threatened on September 5, 1861, when the Confederate government ordered that all private hospitals be shut down because some soldiers were faking illness to escape military duty.  Not willing to go down without a fight, Tomkins went to President Davis to ask him to allow her hospital to remain open.  She showed him her carefully kept records to prove her hospital was better than many of the others.  Impressed with her abilities, President Davis appointed her to the position of Captain on September 9, 1861.  This would enable her to keep her hospital open and receive military supplies from the Confederate government.","Her defense of the hospital paid off.  A total of 1,333 patients were treated there, only seventy-three of which died.  This was due in large part to Tompkins’s dedication to cleanliness and strict order.  In a journal article written for <em>America’s Civil War</em>, George Hagerman claimed, “Wounded soldiers coming to Richmond begged to be admitted to her hospital.”  Tompkins was a well respected woman and served an important role as a Captain for the Confederate States of

speaks to the way in which she cared for the soldiers.  In an article published in <em>America’s Civil War</em>, George Hagerman said, “Each patient discharged from the hospital received a knapsack or bedroll with clean clothes and a book of prayers and gospels.”  Not only did Captain Tompkins care for their medical needs, she also provided for their physical and what she believed to be their spiritual needs as well.","Sally Tompkins was born on November 9, 1833 in Mathews County, Virginia.  Even as a child, Tompkins dedicated her time to helping care for others.  A strong family history of military service led her to lend her talents during the Civil War.  On July 31, 1861, Tompkins opened Robertson Hospital in Richmond, Virginia.  In order to keep the hospital running and secure government funding, Jefferson Davis appointed Tompkins Captain of a Confederate cavalry unit.  In an article written for a website, Ron Maggiano stated, “Carrying her Bible and medicine bag, she spent endless hours comforting and healing those in her care.”  Captain Tompkins dedicated her life to the Lord and her time and money to the hospital.  Hagerman wrote, “She never drew any salary for her work, believing that the money could be better used in caring for her patients.”  Of the 1,333 soldiers who received care at Robertson Hospital, only seventy-three died.","Captain Tompkins passed away on July 25, 1916 and was buried with full military honors at Christ Church in Mathews County, Virginia.  An eight-foot monument stands beside her grave as a reminder to all who see it of her compassionate heart and dedication.  As an additional way of remembering Captain Tompkins, four chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy were created in her honor and scholarships were also offered in her name."],"display_date":"September 10, 1961","search_date":"1961-09-10","locations":[{"id":32295,"lat":37.537998501,"lng":-77.4058582907,"zoom":9,"place":"Henrico,

Civil War hospital was no place for a high society woman, but Phoebe Pember took on the challange with ease. When most Southern women spent the war sewing and mending clothes, Pember spen it as the head matron of the largest hospital in the South.  Pember chastised women who hit behind conventional modesty rather than volunttering for nursing assignments. As head matron she was in charge of making sure that the soldier of the wards were well taken care of by the other staff, often doing the work herself when it did not meet her standards. She was often seen at night at the bed side of a sick soldier or roaming the halls makeing sure all were resting comfortably. Going above and beyond her duties and not following the expetations of the surgeon that the nurses were to obey their orders and not make suggestions when it came to a patients well being, Pember was not a favorite of the male staff.","Women who worked in the hospitals were often frowned upon and  urged by their famileis to come back home. They along with society did not see the need for women to do such things and be around men that were not their husbands. For the nurses had to care for the sick and tent to their wounds often being exposed to male bodies for the first time.

Emmett Martin to his wife, one can see the content, yet suffering state of mind that most Confederate soldiers were in during the days following the Seven Days Battle. Soldiers wanted to be cheerful as they had just won a battle, but were seemingly unable to muster that emotion because of the losses they endured. The Seven Days Battle was technically a Confederate victory. However, historians wonder if it should be considered a victory at all, as the South suffered immense losses.  Martin demonstrated how distressed many southern soldiers were from the deaths and wounds of comrades and the prolonged time and distance between themselves and their loved ones. Other than the effects of the Seven Days Battle on the Confederacy, it also becomes obvious in this letter how poorly educated some of the soldiers were who were fighting in the Civil War.","James McPherson, author of <em>Battle Cry of Freedom,</em> has discussed how devastating the Seven Days Battle was to the southern troops. McPherson reports that the Confederate’s “total causalities in these six contests exceeded Union casualties by 20,000 men.” R. Emmett Martin emphasized this reality as he named off several soldiers he knew who fell that day. Martin summarized that “Our regiment lost in killed and wounded one hundred and twenty six [men].” It is questionable how southerners were supposed to consider this battle a victory when they had lost so much.","The importance of family is also emphasized in Martin’s letter. These soldiers had lives and families waiting for them to return home. Martin showed how important his family was to him as he began his letter: “I write in a haste and only a few lines to inform you of my safety after the hard fought Battle…” Martin spent his spare moments on writing letters to reassure his family that he was still alive. At the end of the letter, he also promises to write again, and in more detail, when he had more time.","Lastly, R. Emmett Martin’s letter shows a stereotypical southern Civil War soldier. It seems as though Martin could not have gone more than a few lines in his letter without a spelling error. For example, “I was in with the regimant,” and “it was an awfull hot place.” These spelling errors also could have been due to other factors such as hurrying to write. However, Frank E. Smitha, a lifelong researcher of history and philosophy, explains that southerners overall were in fact poorly educated during this time compared to their northern counterparts. He states that “Of the nation's 321 public high schools only 30 were in the South.”","Overall, the letter from R. Emmett Martin reiterated many ideas from McPherson, and brought plenty of new ideas to the table as well."],"display_date":"July 3, 1862","search_date":"1862-07-03","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1619,"tag":"family"},{"id":663,"tag":"Letters Home"},{"id":2229,"tag":"Soldier's letter"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6266,"title":"<em>Francis Blair Sr. Facilitates Peace Conference</em>","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-12-28","end_date":"1865-02-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In December of 1864 Francis Preston Blair, Sr., a native of Kentucky residing in Maryland, approached Abraham Lincoln about a peace conference between Blair and political leaders in the South. Blaire was a seventy-three-year-old journalist and influential politician. In 1856 Blaire helped organize the Republican Party. His influence also derived from his editing and founding the <em>Washington Globe </em>.  Blair met with Lincoln on December 28 requesting a pass to Richmond to visit Jefferson Davis. Lincoln, aware that Blair’s trip to Richmond had a political agenda, later wrote that he did not endorse the politics of the trip. The president wrote, “…He was given no authority to speak or act for the government, nor was I informed of anything he would say or do on his own account, or otherwise.” Abraham Lincoln saw Jefferson Davis as his largest obstacle in readmitting the South into the country, as the Confederate President saw secession as the only satisfactory outcome.","Francis Blair received an invitation from Jefferson Davis on January 3,1864 to come to Richmond and arrived on January 12. In Richmond, Blair met with Davis and his wife, Varina. Blair laid out a plan for peace that called for the end of fighting between the North and the South and the uniting of their forces against the French in Mexico. In respect to slavery, though, Blair insisted that it was a doomed institution. Davis rejected the proposal of uniting troops and ending slavery, but indicated his willingness to engage in dialogue with Lincoln.","In a letter he wrote to Blair on January 12, Davis stated he would meet with representatives with the goal to “renew the effort to enter into conference, with a view to secure peace to the two countries.”  Upon reading the letter from Davis, Lincoln responded with a letter to Blair in which he asked him to tell Davis that he was willing to meet with a representative with “the view of securing peace to the people of our common country.” The Hampton Roads Conference, an attempted peace conference between Lincoln and representatives of the South, took place on February 3, 1865."," "," "," "],"display_date":"December 28, 1864 - February 3, 1865","search_date":"1865-01-15","locations":[{"id":13917,"lat":37.5392399795,"lng":-77.4106423457,"zoom":9,"place":"HENRICO, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2525,"tag":"Hampton Roads Conference"},{"id":2524,"tag":"Francis Blair"},{"id":132,"tag":"Jefferson Davis"},{"id":683,"tag":"Abraham Lincoln"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6385,"title":"The Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery in America to Freedom in England","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-12-01","end_date":"1852-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William and Ellen Craft were both born in 1820s Georgia to, by the standards of that time, fairly sensitive masters. Neither was ever beaten by their masters, yet they still could feel the shackles of slavery. They met each other in 1846 by coincidence, and by 1848 were married. Their decision to escape slavery was heavily influenced by, besides their desire for and right to freedom, their desire to raise children out of the confines of slavery. Their escape was quick—eight days from their initial idea—however it was not easy and they ran into many obstacles along the way.","Their idea was based on the fact that Ellen’s quadroon skin made her passably white. So, they decided she was going to dress up as William's male master and chaperone him to Philadelphia, a free state. With nerves rumbling, they gathered costumes and props--Ellen decided to wear glasses and poultices around both her mouth and her arm so that she would neither be recognizable nor be asked to speak or write. Their masters issued them “holiday” papers for a short Christmas vacation. Along their journey, they encountered Ellen's family's friend and William's employer, but luckily were not caught. Many pro-slavery Southern Whites they met warned Ellen, code-named \"William Johnson,\" that her “slave” may escape when they get to the North. Blacks free and enslaved urged William to seek freedom when he got to Philadelphia.","If William and Ellen had good masters, why, then, did they want so badly to be free? Did they not have food, a job, a bed? This sentiment is what Saidiya Hartman says is the worst part of this institution. \"If the excess of enjoyment imputed to the enslaved displaced what we would think of as disturbing circumstances, it did so only by obscuring violence and comflating it with pleasure\" (Hartman 25). The institution's ideologies as a whole seeped within the community in the form of subconscious racial discrimination and subordination, allowing whites to alleviate their guilt in an instance where a slave seems to be treated more humane than usual. This natural inclination towards racism under the lens of paternalistic, goodly masters is seen throughout the Craft's interactions with the upper-middle to upper class white persons on the trains and steamers. When they were on a train in Richmond, an elite woman mistook William for her escaped \"Ned\" because she “never in my life saw two black pigs more alike” (Tweedie 62).  This incidence truly emphasizes the social atmosphere of the era. A majority of whites held skewed views of blacks and a lot of people were very proud and open about it. This woman was of a paternalistic view of blacks, that they were less intelligent and she knew what was best for them. This idea led her to change the will of her late husband, which had called for the emancipation of his slaves. She sold them because she thought it was “such a cruel thing to turn n****rs loose to shift for themselves, when there are so many good masters to take care of them” (Tweedie 64). A discussion, thus, took place amongst her, Ellen, and gentleman who was sitting by them, though it brought no change of mind to the woman. She reserved her paternalistic view of her slaveholding status."," Mysteriously, the couple came across much luck in their travel. At the port in Baltimore en route to free land in Philadelphia, a \"Yankee of the low order\" (Tweedie 68) claimed he could not let men with slaves pass without his approval, to prevent the emancipation of the slaves. With sheer luck, the conductor of the train recognized the couple and convinced the Yankee to let them board. While in Philadelphia, they met a man who was a member of the Society of Friends and who graciously hosted them for three weeks. During those three weeks, the freed William and Ellen learned the alphabet and how to spell and write their names.","It came to be, however, that they were not safe in the supposedly free land of the North for, in 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was enacted and their masters sent out warrants for their re-enslavement. As quickly as they arrived in the North, they fled for Canada and then England. William remarks at the end of his narrative about how unfortunate it is that, in order to be free, he and Ellen had to flee a land that prides itself in freedom and equality for the land which that country fled from just a few centuries prior.","                                    \"In short, it is well known in England, if not all over the world,                                                                                        that the Americans, as a people, are notoriously mean and cruel                                                                                    towards all coloured persons, whether they are bond or free\" (Tweedie 111). "],"display_date":"December 1, 1848 - January 31, 1852","search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":52774,"lat":32.8406946,"lng":-83.6324022,"zoom":8,"place":"Maçon, GA"},{"id":52775,"lat":32.0835407,"lng":-81.0998342,"zoom":8,"place":"Savannah, GA"},{"id":52776,"lat":32.7764749,"lng":-79.9310512,"zoom":8,"place":"Charleston, SC"},{"id":52777,"lat":37.5407246,"lng":-77.4360481,"zoom":8,"place":"Richmond, VA"},{"id":52778,"lat":39.2903848,"lng":-76.6121893,"zoom":8,"place":"Baltimore, MD"},{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"},{"id":52780,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"Philadelphia, PA"},{"id":52781,"lat":42.3600825,"lng":-71.0588801,"zoom":8,"place":"Boston, MA"},{"id":52782,"lat":43.661471,"lng":-70.2553259,"zoom":8,"place":"Portland, ME"},{"id":52783,"lat":45.2733153,"lng":-66.0633081,"zoom":8,"place":"St John, NB, Canada"},{"id":52784,"lat":44.9902861,"lng":-64.1310364,"zoom":8,"place":"Windsor, NS, Canada"},{"id":52785,"lat":44.6488625,"lng":-63.5753196,"zoom":8,"place":"Halifax, NS, Canada"},{"id":52786,"lat":53.4083714,"lng":-2.9915726,"zoom":8,"place":"Liverpool, UK"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":501,"tag":"Escaping slavery"},{"id":2306,"tag":"Slave narratives"},{"id":420,"tag":"Slaves"},{"id":2737,"tag":"Civil War era"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6687,"title":"Let Us Back In!","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1870-01-01","end_date":"1870-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["This letter is from the Secretary of State in 1870, to the Governor of Virginia, officially readmitting the state back into the Union. This comes at about five years after the end of the Civil War. Virginia, of course, leaving during 1861 to join and run the Confederate States of America, Richmond being the capital of the Confederate States. After the Confederacy lost, the whole United States had a long road to get things back to normal. Part of getting back to a sense of normalcy, is bringing the nation back together as it was before the war.","Some time after the war, there were Acts of Reconstruction put into place to bring back that sense of normal. These acts had certain requirements set in place in order to bring a state back into the Union. These states needed to ratify the 14th amendment which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” The state also needed to rewrite a new State Constitution and have it approved by the federal government. All Four Acts are as follows: Each district was to be headed by a military official empowered to appoint and remove state officials, Voters were to be registered; all freedmen were to be included as well as those white men who took an extended loyalty oath, State constitutional conventions, comprising elected delegates, were to draft new governing documents providing for black male suffrage, States were required to ratify the 14th Amendment prior to readmission.","All the states were approved by 1870. The president at this time, Andrew Johnson, was highly against these Acts. He felt it would soon rekindle the fire of aggression if the South went through with these changes. Even though he vetoed it multiple times, congress pushed through and passed all four of the Acts.","This proved to be a trying time during the aftermath of the Civil War. It took the length of the war itself to put the nation back into order. Even today, the effects of this are still felt and many people still do not quite agree on the outcome of the war itself."," "],"display_date":1870,"search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":52777,"lat":37.5407246,"lng":-77.4360481,"zoom":9,"place":"Richmond, VA"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"},{"id":3307,"tag":"Acts"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}}]}
