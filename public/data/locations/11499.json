However, in issue #126C of <em>Amazing Heroes</em> titled “Millenium,” there’s an emphasis placed on popular culture outside of comics themselves. One short article in the beginning of the issue, titled “<em>Captain Eo</em> Hits Stores in August,” brings a music star into the comic world. An ad for a comic adaptation by Tom Yeates of a 3D film starring Michael Jackson that could only be see at Disneyland and Epcot Center, the book was predicted to have extensive reorders due to Jackson’s massive popularity. ","The idea of bringing Jackson, a megastar, into comic books supports the concept of transmedia. According to Henry Jenkins, transmedia is defined as “storytelling [that] represents a process where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience... the strategy may work to draw viewers who are comfortable in a particular medium to experiment with alternative media platforms,” (Jenkins par. 2 and 6). It’s often used in the comic world, being that superheroes would debut in print and make their way to other platforms like radio, television, movies, physical merchandise, and more.","Transmedia in comics became crucial when World War II was emerging, mainly through the means of incorporating Superman into radio propaganda. Being the first superhero, Superman was, arguably, the most popular of them all. Seeing his success in the printed comic world, it was figured that he could prosper in other media platforms as well. On February 12<sup>th</sup>, 1940, <em>The Adventures of Superman </em>radio serial aired, only a few months after the first propaganda film for World War II emerged. Appearing on the Mutual Broadcast System, Superman was depicted fighting more villainous, real forces— affiliating himself with pro-American wartime imagery as a result. Serving as its own form of transmedia, “propaganda, in effect, was a form of advertising, enabling media messages to flow more freely across the borders of media. Both the strategies of producing interlinking narratives in the Superman comics as well as the character’s new construction as propaganda had involved many of the same industrial configurations, with both concerning the production of a flow of adjoining content across media—urging those who had purchased Superman already to purchase Superman again,” (Freeman par. 14). By using Superman in propaganda-like radio shows, the superhero found success in an audio format as well as print by fighting the “real” enemies of the American people. In turn, people would trust him more, and buy more of his comics as well.","Carrying into the 1980s, transmedia was used in “<em>Captain Eo </em>Hits Stores in August.” Through using Michael Jackson, the world’s most famous pop star at the time who appeared in several other media tie-ins like the 1978 film <em>The Wiz, </em>along with Pepsi commercials, <em>Amazing Heroes</em> knew that bringing him into their comics would not only increase their sales, but bring in readers who previously hadn’t picked up their comics. Not only was incorporating Jackson beneficial to them, but to Jackson as well, being that “it [was] necessary to develop new strategies, codes and narratives that brands and artists [were] creating to connect with consumers. Music [was] the basis of the collective experience and, in addition, it connect[ed] intensely and emotionally with the identity of groups that [were] its potential target,” (Sánchez-Olmos and Viñuela 11). Though he already had ample exposure, Jackson hadn’t been included in the comic book world before, giving him a new audience of people.","            Though popularized within the comic’s industry in World War II due to Superman transitioning to radio, transmedia proved to be popular in the industry long afterwards, incorporating a powerhouse musician into a print format to increase sales and draw in new readers."],"display_date":"October 1, 1987","search_date":"1987-10-01","locations":[{"id":53146,"lat":42.7353595,"lng":-84.4831298,"zoom":11,"place":"East Lansing, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1775,"tag":"Comics"},{"id":2589,"tag":"Superman"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":3585,"tag":"Transmedia"}],"course":{"name":"ENG 492H Honors Seminar in English","school":"Rollins College","course_id":185,"school_id":5}},{"id":6815,"title":"Superheroes in the Modern Era: How Print Icons Became a Big Screen Phenomenon","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/30","end_date":"10/8/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The 1980s were full of new superhero movies; from <em>Flash Gordon </em>to <em>Batman, </em>the decade was full of new takes on characters that were often up to half a century old. In Gary D. Robinson’s article “Of Kids and Comics III”, in <em>Amazing Heroes </em>issue152, he tackles the contrast between what schoolchildren of the late ‘80s thought of superheroes and what he observed as a child. It addressed the difference between comic book culture and superhero movie culture, focusing primarily on how children are more and more associating the characters with films rather than comic books. This essay examines the more contemporary relationship between comic books and their film counterparts, focusing on the elements that caused a shift toward a movie-dominated superhero industry, both then and now.","The transition from comic books to films began in large part with the motion picture serials of the 1930s and 1940s (Mcallister et. al). This success, combined with a rapidly growing movie base, was the catalyst for where these films are today. It was easier to justify making movies about well-beloved characters than unknown ones, and as movies at the time were still relatively new with an uncertain future, there was less of a reason to start from scratch. Despite this early start, superhero movies did not really pick up until the 1980s.","            While the 1980s are generally associated with upbeat music and bright colors, that is not fully indicative of the times. The Cold War was still a threat, and nuclear war seemed like a possibility every day. In the early days of the Cold War – the mid-1950s – superhero comic book makers tried and failed to revitalize the print industry, with youth instead flocking to EC’s crime and horror comics as a way of combating the uniformity of their generation (Wright 135). Once an end was in sight to the Cold War, many filmmakers began to turn to flashy, kind-hearted superheroes to symbolize American hope and distract from the dismal reality that many felt, despite the characters often being put in darker scenarios than in the comics (as demonstrated by Tim Burton’s 1989 <em>Batman</em>).","In this article, Robinson also addresses growing cultural issues, like illiteracy and an America-wide preference for cinema over reading, and how he feels this is harming society and, more importantly, the academic growth of children. The focus, however, is primarily on children recognizing superheroes less as a comic book fixture, and more as a movie staple. With a sharp increase in superhero movies in the last fifteen years ago, this trend is decades-old and not likely to die down any time soon.","Michael E. Uslan, an executive producer for the 1989 <em>Batman </em>film, offered three reasons as to why the superhero movie genre has taken off in the last two decades: technological advancements (better digital effects), cultural traumas (like 9/11), and utilizing a pre-existing fan base to procure immediate interest (Burke 23). These three reasons were all relevant in the 1980s, when Robinson’s article was written, but are even more relevant today, particularly with the increased popularity of fan events, like Comic Con. It is also an effect of the political events in each period – the Cold War in the 1980s and 9/11 in the early 2000s.","Joseph Michael Sommers’s take on the growth of the superhero genre shares some similarities with Uslan. Sommers believes that the 9/11 terrorist attacks heavily affected the genre, and Americans’ need for someone powerful and in control, even in entertainment. This similarity to the Cold War’s effect on the superhero movies of the 1980s speaks to the growing relevance of comic movies over comic books in popular culture.","This growing relevance is entirely why this essay is needed. Robinson’s article was written thirty years ago, and little has changed; in fact, the superhero industry has gotten even closer to being film-based than it was back then. This essay engages with the shift of superheroes from print to film primarily by examining cultural events that affected the popularity of both medias and their respective contents, along with the work of credible scholars. To understand superheroes’ relevance to contemporary culture, it is vital that we examine the medias in which they appear."],"display_date":"January 1, 1930 - October 8, 1918","search_date":"1924-05-20","locations":[{"id":53147,"lat":42.7179089,"lng":-84.5539748,"zoom":7,"place":"East Lansing, MI, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":1539013571,"tag":null},{"id":3588,"tag":"superhero, comic, books"}],"course":{"name":"ENG 492H Honors Seminar in English","school":"Rollins College","course_id":185,"school_id":5}}]}
