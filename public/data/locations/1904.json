Sharitt, Jr., a Confederate soldier, describes the repugnant state of war that he daily faced.Because of the hopelessness of the southern cause and his desire to return home before more destruction damaged Louisiana.On October 30, 1864, while aboard a boat at Norman's Landing, Louisiana, Sharitt reveals the history of the boat.The boat had been captured by the Confederate army in the spring of 1863.Sharitt was traveling down the Red River when he saw that the pilothouse was shot full of holes, [and] the pilot was shot at the wheel during the boat's seizure.The remnants of this violent overtaking were still evident, however, as the pilot's hand left a mark when he stumbled down the stairs to his death.Sharitt learned the spot had been cleaned with water and soap, but still the print of every finger is as plain as can be.Such is war."," The boat would forever contain the evidence of a captain's gory and tragic death.Sharitt was revolted and haunted by this image of death in his mind.The brutality and the dehumanization of soldiers during wartime is a common lamentation of Sharitt.He recognized the complete horror of such an image of death and disregard for a former American neighbor."," The military campaigns along the rivers were crucial to the war's outcome.Southern rivers were places of desired domination, and as Sharitt floated down the Red River of Louisiana, he saw first-hand the battles that ensued over waterways like the Mississippi and the Red Rivers.According to Dudley W. Knox, control of navigable rivers was essential to victory, and the Red River was an important route to the Mississippi below Vicksburg, Mississippi.Knox discloses that in the spring of 1864, the Union's Red River Expedition failed miserably and Confederate army strongly held the river and many of the American Navy's boats.Although fighting on the Red River was necessary, especially after Federal forces controlled all of the Mississippi in July 1864, the war's effects shocked and disgusted Sharitt.The desperation and fever of the Civil War was evident in the Rebel soldiers' seizure of a northern boat and the multitude of gruesome murders inflicted upon Union soldiers.Sharitt felt horror and disgust thinking of his enemy's defeat; the tactics of war along waterways, however, required such inhumanity.","--J.R."],"display_date":"January 1, 1863 - October 30, 1864","search_date":"1863-11-30","locations":[{"id":5434,"lat":31.0762323333,"lng":-92.0013726393,"zoom":9,"place":"AVOYELLES, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":6723,"title":"African-American Work Songs","course_id":176,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-01-01","end_date":"12/31/47","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi all had large state penitentiaries with them, where African-American men and women resided. Many people visited these prisons to listen to and record these talented men and women singing, including the famous folklorists John Lomax, Alan Lomax, and Dr. Harry Oster. The recorded singers talked about their life experiences, including prison, and the way that music had greatly impacted them. Before they became musicians and wrote their own music, each man was involved in work songs while in prison. Work songs are pieces of music that are sung while conducting a task. The songs might be a connected narrative, description, or protest song. They are the reason that people visited prisons to record music. ","Prison work songs are a piece of evidence connecting slavery to incarceration. Once African-Americans came to the U.S. as slaves, they sang songs that reminded them of home and their cultural roots as they were in the midst of oppression. Some songs that were sung carried different meanings and messages within them and each song had its own style or rhythm to it. The most common feature of work songs is the call-and-response format where a leader would sing a verse or two and the other men and women would follow with the chorus. To keep every person motivated and in sync while working through the blistering hot or freezing cold days, they sang songs. The work songs were sung to maintain a steady work pace and to keep the beat for the song, the prisoners used their tools. For example, while chopping logs and singing, half of the men would swing their axes down into the log, while the other half of the men were on their upswing. This kept a steady momentum to make work a bit easier and keep the prisoners sane. ","As the prisoners spoke about their music, they provided information about some songs and what the songs meant. One African-American man who stuck out as he was a great singer and very well-known to the public was Huddie Leadbetter (Leadbelly). Leadbelly talked about one song in particular called \"Go Down Old Hannah.\" \"Old Hannah\" is what the prisoners called the sun throughout the south. They sang about the color of \"Old Hannah\" and the pain it brought upon them and their partners or friends working next to them. They wanted the sun to go down for it meant their work day was now over. Here is an excerpt from the song, \"Go Down Old Hannah\": \"Why don't you go down, ol' Hannah / Don't you rise no more. / If you come up in the mornin' / Bring judgement sure. / Well I look at ol' Hannah / She was turnin' red. / Well I look at my partner. / He was almost dead.\" Some work songs were known from prison to prison as they were first sung by African-Americans as slaves. Other songs were unique to the prison itself and had their own-meanings. They are beautiful, powerful and moving pieces of music that hold a great part of American history. "],"display_date":"1867 - 1947","search_date":"1907-07-02","locations":[{"id":52817,"lat":31.9685988,"lng":-99.9018131,"zoom":4,"place":"Texas"},{"id":53068,"lat":32.3546679,"lng":-89.3985283,"zoom":4,"place":"Mississippi"},{"id":53077,"lat":30.9842977,"lng":-91.9623327,"zoom":4,"place":"Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":3384,"tag":"Work Songs"},{"id":3385,"tag":"Prison Songs"}],"course":{"name":"Incarceration in the US","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":176,"school_id":94}}]}
