Segregation was still a big part in the era and blacks still were fighting for equal rights. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People formed in 1909.  The NAACP is for colored people to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination. In 1950, two men, Harry T. Moore and Walter White were big leaders in the organization and made a difference. ","Harry T. Moore was a teacher in Bevard County, Florida and in 1934 Moore became president of the NAACP in Florida. [1] Through many years of studying and teaching, Moore became aware of the loudly proclaimed principles of a democracy, and he learned to appreciate them as proper instruments for making necessary changes in society. With this in mind, when he began his campaign for racial equality, he used only democratic techniques.[2]","The NAACP wanted people to make voting fair to all people. Moore’s goals for the NAACP were: get the democratic primary open to Negro voters in every county in Florida, to encourage the masses of our people to register and vote, to make contact with the various candidates and to make recommendations to our voters on the basis of the candidate’s recommendation and attitudes.[3]  Years after Moore’s goal was to have 25,000 members part of the organization, but he only had 8,219. [4]Moore was able to allow colored people to vote in some areas in Florida but NAACP headquarters increased annual membership dues from $1 to $2. [5]In 1949 the membership went down 40 percent. By 1950, Moore’s leadership became a disaster because National officers believed that he wasn’t taking the NAACP seriously.[6] A year later Moore was removed from the board and was no longer allowed to participate in the organization. On Christmas night, members of the Ku Klux Klan killed Moore and his wife in their own home.  [7] ","When Moore was killed, Walter White was executive sectary of the NAACP paid tribute to Moore.  Walter White spent the majority of his adult years, nearly forty years; working for the NAACP indicates his staying power in the cause for racial social justice. [8]White listed among gains acquittal of four of the six men being retied in the “Trenton Six” murder case; the Federal indictments returned against seven city officials of Cicero; the abolition of segregation in publicly financed institutions of higher education in the South.[9]  Walter wanted to make sure that justice was served because he believed that Moore’s death made an impact on the NAACP.  White said, ","“ Justice and human rights in America seemed to be standing still or even moving backwards a few steps just when the world’s jitter should have hammered home the need for cleaning up our Jim Crow backyard and strengthen our democracy as never before.” [10]","Walter White has his finest hour for NAACP as an undercover investigator following the contours of lynching and race riots. [11]","Throughout the decade “Jim Crow” laws around the country, especially in the south, forbade almost all interaction between blacks and white Americans.[12] Blacks education wasn’t the same as whites. The NAACP fought in court to allow blacks attend to the same school as whites because they wanted the same education as the whites.  In 1957 the Little Rock school board initiated a plan to integrate the public schools on grade at a time, starting with the twelfth grade but the NAACP didn’t think that was fair.[13] After years of hard work and protesting, African Americans and Whites are now able to go to school together, work together, and so on. ","Overall Harry T. Moore was a big part of the NAACP even though things didn’t work out the way it should have. He was still able to make big changes in the organization. Walter White was a man of his word, and continued to fight for the NAACP rights after Moore’s death.  The civil rights movement took years for African-Americans to have their rights."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","Bibliography Reference: Primary Source"," ","            BIAS REPORT CITES BOMBING IN FLORIDA.
