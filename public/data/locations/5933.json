Cherrington was an educational pamphlet written in the early 1900’s. Dr. Cherrington questions the principles of prohibition. He was a general secretary with the World League against Alcohol; he raises questions about people who question prohibition. He doesn’t understand why the people who are against prohibition still wanted regulation in other systems. He wrote the article to point out and raise interesting questions related to the rules of alcohol. He questioned the laws concerning the age of legal alcohol consumption the amount and even questioned why it’s ok to sell it at 9:15 but not at 9:30. Dr Cherrington was clearly against alcohol and likely wrote this article because of the popularity and abuse of alcohol at that time was running high. He felt that alcohol was an important issue to address.","            Prohibition was the practice of prohibiting the transportation, sales, manufacturing, importing and exporting alcohol. In 1919 the United States passed the national prohibition act and the battle began between the “dry & wet”, meaning alcohol or no alcohol. The battle between these two groups had been going on since the 19<sup>th</sup> Century.  Alcohol played a major role and was a huge part in American history. Going back into history even the immigrants and settlers made their own liquor that included beer and wine. Even when the immigrants came to America they traveled and bought alcohol into the United States. Alcohol became a huge part in American society and contributed to the economy a great deal. Farmers were happy because they profited by making and selling alcohol from the barley they grew. It became a favorite hobby for some people and considered alcohol as a favorite pastime. Alcohol caused good and bad during the progressive era (1890-1920), it helped the economy on the good side and caused hostility on the bad side. There were many people against alcohol hence all the supporters of prohibition. Alcohol caused hostility in saloons and shops opened up crime in the black market and effected people’s health. On the other side of the coin alcohol contributed to fun times for people, a hobby to relax and let off steam from a hard days work or just meeting up with friends.  ","Christian evangelicals in 1910 were among the groups who were against alcohol. They took action in there own ways during their quest for prohibition. Because there were so many against and felt strong about the effects of alcohol they joined forces and used various types of propaganda against alcohol. There were songs, poems, pamphlets, and posters trying to prove to the public that alcohol is harmful. One of the most influential propagandas from the evangelicals was the posters because they presented a clear visual message that had gotten across the public. Even though they tried so hard to get their messages across their information did not influence the public as they thought. The public enjoyed alcohol and chose to ignore the messages. Just proves that the truth at the time wasn’t a concern to the public when it came to the physical and mental effects alcohol could cause in a person.","            People in the United States questioned and opposed prohibition in many ways. Dr. Cherrington raised good points. If you are against prohibition then why make rules such as limitations of how much alcohol can be purchased at once or how old is the right age to drink. Dr. Cherrington feels that the rules made in regards to alcohol were made without putting much thought into it. He feels that prohibition is the answer and adding laws to alcohol will not change the way alcohol is consumed"],"display_date":"1900 - 1919","search_date":"1909-12-31","locations":[{"id":52373,"lat":46.2975453728,"lng":-117.907874423,"zoom":9,"place":"Columbia, Washington"},{"id":50175,"lat":39.4276655911,"lng":-84.1668444718,"zoom":10,"place":"Warren, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":860,"tag":"Principle of Prohibition"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":5366,"title":"The Bonus Army","course_id":79,"status":"P","start_date":"7/28/32","end_date":"7/28/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Four-thirty in the afternoon on July, 28, 1932, Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., was embalmed with tear gas.  Herbert Hoover instructed General MacArthur to lead 600 troops from the 16<sup>th</sup> Brigade into the streets to diffuse the “Bonus Army” riots.  The first riot resulted in the death of one Bonus Marcher killed by police gunfire.  After catching wind of the incident, President Hoover requested the deployment of the Regular Army to cease the uproar in Washington.","            After the Great War, Congress promised in 1924 20,000 veterans a “bonus” payment for the compensations of the war.  The payments were to be deferred until 1945.  Due to the severity of the Great Depression, in 1931 the United States Congress overrode a veto granting the Great War veterans half of their promised compensation check.  As the economy continued to decline so did the patience of the veterans and half of their earned money was not enough to survive on.","The legislation made one such payment to Frank Agaria.  The United States Congress issued Adjusted Service Certificates to the Great War veterans upon their return to the States.  The certificates provided the details and regulations of the bonus check that was to be given for compensations throughout the war.  Frank Agaria, was issued the certificate on March 1, 1931.  In Mr. Agaria’s certificate, it is declared that in the event of death of the veteran, his beneficiary received his money if a beneficiary had been appointed before death.  Mr. Agaria was guaranteed $308.00 on March 1, 1931 and $1,931.00 that deferred to March 1951.  The certificate was signed by the Director of the United States Veterans Bureau. ","On December 5, 1932, proponents of further immediate payment published a poster informing Americans of the unfortunate situation the veterans of the Great War faced.  The poster described the harsh conditions the winter brought upon the “hungry veterans” and the creator of the poster suggested that there are “hundreds and thousands of us have no shelter, and there will be more of us in that fix by the time winter comes.”  The poster also encouraged the veterans to march to Washington and elect delegated Bonus Marchers.","The “Bonus Army Incident” was a very controversial issue.  The question of respect for the Bonus Marchers has been a concern, whether or not the proper procedures were followed by the Regular Army.  Though he was following the orders of his Commander-in-Chief, Major General MacArthur was criticized by the American people and after, citizens frowned upon his actions."],"display_date":"July 28, 1932","search_date":"1932-07-28","locations":[{"id":21988,"lat":46.2975453728,"lng":-117.907874423,"zoom":9,"place":"Columbia, Washington"}],"tags":[{"id":1173,"tag":"Bonus March"},{"id":1174,"tag":"Bonus Army"},{"id":1175,"tag":"General MacArthur"},{"id":1176,"tag":"Bonus Check"},{"id":1177,"tag":"WWI Veterans"}],"course":{"name":"The Great Depression","school":"Texas Wesleyan University","course_id":79,"school_id":49}}]}
