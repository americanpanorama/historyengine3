SB 1070 sought to establish an official state policy of “attrition through enforcement.”[1] The wording of the bill indicated that Arizona sought to establish an overarching carceral state in which criminality was constructed around ethnic identity. Their solution was strict enforcement by any means. Enforcement was predicated on the ability for law enforcement officers to “…without a warrant… arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to believe…[the person] has committed any public offense that makes [them] removable from the United States.”[2] Larry Dever, Sheriff of Cochise County Arizona, vocalized pleasure with SB 1070 and stated, “Well, we’ve been doing that down here [border enforcement] for 36 years.”[3] Sheriff Dever’s statement illustrates the participation of law enforcement in racial profiling long before SB 1070. ","In 2008 the Arizona District Court heard the case of Manuel de Jesus Ortega Melendres, a Mexican national on vacation in the United States, in <em>Ortega Melendres, </em><em>et al. v. Arpaio</em>.  The court found that Melendres and others had been victims of racial profiling, when the van he was traveling in, driven by a white driver, was pulled over by the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Department (MCSD). Melendres was detained for over nine hours even though provided adequate identification.[4] The case decided that the MCSD had participated in a systematic practice of racial profiling. ","A long history of anti-Hispanic sentiment has been present in the politics of the United States. In 1902, Indiana senator Albert Beveridge opposed a bill which proposed statehood for multiple Southwestern territories.[5] Beveridge’s rationale was among Hispanic Americans, “…education, moral, and other elements of citizenship are unfavorable.”[6] During the Great Depression, people of Hispanic descent were blamed for many of the economic troubles which hit the Southwest. The United States responded by enacting the Immigration Act of 1929 which made entering the United State without a visa an unlawful felony.[7] The Immigration Act insinuated that people of Hispanic descent were to be associated with a degree of criminality because of the idea of unlawful entry.","Before the controversial bill was to be enacted, the United States Supreme Court found SB 1070 unconstitutional. In the <em>Opinion of the Court</em>, Justice Kennedy cited <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza</em> which established the legal precedent that it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States. SB 1070 violated this statute and established a new precedent that police can stop someone, “…based on nothing more than possible removability” which violates the previous decision of the court.[8] In a sobering statistic, roughly half of Mexican Americans have reported some form of racial discrimination throughout their life.[9] There is an undeniable thread of institutionalized discrimination against Latino Americans which has persisted throughout the twentieth century."," "," ","[1] Russell Pearce, “Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhood Act,” Pub.

They were worried the effect frequent misinformation in the United States was having on the Bracero program, citing as an example a health official statement claiming Mexican labourers raised American rates of venereal diseases. Mr. Carreon hoped Americans would take the time to educate themselves on the program.[4]  In contrast to Mr. Carreon and Mr. Gallagos statements, the program was less beneficial to the migrant workers than it seemed."," ","In the period leading up to the 1950’s agriculture still constituted the majority of the South’s economy.[5] Family members filled only 35% of  the jobs, and with pay and conditions making it harder for employers to hire domestically there were opportunities for temporary migrant labour.[6]  This situation led to the start of an informal version of the Bracero Program in 1921, and a formalized edition in 1942.[7]  Basic life necessities were provided by the employer with the cost being deducted from the worker’s wage.[8] Their temporary status meant this labour-force had no political power and were at the employer’s mercy.[9] In the early 1950’s, President Truman created the President’s Commission on Migratory Labour. This committee’s objective was to work towards improving the experience of Mexican migrant labourers through the revision of the Bracero program.[10]  The committee recommended extending social legislative support for the workers, and even extended the idea of ending the importation of Mexican workers with the support of the Mexican government.[11]  Congress, however, ignored the recommendations and the program was instated for a further decade following the passing of Public Law 78.[12]"," "," ","[1] Morgan Monroe, “Ex-Legislator Urges Extension of U.S.-Mexican Bracero Agreement”, <em>The Arizona Republic</em> (Phoenix, Arizona), Jan. 19, 1952.","[2] Ibid.","[3] Ibid","[4] Ibid","[5] Ray N Gilmore, Gladys Gilmore, “The Bracero in California”, <em>Pacific Historical Review</em> 32 no. 3 (1963): 266","[6] Ibid: 267","[7] Ibid: 269","[8] Ibid: 267","[9] Ibid","[10] R.
