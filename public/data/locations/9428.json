One such story, about Union spy Pauline Cushman appeared in the <em>Valley Spirit </em>on June 8, 1864. Ms. Cushman was arrested by the Confederates, freed by the Northern troops and rewarded with the honorary title of Major in the United States army.","When the war began in 1861, Cushman resided in Cleveland, Ohio. She was, however, originally from New Orleans and of French and Spanish descent. She was an actress by profession and, as such, moved to Louisville, Kentucky where she continued to perform. In March of 1863, while performing at the Wood's Theatre, some paroled Confederate officers asked her to make a toast to the Confederacy. Because of her own loyalties to the North, she consulted with the local provost marshal who then asked her to become a spy for the Union. As such, she did offer the requested toast. She was then subjected to a mock arrest and dismissed from the theatre. She went to work, thereafter, at a theatre in Nashville where she was called to the headquarters of Confederate General Bragg. She first swore an oath to the Government of the United States of America and then proceeded to join the Cumberland Army.","Eventually, she had been caught by the Confederates and charged with being a Union spy in June 1864. In particular, she was questioned about her \"Yankee twang\" which she explained by the fact that she had been playing Yankee parts. She was threatened with hanging if the letters she had been found carrying proved her to be a spy. Fortunately for Miss Cushman, after being found guilty of espionage, she became quite ill and was saved, by this illness, from being hanged. It was during this illness that she was rescued by Union troops."],"display_date":"June 8, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-08","locations":[{"id":10135,"lat":41.4243718872,"lng":-81.6586944761,"zoom":9,"place":"CUYAHOGA, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":4,"school_id":3}},{"id":5129,"title":"<strong>The 1966 Hough Riots</strong>","course_id":59,"status":"P","start_date":"7/18/66","end_date":"7/24/66","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the late night hours of July 18, 1966, 26-year-old Joyce Arnett walked through Cleveland’s Hough neighborhood with two friends. As they approached E. 83<sup>rd</sup> Street, police officers ushered them into the second floor of a nearby building. The police presence had recently arrived to disperse a large crowd that had gathered on the street. Mrs. Arnett, a mother of three who lived nearby, ventured onto a balcony overlooking the street, calling for her three children. As she stepped onto the second story balcony, she was shot. After being rushed to nearby Mount Sinai Hospital, she was pronounced dead at 1:40am.","Joyce Arnett was one of four victims in what later came to be known as the Hough Riots. The riots, which lasted from July 18 to July 23, 1966, were a result of increasing racial tensions between working class African Americans and more affluent Whites in the neighborhood. African American residents were incensed at deplorable living conditions in rented apartments, exorbitant rents and food prices, and frequent incidences of police brutality at the hands of a predominantly White police force. On July 18, this tense situation quickly escalated into violence after the White owner of a bar on Hough Avenue in the neighborhood refused to serve an African American man. A large crowd, composed mainly of African Americans, soon gathered on the street, throwing rocks. Police arrived shortly thereafter and reported being shot at from snipers in the immediate area. The disorder in the neighborhood continued for several days. On July 20, Police Captain James Birmingham described the situation as being “like the part in an old western where you’re caught in the crossfire in a box canyon”. That same day, 36-year-old Percy Giles was shot on Hough Avenue, becoming the second victim of the riots. Sam Winchester and Benoris Toney were the final two victims, having both been fatally shot on subsequent days. All four of the victims were African American. The riot finally ended on July 24 following heavy rains which kept most of the neighborhood’s residents indoors.","The riot ultimately deepened the rift between African Americans and Whites in Cleveland. The all-white Cuyahoga County Grand Jury Commission fully blamed the riot on black militants, echoing the views of many Whites. Conversely, African Americans in the area claimed that the riot was the inevitable result of substandard living conditions in the predominantly African American inner city. Following the riot, almost all middle class residents left Hough, shutting down a majority of the neighborhood’s businesses. This had a devastating effect on the neighborhood, which years later had become one of the poorest in Cleveland. The riots had the effect of speeding up the process of white flight in the city, considerably deepening the rift between the poorer mainly African American inner city and richer mainly White suburbs, a division which still exists to this day."],"display_date":"July 18, 1966 - July 24, 1966","search_date":"1966-07-21","locations":[{"id":31669,"lat":41.4243718872,"lng":-81.6586944761,"zoom":9,"place":"Cuyahoga, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":825,"tag":"Riot"},{"id":826,"tag":"Cleveland"}],"course":{"name":"Intro to American History","school":"Case Western Reserve University","course_id":59,"school_id":41}},{"id":6065,"title":"Debs Found Guilty-Again","course_id":122,"status":"P","start_date":"9/12/18","end_date":"9/12/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As he exited the courtroom, “a girl pushed a bunch of flowers into [Eugene] Debs’ outstretched hands. Then she fell, half fainting, into his arms. Debs stooped down and kissed her.” This report from the New York Times portrays Debs as surrounded by a remarkable sense of bravado, a man who came to be known henceforth as “Democracies Prisoner.” On September 12, 1918 in Cleveland Ohio for the second time, Eugene V. Debs was sentenced to jail time in federal penitentiary. The first was in response to association to the Pullman Strike in 1894 where Debs was indicted under charges of conspiracy and insurrection, and received a six-month sentence for contempt of court. However, this sentencing was far more severe. Ordered by the Ohio District court, Debs was to spend ten years in prison as well as pay a fine of ten thousand dollars.","Judge Westenhaver found his anti-war speech in Canton Ohio to have violated the Espionage Act of 1917 on three accounts. “Attempting to incite insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces. Obstructing and attempting to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service, and uttering language intended to provoke, and encourage resistance to the United States and to promote the cause of the enemy.” Debs’ case was only one of over two thousand wartime cases, and he was only one of twelve hundred to go to jail for his actions. Historian Ernest Freeberg believes this case was pivotal because the government “imposed a monopoly on the meaning of American patriotism that turned a dissenter like Debs into a felon.”","Over 450 miles away, the same events were being covered by <em>The People, </em>the Socialist Labor Party of America’s newspaper that published the news from New York City under the leadership of Daniel DeLeon. De Leon, a Columbia educated man, wrote an article on the same events, but comes to a different conclusion. States De Leon, “to be in contempt of a <em>capitalist</em> court is the only attitude becoming to decent men. The court speaks the opinion not of sense or justice, but of the robber class of capitalism that it represents.” Such ardent beliefs mark a unscrupulous moment in US history according to the Socialist Party. The article was marked my open outrage, and anger towards the court starkly contrasting with the New York Times’ plain, and unemotional diction.","Debs own attorneys had thought along a similar line to DeLeon. They noted that if the Supreme Court of the United States affirmed Debs’s conviction, it would “lend credence to the proposition that the topics of war and of socialism were unmentionable during wartime. It would demonstrate that the espionage Act could be used for the purpose of “suppressing during war an exposition and exhortation toward socialism.”","When the case was heard Supreme Court just a year later, Justice Holmes cited what would become a pivotal case in the history of American jurisprudence, Shneck v. United States, another case of violation of the Espionage Act. He claimed that both men had “[brought] about substantive evils which Congress has the right to protect.”  And although Justice Holmes dropped two of Debs’s charges, his prison sentence was not. Debs remained in prison till after Wilson’s presidency when President Harding, against whom Debs had run for president from his Atlanta prison cell, commuted his sentence in the year 1922. Socialist historian Howard Zinn famously posited that “dissent is the highest form of patriotism.” He never noted, however, it is without its own woes."," "],"display_date":"September 12, 1918","search_date":"1918-09-12","locations":[{"id":16839,"lat":41.4243718872,"lng":-81.6586944761,"zoom":9,"place":"Cuyahoga, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":2188,"tag":"Socialism"},{"id":2187,"tag":"Eugene Debs"},{"id":746,"tag":"Supreme Court"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6321,"title":"Super-boy and The Cold War","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/49","end_date":"12/31/49","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["From arguably the most famous superhero known to man, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created a character that presented the origins of Superman and how he became the symbol for justice. This character exemplified all the troubles of teenage awkwardness and solitude while trying to establish justice . Super-boy’s character is defined as the teenage version of Superman who grew up in the small town known as Smallville. Super-boy’s era is the learning process that Superman goes through to become a well responsible hero. In a letter that Jerry Siegel wrote to Russell Keaton,the artist for Buck Rodgers, Siegel describes his life as “he will find that his great strength, instead of making friends for him, cause people to fear him. Mothers will not permit their children to associate with him, he will be hated in school sports because he never loses”<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup>. Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster’s main focus with creating Super-boy was to exaggerate his loneliness in society to explain the strong willed character he becomes as Superman.","During the Golden Age when Super-boy was created, the world had entered the Cold War. The Cold War is a period in time where super powered countries such as the United States and USSR would flaunt there strengths towards each other to see who had dominance. Jerry Siegel uses Super-boy as a symbol for the United States, a country who “had phenomenal power, but there was inexperience in the new role it found itself in.”<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup> Super-boy defines how he felt as a “teenager who insisted on being called Superman, not because of his maturity, but because he felt he deserved respect by virtue of the situation he found himself in.”<sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup> giving a direct correlation to what the United States tried to achieve during the cold war. Super-boy is also related to children readers to be placed in the realism of the Cold War as the comic book “gave children an early lesson in the exasperation of waging the Cold War.”[4]  Siegel and Shuster wanted to create this image in Super-boy to have readers understand what was the United States role in the cold war.","Smallville, the city in which Super-boy resides, is a small town. Siegel and  Shuster place Super-boy in this town to exemplify Super-boy’s loneliness in the world. Overall, Smallville is also symbolized to the United States because of it’s little development and loneliness before the cold war. As Super-boy transforms to Superman and he moves from Smallville to an urban city like Metropolis shows the development the United States went from before to after the cold war. Lincoln Geraghty states “We can see vestiges of this version of American masculinity in the setting of Smallville, small-town America writ large”<sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup> showing the development of the United States from an individual country to a superpower, but still trying to show America to try to celebrate small town values.","Siegel and Shuster exemplify the United States as a whole during the late 1940’s through the 1950’s through Super-boy and Smallville. As readers see the development of Superman’s origins through Super-boy, society sees the overall development of the United States during the cold war."," ","<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> Jerome Siegel to Mr.Keaton, June 12, 1934, in <em>SuperMan: The Man of Tomorrow</em>, http://www.lettersofnote.com/search?q=+Jerry+Siegel","<sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup> Joseph J.

In the 1930’s there were questionnaires sent out to people in the United States, specifically in Ohio, that contained questions that twins would fill out regarding themselves in many subjects. It questioned the twin’s physical features such as their health and if it differentiated between each twin or how much they differed in height. It also asked the twins to observe the palms of their hands to see if they were different or not. These packets of questions helped the scientist compare the two people and make important observations that could in fact prove eugenics to be a misguided movement.","Eugenics or the science of improving a human population by controlled breading to increase desired heritable traits and characteristics. Francis Galton had the high-minded idea that twins would be exemplary for the study of eugenics, he wanted to see if behavioral traits were determined by genes and using twins was the most accurate way. He didn’t take his idea to the next level, however, he certainly encouraged others and in turn disbursed evidence for the downfall of eugenics.","Eugenics continued to decline due to the studies regarding twins. Favoring the notion that the environment to which you grew up in is the main influence on your heredity, Horatio Newman, Frank Freeman, and Karl Holzinger researched twins in the 1930’s. They uncovered that twins that grew up apart were not identical behaviorally or personality wise, but were one hundred percent in correspondence in areas such as blood groups and appearance. The three men’s findings also showed that there was a fifteen-point difference between the twins IQ, thus proving intelligence is based upon upbringing, not based on the genes your parents pass down to you. Revealing that controlled breading isn’t the answer to a better society.","Those few men started a trend that continued into the 1950’s. Twins were studied and studied and inevitably showed that eugenics wasn’t all it was made out to be which wasn’t necessarily the goal of studying eugenics in twins, but it ended that way. Galton was one incredibly intelligent man to think of using twins who are the same physically and study how different or the same they were growing up apart or together. Thus throughout the years we can see that twins were the key to eugenics."],"display_date":"1920 - 1950","search_date":"1935-07-02","locations":[{"id":53008,"lat":41.49932,"lng":-81.6943605,"zoom":6,"place":"United States, Cleveland, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":3222,"tag":"Twins"},{"id":533,"tag":"Eugenics"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":165,"school_id":94}},{"id":6759,"title":"Emily Blackwell becomes the third woman to earn a medical degree in the United States!","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-01","end_date":"1893-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Inspired by her older sister, Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell (the first woman to earn a medical degree in the United States), Dr. Emily Blackwell studied medicine. Like her sister, she did not have an easy journey. Dr. Blackwell’s sister warned her from the beginning, “a blank wall of social and professional antagonism faces the woman physician that forms a situation of painful loneliness, leaving her without support, respect or professional counsel.” She was rejected from eleven medical schools, due to complaints from male students, but continued to carry on.","            Medicine at this time, in 1854, was going through a transition. The onset of industrialization brought about important alterations in the organization of work and family life, which created a change to the role of women, and made more middle-class women comfortable with studying medicine. Before this time, there was a specific role for women that limited them, they were to stay at home and care for the house and children. The advances in medical science have begun to call traditional therapeutics into question, and older concepts of professionalism are being challenged. Women brought another element to medicine, humanity.","            Emily saved money for her education through her salary as a teacher, and persisted on for the cause of women in medicine, and for this she was willing to struggle. Prior, Dr. Emily Blackwell was studying, and teaching, music. “I soon felt the want of a more engrossing pursuit than the study of music, German, and metaphysics. The suggestion of studying medicine was first presented to me by a lady friend who was ill and said to me, “if I could be treated by a lady doctor, my worst suffering would have been spared me.” Dr. Blackwell went on to write to physicians she knew through her family, and in various parts in the country, about the possibilities of a woman becoming a physician. Most of her responses concluded with, “the idea is a great one, but also impossible.” Using this as inspiration, she started her journey. After spending a year at Rush Medical College her studies ended, the college bowed to pressure from the state medical society and rescinded her admission. 1852, she spent the summer in New York, gaining practical experience at her sister’s side among poor immigrant women. She went on to attend Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where she became the second woman to earn a medical degree after graduating in 1854. At the time of her graduation there were 1,206 students, with her being the only woman.","In 1857 the Blackwell sisters and established the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children. By 1874 the infirmary served over 7,000 patients annually. In 1868, the Blackwell sisters established the Women's Medical College in New York City. Emily became professor of obstetrics and, in 1869, became dean of the college. In 1876 it became a three-year institution, and in 1893 it became a four-year college, ahead of much of the profession. By 1899 the college had trained 364 women doctors. Dr. Emily Blackwell’s determination to not give up on pursuing a profession in medicine inspired many women to follow in her footsteps. She played a large part in helping other women in the same journey.

The strategically titled article “Life-Saving Aerial Spray Missions in Vietnam” appeared in the March 1969 issue and provided the audience with broad understanding of how defoliation missions took place. More than that, the tone, title and content of the piece explained and endorsed the necessity of such missions. In favor of herbicide and defoliant use, the article relied upon education to inform those reading the article of how vital the use of defoliants can be to American lives as “Their task: aerial defoliation at various strategic areas to help save the lives of their fighting compatriots.”","            Misunderstood and misjudged at the time, the use of defoliants in the Vietnam war, through Operation Ranch Hand, unleashed unintended environmental and health effects on those in targeted areas. Ultimately, the U.S. used eleven million gallons of defoliants leading to unimaginable destruction. The defoliants remained hidden in the soils, water systems, and fats of humans and animals following exposure and as a result, defoliants affected areas such as rice fields and rubber plantations that had not been intended targets. With dioxin levels at estimated concentrations of 1000 mg/kg in highly exposed areas, some zones in Vietnam are still considered harmful to humans. One study, published in 1998, that surveyed areas adjacent to the former A So airbase in Central Vietnam suggested that fish still contained concentrations of dioxins that would be harmful to humans if consumed. This further raises the question of whether defoliant use was necessary.","The monthly magazine held a distinguished position as the foremost provider of valuable herbicidal and agricultural information covering developments in farming techniques. With such a title came the responsibility of producing pertinent and informative articles each month. Through their report on the use of defoliants in Vietnam, <em>Weeds Trees and Turf</em> suggested to their audience of dealers and manufacturers of herbicides, along with farmers and landscapers that the topics they cover are cutting-edge and significant at that time throughout the world.","As with many new technologies, the use of defoliants in Vietnam came with an initial lack of knowledge and understanding of its long-term consequences. This use led to the significant destruction of native Vietnamese vegetation, along with severely affecting human health through cancer and birth defects, prompting an international questioning of its use and accusations of violating the 1925 Geneva Protocol. However, the article provides an example of defoliants viewed as an asset because it was critical to saving the lives of American soldiers."],"display_date":"March 1969","search_date":"1969-03-16","locations":[{"id":53121,"lat":41.49932,"lng":-81.6943605,"zoom":8,"place":"Cleveland, Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":292,"tag":"Vietnam"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":3512,"tag":"Defoliants"},{"id":3513,"tag":"Agent Orange"},{"id":3514,"tag":"Operation Ranch Hand"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":178,"school_id":3}}]}
