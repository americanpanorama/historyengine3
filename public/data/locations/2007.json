Bundy, a northern soldier, witnessed human cruelty and the outrageous poverty encompassing much of the South. Bundy and his Union comrades were invited to ride up the Red River to Shreveport on the Confederate flag-of-truce boat before a conference with southern officers about terms of surrender. Flying towards this vital meeting, the steamer ship needed more fuel, and deck hands began tactlessly tearing down fences along the banks of the river. Suddenly, a poor, woebegone, wretched looking old man came rushing down with his children...all crying together, imploring that the northern steamboat spare his fence. This poor white man complained that his crops just began growing, but he was too poor and weak to fix the fence, whose destruction meant starvation for himself and his family."," Both Bundy and a Confederate officer felt sympathy for this man, saying so to the men stealing the wood. The Confederate officer explained the problematic nature of this situation, professing, Our people only know one part of making war. They known how to fight, and that's all. The southern men have no business faculty. Although this officer requested supplies many times, his soldiers were naked and starving in their own homeland, the South. Bundy and the Rebel officer agreed upon the injustice of taking from an impoverished family. The two men were alarmed at the desperate state of affairs in these closing days of war."," Before the Civil War began, the poor white southerner felt the hardships of the plantation economy as a yeoman farmer or a tenant farmer. Expectedly, his situation worsened during the years of economic decline of in a nation at war, as John B. Boles describes. The extreme poverty suffered by a large portion of southerners during the Civil War was horrifying to this northern man. He and his enemy, a Confederate officer, shared the same opinion on the poor white southerner's situation: it was unfair for a quartermaster to destroy a family to attain a few pieces of wood. According to Boles, towards the end of the war, however, conditions worsened for soldiers and civilians alike, as the economy continued to deteriorate through a lack of Confederate economic policy. Boles illuminates families' struggles with starvation, and conquering Union troops, embittered too by the continuing war, made fewer exemptions for civilians, feeling less guilt at taking fence rails and other amenities. Bundy and his comrades were en route to finalize surrender by the Louisiana armies and still civilians suffered at the hand of apathetic officials. Bundy, unable to forget the unfortunate fate of this family, witnessed a typical tragedy throughout the poverty-stricken South, a family unable to sustain itself and apathy of exhausted officials. He, like many other soldiers from both the North and South, was glad to see the end to war propelling his fellow soldiers to act so callously towards one another."],"display_date":1865,"search_date":"1865-07-02","locations":[{"id":5451,"lat":32.5546520114,"lng":-93.8589115796,"zoom":9,"place":"CADDO, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3280,"title":"African American Lynched During Prison Transfer\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-05-08","end_date":"1883-05-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On May 8, 1883, a Texan was arrested at the ferry landing in Shreveport, Louisiana for the murder of William H. Lyon. The Texan's name was D.C. Hutchins, and he was an African American. The paper described Hutchins as a desperado and noted that he had been a terror to the decent citizens of Bossier parish, La. The citizens of Bossier parish were indignant at the crime. The paper also noted with no surprise that they created a plan to capture Hutchins when he was being transferred between prisons at Shreveport and Bellevue in order to perform their own justice with the criminal. The transfer was to take place on May 12 through 13 and the group that conducted the prison transfer consisted of two deputy sheriffs and a group of 12 citizens including the Chief of Police, E.M. Austin. Hutchins rode in a wagon with one of the citizens, Chas. A. Dewing. Everyone except Hutchins was armed. The group met 75-100 masked men about four miles from town. When Hutchins saw them he tried to get Dewing's pistol, but Dewing kept it from him as Austin, the Chief of Police, put himself in between the wagon and the crowd. Austin attempted to get the crowd to lower their guns, while Hutchins begged the crowd to shoot him. The crowd refused both Austin's and Hutchins' requests, and yelled back their intention to hang Hutchins. With this threat Hutchins pulled a four-inch blade from his pocket and began to stab himself to try and save himself from hanging. Austin and Dewing got the knife away from Hutchins and the crowd took Hutchins, who had begun to lose large quantities of blood, away from the wagon and to a nearby tree. The crowd hung Hutchins from the tree, even though he was already dying from his self-inflicted wounds.","The most telling part of this episode is the opening line of the article: The lynching of D.C. Hutchins...was accompanied with more than the usual dramatic surroundings of such events. This article, which was published in a national newspaper, used the word usual to describe the death of an African American without trial. Lynchings became increasingly popular in the cotton uplands, and especially in rural places such as Bossier Parish. Counties or parishes with few towns, low rural population density, and poor law enforcement had high rates of lynching, especially as the African American population increased. The lynching of African Americans reached its highest point when new African Americans came to the uplands and were strangers to the community. Men like Hutchins had no one within the community to support them, allowing reputations as desperados to spring up. These reputations were also due to the white belief that African American crime was out of control and a serious threat. The paper describes Hutchins as a villain, while portraying the lynching mob as the decent citizens of Bossier parish. This description in a national paper cements the severe racism that grew in this era."],"display_date":"May 8, 1883 - May 13, 1883","search_date":"1883-05-10","locations":[{"id":5453,"lat":32.5800672889,"lng":-93.88223782,"zoom":9,"place":"CADDO, Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}]}
