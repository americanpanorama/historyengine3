The judge confirmed that in no way could the defendant be considered innocent and sentenced him to be publicly hanged on December 2, 1859.  When this sentence was pronounced, Mr. Brown received [it] with composure.  The only demonstration was made by the clapping of hands of one man in the crowd, who is not a resident of Jefferson County.  This was promptly suppressed, and much regret is expressed by the citizens at its occurrence' (95).  Despite the Southern outrage at Brown's actions, the people of Virginia realized the gravity of the events surrounding Harper's Ferry.

He had discovered the most valuable medicine ever offered to the public (Farmer's Repository), a veritable cure all. Luckily, he was nice enough to share. The local Apothecary's Shop in Charlestown advertised that it would sell the phenomenal set of Doctor Robertson's Family Medicines. One cure was proved by thousands who have experienced its beneficial effects while another was confidently recommended as the most efficacious medicine for the speedy relief and cure of all nervous complaints. They were truly panaceas. The medical professional also offered the public antidotes for fevers and itches as well as infallible worm destroying lozenges. Clients must also have cared about the appearance of their teeth because Doctor Robertson made sure to include toothache drops and a remedy for improving the teeth and gums."," On the small chance that a woman's ailments were not covered by the above medicines, the good doctor offered a solution for all diseases peculiar to the female sex. Doctor Robertson's Vegetable Nervous Cordial, or Nature's Grand Restorative was the ticket out of depression, illness, faintness or any other disease associated with nerves. Such quack medicine gained popularity because there were few good options for southerners. According to John Duffy, Although tremendous strides had been taken in the realm of the basic sciences by the early nineteenth century, the practice of medicine had not kept abreast of the new discoveries. People were hungry for cures for everything from the common cold to the miserable contagious diseases that plagued society, but there was little help to be found."," Southerners also turned to folk medicines as orthodox practices became increasingly extreme. Duffy writes thatThroughout most of the period the average practitioner was prone to excessively bleeding, purging, blistering, and the administration of relatively large quantities of dangerous drugs. There was a great chance that doctors would harm patients more than help them. Faced with such horrific treatment options and unqualified medical help, it is no wonder that a large percentage of the population in the South looked to herbal medicines and folk panaceas."],"display_date":"August 20, 1817","search_date":"1817-08-20","locations":[{"id":14650,"lat":38.3861984314,"lng":-81.3578369854,"zoom":8,"place":"KANAWHA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3666,"title":"The Virginia Census of 1850\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"1850-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The composition and make-up of Virginia was complicated and had changed since the last census, so the editors of the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em>, Norman Miller and George A. Porterfield, published the 1850 census of Virginia in March 1851. It showed the free white, free colored, slave, and total population in each county of the Commonwealth Virginia. As the census broke down the Virginia population into the Trans-Alleghany, Valley, Piedmont, and Tidewater regions, the people of western Virginia who read the <em>Martinsburg Gazette</em> rejoiced in their growth.","One thing is clear for the region: whites always outnumbered the combined number of free blacks and slaves. Other than that, the Appalachian region was varied in its proportions. Kanawha County had the largest slave population (3,140) in the region with black people, including free and slave, making up 22 percent of its population, while whites made up 78 percent. This was a county with one of the largest disparities between free and enslaved. Pulaski was 71 percent white with 29 percent black. Likewise, Greenbrier, Washington, Montgomery, and Wythe had large black proportions with 15 percent to 20 percent black. In contrast, Barbour County's free black population (214) outnumbered its slave population (113), and the county had a substantial number of whites (8,682), having 96 percent white population. Scott, Wood, Lee, and Brooke Counties also shared a large white population ranging from 92 percent to 97 percent. Most common, however, were counties where the free black population stayed in the low double-digits, while the slave population was substantial, such as in Pulaski county, where there were 3,612 whites, 32 free blacks, and 1,470 slaves. In counties like Pulaski, the large proportion of slaves showed interesting developments in the social climate.","The white population in the mountain region was the highest in the state, surpassing the tidewater, piedmont, and valley regions with 331,568 total whites. The proportion of whites in the Trans-Alleghany region was 92 percent, which contrasts sharply with the proportion of total whites in the entire state, which was 63 percent. Meanwhile, the black population in the Trans-Alleghany region for both the free black population and the slave population was the lowest compared to other areas in Virginia, being 2,482 and 24,436, respectively. ","Slavery had already been prevalent in the Appalachian South, but in 1820, there were large slave concentrations in Kanawha and Greenbrier counties in western Virginia. Over the following 30 years, as these slave communities grew, other places in Appalachia remained void of slavery, such as Jackson County, Kentucky. There was no denying slavery's impact on Appalachia. There were regular slave markets including one in Bristol, Virginia, where slaves could be sold down river if necessary. At the same time that slavery was expanding, antislavery followers moved into Appalachia. In 1827, 106 of the 130 antislavery societies in the nation were located in the South, with a heavy concentration in the Appalachian Mountains. What the Census of 1850 showed was that Appalachia was made up of varied counties. Appalachia had counties where there was a large number of slaves and free blacks, and at the same time, it had counties where there was virtually no black population. Regardless of individual county analysis, Appalachia on the general scale was white. The white population seemed to be concentrated in the Trans-Alleghany Valley, as the white population for that region was 92 percent while the proportion of whites throughout the whole state was 63 percent. Since the Trans-Alleghany Valley contained only 25 percent of the total population in Virginia, it seemed like white Virginians concentrated in Appalachia. This could possibly have been due to the antislavery movement, although it is more likely that the movement was for pursuing land and religious culture in Appalachia."],"display_date":1850,"search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":14654,"lat":38.3892987778,"lng":-81.5023034378,"zoom":8,"place":"KANAWHA, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3887,"title":"Coal in West Virginia and the Industrial Revolution of the South\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-01-01","end_date":"1893-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["    Will Anderson had a lot of trouble on his hands.  Anderson, a prominent creditor in central Virginia, found himself in the midst of a particularly difficult legal battle involving the sale and distribution of coal-rich lands in West Virginia.  The lands in question were the John Lykens and Crescent tracts.  Apparently, two men, James G. Paxton and J.R. Jordan, owned some of the land and allotted it to certain family members after they died.  However, the Kanawha-Gauley Coal and Coke Company did not know this when they decided to invest in some of the land because it contained \"very fine...coal\" and \"a fine seem of black-band ore.\"  Unfortunately for the company, some of their land overlapped with the land that Paxton and Jordan allocated out in their wills to their respective relatives.  The beneficiaries of Paxton's and Jordan's wills and the coal company all bombarded Anderson with letters asking him for a quick and fair end to the trial.  He knew that it would be impossible to satisfy everyone.  After all, there were just too many parties of interest and not enough land.  Anderson was especially worried about the backlash from the coal company if they did not get their desired share of the land.  One letter in particular contained threat upon threat.  Anderson knew that the coal company would not back down until they obtained their land.  Why could they not find other land in West Virginia?  What was so special about these tracts? ","    Around the 1880s, coal became popular in West Virginia.  It would develop into the key export in the early 1890s for three reasons.  One was the introduction and expansion of railroads, most notably the Chesapeake and Ohio railways.  The second reason was the change in preference for southern coal over northern coal, as southern coal was of higher quality than northern coal.  Thus, northern industries started to request southern coal to power their northern factories.  Lastly, when the depression of the 1890s lifted, coal output skyrocketed as larger coal companies infiltrated the area and started new enterprises.  Along with the increase in profits came the increase in population.  In McDowell County, which held the state's richest coal mines, the population rose by 600 percent from 1880-1900.  West   Virginia's prosperous coal mines lured workers and their families, as well as single white men and a large number of free black men who wanted to create a better life for themselves after emancipation.  As the mines drew in more people, production continued to escalate, demand grew, and coal became the catalyst for the economic boom in West Virginia of the late 1800s.  ","    On a larger scale, West Virginia developed into a leader of the industrial revolution that took over the South beginning in 1880.  As agricultural production stopped making large profits, the South realized it needed to revamp its economy if it wanted to compete with the North.  Slowly but surely, industry grew in the South.  Lumber and steel mills started to spring up.  Planters began abandoning their cotton fields in exchange for a position in the numerous and flourishing textile mills scattered throughout the South.  Slowly, the cities of the South started to resemble some of their urban counterparts of the North.  These industries, with coal acting as one of the leaders, destroyed the notion that the South was just one big plantation and successfully transformed the economy into one that could effectively challenge the North domestically and internationally.

The bill he discussed (H.R. 3022) determined appropriations for improvements to the Kanawha River and its tributaries, the Elk River and the New River, the Big Sandy River, and the Monongahela River.  He believed that such improvements would allow the state to capitalize on its natural resources, which had previously been isolated from market contact due in part to inadequate transportation facilities.  ","Though the wealth that existed in West Virginia's fertile lands was publicly known, no significant effort was made to \"realize its commercial value.\"  With the growth of settlement in the antebellum years, transportation along roads and waterways became a critical concern for isolated western Virginians.  Rivers and streams, however, proved difficult to navigate due to low water levels in summer, ice in winter, and year-round flooding.  Nevertheless, inland routes such as the Ohio River carried more coal than any other product.  ","Out of the many coal-producing states, western Virginia was one of two that was in a position to take advantage of markets both along the coast and along the interior.  Yet, because it had not developed channels for the distribution of coal by neither canal nor railroad, West Virginia's Kanawha coal fields had outlet only through the Kanawha River.  The Kanawha Company attempted to keep the river clear of rocks and snags, yet it had not made the improvements necessary to permit uninterrupted shipments of coal to the Ohio River.","Faulkner recognized the statements of Mr. Bell, president of the Iron and Steel Institute, the London Daily Advertiser and the British Quarterly, which spoke of the decline of British iron and coal empires.  He noted their claims that the United States would become the only nation that could supply the world's demand for coal and iron.  Faulkner illuminated his belief that West Virginia could satisfy these growing international demands.  He stated, \"doubtless there are many sections of the Union from which large contributions can be made; but where upon this continent is the coal and iron region to be found that can justly compare with West Virginia?  Where is the state or country that in the variety, richness, and manufacturing quality of its coal can rival those wonderful deposits, which are comprehended in our sixteen thousand square miles of exhaustless wealth?\"  ","  Though West Virginia had never before been a dominant supplier of coal, the improvements that Faulkner eagerly supported would finally allow the coal industry in the Kanawha region to become a chief factor in the state's economy.  Only then could the West Virginia coal industry claim its share of competition in the nation's coal market.  As Faulkner asserted, \"for heavy articles like iron and coal no mode of transportation can compare in cheapness to that of water, and when, under the benign auspices  of this Government, our rivers shall be cleared of their obstructions and made capable of floating upon their surface our rich products to market, we shall bid defiance to competition and feel that we are prepared \"to stand up against a world in arms.\"  "],"display_date":"April 10, 1876","search_date":"1876-04-10","locations":[{"id":14656,"lat":38.3365622006,"lng":-81.528129492,"zoom":9,"place":"KANAWHA, West Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":5404,"title":"Study Shows Rates of Syphilis Higher for Poor Individuals","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"10/11/37","end_date":"10/11/37","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Charleston Gazette reported that poor individuals have higher instances of acquiring syphilis.
