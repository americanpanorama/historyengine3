Embury on December 10, 1831. Embury spoke at the anniversary ceremony for the Brooklyn Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies. She pointed out that although schooling was becoming more prevalent across the country, female education and its reputation was still lagging behind the education that males were receiving. Embury emphasized that intellectual women were \"enough to convince any unprejudiced mind that heaven has conferred upon woman, no less than upon man, the gifts of talent and genius.\" She proclaimed that men and women were equally capable and that increasing the education of women was of utmost importance. Embury declared, \"A good education includes the culture of the heart as well as the mind.\" Individuals should be well-rounded, capable, intelligent citizens. Therefore, early childhood education was extremely important. Since mothers generally did most of the nurturing, Embury said, the education of women was extremely beneficial for society. ","Embury was not the only person to promote education for women in the United States. Female seminaries began to develop between 1820 and 1850. By 1850, there were 6,085 academies and seminaries in America. A large percentage of these were co-educational or open exclusively to women. Schools continued to open and expand their curriculums. Many educational reformers believed that such schools would not only provide women with a large knowledge base, but also \"prepared [them] for their important duties as virtuous wives.\" They felt that women would be better prepared to nurture their children and \"uplift the moral character of their sons and husbands\" if they were well-educated. Embury's speech outlined the benefits of the education of women, informing her readers of its necessity and pointing out that even \"the character of our illustrious [George] Washington was formed by his mother.\" "],"display_date":"December 10, 1831","search_date":"1831-12-10","locations":[{"id":8867,"lat":40.6450686304,"lng":-73.9495584018,"zoom":11,"place":"KINGS, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":6,"school_id":2}},{"id":4148,"title":"Recognizing the Importance of Female Education\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-12-10","end_date":"1831-12-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"Let me not be misunderstood, when I thus earnestly insist upon the necessity of female education,\" insisted Emma C. Embury, a strong advocate for female education who spoke at the Anniversary of the Brooklyn Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies in December 1831. The idea of women's education was being discussed far more in the 1830's than it ever had been before. Embury was just one of many advocates for the education of females. Embury argued that a proper education would finally help women gain the recognition that they felt they were worthy of receiving. ","With the growing interest in female education, many of those advocating for it were apprehensive of how the men would respond. For years women were not treated with the same equality as men; they were seen as the weaker sex thus female education was not seen as a necessity. Editor Sarah Josepha Hale voiced her belief that the only reason the intelligence of men seemed superior to that of women was because women were only involved in duties as a housewife, and men had more chances to acquire greater knowledge. Slowly, after much debate, the views on the education of females began to shift. Eventually a women's education was seen as being necessary in order for them to properly carry out their obligations as both a mother and wife. They believed that if a woman did not obtain appropriate knowledge, how could she impart proper wisdom upon her children? The years following the speech made by Emma Embury were a huge transition for female education, \"in fact, more than a few clergy and educators had come to argue that the education of women was actually more important than the education of men.\""],"display_date":"December 10, 1831","search_date":"1831-12-10","locations":[{"id":8867,"lat":40.6450686304,"lng":-73.9495584018,"zoom":11,"place":"KINGS, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":6,"school_id":2}},{"id":4450,"title":"Bayard Rustin and Israeli Air Support\n","course_id":19,"status":"P","start_date":"6/28/70","end_date":"6/28/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1970 Bayard Rustin gathered many civil rights leaders and black public officials in support of an appeal to Washington. This appeal pushed for the U.S. government to supply Israel with fighter jets for protective purposes.  Their appeal, in the form of a full-page ad in the <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">New York Times</em>, was sponsored by the A. Philip Randolph Institute of which Rustin was the executive director.  This action signaled a significant change in Bayard Rustin's ideology as Rustin advocated nonviolence throughout the civil rights movement, and the shift furthermore upset many of his former colleagues from the War Resister's League.  The correspondence resulting from Rustin's action display not only his legendary status, but also many of the complex issues wrapped up in the conflict.  ","            Andrew McReynolds, who was the co-editor of the WRL magazine along with Rustin, wrote a letter expressing his deep disappointment.  In his letter he calls Rustin, \"the hero image of [his] life,\" and speaks of the path (of pacifism) that Rustin set before him and has now diverged from.<a name=\"_ftnref1\" href=\"_ftn1\">[1]</a>  To McReynolds, Bayard's transition from protest to politics seemed to diverge from the fundamental ideas that forged the civil rights movement.  In a more vitriolic letter, another WRL member, James Peck expresses similar sentiments.  Calling Rustin the, \"housenigger of the Democratic Party\", he reproaches Rustin for his ad in the <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">New York Times</em>, as well as reproaching him for entering into politics rather than filling the vacuum of leadership the War Resister's League was facing (as the executive director, A.J. Muste, recently passed away).  Regardless of the criticism, both these letters speak for the tremendous leader Rustin was and the loss that the peace movement was feeling at the time.  Rustin's terse response to his critics reveals little into his thoughts as he refuses a discussion.  He refused discussion deeming it unfruitful as long as his critics continued to use such derogatory language.  McReynolds wrote another letter to Rustin essentially reiterating his thoughts, except imploring his belief that Rustin still was, \"personally and existentially a pacifist.\"<a name=\"_ftnref2\" href=\"_ftn2\">[2]</a>  In this letter the question of Rustin's pacifism is much more prevalent, and displays the thin line that Rustin walked as a result of his struggle against injustice conflicting with a pacifist agenda.    ","            Bayard Rustin's dramatic change in ideology occurred less abruptly than this dialogue would suggest, with Rustin beginning to move towards politics in 1965 as summed up in his article, \"From Protest to Politics: The Future of the Civil Rights Movement\".  Nevertheless, his support of defense for Israel in 1970 not only represents a change in his ideology, but is indicative of the larger changes which conclude the classical conception of the civil rights movement.","<a name=\"_ftn1\" href=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Bayard Rustin. <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">The Bayard Rustin Papers. </em>(Bethesda, MD: University Publications of America, 1988), Reel 14.

Hine's work often demonstrated the dignity of the worker, but reflected the purposes of those who hired him. Hines was surrounded by and influenced by the vibrant reform movement and worked closely with Felix Adler, head of the National Child Labor Committee for which his photo entitled 'Home Work' was taken. It was believed by these Progressives that poverty might be eliminated by publicizing the plight of the poor. The ills of tenement life, the exploitation of child labor, and the practice of homework as evident in the photo by Hine became three issues Progressives toiled to change in urban environments like the Lower East Side of New York.","In most tenements, there was only one room that had access to outside air, leaving the interior rooms dark and unventilated. Overcrowding, neglect on the part of the owners, and violation of the simplest rules of sanitation by the tenants, together with the design of the building, created serious hygienic problems. These living quarters usually had no more than two rooms. One room typically served as a kitchen and living space, and the other as a bedroom. Families often set up one of these rooms as a sweatshop as well and together the family would spend long hours rolling cigars, making artificial flowers, or most commonly sewing clothes.","The industry of producing ready-made clothing increased greatly at the turn of the twentieth century and coincided nicely with the influx of immigrant laborers. This particular industry was organized as a contract system where cloth was purchased by the contractor from the textile manufacturer. The fabric was then cut and finished by hired garment workers who completed the work in their apartments. The practice of home work became a serious issue because it often meant the use of child labor, exploitation of workers outside of the factory setting, and the development of goods under unsanitary conditions. In response to public concern about industrial homework, some states, including New York, tried to regulate tenement homework. These regulations aimed to protect the consumers from health problems associated with purchasing goods produced under unsanitary conditions. This was done by prohibiting the manufacture of certain articles in dwelling places and that these tenements meet certain sanitary and health provisions. It would still take several years and further efforts by Progressives to have regulations of homework put in place to benefit the lives and rights of the families performing the housework.","Despite these initial regulations, tenement manufacture was still being done under unhealthy conditions for low wages, long hours, and through the continued exploitation of child labor. Although several compulsory education and child labor laws were passed in New York at the end of the nineteenth century, these laws were difficult to enforce. The Compulsory Education Law of 1874 had tried to require all children between eight and fourteen to attend school for fourteen weeks a year, but one survey of 371 home workers from 110 families found that nearly half of those workers were under the age of sixteen. Further attempts to strengthen the regulations on home work came in 1913 with licensing provisions which meant that employers were required to obtain special permits before they could give out material to employees for tenement manufacture. The Child Labor Law was also extended to cover this type of manufacturing. These stronger policies did not alleviate the problems with home labor, however; an investigation conducted ten years later found that practically nothing had changed. It was not until the 1930s when laws were passed at the federal and state level to prohibit homework."],"display_date":1910,"search_date":"1910-07-02","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":65,"tag":"Child Labor"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4473,"title":"Triangle Factory Fire","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"3/25/11","end_date":"3/25/11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The immigrant women working in Triangle Shirtwaist Factory called it a \"prison.\" Its safety and working conditions were abysmally low, but these conditions were not unique: New York was an epicenter for industrialization, containing thousands of unsafe factories filled with recent immigrants. In 1909, many factory workers organized a strike to protest unsafe conditions, and most factories met their demands, but among the resisters were the owners of The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.  On March 25, 1911, as the 600 workers of the factory, the majority of whom were Jewish and Irish immigrant women, were preparing to leave, a fire broke out in the factory.  In no more than half an hour 146 workers were dead, either burning or jumping to their deaths.  This accident was one of many that occurred that year, but it became much bigger than a tragedy for a few blocks of immigrants from the Lower East Side.","The fire was especially memorable because it was witnessed by so many people and because so many groups used the memory of these women to call for political and social reform. Those defending the factory owners presented the women as whorish and impressionable, but those in the middle class using the event to call for protective legislation presented the women as helpless victims. The working class challenged both these views, calling for more power for oppressed but competent workers.  One of the groups who most effectively propagated the memory of these women was the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. An article in the Ladies Garment Worker published shortly after the fire reflected the sense of outrage common among working class women after the fire, blaming the owners for the incident. Acting on these emotions, ILGWU made funeral arrangements for the unidentified women.  The purpose of the ceremony and protest was twofold: to honor the dead and protest the injustice done to them.  By honoring these women, the ILGWU was creating one of the greatest displays of class solidarity New York had ever experienced.","The main voices behind the protests following the fire were those of members of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. To the ILGWU the women who were killed during the fire were representations both of the injustice many unskilled workers faced in factories and the powerlessness of workers: these women were killed by the apathy of owners who were more concerned about profit than safety. Leaders like Rose Schneiderman used the images of competent but oppressed women during mass demonstrations and strikes to gain support for a movement towards industrial democracy. Pointing out that this tragedy would not have occurred if concessions were made during the 1909 strikes, Schneiderman cited the need for social justice in the workplace.  While the ILGWU stressed needs of all workers, they also pushed for women's suffrage, arguing that women had died because they were not able to act politically.","Through the manipulation of the worker's images to fit their purposes, various groups made the Triangle Factory Fire a very accessible event.  Although it was often simplified to an example of gender oppression or poor working conditions, it also made many aware of the need for reform and a greater sensitivity to the needs of those on the gender and socioeconomic margins. Through their protests, the ILGWU used the event to represent the plight of immigrants, workers, and women everywhere.  The event became more than something that would be preserved in the collective memories of a few Italian and Jewish neighborhoods in the Lower East Side of New York, it was claimed by those oppressed in various conditions and situations."],"display_date":"March 25, 1911","search_date":"1911-03-25","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":71,"tag":"historical memory"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4474,"title":"The New York Milk Committee Preaches Pure Milk by Moving Pictures","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"3/24/13","end_date":"3/24/13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Urban infants in the 1840s had only a 50 percent chance of living to the age of five. Progressive reformers believed that high infant mortality was linked to adulterated and infectious milk, a concern that remained even after New York passed regulation laws. On March 25, 1913, the Committee of Women's Organizations of the New York Milk Committee held a meeting to educate mothers living in the tenements of the Lower East Side on the importance of \"pure\" milk and of clean living areas. Dr. Lee W. Thomas, a member of the New York Milk Committee, encouraged the mothers to get milk from New York Health Department milk stations, to keep clean homes, and to influence their husbands to vote for the passage of pure milk bills, which were introduced to the New York Legislature by the Milk Committee. After Dr. Thomas spoke to the mothers, films were shown to illustrate the dangers of impure milk.","During the mid-nineteenth century, most of New York's milk supply came from \"swill\" milk stables attached to breweries and distilleries in the city. The cows in these stables ate the leftover grains from the fermentation process in the brewery or distillery. Unfortunately, the milk produced from these stables was very low quality and often full of bacteria. Even milk brought to the city from the country was often adulterated with water and carrying bacteria. In 1842, social reformer Robert Hartley published his <em>Essay on Milk</em>, which both praised milk as the \"perfect food\" and argued the importance of pure milk in New York City. Though New York City began to pass milk regulations in 1856, milk continued to be a concern for social reformers as a potential carrier of germs and diseases. Milk reform was part of a larger reform movement to regulate food, drink, and drugs, a movement that eventually resulted in the Federal Food and Drug Act of 1906, which made it illegal to adulterate or mislabel food or drugs. This put the power of information and choice in the hands of consumers, most of whom were women. Thus, even after this law was passed, social reformers felt impelled to guide tenement mothers in the importance of choosing good quality milk and keeping a clean home.","One of the means used by Progressive reformers, eager to use new technology, to preach cleanliness was moving pictures. Though this is an early instance of moving pictures being used as health propaganda, it is not the first. Three years before this meeting, Thomas Edison made a series of health propaganda films for the Tuberculosis Association. Whether or not the New York Milk Committee was aware of Edison's use of film, they obviously recognized the \"universal appeal\" of film and its potential as an educational device."],"display_date":"March 24, 1913","search_date":"1913-03-24","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":68,"tag":"Progressive Reformers"},{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":72,"tag":"Food Regulation"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4637,"title":"Spencers Supports, Supporting Working Women","course_id":22,"status":"P","start_date":"2/1/43","end_date":"2/28/43","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The strong, modern women of the 1940's no longer desired the wasp waist corsets of previous generations.  The new breed of woman wanted practicality.  Hence, the advertisements of the time did not dwell heavily on waist reduction or social expectations, rather, the emphasis focused more on health issues.  An example from Ladies Home Journal published in the February 1943 issue for Spencer Supports headlined their ad by posing a question to women about their level of fatigue.  \"Tire easily?\" the author asked.  The ad goes on to claim that a woman wearing Spencer Supports \"[felt] new energy.\"  It also stated that \"doctors prescribe Spencer's for backache, fatigue, arthritis, hernia,\" and many other maladies.  These claims for new found energy came in handy for women who entered the work force in support of the war.  Many women worked long hours doing strenuous work. Advertising promised more energy and support from a \"light, flexible, durable, easily washed\" garment that also eliminated bulges and smoothed the figure, and these promises really resonated with the target audience.","When women opened the pages of the Ladies Home Journal in 1943 and saw this article, a war raged on two fronts thousands of miles away.  A large percentage of the country's young men fought on those fronts, and women found themselves in new and exciting positions performing tasks that their mothers and grandmothers never dreamed.  These previous generations of women might also be surprised at the sort of garments passing for underwear near the mid twentieth century.  The rigid font busk corsets of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, made with a one inch or more wide piece of steel down the center front making motion difficult, fell out of favor.  Women replaced the unyielding corsets with garments resembling modern girdles and brassieres.  These support garments still laced up at the front, side, or center back for a tight fit, but they now came with stretchy elastic sections so less pressure was exerted on the wearer's waist.","The 1940's also saw a shift in how corsets companies marketed their products to women.  In decades past, advertisers made much of how small a corset shrunk the wearer's waist.  It was such an important detail that companies often altered photographs and encouraged artists to render drawings with skewed prospective to make waists look unnaturally small.  In contrast, the woman drawn in a Spencers Support appeared with normal proportions. Older advertisements also preyed on women's fears of inferiority pertaining to social expectations.  When manufacturers choose to use these fears in a positive light, the ad sometimes included claims that their corsets made it easier to keep up with young children or gave the wearer energy to take on household chores.  When advertisers used such tactics in negative ways, they doomed women without the proper corset to the lives of old maids.  The Spencers ad, however, highlighted cures for medical complaints rather than promises of a social and family life.","The clothing women wore evolved in to a much more practical state in the 1940's.  Undergarments followed suit and also changed for the better, because women looked for different qualities in their underwear than the ladies of previous generations.  Women attained new roles in society and fashion moved forward to meet the changing needs of the twentieth century woman.","<a href=\"http://s647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/?action=view&current=img0112.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/img0112.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>"],"display_date":"February 1943","search_date":"1943-02-14","locations":[{"id":27491,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":198,"tag":"corsets"},{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"},{"id":199,"tag":"working women"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}},{"id":4617,"title":"Doubleday Takes Baseball from Brooklyn to the Battle Fields of Dreams","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-01-01","end_date":"1861-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Sports can bring groups of people together like few other activities. The same can certainly be said for baseball, America's pastime, in the Civil War era. Baseball was being played before the war started, it was played during the war, and it is still played today. Baseball, which went by many names in the time of the Civil War, helped keep the morale of the troops up for both the North and the South. The game was endorsed by civilians and soldiers alike. Union General Abner Doubleday is popularly credited with founding baseball as we know it today.","            Baseball was played by the troops in their free time to keep their minds off of the dead, dying, wounded, battles past, and battles to come. Mostly it alleviated the boredom of camp life, officers and soldiers would play together, on one team, strengthening the camaraderie within the camp. Baseball also served as a means of something that connected the civilians with the soldiers. In a letter sent from Brooklyn to a soldier, \"I was pleased to hear that you had had a base ball match […] for I think you poor soldiers need a little recreation once and a while.\"  The letter was dated July 11, 1861 signed by <em>Phobe</em> of Brooklyn. Many other letters were sent as well, soldiers sharing stories of their baseball games rather than stories of war. Baseball proved to be very helpful for many in getting through the day in and day out life of a soldier during the Civil War. \"Suddenly there was a scattering of fire, which three outfielders caught the brunt; the centerfield was hit and captured, left and right field managed to get back to our lines. The attack…was repelled without serious difficulty, but we had lost not only our centerfield, but… the only baseball in Alexandria, Texas\" George Putnam said in a letter from his Union army camp.

The July 4, 1910 heavyweight championship bout in Reno, Nevada between the white challenger Jim Jeffries and the black champion Jack Johnson was supposed to be an easy victory for the undefeated Jeffries; his superior intellect and Anglo-Saxon masculinity were supposed to vanquish the black brute. Johnson decimated Jeffries, and race riots occurred in numerous cities. Johnson had defeated the so-called epitome of white male.

The heavyweight bout lasts only two minutes and four seconds, and “the ardor of German radio parties and café gatherings are quickly dampened.” Schmeling’s maid is so embarrassed by the fight that she keeps the news from Mrs. Schmeling. Louis avenges his earlier loss to “Unser Maxe” Schmeling and dealt a major blow to the Nazi idea of Aryan supremacy. Parties and riots break out in major cities in the United States. Louis did not “rock the boat” as his predecessor Jack Johnson and was thus loved by most of the public and labeled as an “Uncle Tom” by others. ","     In many sports, there is the strange phenomenon that many of the players are African American, while the majority of the spectators are Caucasian.

But a decrease of support for higher immigration numbers occurred compared to statistics collected twenty-one years prior to this poll. A decrease of four percent was collected regarding the question of whether immigration levels should be kept the same or increased.

The poor, suffering from a lack of employment opportunities, thought their position could be improved if immigration were restricted.

This reporter had credibility on the subject of U.S.-Central American relations because it was his journalistic specialty from 1970-1989.","Alan Riding reported in the article that the Guatemalans greatly anticipated Reagan coming to power “The conservative Government and private sector in Guatemala, which had been strongly critical of President Carter’s human rights campaign, were delighted by his defeat and seemed hopeful of resumed American military assistance to help combat leftist guerrillas.”","The historical context leading up to this involved official policy from the previous administration.","In 1977 President Jimmy Carter ordered a human rights report on the actions of the Guatemalan military. What the study found was later confirmed by the United Nations Commission for Historical Clarification. The Guatemalan military was responsible for 93% of the human rights violations committed during the war, the guerrillas for 3%. The Guatemalan government reacted to these negative findings by refusing United States military aid.","Reagan immediately voiced his support for funding Guatemala once again in his first presidential news conference. He stated: “You can [not] turn away from some country because here and there they do not totally agree with our concept of human rights.”  Public opinion at the time about United States involvement in Central American Civil Wars is hard to gauge. While some, like former Peace Corp volunteer John Elder actively participated in the process of bringing Guatemalan refugees to the United States, most Americans remained inactive. The United States Military’s involvement was mostly logistical, so the violence did not have a direct effect on American citizens. Our aid to Guatemala did not cause the same public out rage that Vietnam did because few Americans died. The reinstatement of funding was a political success from Reagan’s point of view and by 1983, most of the Guatemalan countryside was subdued.

However, leaders in the African-American community were divided on the best way to portray their newfound ideas. The majority of intellects believed that desegregation was the ultimate goal, which was achievable by integrating their culture with white culture. The other school of thought was led by Marcus Garvey and his ideas of Black Nationalism and separatism. Zora Neale Hurston was a major actress in the Harlem Renaissance, publishing many literary pieces; however it is difficult to classify her in either of these two schools. In a letter to a fellow poet, she states, “Now, as to segregation, I have no viewpoint on the subject particularly, other than a fierce desire for human justice…I have no desire for white association except where I am sought and the pleasure is mutual.” Hurston was shunned by many of the Harlem Renaissance activists and critics of her time, as well as many white “liberals” because of her view. Hurston was beyond her time, seeing that the true path to end Black oppression was to eliminate the misconception that Whites were naturally superior to Blacks, and that White people were doing Blacks a favor by associating with them.","Zora Neale Hurston’s personal history deeply influenced her view on segregation as well as the literary work that she produced. Hurston was born[1] in 1901 and raised in Eatonville, FL, the first all black community in the United States. Her father was a pastor and her mother was a school teacher, although she passed away when Hurston was 13. Hurston received her high school diploma in 1918, and continued her education at Howard University. At Howard, she pursued a degree in English and received several accolades; including being a member of Zeta Phi Beta, a contributor to <em>The Stylus</em> and a group called The Saturday Nighters, all prestigious academic and literary groups. Her early work was mainly in poetry where she wrote about love. Late in her college career, she began publishing short stories in <em>The Stylus</em>, most notably “John Redding Goes to Sea” which was heavily influenced by her home town of Eatonville and her family. These stories were written in the broken African-American dialect of Eatonville, a style which was largely unpopular by the Black critics of the Harlem Renaissance.              Incredibly talented, Hurston was an asset to the Harlem Renaissance, although her work was largely ignored by several critics of her time. The Harlem Renaissance was a period of intellectual advancement and creativity for the black community. Leaders of the movement, including W.E.B. Dubois and James Weldon Johnson, saw the Harlem Renaissance as an opportunity to advance the African-Americans past segregation and that black artists were tools to accomplish those means. The two primary schools of thought were desegregation versus black Nationalism and it was concluded that Hurston did not truly fit into either one of these categories. Sub sectioned into this central debate is whether or not Blacks should truly embrace their heritage and selfness and incorporate that into their literary work, or if they should try to modify their work to appease the white crowd and impress upon them their equality of intelligence and creativity.  In other words, should Blacks be “censoring” their literary work, allowing only art that conforms to White culture to be published?  In a letter Hurston wrote to Countee Cullen, she clearly expresses her opinion, one that was largely unpopular at the time.","Cullen was one of few leaders in the Black community that encouraged African-American artists to incorporate heritage into their work and not sacrifice any of their creativity in order to cater to Whites. Hurston deeply admired Cullen for this, writing in her letter, “I have always shared your approach to art. That is, you have written from within rather than to catch the eye of those who were making the loudest noise for the moment” (Hurston 1979). Throughout this letter, she elaborates on the resistance she has encountered from white “liberals” who are associating themselves with blacks in the fight for equality. Her outspokenness against those who believe in appeasing a white audience has tormented these white “sympathizers”, as they realize the asset she could be if she would conform to the idea of changing her work to be more compatible with white culture. She speaks of one instance where these white “liberals” offer her a white husband if she can, “see things right” (Hurston 1979). She reiterates, “I am utterly indifferent to the joy of other Negroes who feel that a marriage across the line is compensation for all things, even conscience” (Hurston 1979). She does not see how marrying a white man is advancing her race in anyway, and that by settling for interracial marriage is actually a statement of inequality. Hurston’s view on desegregation and equality seem uncaring, although the underlying idea she portrays in this letter is more than 30 years ahead of her time. She is truly colorblind, not seeing the difference between whites and blacks and holding both of equal value. She is simply an artist, producing literature that honors her heritage and Blackness and those who like it, white or black, are welcome to enjoy it.","Zora Neale Hurston was truly a visionary of the Harlem Renaissance, seeing beyond the goals of desegregation onto the advancement of true equality. In the face of scrutiny from Whites as well as Blacks she refused to conform, using her brilliance to exemplify the culture of her race in its true form. Drawing on both personal experience as well as her elite education she was able to produce literary work that survived her, and expressed the ideas and concerns of an African-American woman during the Harlem Renaissance."," ","[1] Actually Born in Alabama in 1891, although she denies this (Boyd)"],"display_date":"1924 - 1940","search_date":"1932-07-01","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":505,"tag":"Black Poets"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4898,"title":"How one woman helped to valut African American culture into the spotlight","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"10/29/32","end_date":"10/29/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Born in 1891 in rural Alabama, Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood in the first incorporated black town in the nation, Eatonville, Florida. Zora attended school in Eatonville until only 13 years old, when she traveled to New York City with a traveling theatre company. In the city that never sleeps, Zora would develop her creative mind and make her mark on history. Hurston seized the tremendous opportunity of living in New York during the Harlem Renaissance, a period of blossoming of African American culture through music, poetry, dance and other forms of media. First, she obtained three degrees from illustrious learning institutions including Columbia University and Howard University. Soon after, she was blessed with a shot to work with Langston Hughes, arguably the most famous black writer in American History, on a play entitled, “Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life in Three Acts.” Hurston went on to publish books such as the 1934 work “Jonah’s Gourd Vine,” detailing African American life in the deep-south and bringing it to the forefront of society. Through her life’s work and experiences, Zora Neale Hurston exposed the masses to African American life and folklore, broke racial boundaries, and inspired change here in Central Florida and across the nation.","Growing up in Eatonville, Hurston was fully immersed in African American culture and folklore. She specialized in theatre and comedy decided to pursue her interests further at Columbia. During her academic years, she conducted extensive field studies throughout the American South, becoming an expert in the field. Here at Rollins College, interest in American folklore was mounting. In a letter from October 29<sup>th</sup>1932, Professor W.R. Wunsch pleads with school President Dr. Hamilton Holt to allow an African American folk performance in the Annie Russell Theatre. Wunsch challenges the President to “break the ground as it were: to make the students sensitive to the lyric beauty of swamp and citrus grove, […] find the drama in the life of fisherfolk and sponge divers, […] to get the students to ‘dip their nets where they are.’” He goes on to specifically request Hurston, insisting that he “can think of no better way to introduce the students to the honest-to-the-soil material at their own doorsteps than to present to them in a program of folk songs and dancers a group of Eatonville negroes, headed by Zora Hurston. Zora, a national authority on negro ways, has won an enviable place for herself in American dramatics.” Clearly, there was desire for Zora’s expertise and creativity in the field local folklore here at Rollins, but the President was somewhat apprehensive to approve because of the well established racial boundaries of the time.","These pre-existing racial boundaries were tremendously difficult for African Americans to overcome, as the Jim Crow laws of segregation were still widely in effect. Dr. Holt illustrates this in his response to Mr. Wunsch’s letter. He allows the performance to take place, however, he adds, “Of course we cannot have negroes in the audience unless there is a separate place segregated for them.” Holt continues by hinting that he fears the judgment of others, warning, “I do not think I would advertise it very much outside our own faculty and students.” This mentality held widely throughout the south was a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to overcome. Hurston did an incredible job of shrinking the barriers by thrusting the lives and cultures of African Americans into mainstream society. Her first book, entitled “Jonah’s Gourd Vine,” was critically acclaimed as something totally new and fresh. Additionally, her academic success provided opportunity and paved the way for many African American women to follow.","The Harlem Renaissance set the stage for real progress in America. The timeless works of Hurston, Hughes, and countless other intellectuals, artists, poets and entertainers provided the building blocks for the Civil Rights Movement. This cultural movement shined the African-American experience in the spotlight, and in turn changed how African Americans were perceived. As rural, southern blacks moved north to larger cities, they developed a new image, one of urban sophistication. The idea of the black identity was forming, and antiquated, racist laws could no longer suppress it. In his response letter, Dr. Holt acknowledges that he is in favor of racial progress, telling the courageous Mr. Wunsch, “I am glad you are doing this as it is one of the best steps in the right direction.”","Zora Neale Hurston achieved incredible things in her lifetime. She won numerous awards as an actor, playwright and author. But arguably her most important contributions to this world came in the form of advancing her people and fighting for equality. Through hard work, a will to succeed, and being in the right place at the right time, she inspired true change in our country.

Rickey stated, \"I have not been pushed into this “, and, “I signed Robinson in spite of the pressure-groups who are only exploiting the Negroes, instead of advancing their cause. I signed him because I knew of no reason why I shouldn’t.  I want to win baseball games, and baseball is a game that is played by human beings.” What if an African American was able to play baseball within the white baseball leagues, would others agree and approve of this? The idea of an African American playing in the Major League Baseball Association during the 1940s was seen too many as just plain nonsense, and to others  nothing but a dream.  In a segregated America, the chance of an African American playing organized baseball in the white leagues was slim to none. Although the blacks had their own organized leagues, they weren’t nearly as popular, paid only a fraction of the salary as a white player, nor were they seen as major contenders compared to the white players in the Major Leagues.  Branch Rickey's decision to sign Jackie Robinson not only marked a defining moment in baseball history, but also was a major adjustment for the American public against the integration of African American athletes into the big leagues.","     Jackie Robinson was the first African American to play organized baseball in the white leagues. Recruited by Branch Rickey, the president of the Brooklyn Dodgers at the time, Robinson went on to become the first African American player to sign with their farm league. While signing Robinson might seem like a good decision now, in 1945, the decision of signing Robinson to the Dodgers farm league, made by Rickey, created a huge controversy.  Critics against integrating baseball, once again, suggested Rickey might have been pressured to sign Robinson. Also, players at this time such as Hornsby, a player for the Texans, and Dixie Walker , with the Dodgers, thought the situation wouldn’t work out .They assumed that African American players would be unable to travel, use the same busses, stay at the same hotels, or eat in the same restaurants, as their white counterparts.   These reactions tell us that many Americans at the time viewed sports, especially baseball, as solely a “white” hobby, that African Americans didn’t belong in the white \"professional\" baseball league, and that they should remain in their own leagues.","      Branch Rickey’s signing of Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1945 (minor   league affiliate and then 1947, major league) was because of his innovation, determination to desegregate, business sense, and idealism.  Robinson was baseball’s first rookie of the year, and the Dodgers made it to the World Series the year he signed on.  Rickey chose the most talented man for the job, not based on his color.

Wood & Sons, Inc., the increase was due to the Korean crisis.  It was mere weeks before this escalation of ring sales that the Korean War began.  Mr. Schwab noted that this increase in sales was following the same pattern that occurred at the beginning of the Second World War.   One of the executives of Lambert Brothers, Inc., Henry Lambert, explained that jewellery stores were filled with young couples purchasing rings.  This occurrence seemed to grow in just under a fortnight, and had not been seen since the end of World War II.","<br />Throughout the twentieth century this trend of increased weddings, and ring sales before, and during a major conflict was noted in both America and Europe.  During the months prior to World War I and World War II, young couples were joined in matrimony much more frequently than in times of peace.  In addition to the increase in marriages, there was a change in the average age that men and women were wed.  Throughout the first half of the twentieth century the average matrimonial age for men dropped from twenty-six to twenty-three, and for women dropped from twenty-two to twenty.","<br />Some argue that, the major influence on this sudden explosion of romance in the United States was the Selective Service Act of 1948 which reintroduced conscription.  The original act was passed in 1917 and revised in 1940.  Volunteer enlistment in the years following World War II was not enough to satisfy the needs of in this new Korean conflict.  The new act required all males over the age of eighteen to register for the draft and made all males between the ages of nineteen and twenty-six eligible to be drafted, thus increasing the number of conscripts by 100,000.  When the Selective Service Act was imposed in 1917 there appeared to have been a corresponding rise in the sale of wedding and engagement rings.  This trend was again seen at the outbreak of the Korean War.  The Selective Service Act was further revised in 1951 (Universal Military Training and Service Act) introducing a college or training exemption and reducing the draft age from nineteen to eighteen and a half.   While the war cast a dark shadow over these rushed marital vows, the uncertainty of the times and the notion that these men and women did not want to take the chance of deferring their weddings until after the war may shed some light on this upward trend in weddings and jewellery sales."],"display_date":"July 15, 1950 - July 27, 1953","search_date":"1952-01-19","locations":[{"id":28501,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":665,"tag":"Conscription"},{"id":664,"tag":"Korean War"},{"id":405,"tag":"Marriage"}],"course":{"name":"American History since the Civil War","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":42,"school_id":28}},{"id":5101,"title":"A English tourist documents his travels from Liverpool, England to New York.","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-06-01","end_date":"1848-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1848, Archibald Prentice composed “A tour in the United States” during his journey from Liverpool, England to New York.

He was particularly fascinated by the working man of America. In one of his journal entries, he noted that the labor market for incoming immigrant men was plentiful throughout the city. In the following passage he described the lure of moving to America. Many poor immigrants had nothing but hope that the simple opportunity to promote themselves through higher wages could improve their lifestyles. “Much misery must prevail. Tens of thousands of immigrants land here and linger here without a definite object; but yet the wages of common labour are about fifty percent. more than they are in England, and the price of food is one-third less. It is true that rent, clothes, and coals are fifty per cent. higher; but where a man has scarcely earned more than has kept him in food, the change by coming here is decidedly to his advantage, always premising that he brings the kind of labour which is in demand. If the labourer has earned three shillings a day in England, he will earn four shillings and sixpence here.\"","Although Prentice painted a portrait that sounded hopeful to any poor immigrant, not everyone entering the United States was able to obtain good employment or maintain a successful lifestyle. Prentice noted that alcohol such as whiskey was cheap and plentyful which caused problems for immigrant workers. He wrote how alcohol abuse often ruined the progress of hopeful immigrants by causing ill mental and physical health.","Those who were destitute often ended living in charitable homes for the poor called Almshouses. “Life in many 19th-century immigrant urban neighborhoods was squalid and mean. Immigrants were disproportionately represented among the ranks of the inner-city poor. By 1860 nearly 90 percent of New York City’s paupers were immigrants. When not begging for food or accepting charity, they lived in dank, dark, filthy, crowded tenements. Such conditions served as a breeding ground for alcohol abuse and crime.

Kindergarten would remedy this and mold children into what they were supposed to be. The children were also very polite and respectful to their elders, a trait, Bertha noted, that was lacking in many European children. Even the boys from the slums were polite and courteous as she drove by.","Bertha visited many schools and kindergartens while visiting America, and she was struck by the children’s seriousness. Although well groomed and neat, they did not laugh or play often and were quiet. She recounts the story of a young 13 month old child, already independent. The child, she claimed, could walk forward and back, up and down stairs, and feed himself with a fork cleanly and without any aid. She thought of the importance of independence and self-reliance in America, and marveled that it was taught to babes even at such a young age.","During Bertha’s time in the United States, children were still seen as helpers in the household. Education for children was carried out mostly by their mothers and perhaps fathers at home. James Marten agrees that children were molded into miniature adults early in life, their childhood a sacrifice for family prosperity. Children of both rich and poor families were brought up in order to contribute to the family income, not to leech it and indulge themselves in frivolous affairs.

The German Foreign Office promised to pass on all pertinent information regarding their investigation into the case of Dr. Mulvihill on to the United States government. They promised the same for similar cases as well, such as that of Mr. Roland Velz, who had been similarly assaulted by two German men when he failed to salute an emblem of the Nazi party.","In these cases, the severity of the punishments may seem somewhat harsh, and also appear unusual to us due to the fact that our knowledge of the use of prison (or concentration) camps generally derives from the post-war period and not before, and we are rarely informed about non-Jewish, German prisoners.  However, at the same time that the Nazi régime was investigating and punishing the men involved in these crimes, the articles notes that there were also “problems arising from Germany’s severance with the League of Nations and the arms parley at Geneva.” Regarding the latter issue, between the years 1932 and 1933, a World Disarmament Conference was held by the League of Nations in Geneva at which the constituent countries (primarily the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Germany) could not come to an agreement. On the one hand, according to Historian Marlies ter Borg, the German representatives believed that their country had taken the initiative in beginning the disarmament process and asked that the others follow suit. France, however, refused to do so unless they could have a promise of “collective security” from the United Kingdom and the United States, whereby those nations would intervene if war should break out in Europe. As Borg mentions, unfortunately for France, neither of those countries were willing to do so at the time.","In terms of the former concern, Historian Colum Duffy notes that when the nations who afterward became the Axis Forces during the Second World War (Germany, Japan and Italy) were accused of “committing acts of aggression” by the League of Nations, they made known their intention to withdraw from it “in order to prevent the machinery of the [League] from functioning effectively against them.” In light of these events – and their mention in the article – it is likely that the Nazi régime made their promise to hand over the information about these cases in an attempt to alleviate (somewhat) the issues that were quickly developing at the time and would damage their international image."],"display_date":"August 8, 1933","search_date":"1933-08-08","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"},{"id":806,"tag":"League of Nations"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":56,"school_id":28}},{"id":5128,"title":"The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire of 1911","course_id":54,"status":"P","start_date":"3/25/11","end_date":"3/25/11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire of 1911","By: Louis Daleandro","<br />Within fifteen minutes, a massive fire broke out in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City in 1911.  Dubbed a model of modern efficiency, the Triangle factory was large in scale as were the specially designed bins that held hundreds of pounds of scrap cotton and tissue paper.   The blaze that ensued ultimately took the lives of 146 mostly young, immigrant women workers who either burned or jumped to their deaths.  Out of the tragedy came progress as the trial and outcry sparked by the even led to improvements in safety and sanitation.  Witnesses of the account, however, tell haunting tales of the event.  William Shepherd’s first hand account, provided over a telephone to a reporter as the fire burned, depicted the gruesome nature of the fire.","<br />William G. Shepherd was walking through Washington Square on the night of the fire and was drawn to the scene when he saw a puff of smoke.  The sound of a speeding, living body making a thud on the sidewalk became a sound he quickly learned.  His eyewitness account gruesomely described the horror of the event.  Shepherd explained that the first ten thuds he heard shocked him.  He was able to look up and see a girl falling while waving her arms and trying to keep her body upright until the instant she hit the pavement.  Through shouts of horror for the fire department, Shepherd could see the young women climbing out onto the windowsill and then dropping.  The ladder of the fire department could only reach the sixth floor; the factory took up the top three floors of the ten-story building.  A life net was set up below but the bodies of the workers just broke through it.  Shepherd explained that he witnessed a love affair amid the flames when a young man held out women away from the building and let them drop, with the fourth woman grabbing the man and giving him a goodbye kiss.  Girls jumped and tried in vain to grab the short reaching ladder.  Shepherd went around the corner and witnessed tragedies unfold on the ninth floor where girls were screaming, as they burnt alive.  The windows were jammed offering them no chance to jump.  The sidewalk became the home of heaps of broken bodies where a policeman began fastening tags to the wrists of the girls, one of whom he noticed wearing an engagement ring.  Shepherd recalled the strike of the previous year where these same girls fought for better sanitary conditions and more safety precautions.  In less than seven minutes, however, the fire had amassed the factory and the street below was covered in bodies.","Well before the fire engulfed the factory, efforts were taken to improve the safety conditions of the workers.  At the turn of the twentieth century labor laws and safety codes were not aggressively enforced if they even existed.  The garment workers of Triangle struck in 1909 on the basis of being overworked and underpaid.  The strike soon spread to other shirtwaist manufacturers and by Christmas of 1909, 723 employees had been arrested.   The public, however, mostly sided with the laborers.  In thirteen weeks time, the strike ended with new contracts that created a 52 maximum hour workweek and wage increases of 12 to 15%.  Conditions in the factory, however, still remained unsafe in the end leading to a grand jury indicting Triangle Shirtwaist owners Isaac Harris and Max Blanck on charges of manslaughter.","The trial that emerged over the guilt of the factory owners, Harris and Blanck, rendered its final decision of not guilty on December 4, 1911.  The judge reminded the jury that the dramatic testimonies of the devastating event was not the key to the case, whether or not the owners knew the door that could have given the girls an escape was locked was. The all male jury set Harris and Blanck free with some of the jurors remarking that the women probably just panicked and guilt could not be found unless they believed Harris and Blanck knew the door was locked and in that regard what real reason the door was locked in the first place.  The tragedy, however, inspired workingwomen to fight harder for their rights.  Strikes increased and membership in the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union skyrocketed.  Female labor leaders such as Leonora O’Reilly demanded suffrage for women in order to be empowered to vote in politicians who would change sweatshop conditions.  New York City created the Bureau of Fire Prevention and began enforcing stricter safety regulations and finally under Franklin D. Roosevelt, the precursor to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was created.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","Bibliography","Drehle, David Von. “Trial by Fire.” Smithsonian 37, no. 5 (August 2006): 93-98. http://vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com/hww.results.getResults.jhtml?_DARGS=///advanced_search.jhtml.4 (accessed November 15, 2010)."," ","Linder, Doug. “The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire Trial.” Famous Trials. http://www.law.umkc.edu//projects///.html (accessed November 15, 2010)."," ","Shepherd, William G. “Eyewitness at the Triangle.” Interview by Roy Howard.

Through these investigations, it was revealed that the only stairway out of the building was rusted and crumpled to pieces as the girls tried escaping the fire.","The working conditions of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory epitomized the poor working conditions and hardships many immigrant factory workers were subjected to as they attempted to earn a living.  This infamous event was a catalyst for progressive reformers as it created public awareness of the poor working conditions that were imposed on factory workers.  The catastrophe fueled the union movement as they sought to improve working conditions in America.  As civil and criminal trials developed as a result of the Triangle Factory fire, legislative reform grew out of the now clearly apparent need to prevent industrial accidents.  With 146 immigrant young women of varying age and ethnicity losing their lives, the Triangle Factory disaster symbolized the brutality exhibited by factory owners and created political attention and the demand for change in the working and sanitary conditions of industrial workers. "],"display_date":"March 25, 1911","search_date":"1911-03-25","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":851,"tag":"Catastrophic event"},{"id":850,"tag":"Labor Reform"},{"id":849,"tag":"Progressive Era"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":5140,"title":"The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire","course_id":60,"status":"P","start_date":"3/25/11","end_date":"3/25/11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 26, 1911, the <em>New York Times</em> reported on a disastrous fire in a Manhattan building.  According to the article, the previous day, a fire had broken out in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in the Asch Building located near Washington Square in Manhattan.  Although the building had been declared fireproof, contents within the buildings 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, and 10<sup>th</sup> floors ignited the deadly blaze just moments before quitting time.  The fire caused panic to erupt.  One of the two elevators was out of service, the fire escape was rusty to the point of collapse, and the stairwell was locked in order to keep the workers inside the factory until the end of the work day.  One hundred forty one men and women died either in the fire or by jumping from windows, which were 100 feet above the sidewalk.  Of the dead, approximately one hundred twenty five were women who immigrated to the United States in search of a better life.  They were young and, although paid poorly, often the bread winners of their families.","            The Triangle Fire was the single most tragic fire in the history of New York.  The fact that the firemen could not reach the fire or those who were trapped was a significant aspect of the tragedy.  The fire prohibited rescuers from entering the building and the truck ladders did not extend far enough to reach the involved floors; therefore, firefighting efforts were hindered.  According to the article, what burned so quickly and disastrously for the victims were shirtwaists, hanging on lines above tiers of workers, sewing machines placed so closely together that there was hardly aisle room for the girls between them, and shirtwaist trimmings and cuttings which littered the floors above the eighth and ninth stories.","            Prior to the Triangle Fire, the United States had not experienced a tragic event of this magnitude.  Laws did not address safety and fire prevention.   Fire departments were not educated and trained on how to handle a catastrophic event of this magnitude.  Following the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, Mary E. Dreier worked to improve the lives of women working in factories.  She was a wealthy New Yorker.  From 1906 – 1914 she headed the New York Women’s Trade Union League, a group of workers and their middle-class allies who focused on getting women workers to join unions.  Dreier brought women together from various ethnic backgrounds calling them sisters.  She fought to improve working conditions and pay.","            The New York Time article highlighted the dangers that many young immigrant women faced in their daily working lives.  While tragic, the fire led to improved workplace safety for many working women throughout New York City and the rest of the nation.  The women of the Triangle Fire served as an important reminder that reform was a necessary part of social progress in the United States."," "],"display_date":"March 25, 1911","search_date":"1911-03-25","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":646,"tag":"factory fire"},{"id":854,"tag":"Triangle Fire"}],"course":{"name":"History","school":"Widener University","course_id":60,"school_id":43}},{"id":5166,"title":"With poor immigrants to America","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/14","end_date":"12/31/14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1914, Stephen Graham, an European, wrote a book describing his first journey in the United States and why he was so impressed. First, he wrote about why he came to U.S., “I came to America to see men and women and not simply bricks and mortar, to understand a national life rather than to moan over sooty cities and industrial wildernesses. Hundreds of thousands of healthy Europeans passed annually to America. I wanted to know what this asylum or refuge of our wanderers actually was, what was the life and hope it offered, what America was doing with her hands, what she was yearning for with her heart. I wished to know also what was her despair,” he says. Graham and most of the immigrants believed that in the United States it was easy to get a place and earn an honest living. In the first chapter “The Arrival of the Immigrant”, he described how he and other immigrants arrived in New York. All the approved immigrants were overjoyed. These people were mostly Europeans, such as Germans, Swedes, Italians and Russians.","Graham then expressed how he was impressed by the advanced technology, diversity of language, people’s hospitality and kindness and the natural environment.  He was also impressed by Americans' culture and faith: “America breathed kindness. New York seemed to me more friendly and hospitable than any other great city I had lived in,” he says, “I for my part have to thank numberless farmers, east and west, for kindly interest and good talks, loaves of bread, cups of coffee, and pleasant meals. Several times when I have been cooking by the side of a road a farm wife has come running out to me with something hot from her kitchen, with an ‘Eat this, poor man, and God bless you, you must be hungry.’” Graham was very touched by these kind people and the way they lived.","Graham basically loved America rather than his home country, in every aspect such as culture, religion, society and economy. “We live in a tradition; they live in an expectation. We are remedying the old state; they are building the new. We are loyal to the ideas of our predecessors, they are agape to divine the ideas of generations yet to come,” Graham once says in his book. In the end of the book, he expresses how he thinks of the United States and how the United States is better than his home country.  He says, “Back to Russia! From the most forward country to the most backward country in the world; from the place where ‘time is money’ to where the trains run at eighteen miles an hour; from the land of Edison to the land of Tolstoy; from the religion of philanthropy to the religion of suffering--home once more.”","Graham’s book reflected the image of the United States in the European’s eyes. His experiences perfectly explain why Europeans craved to come to the U.S. during the early 1900s. In the book <em>The Huddled Masses: The Immigrant in American Society, 1880-1921, </em>Alan Kraut explains that the depression of the 1890s greatly enhanced the number of Eastern and Southern European immigrants in United States. By 1910, Eastern and Southern Europeans made up seventy percent of the immigrants entering the United States. Kraut argues that immigration to America was but one of the many choices available to the immigrants, and that individual aptitude and desires were just as influential as cultural, social, and familial pressures to find a better life, which is exactly what Graham was talking about. As Kraut discusses, escaping religious, racial, and political persecution, or seeking relief from a lack of economic opportunity or famine, were the main reasons why they wanted to come to United States. To sum up, what Kraut explains about the immigration of early 20<sup>th</sup> century perfectly illustrates Graham’s experience and the reason why those Europeans were craving to move to the United States during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century."],"display_date":1914,"search_date":"1914-07-02","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":892,"tag":"European immigrants"},{"id":797,"tag":"America in 19th Century."},{"id":759,"tag":"Immigrants"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5255,"title":"Southern Trees","course_id":67,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/30","end_date":"8/31/40","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"Strange Fruit<em>\" </em>is a haunting poem with verses that illustrate in vivid detail a dark facet of Southern life in the United States in the early-mid twentieth century.","“Southern trees bear a strange fruit,<br />Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,<br />Black body swinging in the Southern breeze,<br />Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.","Pastoral scene of the gallant South,<br />The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,<br />Scent of magnolia sweet and fresh,<br />And the sudden smell of burning flesh!","Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck,<br />For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,<br />For the sun to rot, for a tree to drop,<br />Here is a strange and bitter crop.”","Written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish school teacher from New York, \"Strange Fruit\" was inspired by the infamous image of the beaten and lynched bodies of two African American youths in the south, Abram Smith and Thomas Shipp. The men were overtaken by a mob of an estimated 10,000 white southerners who stormed the jail in which they were held. Smith and Shipp, who had been imprisoned under accusations of rape and murder, were dragged from their cells one August night in 1930 violently beaten and ultimately hung by the rabid mob. Meeropol loathed the indiscriminate and unmerited lynchings of African Americans in the South and spoke out against it in this poem. That common hate, for both action and perpetrator would provoke anti-lynching campaigns across The United States, often spear-headed by women. Many of whom who would soon call upon \"Strange Fruit\" to be one of its most recognized anthems. African American Jazz Singer Billie Holiday would take the poem and make it into one of the most infamous Jazz recordings of the time. Enabled initially by the open mindedness of New York neighborhoods, most famously Greenwich Village, integrated establishments like the Café Society allowed the song, \"Strange Fruit,\" to reach a far wider audience then ever thought possible. The simplicity of Meeropol’s words bought to life by Holiday’s signature deep and husky voice epitomizes a pivotal yet overlooked aspect of American Society in the thirties.","Significant numbers of Southern women, in a parallel effort with their northern contemporaries like Meeropol and Holiday, began to take a stance against the very societies of which they were part. Women, who frequently saw the lynching of many African American men, formed groups such as the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching(ASWPL)which advocated for an end to, what was for them, the all too common scenes depicted by Meeropol’s \"Strange Fruit.\" The use of their insider status as Southern women enabled them to actively attack the all too common male fueled misconception that white southern men partook in lynching as an active effort to protect the Southern Bell against men like Shipp and Smith. Women such as those in the ASWPL actively petitioned for the cause not just their own communities but throughout the South. Their goal, to put an end to this twisted illusion of southern chivalry which to them was nothing more then sadistic barbarism, painted pretty for bigoted southern men. Acting with equally as much fervor as Meeropol and Holiday, such examples stand as a testament to how injustice does not adhere to the neatly drawn lines of a map, nor those who fight it defined by where they happen to fall on that map."],"display_date":"August 1930 - August 1940","search_date":"1935-08-16","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"},{"id":22726,"lat":39.7816126185,"lng":-86.1384147396,"zoom":10,"place":"Marion, Indiana"}],"tags":[{"id":999,"tag":"Strange Fruit"},{"id":998,"tag":"Abel Meeropol"},{"id":997,"tag":"Billie Holiday"},{"id":226,"tag":"Southern Women"},{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"},{"id":889,"tag":"Racism"}],"course":{"name":"US History Since 1865","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":67,"school_id":28}},{"id":5258,"title":"<strong>Leary, Metzner, and Alpert Instruct LSD Initiates on How to Achieve</strong> <strong>a Successful “Psychedelic Session”</strong>","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/64","end_date":"12/31/64","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1964, psychologists Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, and Richard Alpert published <em>The Psychedelic Experience</em>, a manual intended to prepare the users of psychedelic drugs for sessions. The authors had researched the therapeutic aspects of psychedelic substances, as well as their religious possibilities. The book is heavily influenced by the <em>Tibetan Book of the Dead</em>, (also known as <em>Bardo Thodol</em>) a funerary text that describes spiritual after-death experiences. The authors’ experiments with LSD and other psychedelics began at Harvard University, until unfavorable representations in the press led to the suspension of the research and, in 1963, the dismissal of Leary and Alpert from their faculty positions at the institution. The authors continued their own research, through observation of others and under the influence of hallucinogenic substances themselves.","The text focused on the use of psychedelics with the intention of achieving spiritual enlightenment. The authors devoted Part 3 of their text to an explanation of how to achieve a beneficial experience through proper preparation for a session, noting proper drugs and dosages as well as the critical importance of an experienced “guide.” A guide was expected to serve as a relaxed, secure, and wise presence to help the “voyager” through their trip, “always ready to help navigate their course, to help them reach their destination.” Also important to a successful session was what Leary frequently referred to as “set and setting.” This idea emphasizes proper mental and physical preparation by participants, as well as a suitable environment for the experience. Most significantly, the authors stated that the manual “prepares the person for a mystical experience according to the Tibetan model,” and instructed participants to delay religious interpretations until the end of the session when they could best benefit the individual spiritually.","A significant proportion of those drawn to Buddhism and other Eastern traditions in the 1960s—like Leary, Metzner, and Alpert—were influenced by the effects of psychoactive substances, and vice versa. Reflecting on psychedelic drug use in the 1960s, scholar Richard Batchelor asserts that “it is all too easy either to dismiss claims of spiritual significance for drugs as thinly veiled justifications for hedonistic indulgence, or to invoke the tragic consequences of heedless excess as grounds for denying the validity of any drug-induced experience at all.” LSD advocates were continually forced to defend the legitimate benefits of its use.","The authors of <em>The Psychedelic Experience</em>, trained in medicine and psychology, were pioneers in the exploration of consciousness and spirituality through the use of psychedelics like LSD. Their research, during the short window of time when LSD was legal, gave some legitimacy to the possibilities of personal and religious development through the use of hallucinogenic drugs. Their work on the spiritual benefits of psychedelics would become even more significant in debates over the use and control of such substances in the late-1960s—debates over one’s right to control their own brain.

Stept. It was a version of the nineteenth-century English folk song <em>\"Long, Long Ago\".</em> Lew Brown and Charles Tobias wrote the lyrics and the song debuted in the 1939 Broadway musical Yokel Boy. It was written as a pledge of loyalty between two young lovers while one of them is away serving in the war.","After the United States entered the war in December 1941, Brown and Tobias modified the lyrics to their current form, with the chorus ending with \"...'till I come marching home\". In February 1942, two months after Pearl Harbor, the Glenn Miller Orchestra recorded the song with vocals by Tex Beneke, Marion Hutton, and The Modernaires. In May the song was featured in the film “<em>Private Buckaroo” </em> as a performance by the Andrews Sisters with the Harry James orchestra. The Andrews Sisters then released the song on Decca Records. Many other artists released records of the song that year, including Kay Kyser.

Written in 1918, Clarke clearly explains that she plans, with this publication, to “permanently record the greatest massed effort of women the world has ever known” [1]. It is clear that Clarke feels that these great women go under-appreciated, hence why she published this document. Clarke’s target audience for the publication is women. She seeks to encourage women in their future endeavors by describing the great successes of women during the first World War. Her goal is to bring well-deserved attention to the efforts of women during the war.","Clarke begins by discussing the creation of the Woman’s Committee, a useful tool that gathered together groups of women across many states in mutual cooperation [2]. The Committee was so well-organized that it began to acquire sub-divisions such as Child Welfare and Home and Foreign Relief. The women of this Committee delivered valuable lectures about food conservation and also gave their time to help with the Red Cross. Although the Red Cross work was very helpful to the sailors during this time, women during the war also volunteered at home by overseeing playgrounds, parks and other various charities [3]. Clarke also goes on to describe that these women did their patriotic duty by nearly solving the problems of food conservation and food production during the time of the war.","Although there are many triumphs discussed in American Women and the World War, women also faced several injustices. While women were able to enlist in the US Navy during World War I, they had to settle for typically “female” work. This work would include nursing and telephone operating. The women were also denied an auxiliary corps, as per the War Department. Along with the war ending also concluded any hopes of women enlisting in the US Army [5].","While women during World War I faced many ups and downs, one can say that their efforts were eventually recognized. Popular belief holds that women were recognized because they had truly proved themselves during the war [6]. Undoubtedly, the women’s war efforts also helped lead to their gaining the right to vote in 1920 with the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment.","In conclusion, Ida Clarke successfully achieved her goal in proving the heroism and patriotism of American women in American Women and the World War. Women finally were given the chance to prove themselves as the everyday heroes that they were, at home and during the war. By doing so, they continued their legacy of equal rights and eventually gained the right to vote."," "," ","<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> Ida Clyde Gallagher Clarke, <em>American Women and the World War</em> (New York: D.

She has an air of power, intelligence, and strength. Something about her captivating expression renders you powerless. Her stance is one of both strength and seduction. You can do nothing but stand there and stare in awe of her glory as she takes a puff from her Lucky Strike…","The roaring twenties is known as a time of change and decadence in the United States. Flappers, jazz, and speakeasies were cultural fixtures of this period. There was a shift in social norms that brought with it a new sense of freedom and a different idea of what the modern world should be. One aspect of this time-period which is often overlooked is the emergence of cigarettes as a social staple. Brands like Camel and Lucky Strike were able to change public perceptions of smoking. In the past women smoking in public was seen as faux pas. Additionally, cigarettes were seen as feminine so men often stuck to cigars or chewing tobacco. A man named Edward Bernays changed all that.","Edward Bernays is often referred to as the father of public relations as well as the master of spin. He was famously commissioned by Lucky Strike cigarettes to make the brand more appealing to women. Bernays was nothing if not clever; he conducted research showing that most women wouldn’t buy Luckies because the green packaging clashed with their clothing. Bernays teamed up with Barney’s of New York to make green a staple in the fashion world. The now infamous “green campaign” was extremely successful. The shop windows up and down Fifth Avenue featured green suits, dresses, and evening gowns. Women across the country wore green from head to toe. Luckies sales grew exponentially and eventually surpassed the powerhouse that was Camel.","In an effort to keep Lucky Strike at the top Bernays turned to the advertising experts on Madison Avenue. He used a plethora of famous faces as well as testimonials from “experts” to ensure that Lucky Strike would become a household name nationwide. Posters, magazine ads, and radio spots rebranded smoking as something that was chic and cool for both men and women. One of his most famous advertisements features an interview with actress Delores Del Rio standing in a green and white gown while smoking a Lucky Strike.

This is what many like the writer below quested to experience and understand.  Stephen Graham, a British traveller, walked about New York City and stopped to converse with an American man in a club. The man opened Graham’s eyes to the American mentality when Graham asked if it was embarrassing to take such great risks such as death and disease all for the sake of expansion of the city. The man replied: \"You play chess?\" said he, laughing. \"That's it exactly. He did not care to sacrifice pieces; he was entirely on the defensive in his chess, eh? And in life he would be the same, hoarding his pennies and his dollars, and economizing and saving. That's just how the American is different. He doesn't mind taking great risks; he is playing the large game, sacrificing small things, hurrying on, building, destroying, building again, conquering, dreaming. We are always selling out and re-investing. You are concentrating on yourselves as you are; we want to leave our old bodies and conditions behind and jump to a new humanity.\" This American, as opposed to Graham, did not save and count on every event to be safe. Rather, he took pride and joy in knowing that he was taking risks. The Americans as this man saw it were not afraid to fantasize about bigger and better things. Once they thought up something they wanted, they pursued it without fail until their desires were realized. The Americans were neither complacent nor fearful. They celebrated the trials and tribulations of normal men and realized that things may be less than ideal at times.","For many, the journey to America consisted of working in factories to procure better lives for themselves and their families.  \"In the period between 1866 and 1900, over 13 million immigrants entered the United States...Most immigrants left their homes seeking jobs and better financial opportunities in the United States. Some, like the Jews in Russia and Poland, left because of religious or political oppression. Most arrived with little money and no professional skills. Many immigrants were young males who intended to stay in the country only long enough to earn some money and then return home—and, in fact, many did return. Others settled permanently in the United States and saved money to pay for their loved ones to join them.\"  Thus we see that people came to the United States to work.

More importantly, the morale and efficiency of troops was dependant on the fact that these food and munitions were particularly good. For this reason, the food rations provided to American soldiers were specifically monitored by the Army Medical Corps in an attempt to ensure their superiority over the supplies of the German or Japanese troops. The significant resource cost of the war made it difficult to ensure a fresh supply of food and beverages was getting to the front line or being available to the workers back at home. According to the US Army, American soldiers consumed about nine million pounds of food daily. This meant that a considerable amount of food had to be brought to the battlefront which would be nutrient rich, in eatable condition, and available quickly. The American soldier's ration was made up of easily mass produced, canned, and shipped goods such as beans, packaged meats and vegetables, soluble fruit drinks, chewing gum, and cigarettes.","Though the American soldier's rations were processed and not freshly made, the availability of genuine, vitamin-rich food should not be taken lightly. The Germans and Italians, by comparison, had trouble supporting their troops and munitions workers with food in the same way. The production capacity of the United States was colossal and was not subject to the same stipulations as some of the European powers. The Germans were largely dependent on domestic food resources which, while enough to survive on, could not provide both soldiers and munitions workers with enough nutrients to remain at full efficiency. As a result, the Germans suffered a loss in the supply of food and munitions due to worker malnourishment while the Americans were able to provide for the Allies.  Winston Churchill is even quoted as having said \"We have won the war!\" after hearing of the attacks on Pearl Harbor, knowing well the industrial power of the United States.  During war time, the importance of efficiency and support of the home front should not be underestimated, and it is without a doubt that well-fed and nourished soldiers and workers have a distinct advantage over their malnourished counterparts. People under the Axis often had to eat substitute \"sawdust\" food and rely on foods which engineered specifically for mere survival, and this was a clear advantage that the United States brought to the Allies.","The importance of steady and healthy food supplies was not lost on the United States, and the great economic advantage of the nation has always been something which could be exploited. After World War II, the Medical Corps continued to improve the supplies received by American soldiers, upgrading the synthetic food drinks of wartime into instant coffee, and providing a wider variety of meat as well as pastas and treats such as cookies to the troops.  Well nourished troops are very important to a war effort, and there is no doubt that the superior food rations of the Allied troops, particularly those of the United States, helped in part to ensure victory over the Axis. <br /><br /> <br />Works Cited: <br /><br />Merriman, John M.

Unfortunately, in spite of the three attempts for an anti-lynching bill that successfully passed through the House of Representatives, it continued to fail in the Senate. Lynching was protected under the Constitution as it protected the right of local government to control crime thus giving them freedom from interference or scrutiny.","The early twentieth century was the era of ‘The Declaration of Principles,’ a call to “restoring to ‘blacks’ the right to vote, an end to racial segregation, and complete equality in economic and educational opportunity”  created under the leadership of W.E.B. Du Bois, being adopted in 1905. Yet, as African Americans began to show assertiveness and independence, racial tensions were amplified and whites reacted in violence, in order to maintain their white supremacy.  Horrifically, more than 5,000 African Americans were lynched by white mobs between 1882 and 1932, with the express purpose being to “terrify ‘Negroes’ as to dissuade them from ever asserting themselves or their rights.” Incredibly, the lack of concern over the murder of thousands of African Americans was because whites believed that their lives were cheap and “inherently and permanently inferior,” to the point of being as low in value as animals. In fact, lynchings were committed by respected and regular citizens and celebrated as social events attended by families. The real horror about this period in American history is that, regrettably, racism would continue to raise its ugly head for three more decades before many of the African Americans dreams for true freedom and equality would begin to be realized through the crusades led by Martin Luther King, Jr.  <br /><br />"],"display_date":"July 11, 1930","search_date":"1930-07-11","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"}],"course":{"name":"US History since the Civil War","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":86,"school_id":28}},{"id":5465,"title":"Potential Danger for Prohibition","course_id":84,"status":"P","start_date":"1/31/20","end_date":"1/31/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1920 Linton Smith, also known as the Bishop of Hereford, wrote a controversial article on the Temperance Movement and Prohibition. Linton claimed that prohibition could possibly divide political parties on a, “Sex basis,\" meaning that female prohibition proponents could vote as a block against male opponents of prohibition.<br /> <br /> Strong drink was very popular in the lives of men during the time. In this time men were turning to alcohol because of work conditions, social, and sanitary reasons. In most cases this would affect the home life and relationship between husband and wife.  Because of the large amounts consumed men would become violent with their wives or spend all their income on alcohol rather than providing things needed for their family. Tension was rising between both men and women because of alcohol.<br /> <br />During the mid 1800’s to the early 1900’s women played a dominant role in the Temperance Movement and Prohibition. By 1892 the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, the largest temperance union at the time, had nearly 150,000 members. Historian Ruth Bordin writes that, “Through the WCTU, women became visible as leaders in communities and cities from coast to coast” (Bordin 157). Not only was the WCTU the largest temperance movement, but also the largest women’s organization in America. Because of the growing number of followers, the union began to respond not only to temperance but larger issues they were facing, such as women’s suffrage. Bordin also writes, “Through the Union women learned of their legal and social disabilities, gained confidence in their strengths and talents, and became certain of their political power as a group and as individuals” (Bordin 157). The Union allowed for women to push the envelope and fight for their rights, one of those rights being the right to vote. This right was given to women in 1920 with the passing of the 19th Amendment.<br /> <br />It is for reasons like this that Smith wrote the article on the danger of Prohibition and the Temperance Movement. Women were already aligned, in large numbers, with the WCTU and would vote for Prohibition. Smith felt as though the passing of this law would cause tension between the two sexes and split the political parties based on this one idea. He writes that, “The law will certainly be passed, if it is passed at all, by women for men, and it will be resented the more for that reason”."],"display_date":"January 31, 1920","search_date":"1920-01-31","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":644,"tag":"woman's suffrage"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":84,"school_id":10}},{"id":5574,"title":"<strong>The Fight of Ultimate Rivals</strong>","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"3/8/71","end_date":"3/8/71","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The night of March 8, 1971 is one that will never be forgotten in sports history. This was the night of an international sports spectacle. This was the night that Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier attempted to settle the controversy over the world heavyweight boxing championship at Madison Square Garden. Never before had a boxing match meant so much, cost so much, viewed so much, or edged out the My Lai massacre trial off of so many front pages. The night of March 8, 1971 marked “The Fight of the Century” between the ultimate rivals; “the bull” and “the bee”, however, every American felt like they were right in the ring with them due to the social implications that went beyond the arena.","At first glance, Ali and Frazier seemed like strikingly similar public figures. Both were undefeated professional heavyweight champions; Ali with twenty-five knockouts in thirty-one straight wins, Frazier with twenty-three knockouts in twenty-six consecutive victories. They each were guaranteed the same pay day of two and a half million dollars and would be watched by the same three hundred million viewers during these ultimate showdown. Along with that, both were also Olympic Gold Medal champions; Ali in 1960 and Frazier in 1964. Both these uncontested champions also were prominent African Americans during a the height of the Civil Rights Movement when fighting took to the streets while they were fighting in the ring for millions of dollars a knockout.[1]  Despite all these similarities, however, Ali and Frazier had been on a collision course since 1967, when Ali was stripped of his title while Frazier was approaching the stature of a contender. In 1970, Frazier earned world recognition as Ali’s successor as champion by stopping Jimmy Ellis, who was once Ali’s sparring partner.[2]","Adding to this infamous rivalry was the fact that Ali and Frazier represented the two different sides of America at the time. Ali had been born Cassius Clay and changed his name to Muhammad Ali upon his conversion to the Black Muslim Faith. This was the same religion that was tied to the militant Civil Rights group; the Black Panthers.[3] Then, in 1966, he avoided the draft by failing his mental exam and became a Muslim “minister” in order to claim a clerical exemption. After he would state, “I ain’t got no quarrel with those Viet Congs.”[4]  A year later, he was then convicted of draft evasion. This caused the WBA to then strip him of his title, clearing the way for Frazier to take his place.  Both of these sentiments, being a black Muslim and speaking out against the war at a time both of these issues were reaching a breaking point due to violent protests on both issues throughout the country, caused him to represent the anti-establishment movement and counterculture.","While Ali during came to symbolize the image of the counterculture; Frazier became to embody the other-half of America the “good citizens”, while also being dubbed the white man’s champ, mostly due to trash talking from Ali. Frazier, was a Baptist whose mother was “a real church-goin’ lady” who taught him “respectfulness”, standing in deep contrast to the militant Black Muslim religion that Ali spoke vocally towards.[5]  In the months leading up to the fight, Ali would also yell fighting words in Frazier’s direction, calling him names like “Uncle Tom”, leading Ali to represent more and more of the Civil Rights Movement even when Frazier tried to counteract these claims. In contrast to Ali’s views of the Vietnam War, Frazier again stood with contrasting views and became a symbol of the conservative, pro-war movement. In his autobiography, Frazier said that the only reason why he did not fight in the war was because he was a father, but that he would have fought if he were drafted because his country had been so good to him.[6] Clearly, going into this supposed, “Fight of the Century”, it was a fight between to seemingly similar, yet vastly different champions; with the liberal anti-establishment counterculture on one side, and the conservative and traditional rule followers on the other. This was a showdown that everyone in America felt a part of.","By the time it was finally the night of the match, Madison Square Garden had a circus-like atmosphere that was fit for the occasion. Scores of policemen tried to control the crowd of outrageously dressed fans as countless celebrities, from Woody Allen to Frank Sinatra, sat among the masses.[7] The fight itself exceeded even in its massive promotional hype and went the full fifteen round championship distance. Ali dominated the first three rounds, however, Frazier began to dominate in the fourth rounds. Despite continuous pinning to the rope and massive body blows, Ali’s speed and combinations kept him on roughly even terms with Frazier and the fight remained very close until late in round eleven. At the end of round fourteen Frazier had held a lead on the three scorecards while giving Ali a brutal beating. Then, early in the final round, Frazier landed a spectacular left hook that put Ali on his back. Ali, his right jaw swollen grotesquely, got up from the blow quickly, but it would be too little too late.","On March 8, 1971, in the “Fight of the Century” at Madison Square Garden had ended. Frazier won by a unanimous decision. Ali lost. The Garden sizzled. The unbeaten Frazier officially handed Ali the first defeat of his pro career, and secured his own title as world champion.[8] Despite this, the rivalry between Ali and Frazier, along the fight of the morals and the people that each represented, still had decades before its final call."," ","[1] Mike Sielski, \"Frazier battled Ali in timeless trilogy,\" (ESPN Classic, 2012).","[2] Thomas George, \"Fight of the Century: Muhammad Ali's Legacy Grows in Defeat,\" (AOL News, 2011).","[3] David Horowitz and Peter Carroll, <em>On the Edge: The United States Since 1945</em>, (Belmont: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2002).","[4] Stan Wilson, \"Muhammad Ali returns to the Olympic stage, once again, in London,\" (CNN, 2012).","[5] Sielski, \"Frazier battled Ali.”","[6] Ibid.","[7] Victor Navasky, “All Our Conflicts On Violence, Sex, Race And Money: The Fight,”(<em>The</em><em> New York Times</em>, March 14, 1971).","[8] Ibid."],"display_date":"March 8, 1971","search_date":"1971-03-08","locations":[{"id":36051,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":239,"tag":"Boxing"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5585,"title":"Morality and Birth Control- What Every Woman Should Know","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"2/1/18","end_date":"2/28/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","<em>Morality and Birth Control </em>by Margaret Sanger is a pamphlet written in 1918 questioning the morality of denying the knowledge of birth control to working class women. She compares the lack of education given to women at that time to the “shackles of slavery.” Sanger believes that birth control is the first step towards women’s freedom. She gives several examples of how not only women, but also society suffers by the current standards of morality."," ","First Sanger describes a working class family with six children. The father and mother work hard to keep their kids in school. Two years later she visits the same family only to find that they have had five more children! The three youngest were born with a disability, the two oldest girls were prostitutes, and three of the boys were in jail. The mother works outside of the home scrubbing floors and the father has become an abusive drunk. Sanger concludes that present day morality has caused this family to live as paupers."," ","Sanger points out the over-crowded tenements in which children sleep in the same rooms as parents and borders offer no privacy. She recalls a 26-year- old woman who died giving birth to her seventh child. Her oldest, a girl of ten, took over her mother’s duties, including keeping four male boarders. A few years later Sanger found the girl dying of syphilis. She blames society’s attitude of “Sacred Motherhood” for keeping young girls ignorant to basic knowledge and hygiene."," ","The last example she gives is of a large family in which the two oldest girls worked in the factory in order that the younger ones could go to school. One of the younger girls fell in love with a bum and had an illegitimate baby. She was shamed and ostracized. She left home with her child to work as a servant. Her baby eventually died. By this time her self-worth was so low that she became a prostitute."," ","Another sister fell in love with a respectable man. She also became pregnant without the benefit marriage. She was given sympathy and taken to a doctor to have the problem fixed. She returned to school and later became a principle and a respected woman. Sanger argues that the morality of the time forces women to be either celibate (which means neglecting her marital obligations to her husband) or to seek abortions."," ","Meanwhile wealthy women are given access to information about birth control. They are happy and healthy. They do not contribute to any of the social problems of the times. Sanger asks the reader to imagine what the country would be like if the wealthy were denied the knowledge of birth control, just as the working class has been. She concludes that if there is to be any morality, changes need to occur so that all women have the same control over their lives."," ","In 1913 Margaret Sanger worked as a nurse in New York’s Lower East Side where she witnessed first-hand the suffering of poor women from frequent births and self-induced abortions. One day she heard a doctor tell a woman who became sick after a home abortion to avoid pregnancy by “having her husband sleep on the roof”. Months later Sanger found the woman dead after another self-induced abortion. This inspired Sanger to devote her life to legalizing birth control and making it accessible to all women. Sanger believed that numerous and often unwanted pregnancies resulted not only in poor health for women but also in preventing economic freedom for both men and women of the working class. Poverty and large families went hand-in-hand. The stress of trying to feed, clothe, and educate so many children was a strain on the physical and mental health of the parents."," ","According to the Centers for Disease Control, six-nine of every 1000 women died in childbirth in 1900. Distributing information about contraception was illegal under the Comstock Laws passed by Congress in 1873. In 1916 Sanger challenged these laws by opening the first family planning clinic in New York. Although police closed the clinic, court proceedings led to doctors being given the right to hand out birth control information if medically warranted. Sanger established the American Birth Control League in 1921 in order to provide information and education on the prevention of pregnancy. This organization would later be known as Planned Parenthood Organization of America."," "],"display_date":"February 1918","search_date":"1918-02-14","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1524,"tag":"women's health"},{"id":1393,"tag":"Margaret Sanger"},{"id":481,"tag":"birth control"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":94,"school_id":43}},{"id":5586,"title":"\"US Declared Able to Wage Cold War\"","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"11/10/52","end_date":"11/10/52","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["How ready was the United States ready for the Cold War?

Nourse, a federal economist since 1946, viewed the Cold War as a substantial but manageable drain on America’s resources. May believed that as a super power, the USSR would be unable to wage a war of this scale for such a long period of time. Janeway viewed the Cold War as war that must be met, regardless of cost, so that the civilized world can prosper. As history can tell, the Cold War lasted substantially longer than the proposed decade. What was going on in 1952 that lead to this urgency and sense of duty instilled in the American people? The final months of 1952 saw the increase in paranoia through the rages of McCarthyism and the Korean War, mixed with the uncertainty regarding the newly elected president Eisenhower. The New York Times needed this article to reaffirm the populace that they had to remain vigilant and prepare for future economic woes. Yet, it made things blatantly obvious that the wars had to continue for the good of liberty. In this article, Nourse posed the question “Will people stand what ten more years of this kind of cold war involves?” However, the prevailing attitude of the time was that it all of these gripes <em>must </em>be met for the good of the nation.","The social climate in 1952 was rife with controversies, paranoia and uncertainty. A veracious Congress spurred on by Republican fear mongers like McCarthy and Nixon passed the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act over Truman’s veto, which made immigration more preferential and selective than ever. Partisan divisions became more and more entrenched as each party accused one another of communist affiliations. Republicans used the slogan “K1C2” (“Korea, Communism, Corruption) to describe the incumbent administration, while many Democrats openly denounced McCarthyism and radical anticommunist sentiments. This led to the landslide victory of Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 election, who agreed with Republican platforms like cleaning up Washington, but also quietly denouncing McCarthy’s allegations within his party. Many questions were being asked about the president elect. Republicans believed that concentration of power in Washington meant a greater communist influence, while Democrats believed in restraint in foreign policy. Eisenhower was above party lines and disputed planks of both parties, especially those regarding the continuation of the Korean War.","After the Chinese entered North Korea to protect their fellow communists, panic ensued over whether or not this would result in another World War. Had Truman not restrained MacArthur’s proposed counter-invasion of China, the possibility of a World War with nuclear arms seemed ever looming. By mid to late 1952, there was a stalemate at the thirty-eighth parallel. Talks of peace began between Communist and U.N. forces, but at the same time there were fierce hill battles and tactical bombings. The populace back home was torn between those who were terrified that one slip could spell doom for the world, and those who believed that America had a newfound duty to stamp out communism. The war drained the funds of the treasury, and the morale of the American people.","The article quotes Nourse as saying that a sustained state of military preparedness over a decade would optimistically cost about eight percent of the GDP, down from the current fourteen percent. However, in reality the cost percentage of GDP in the most expensive year of the war (1952) was 4.2 percent, making the cited eight percent only comprise less than two years of sustained warfare. These projections mirrored the simultaneous denial and horrified acceptance over the prospect of a long, drawn out Cold War that extended far past their wildest predictions.","Economist Eliot Janeway says in the New York Times article that the Cold War “must and can be met. For the cold war is war, and war assigns survival priority over economics.” From the perspective of many Americans, the Cold War was not treated as a long-term political crisis, but a threat to human life itself. The article also addresses a Mr. May, who proposed that the U.S. was “in a far stronger position to withstand increased economic strain than the Soviet bloc.” This is contradictory information, considering that the USSR showed an annual 3.6 percent GDP growth starting in 1945, and continuing well into the 1950s. It is possible that May made this statement out of ignorance or optimism: ignorance due to the Soviet Union’s secrecy regarding economic status may have been closely guarded, and optimism due to the uneasy and tentative political-economic state of the United States at the time.","The Cold War was probably the most heated diplomatic crisis in world history. This article goes on to prove this fact by showing how divided the country was during the early years of the crisis. The stances of the three economists- Nourse, Janeway, and May- embodied not just the possible economic approaches to a continued Cold War, but also the three main ideological stances of the American people themselves: the skepticism of the United States’ ability to wage a Cold War on this continued scale, as addressed by Nourse, the belief in the States’ illusory economic superiority, as addressed by May, and the belief in fighting as a means of self-preservation with the human race at stake, as addressed by Janeway. With controversies like the 1952 election, the war in Korea, and the ensuing economic panic were only three ways to show that the stances of the American people were as diverse as its inhabitants."," "],"display_date":"November 10, 1952","search_date":"1952-11-10","locations":[{"id":28501,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":1525,"tag":"Red Scare"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5602,"title":"\"Why They Become Communists\" By Elizabeth Janeway","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"6/14/53","end_date":"6/14/53","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["What was the seductive and driving force of communism? An article published in the New York Times on June 14, 1953 sought to answer this question. Elizabeth Janeway’s “Why They Become Communists: Americans seeking an effective answer to communism’s internal danger must first be aware of its influence,” was the entire title of the article and resolved to serve as an indicator as to why and how American citizens could fall victim to the ideology of the Red Menace. The first half of this article revolved around two former communist converts and their acceptance and cooperation with the Soviet Union: the infamous atomic spy Klaus Fuchs and the prolific English poet Stephen Spender. The second half detailed the steps to be taken to recognize and avoid communist influence. These two halves came together to form a typical, yet intellectual Red Scare era article that promoted concern, but discretion, and alertness, but awareness. This was an important statement during a time when Americans believed that communism was the antithesis of freedom and independent thinking.","The summer of 1953 was the height of the Red Scare in America. Fear mongers like Joseph McCarthy accused everyone from Hollywood actors to government officials of communist affiliation of varying degrees. The Korean War was at a tentative truce, but the Eisenhower administration was staging covert action all around the globe to “contain” the communist threat. For Janeway, the communist threat at home was more important due to Eisenhower’s public and determined efforts to stamp out communism abroad. In the article, she first delves into the psychology and mental state of the typical communist using two highly publicized examples: Fuchs and Spender.","At this time, German expatriate and nuclear physicist Emil Klaus Julius Fuchs was imprisoned in England on a fifteen-year sentence for giving highly classified research on the Manhattan Project to former ally Russia during the war. Janeway described in her article that Fuchs was drawn to communism out of “some kind of explanation for the horror and confusion which had invaded his world.”According to her, communism fit Fuchs because he was mentally unstable and communism offered him a new perspective on reality; this granted some sense of purpose and direction that adherents to capitalism just could not understand. Even though Fuchs was incredibly intelligent and instrumental in developing and patenting the implosion trigger for the first atomic bomb, Janeway wrote off his affiliation to the communist party as a reaction to his difficult life and genetic history of mental illness. Up until Fuchs’ death in 1988, he still believed that the power of the atomic bomb had to be shared between the two great powers as a gesture of trust and mutual respect. Thanks, in no small part, to his deeds Russia was able to develop atomic ordinance by 1949.","Janeway’s other example of a repentant communist convert was Stephen Spender, the English poet. She likens his experiences to that of an outsider looking in, which was indeed the truth. While never conforming to NATO capitalism, Spender was also not a true believer in communism. From being exposed to intellectuals from Cambridge and Oxford during the 1930s, Spender was subject to socialist ideals that made him interested in the communist party. Cambridge in particular was infamous for the Cambridge Five: five Cambridge graduates who fed secrets to the Soviets from the 1930s to 1960s. Undoubtedly, Spender would have known, or at least heard about, these men; this may have affected his decision to leave the party. Janeway again used the concept of a struggling man desperately turning to communism for him to make sense of a terrifying and confusing world. She states in the article that communists “cling to the…structure of unreality” in order to become part of a larger being than themselves. She said that Spender was able to break from the allure of communism because he was able to recognize the absurdity and clandestinity of Soviet communism.","Janeway’s argument for the education of the American populace against the allure of communism started with the minds and mindsets of two ex communists. The first was Klaus Fuchs, a strong believer in communism and a devotee until his death in 1988. The second was Stephen Spender, the British poet who only joined for a look into another perspective separate from capitalism. This article then describes the measures to take in order to not end up like these men. Janeway dives deep into the supposed psyches of communists to find them deeply disturbed and enthralled with the concept of unity and service to Moscow. She describes one of the central tenants of communism as the duty to spread its influence across the world. In order to do so, communism must take seductive forms that must be recognized and avoided by the American people. Contrary to the stance of fear mongers like McCarthy and Vice President Richard Nixon, Janeway called for discretion and the ability to discern liberalism from communism. She feared that blatant hatred and paranoia would fracture and divide the American people. Then, Soviet influences could sneak in and turn policy towards Moscow’s favor. Whether or not this was indeed the case, this pragmatic approach towards communist influence – as popularized by Dwight Eisenhower - was provocative in a time where polarization of the populace was the basis of the majority of the 1952 presidential election. It also served as an incredibly powerful social influence. In a small, curious addendum at the very end of the article, Janeway stated that America must not only be vigilant against communism, but also actively express a global attitude and demeanor to which all the other nations of the world could aspire.","Janeway’s “Why They Become Communist” is an interesting look into the hearts and minds of ex-communists while simultaneously shedding light on the situation of communist insurgency and how to prevent it. With the inclusion of admitted ex-communists Klaus Fuchs and Stephen Spender, Janeway painted a picture of a self-destructive and all-consuming ideology that catered exclusively to the mentally unstable. She then explained why the ability to keep a cool head in the face of the nefarious structure of communism was paramount in maintaining national security. “Why They Become Communist” is a look into the more levelheaded approach to the Red Scare and an intellectual attempt to rationalize the seductive nature of communism."],"display_date":"June 14, 1953","search_date":"1953-06-14","locations":[{"id":28501,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1525,"tag":"Red Scare"},{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5608,"title":"\"Bill and the Water Wagon\"","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/20","end_date":"12/31/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the Second Industrial Revolution in the United States, the consumption of alcohol became very popular, especially by men before and after work.  In thirty years, from 1870 to 1900, the number of bars in the nation grew from 30,000 to 100,000.  Since the late 19th century, years before Prohibition went into effect, moral reformers saw alcohol consumption as a problem and pushed constantly for Prohibition laws to be passed at the local, state, and federal levels.  Finally, in 1920 a Prohibition law (the 18th Amendment) passed Congress making the manufacture, transportation, and the sale of liquor illegal.  There were many people that were against Prohibition because people enjoyed their time at the bar and many men enjoyed their few glasses of alcohol daily.  One group of people that did support Prohibition was factory owners.  Factory owners supported Prohibition because they thought it would increase how effective their workers were and help them prevent factory related accidents and injuries.[1]  In addition to factory owners being in favor of Prohibition, many women were also in favor of Prohibition mainly because alcohol consumption often encourages men to talk in a derogatory way to their families, beat their wives, and spend money unnecessarily.[2]"," ","Bar owners were definitely against Prohibition because that is how they earned their money and made a living.  Since many men went to the bar several times a day throughout the week they spent a nice part of their hard earned money on alcohol, but since many blue-collar workers earned low wages, this could impact a family financially over the years without being noticed.  Bar owners made a decent living, while the working class man could not move forward in life financially.  Bar owners purchased nice clothing, jewelry, and could even afford an automobile while the men at the bar could not give their family nice clothes."," ","In a 1914 article “Bill and the Water Wagon,” Bill is asked if he is “wet” or “dry,” meaning if he would vote for or against Prohibition.  He replies that he is “wet.”  When Bill sees a sign advertising Budweiser with a slogan “Budweiser is a good friend of mine,” he starts to think about whether Budweiser really had been his friend?  After thinking for a while, Bill realizes that neither Budweiser nor any other type of alcohol is his friend.  Bill concludes that by going to the bar for a couple drinks before work in the morning, going in the afternoon for one or two more, and then going in the evening to have anywhere from one to three drinks he gives a lot of his money away to the bar owner.  Bill calculates that he has spent $1,859.22 in ten years at his local bar.  He spent this money making the bar owner rich while his wife and children did not have anything nice to wear or a nice home to live in.  Bill realizes he can put his money to better use by caring for his family rather than supporting the bar owner and his wife.  Bill begins to think that maybe Prohibition isn’t such a bad thing. [3]"," ","“Bill and the Water Wagon” was published in 1914 to show people in the United States the downside to alcohol consumption and promote Prohibition to those who were on the fence about banning alcohol.  The author of this article, M.H.P., wanted to show readers the negative side to alcohol consumption and the financial benefit of being on the “water wagon.”  Being on the water wagon symbolizes people drinking water rather than drinking alcohol.  This article really shows readers the benefits of Prohibition and how much their families could benefit from it they voted “dry.”  Readers would have had to consider the amount of money they were spending on alcohol and possibly rethink their priorities in life."," ","Though the 18th Amendment banning alcohol production and sales was overturned by the 21st Amendment in 1933, a short thirteen years after it was passed by Congress, it did seem that Prohibition held the potential to better the lives of many people.  While rich people did not have to worry about watching their dollars, working-class people like Bill did, and, for moral reformers, keeping people away from alcohol seemed like a way to help keep everyone out of trouble.  Ultimately, President Franklin Roosevelt, who won the election in 1932, opposed Prohibition, because he felt taxing alcohol production would help raise money for the government and he also saw alcohol production as a way to help the American economy get back on its feet and to put people back to work during the Great Depression.  Ultimately alcohol could be a good thing for the United States economy, but if not used in moderation by each individual man it could ruin his finances and his relationship with his family."," ","[1] “Prohibition”","[2] “A Look at Prohibition, Hardly Dry”","[3] “BILL, and the Water Wagon”"],"display_date":"1920 - 1932","search_date":"1926-07-02","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":1563,"tag":"18th Amendment"},{"id":1564,"tag":"Bill and the Water Wagon"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":94,"school_id":43}},{"id":5667,"title":"Agricultural Labour-The Secret Jobs Done by Children-A look into the secretive world of hiring children as child labourers during the Great Depression.","course_id":104,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/30","end_date":"12/31/38","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Agricultural Labour-The Secret Jobs Done by Children"," ","Industrial child labour was a very important issue in New York and the Southern part of America during the 1930s, but a large number of children also worked in agricultural farms for wages. There was no means to end this and it was a largely unknown issue at the time (Feld, 2). Feld’s article described New York citizens in 1935 fighting for more child labour amendments to be included in New York Legislature of 1921 for children working in sweatshops and industries (1). From 1921 to 1935, only few changes to the amendments regarding child labour were made, including the minimum age for a child to work, which was 16, by President Roosevelt (Feld, 1). Child labour was seen as a fairly cheap source of labour and many adults competed with children in New York for work. This was especially evident from 1928 until 1935 as the Great Depression hit, a result of the crashing stock markets. Subsequently many families grew poor and, “children found work while their elders waited for relief in bread lines”, (Feld, 2). Financially, children supported the families while their care-givers waited for food to feed their families.","Though many people believed child labour did not occur in the factories following the 1925 child labour amendments, children worked in farms as labourers as, “the laws did not apply to the fields”, (Feld, 3). In the census of 1930, two million children aged 10-18 still worked and 700,000 were under the age of 15. Most worked in the agricultural sector during summer vacation (Feld, 4). Federal surveys said children worked twelve hour shifts on tobacco, beet and, cotton plantations, all over the country (Feld, 3). One specific type of child intensive labour was when children worked on their parent’s farm (Feld, 5). Parents could use their children’s work for their own benefit and there was no legal way of limiting the hours children worked, nor regulation for their safety. As a result of fluctuating market prices for the crops of farmers, Feld states that farmers’ only sure economic strategies were, “their own labour and that of their children”,(Feld, 2). Using a lot of child labour was one way that a farmer could survive economically due to the unstable markets. This was very true about the tobacco fields as tobacco was, ``fashionable``, (Young and Young, 51)  and used children as young as five years old to pick the best, lowest leaves and de-worm crops (Feld, 6).","This article aimed at showing the significance of a largely unknown American condition of working children under the age of sixteen in farms. Many adults were in competition with the children because employers knew, ``children are a cheap form of labour without demands``, (Hindman, 71). Especially during the Great Depression, children were, ``willing to work long hours, as a way of cutting costs``, (Hobbes, McKechnie, et al, 191), and compete with adult workers until the 1940s (Nanjuda, 23). Working children took on the role of adults and were a main source of income for their families. Finally, “technological improvements in agriculture can never keep up with technological improvements in technology”, (Feld, 3). Much faster, easy labour was provided by children but that was no match for machine power in relation to industries."," "," "," "," "," ","Works Cited","Feld, Rose, “America’s Vast Army of Child Workers.” <em>New York Times</em> (2013): 18-19."," ","March 24, 1935, Accessed February 5, 2013."," ","http://search.proquest.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/101577232/13C81D7A"," ","5E05BEAFEEC/1?accountid=14771"," ","Hindman, Hugh<em> .Child Labour an American History</em>.

One of these woman was author Betty Friedan who through her writings changed the way we view equality.","On February 19, 1963, Betty Friedan started the “second wave feminism” movement with her book The Feminine Mystique. The Feminine Mystique was a book that encouraged women to seek new roles and responsibilities, and to seek identity both personally and in the workplace. Soon after it’s inception The Feminine Mystique was a pivotal point in the fight for women's rights. “Chosen motherhood is the real liberation. The choice to have a child makes the whole experience of motherhood different, and the choice to be generative in other ways can at last be made, and is being made by many women now, without guilt.” Friedan’s book finally made it possible for woman to work outside of the house and at real jobs. Three years after Friedan’s book, in 1966, 28 woman including Betty Friedan herself established the National Organization for Women. Since then NOW has been responsible for many of the major changes to the equality of women, Including the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. “Through more than five decades of activism, Friedan showed the ability not only to formulate feminist theory but also to develop her thinking response to social and cultural change. This has made her one of the most significant political and intellectual leaders in the 20th-century feminism.” This quote from the Encyclopedia of Women and American Politics by Lynne Ford shows the impact that Friedan had on the second wave feminist movement and how she changed the world for all women."," "],"display_date":1960,"search_date":"1960-07-01","locations":[{"id":32057,"lat":39.4750359792,"lng":-74.3341472584,"zoom":9,"place":"Atlantic, New Jersey"},{"id":31817,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"},{"id":31603,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1760,"tag":"Gender Roles"},{"id":1759,"tag":"Girl Power"},{"id":1758,"tag":"Gender"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":1604,"tag":"Female"},{"id":617,"tag":"Feminism"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":5755,"title":"Strong Female Characters in Depression Era Media","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/20","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Great Depression provided a hotbed of motivation that led to a dramatic change in the status quo of gender roles.

She was a sly and capable foe, and at the advent of World War II, led the resistance against Japan’s invasion of China. She is shown to be an equal match for Terry on numerous occasions. This portrayal of a competent, attractive female antagonist was revolutionary for the time. It is also worth noting that the Dragon Lady was not only a woman, but also ethnic, being Asian. Caniff’s comic contained several other strong, female characters, but none were quite as influential as her. This can clearly be seen today where the term “dragon lady” refers to a negative stereotype of strong or mysterious women of East Asian descent."," "],"display_date":"1920 - 1945","search_date":"1932-12-31","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":1158,"tag":"Great Depression"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":788,"tag":"Sexism"},{"id":617,"tag":"Feminism"},{"id":1774,"tag":"Milton Caniff"},{"id":1775,"tag":"Comics"},{"id":1776,"tag":"Dragon Lady"},{"id":1777,"tag":"Cartoonist"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":5763,"title":"Harlem Renaissance: A cultural battle for equality","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"9/19/26","end_date":"9/19/26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A new movement rose in the 1920s as African American Jazz began to sweep the nation. Marking an influential Harlem Renaissance, this “New Negro Movement” resembling an outburst of African American culture included literature, music, and art.  The new jazz that rose during this period challenged conventional white music by emphasizing the need for more culturally inherent music; it asserted the emergence of the “New Negro”[1], one that would attempt to revive culture and make it significant to the African-American race, creating their own identity.  On a deeper level it challenged de jure segregation that began with the Jim Crow laws[2], laws that would cause them to express themselves culturally, rebelling against the mainstream.  This resistance towards the mainstream would increase significantly after the wartime period where they experienced more freedom from the French than their own country causing them to turn towards literature and the arts, to argue that the mainstream should begin to take them more seriously.","Zora Neale Hurtson’s iconic book <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> was a landmark for African American women featuring a title character who broke society norms by choosing an independent lifestyle where she became very active in finding a partner and crafting her own identity.  Her race and her gender does not stop Janie Crawford from achieving an established role in a 1930s environment that attempted to oppress African American women. African Americans were struggling to achieve their own national identity, one example of this struggle was distinguishing Negro music with American Jazz.  The misconception was that they were the same but African Americans in 1926 gave key notes on why this was inaccurate.  Like African tribes and commu­­nities, the music of the Negro was one that relied on group effort, “no one sings just one part.”[3] Instead, they have emphasized creating their own system of orchestrating music that differs from American processes. This group effort would foreshadow African American’s attempt to separate from mainstream society in the 1960s, creating their own racial community through groups like the Black power.[4]"," ","[1] Harriss, M.

This migration became known as “The Yellow Peril.” The Chinese Exclusion Act and the Immigration Act of 1924 both halted the growth and development of the existing Asian minority groups present in the US.[1] This anti-Asian sentiment became more focused at the advent of World War II, and was distilled and directed toward the Japanese. Propaganda ensued and, three months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese internment commenced. All Japanese-Americans and anyone of Japanese descent on the west coast of the US were herded into internment camps or forced to leave their homes. At this time the Japanese were depicted and thought of as sub-human and deceitful. [2]","This Anti-Japanese meme shifted the focal point of Asian hatred onto the Japanese, and popular media depictions of other Asians, particularly the Chinese, became less negative.[3] The Chinese were also being invaded by the Imperial Japanese military. This common enemy led some Americans to believe the US should not only combat Japan, but assist China in doing so. While the US never sent direct military support to China, they began airlifting supplies to the Chinese in an attempt to relieve some military pressure. The American dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan led to their complete surrender, and simultaneously ended the second Sino-Japanese War.","The changing attitudes towards Asians can be seen in popular media of the era, such as the cartoon strips of Milton Caniff.

New York City resident Oscar England had been without sight his entire life and died earlier that day apparently due to trusting too highly in his ‘eerie’ (the <em>Globe and Mail</em> reporter implied) innate ability to know where he stood in relation to his surroundings(“Blind” 14). The<em> Globe and Mail</em> reporter professed that England’s ability had proven dependable for nearly three and a half decades, and turned out to be especially useful during a nearly decade-long period of frequent subway travel (“Blind” 14). England required no accompaniment whether navigating New York City’s packed walkways or confusing mazelike subway terminals (“Blind” 14). This talent allowed England to precisely discern the distance and way needed to reach various destinations, such as different underground trains… until December (“Blind” 14). On that date, England overestimated the distance to the boarding zone and tumbled down onto the tracks, directly in the path of a train that steadily drew nearer (“Blind” 14). It took close to sixty minutes for an accident response teamto extricate England’s remains out from the middle of the solid platform and the subway cars (“Blind” 14).","England’s death (perhaps ironically) occurred shortly after the initial introduction of United States government aid towards individuals with disabilities (“Blind” 14) (Shriner 480). Parties, ranging from relatives of individuals with disabilities, to state bureaucrats, to a team involving a mental health patient and a medical professional, founded prominent mental and physical disability societies early on, in 1909 and 1927, and as late as 1950 (Shriner 480). The aforementioned societies officially identified with, or complimented efforts by, the American government (Shriner 480).","Some of this increased American state disability-assistance specifically benefitted the blind (Shriner 480-481). Since the year 1920, state-run workforce-rehabilitation agencies were directed towards individuals with disabilities (Shriner 484). However, these rehabilitation agencies initially displayed an inability to adequately meet the requirements of individuals without sight (Shriner 482). The resulting early-1940’s Barden-LaFollette Vocational Rehabilitation Act (BLVRA) allowed government-run blind-assistance-organizations to operate blind-individual-specific sections within government rehabilitation agencies (Shriner 482). The BLVRA addressed the aforementioned limitation of the rehabilitation agencies, but also had an overarching purpose of tapping into a hitherto-unexploited potential labour force (visually-impaired individuals) (Shriner 482). Also in the early-1940’s, blind-individual advocacy groups made government officials aware that proposed tax rate modifications, if implemented, would disadvantage the blind citizenry to a greater extent than the non-blind (Shriner 483). The United States Congress thus decided to allow a set amount of blind individuals’ costs to be exempted (Shriner 483). Earlier on, in a somewhat ‘eerie’ coincidence (as the <em>Globe and Mail</em> reporter implied about England’s ability the same year), 1936 saw the advent of the Randolph-Sheppard Act (Shriner 481) (“Blind” 14). The Randolph-Sheppard Act ultimately allowed blind persons a near-total monopoly over holding positions as merchants in federal government structures (Shriner 481-482)."],"display_date":"October 1936","search_date":"1936-10-16","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1812,"tag":"blind"},{"id":1811,"tag":"disability support"},{"id":1810,"tag":"disability"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":117,"school_id":28}},{"id":5778,"title":"\"Comstockery in America\", <em>The Woman Rebel</em> - by Margaret Sanger","course_id":114,"status":"P","start_date":"7/1/15","end_date":"7/31/15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","In 1914, Margaret Sanger fought for women and their right to have control over their own bodies. She was shocked that working-class women were unable to obtain safe and effective birth control. Sanger began providing them with the information and the knowledge to have a say regarding what they would do with their bodies in and out of marriage; the right to decide if they would become a mother or not, and the right to prevent conception if they wished. During this time she published a monthly newspaper titled <em>The Woman Rebel</em> for working-class women where she openly discussed many of these topics with her readers. This was the first publication of its kind in America, and many topics the newspaper discussed were touchy subjects that U.S. postal authorities and Anthony Comstock , U.S. Post Office Inspector, called obscene. Many of her publications advocated the use of contraception and for that reason three issues of <em>The Women Rebel</em> were banned from the mail. In August of 1914, Margaret Sanger was indicted for further publication of newspapers and, not wanting to go to prison, she fled the country under a false identity. While out of the country, she had friends release 100,000 copies of a 16-page pamphlet she had written with instructions on the use of various contraceptive methods entitled “Family Limitations.” This infuriated Anthony Comstock, who went on the hunt to bring Margaret Sanger to justice.","Anthony Comstock was a powerful American reformer who led a fight against what he viewed as obscene material in literature and other publications. The term “Comstockery” was born in regard to his war against stopping this type of material from being shared amongst Americans via the U.S. mail. In 1873, he successfully lobbied Congress for a ban on mailing obscene or inappropriate material. This act became known as the Comstock Laws of 1873. During that time he served as a special agent or inspector for the U.S. Post Office and founded the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. He devoted his life to fighting against what he felt was obscene material, which included attacking Margaret Sanger and her newspaper. He would not rest until she was brought to trial for her writings in the paper.","In July 1915, Margaret Sanger was indicted under the Comstock Law for her discussions regarding birth control in <em>The Woman Rebel</em>. During this time she responded to the Comstock Laws in her paper in an article titled “Comstockery in America.” She writes that Europeans are laughing at Americans in regard to this Comstockery in America.  The young women of Europe look up to Americans for their freedom and opportunities, Sanger argues, but are saddened when they learn that American women have to fight for their right to have a say in what they will and will not do with their own bodies. Margaret Sanger informs her readers that in order to fight Comstockery, they must know who and what is behind it. She assures her readers that the purpose of the paper is to make the working-class woman aware of their rights. To give them knowledge to know what great power they have over what they chose to do with their own body. She states how it is the working-class woman that is suffering because she does not have access to the knowledge and resources like women of wealth. Margaret Sanger says the working-class women are the ones who are having the big families and who fill the death lists from abortions. She states that she will defy the law and not hide behind the walls, but continue to fight for the working-class women. She will continue to provide them with the knowledge and information they deserve. She asks Americans to join her in her fight against the Comstock Laws and to realize they deserve to know their rights. She believes Comstockery must die and education on the methods to prevent conception must continue.","Margaret Sanger continued to fight for women’s rights regarding birth control and in 1921 she started a campaign based on education and publicity which was aimed to win mainstream support for birth control by opening the American Birth Control League. Her efforts helped the movement gain the support of medical professionals and social workers. Possibly her biggest contribution, and what she is best known for today, is her role in the Birth Control Federation of America in 1939, which was later renamed Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Sanger, until her death in 1966, continued to fight for what she had always wanted for the women of American; less costly and more effective birth control."],"display_date":"July 1915","search_date":"1915-07-16","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1819,"tag":"The Woman Rebel"},{"id":1818,"tag":"Anthony Comstock"},{"id":481,"tag":"birth control"},{"id":535,"tag":"Comstock Law"},{"id":1393,"tag":"Margaret Sanger"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":5790,"title":"Women, Automobiles, and Advertisements.","course_id":114,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/20","end_date":"12/31/29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","“Motoring can ruin the finest skin,” the Pond’s advertisement boasts. Beauty products and motor vehicles may not seem to go hand in hand, but the ever changing cultural landscape of the 1920s saw many companies addressing the needs of the new age woman. In 1920 Pond’s published their advertisement in the <em>New York American Sun </em>newspaper; the product was a vanishing cream that, the company promised, could protect from sunburn and pore clogging dust. It also offered a cold cream which could help cleanse the skin after “a long motor trip.” This advertisement clipping highlights the trend of women who enjoyed “motoring.”","When automobiles were first created, many saw them as a luxury. By the early, 1920s the moving assembly line gave way to true mass production, which, in turn, created lower prices for automobiles. Vehicles were no longer seen as luxuries or toys for vehicle enthusiasts. Although vehicle registrations increased from 8.1 million in 1920 to 23 million in the late 1920s, motoring was still considered a manly sport. Motor cars were seen as a piece of masculinity that was both difficult and dirty to drive. Yet, many women sought driving as an act of independence and ignored naysayers who believed that women were incapable of learning how to operate a vehicle.","Famous women like Edith Wharton, Gertrude Stein, and Rose Wilder Lane publicized their use of the vehicle, inspiring housewives all over the country to do the same. The Suffragette Movement also pushed women to gain independence from their husbands and fathers. Women who lived in urban areas where roads were paved and petrol stations were readily available began owning and driving vehicles. In the country, wives of farmers used the automobile as a way to shop in nearby towns, run errands, take care of farm business, and visit with friends.","The push for the woman’s suffrage amendment and World War I made women a primary consumer. During the war many women became the sole providers in their households, when their men returned many continued their lives in the workforce which created disposable income. With the new trend of female drivers and workers many companies found new ways to market to them. Despite women no longer being seen as simply housewives, advertisers still kept up the “housewife” image. Ads did not promote women’s political and economic status, but focused on their social status instead. There were two ideas behind marketing campaigns centered on automobiles in the 1920s: (1) women were only concerned with the aesthetic quality of the vehicle they drove and (2) they were concerned with their appearance while driving.","Advertisers were not above pushing the image that women placed a higher importance on their personal style and appearance than other aspects of life. It was believed that women spent time choosing gowns, hats and shoes that complimented her driving habits and did not pay much attention to the mechanics of motoring. Pond’s understood that while many women enjoyed their newfound independence they did not stop subscribing to “Victorian” social mores, which instructed women to remain classy, elegant and fashionable at all times. If their skin was damaged by the sun, dust and wind it would ruin their flawless image. A woman who used Pond’s beauty products would be able to have the best of both worlds; freedom and youthful beauty."],"display_date":"1920 - 1929","search_date":"1924-12-31","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1544,"tag":"automobile"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":730,"tag":"Advertising"},{"id":1833,"tag":"Pond's Extract Co."}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":5805,"title":"When America was engaged in War War 1 a national creed was written in order to movtivate Amerian people to stay loyal to thier country.","course_id":114,"status":"P","start_date":"4/3/18","end_date":"4/3/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the 1910s, as war raged in Europe, America prided itself for remaining a neutral country. For three years President Wilson tried to keep America out of the overseas conflict. However, by 1917 President Wilson no longer felt that the U.S. could remain neutral due to attacks against American shipping and threats to the nation’s security. As the nation entered the conflict, patriotic activities and rhetoric became more popular. This show of patriotism was shown in many different ways, such as through songs like “Over there” by George M. Cohan. An even bigger show of patriotism took place when the New York State Commissioner of Education, Henry Sterling Chapin came up with the idea of creating a national creed. A creed is a system of principles or beliefs that is usually accepted by that group. The national creed would summarize America’s political faith by drawing from fundamental elements of American history and tradition. A nationwide writing contest was launched to find who could best put the national creed into words. The end result was what gave birth to the American Creed:","“I believe in the United States of America as a government of the people, by the people, for the people; whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed, a democracy in a republic, a sovereign Nation of many sovereign States; a perfect union, one and inseparable; established upon those principles of freedom, equality, justice, and humanity for which American patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes.","I therefore believe it is my duty to my country to love it, to support its Constitution, to obey its laws, to respect its flag, and to defend it against all enemies.","-William Tyler Page"," ","More than three thousand entries were submitted. The winner, William Tyler Page, was from Friendship Heights, Maryland. At the young age of thirteen, Page had served as a U.S. Capitol page in Washington. He then went on to serve as an employee of the Capitol building for almost sixty-one years. Winning a contest that shows patriotism probably came naturally for Page since he came from family deeply rooted in American politics. In 1650, one of his descendants arrived in America, and later settled in Williamsburg, Virginia. From 1789-1797 Congressman John Page served in the House of Representative. Page was also related to Carter Braxton, who signed the Declaration of Independence. The tenth president of the United States, John Tyler is another one of William Tyler Page ancestors.","America was a nation of immigrants that was engaged in a war against some of the counties from which many of the immigrants or their descendants originated. Some feared that this could cause conflicts and divide the American people. The American Creed reminds people to give power and support to the U.S. government and any challenges it will face in the future. The creed also reminds people to uphold their duties to the government in the land in which they now reside.","It was just a little over a year after the start of World War 1 when the National Creed of America was approved by the speaker of the House of Representatives and the commissioner of education of the state of New York. On April 3, 1918 in the House of Representatives Office Building the mayor of Baltimore James H. Preston presented the award to Page. The <em>Congressional Record</em> printed the proceedings that were related with the award on April 13, 1918. A year after the Creed was adopted by Congress, Page was elected clerk of the House. Thirteen years later, when the Democrats were the majority party, they created the office of minority clerk of the House of Representatives for Page. He held that position for the rest of his life.","At a time when patriotic sentiments were very important, the American Creed was the perfect compliment. Page’s short statement drew on American history and tradition to remind people what they were fighting for in 1918 and encourage them to give all to their country."," "," ","Sources:","Copyright ©1995-2013 by the Independence Hall Association","This Page Established on 20 November, 1994","Copyright © 1999-2012 by HomeOfHeroes.com"," "],"display_date":"April 3, 1918","search_date":"1918-04-03","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1858,"tag":"America's Creed"},{"id":1859,"tag":"World War 1"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":6075,"title":"Family of Andrew Goodman Spoke at News Conference","course_id":123,"status":"P","start_date":"8/6/64","end_date":"8/6/64","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 06, 1964, <em>The New York Times</em> reported an expression of “grief and hope” by Andrew Goodman’s family to the public at a news conference. Andrew Goodman, the dead civil rights worker killed near Philadelphia, Mississippi, had been working on a voter registration drive in Meridan, Mississippi. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Goodman, ensured the public their pain, although personal, belonged to the entire nation. Despite the death of Andrew and the other two civil right workers, the Goodmans remained adamant the three young men “shall not have died in vain[; the] struggle for equality…shall continue” and not end with the slaying of civil rights activists Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael “Mickey” Schwerner.","The three civil rights activists were a part of the Mississippi Freedom Project under CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) which prepared and encouraged men and women to vote in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. Among those opposing the Freedom Project was the Ku Klux Klan, who had approximately 750 members in Mississippi by the 1960s. The prominent presence of the Ku Klux Klan in the state of Mississippi fostered an environment of intimidation in almost every political office and allowed the extremist group to use fear tactics to prevent minorities, such as African Americans, from voting. Schwerner and Goodman, both twenty-one year old, Jewish men from New York City met at the Mississippi Freedom Project training session. Chaney, a twenty-year old African American and Mississippi native brought local knowledge to the team including his navigating skills needed for the back roads of the Magnolia State.","Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner had ridden out on the June 16to investigate the arson against the Freedom School, at Mt. Zion. Shortly afterwards they were arrested on the June 21 for a traffic violation and held until the fine of $20 was paid. Klansmen, working in cooperation with some local police stopped the car, and killed the three men. They burned the vehicle and dumped it in a swamp, and buried their bodies in dam. No one was charged for the murder for the three activists, although nineteen men, including the sheriff and deputy sheriff, from the Lauderdale and Neshoba Counties of Mississippi were arrested for “depriving the three [murdered] victims of their civil rights,” in 1967 according to writer Bill Scheppler.","The news conference held by the Goodman family reinforced the philanthropic behavior the civil rights activists pursued in Meridian, Mississippi. With the loss of these young men, the Goodman family voiced hopes of, personally, continuing their son’s civil rights duties. James Farmer, the national director of the CORE released in the news conference that a drive headed by Jackie Robinson, former baseball player, would collect funds for the Schwerner-Chaney-Goodman Memorial Community Center in Meridian. The openness of the Goodman family created a spirit of resilience in the nation during a time of mourning for the African American community.

Rockefeller were all keeping mankind in an eternal enslavement, by “…perpetuating poverty and disease, maintaining crime and corruption...”  Relentlessly fighting for the meager existence they have, and being degraded at every chance, these people deserved more and should demand more.  Emma Goldman writes that the only way for man to reclaim his life and freedom is to “emancipate himself from the sacredness of property, the respect for man-made law, the fear of the Church, the cowardice of public opinion, the stupid arrogance of national, racial, religious, and sex superiority, and from the narrow puritanical conception of human life.”  She supported the anarchist cause whole-heartedly.  Goldman believed that everyone would benefit if land were no longer privatized and the population were allowed to perform, work, and live with equal opportunities to succeed.","Emma Goldman’s call for a revolt may have been heard by a group of immigrant Jewish women who slaved away as poorly paid unskilled laborers in New York’s shirtwaist factories.  The Uprising of Twenty Thousand lasted over 11 weeks and began November 23, 1909.  These immigrant women rebelled against the repressive regime of the factory.  Women were often kept in the lowest paid jobs within the factories, while men were able to obtain employment as supervisors and other higher paid jobs.  This rebellion came after years of mounting abuses by factories, the wealthy, and the government against immigrants and the poor.  Factory owners hired brutes to beat, threaten, and intimidate picketers.  Law enforcement was also quick to jail and fine over 700 women.","This period of time had little to no rules about workplace safety.  Many women worked long hours in deplorable conditions, like the practice of packing as many women as possible into the factory, often with poor ventilation.  They received barely livable wages ranging from $3-12 a week depending on skill level, with little opportunity of promotion.  The government did not offer protection to employees from their employers.  Courts often ruled with the business over employee’s grievances about work hours, safety, and work conditions.  Strikes were frequently the only way to have complaints taken seriously and addressed.  The conclusion of the Uprising of Twenty Thousand allowed workers a 52 hour work week, 4 paid holidays annually, and the negotiation of wages.  Emma Goldman told her followers that when an institution no longer works to serve the needs of the people, it is their duty to rise up and challenge that institution.  The women’s revolt accomplished much and as a result, forced the changes they desired and desperately needed."],"display_date":"July 1909","search_date":"1909-07-16","locations":[{"id":49732,"lat":40.5980855538,"lng":-73.8693155342,"zoom":10,"place":"Queens, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2484,"tag":"Emma Goldman, factories"},{"id":2483,"tag":"women, revolt, immigrants"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":125,"school_id":69}},{"id":6239,"title":"Eleanor Roosevelt and Character Building","course_id":125,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/31","end_date":"6/30/31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Eleanor Roosevelt wrote an editorial titled, “Building Character,” in 1931 informing parents how to discipline their children properly. She argued that discipline was the best way to build character. Children’s ability to reason in society comes from the parents’ enforcement of obedience. Her argument suggests parents are responsible for their child’s development; therefore, they must help build confidence, structure, and self-control through a variety of disciplinary actions. She suggests, “a generation ago it was the custom to feel that a child should be made to obey without understanding; nowadays we feel that prohibitions are useless—there are too many means of getting away from authority these days . . .”[1] Roosevelt had a new outlook on children. They were the future workers and decisions makers of the United States, so she believed parents should take responsibility for cultivating their children’s character.","Roosevelt was most commonly known for her dedication to political movements and rights for women and for bringing women into press conference meetings and other political contexts.  But she was lesser known for advocating for successful child rearing. Her drive to focus on child rearing stemmed from the economic crash. The Great Depression had negative and long lasting effects on jobs and trade. American men and women experienced many hardships of the recession, taking drastic pay cuts and resorting to volunteer work. Roosevelt knew that strong citizens working in a struggling environment could have a positive effect on the economy; so delving into the effectiveness of childhood development would change the outcome of the economical downturn. By instilling hard work and motivation into youthful minds, children growing up in the Great Depression would become stronger adults.","Along with changing children's behavior, Roosevelt also called for the improvement of the parents' behavior: “She encouraged parents to maintain a distance between themselves and their children and advised them to exercise control over their own emotions and act calmly and reasonably in all circumstances surrounding childhood development.” [2] Maintaining proper conduct was a challenge for parents because they had to focus on their own conduct as much as their child’s.","Eleanor Roosevelt was a role model not just in the political sphere, but also in the domestic sphere. She could not do it on her own, seeing as many people saw her vision for democracy clichéd and obtuse. She relied on the media to spread her word; her editorial found its way into the homes of families all across the country. Roosevelt proposed old ideas of child rearing for a modern society and changed the roles of parenthood in hopes for a stronger, united country. Her contributions not only pushed the economy in a positive direction, but also set the standards for future citizens to come."," "," ","[1] Roosevelt, Eleanor, 1931. “Building Character,<em>”</em> <em>The George Washington University</em>,  Accessed November, 13 2014."," ","[2] Dennis, Paul M, \"Between Watson and Spock: Eleanor Roosevelt's Advice on Child-Rearing from 1928 to 1962,\" <em>Journal Of American Culture </em>18(1995): 41-50"],"display_date":"June 1931","search_date":"1931-06-15","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2469,"tag":"Eleanor Roosevelt"},{"id":2470,"tag":"Child Rearing"},{"id":2471,"tag":"20th Century"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":125,"school_id":69}},{"id":6247,"title":"Black Feminism and The Women's Liberation Movement","course_id":125,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The 1970s were characterized as an era of protest, activism, and change in America. Anti-war protests against the war in Vietnam and the involvement of the United States in Indochina were popular. As the women's liberation movement continued, the disparity between the needs and agendas of black feminists and white feminists became more evident. In the \"Black Women's Liberation\" pamphlet, two articles, \"Why Women's Liberation is Important to Black Women\" by Maxine Williams and \"Take a Look at Our Problems\" by Pamela Newman, identified the unique needs of black women that served to divide black feminists from the women's liberation movement. The authors identified the aspects of the women's movement that hindered the involvement and development of minority women, like racist sentiments and a narrowly-oriented set of goals that favored white, upper-and-middle class women. The narrow, class-focused orientation and goals of white feminists led many black feminists to value racial liberation over gender liberation.","A major source of tension between black feminists and white feminists was the push by upper-and-middle class white feminists and Southern Republicans for Congress to pass the Equal Rights Act (ERA) that granted both sexes equal rights under the law. The ERA was strongly opposed by the American Federation of Labor and other labor unions because they feared that the amendment would invalidate and weaken protective labor legislation for women. Black feminists, like the labor unions, favored state protective labor laws because they protected the minority women, who disproportionately formed the bulk of the women's labor force, from horrible working conditions like extreme hours, unfair pay, and dangerous work environments. Upper-and-middle class white feminists, however, unfamiliar with labor-intensive jobs and their harsh conditions, saw these laws as restrictive for upwardly-mobile women in the workplace. Black women and black feminists experienced a far greater array of oppression than their white counterparts-- as a woman, as a worker, and as an African American. As the case on state protective laws illustrates, the oppression that black women faced also came from the women's liberation movement. Disparity between the needs of the races functioned to solidify black women's resolve and efforts to focus on racial liberation rather than the liberation of women as a gender."],"display_date":1970,"search_date":"1970-07-02","locations":[{"id":36051,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2492,"tag":"state protective laws"},{"id":2491,"tag":"white feminism"},{"id":2490,"tag":"black feminism"},{"id":2489,"tag":"gender-race conflict"},{"id":2488,"tag":"black liberation"},{"id":2487,"tag":"black women's movement"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":2258,"tag":"women's movement"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":125,"school_id":69}},{"id":6308,"title":"Superheores and Late 20th Century Pop Culture","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"1/30/66","end_date":"5/2/71","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Pows, bangs, and booms captivated young readers in the late 1930’s and up throughout the entirety of World War II.  However, characters, like Batman and Superman, nearly fell into obscurity after Fredric Wertham published <em>Seduction of the Innocent</em> in 1954.  Comic book burnings were not an uncommon in suburban America.  It took time, determination, and alternative media outlets, but superheroes returned to the public eye by the late 1960s’ and 1970s’.  Comic books were brought into the pop culture of the late 20<sup>th</sup> century by the emerging counterculture, television shows, and more mature and relatable subject matter.","To begin, the youth culture boom of the 1960s’ sought after comic books as a modern mythology to speak to the troubles of their generation.  At the time, comic books began to resonate with college students so much that creators held lectures. In his 1971 New York Times articles, Saul Braun says, “[Stan] Lee has succeeded so well in his art that he has spent a good deal of his time traveling around the country speaking at colleges.”[1]  As with many large popular trends, the young adults and teenagers carried their likes into adulthood. In this case, Marvel Comics (Hulk, Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, etc.) traveled safely out of the 1950s’ comic slump bigger than ever into the 1960s’ and onward.","Additionally, the widespread episodic possibilities available on television let superheroes invade the homes of millions of people across America.  When speaking of the influence of superhero television shows, it was assumed that one will speak of the <em>Batman</em> (1966-1968).  However, it would be unfair to include the shows that were the product of this show’s outrageous success, shows such as <em>Wonder Woman </em>(1975-1979), <em>Shazam</em> (1974-1977), and the classic <em>Spider-Man Cartoon </em>(1967).  Each held cultural significance in their own right, but <em>Batman </em>truly stood out as the one that shifted popular opinions on comic books, though it is criticized for saturating the art with camp value.  In a study of merchandizing of television brands it was said, “Scholarship on the Batman TV series has largely been concerned with its appeal to multiple audiences - generational, countercultural, or queer-and with its relationship to the emerging pop art movement and camp sensibilities of the late 1960s’.”[2]  The manner in which <em>Batman </em>appealed to so many different walks of life allowed comic culture to work its way into the mainstream.","Finally, the matter being discussed (aside from camp coming from some television related materials) was more mature in nature.  Marvel Comics was praised by the youth movement of the 1960s’ for creating characters that faced problems and fears shared by their generation.  Robert Genter explains the Marvel formula in his exploration of their impact on Cold War America: “Fantastic powers aside, most Marvel heroes were laden with typical problems plaguing the 1950s’ and spoke to the anxieties of a culture in an atomic age.”[3]  The relatability present in Marvel Comics allowed readers to, for the first time, interject themselves fully into the superhero fantasy.  In <em>Comic Book Nation</em>, Bradford Wright explains the impact of Marvel characters at this time, “Heroes like Spider-Man helped keep code approved comic books relevant and profitable in the age of television and rock-n-roll, a prospect that had seemed quite unlikely only a few years earlier”[4].","In short, comic books grew back into pop culture icons during the late 1960s’ and 1970s’ through youth culture, television appearances of superheroes, and significance of subject matter in mainstream comic stories.  The culture that grew out of comic books in the mid and late 20<sup>th</sup> century incubated and gave through to the present third way of superhero/comic book fascination in America."," "],"display_date":"January 30, 1966 - May 2, 1971","search_date":"1968-09-15","locations":[{"id":31603,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2592,"tag":"Pop Culture"},{"id":2591,"tag":"Superheroes"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6312,"title":"Superman vs. Ali: Simply A Fictional Fight, or Something More?","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"2/1/78","end_date":"2/1/78","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Muhammad Ali was the first Muslim boxer to win a heavyweight title, and his fame earned him the opportunity to create a comic book plot for American readers. Ali chose to write a scenario in which he and Superman, who was unable to use his powers, boxed against each other as mortals. In fighting Superman, Ali is clearly reflecting the internal racial war that was going on during 1970’s America. He made the conscious decision to choose a superhero that was most associated with conservative American values such as equality, freedom and justice.","Siegel and Shuster had intentionally created Superman as a symbol of hope to the people during the time of the Great Depression, and gave him the alter ego of  “Clark Kent” in order to relate more with the people. As the gap between the American Dream and reality began to take a toll on the Americans in the 1930’s, Superman fought for justice and upheld the idea of the traditional American hero.","On the other hand, Muhammad Ali was a boxer, who was also known as being one of the biggest Muslim and African-American figures during the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. He spoke out on American hypocrisy towards other races, and criticized how Superman was meant to be the one to speak out for justice and American values, yet there were still oppressed minorities living in America. Ali’s comic book scenario clearly puts Superman as the superior white American male against himself, standing in place for the oppressed minorities who lack equal rights. In taking away Superman’s powers, Ali is literally leveling down the playing field, which shows how unequal the whites and blacks were in America. Superman’s “superpowers” would have been a representation for the social and economical power that whites had in America and the blacks were willing to fight for. Ali’s ending, in which Superman is knocked out in two rounds, creates the controversial alternative to American society as it features a world in which both races are equal, and minorities are able to defeat white Americans.","In conclusion, Ali was trying to send the message to the public about his opinions about race and inequality in America. He struck a chord in the American public by using one of the biggest Superheroes ever created. His comic book scenario featured a black man and a white man fighting against each other, and threatened to defeat the oppressed status quo just like how he defeated Superman in the ring."],"display_date":"February 1, 1978","search_date":"1978-02-01","locations":[{"id":36051,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2597,"tag":"Muhammad Ali"},{"id":2589,"tag":"Superman"},{"id":2201,"tag":"Minority Groups"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6315,"title":"Finding Hope in a World of Apathy: Comic Book Movies in 1979","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/78","end_date":"12/31/79","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1979, the American populace was in a state of apathy and hopelessness, feeling stuck in a rut with no positive change in sight. Under President Jimmy Carter, many people felt that because their problems could not be solved, it was best to accept things the way they were. Carter’s foreign policies are still debated today. During his time, he unintentionally created tensions by endorsing the European Monetary System (precursor to the Euro), in hopes of building the three-way partnership of the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. His actions put pressure on the Europeans, and, despite their intentions to strengthen relationships, ironically ended up neglecting Western Europe itself.[1] In addition to problems with foreign policy, the economy was troubled, there was an energy crisis in progress, and Carter had lost the support of the Southern Baptist Church as well as other conservative Christians because he refused to answer their questions with a simple “yes” or “no” as they deemed fit.[2] By the end of his term, Carter and his reluctant populace were facing soaring oil prices, American hostages over seas, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. [3]","However, under such faithlessness in humanity, people found stray streaks of light. The comic book industry was bleeding into Hollywood, after the astounding popularity of the first Superman movie in 1978. It earned over 300 million dollars during its first theatrical run, received critical acclaim, and was nominated for three Academy Awards.[4] People young and old—grandfather to father to son—could all understand and relate to the simplistic stories of good versus evil, rather than the more realistic but elite and depressing problems of romantic comedies, war movies, and literary movies.[5] The movies simplified life and provided escapism, distracting frustrated Americans from the crumbling economy and other issues brought on by Carter. Superman was put on a pedestal, multiple critics making comparisons between the character and Jesus; ironically, Superman was a savior to the real American public as much as he was to the people of Metropolis.[6] Soon after the success of the movie, three more movies in the series went on to be made, not including later remakes and new additions to the franchise. Comic book movies not only brought smiles to faces of all ages, but helped the economy in ways the aforementioned movie types could not. Posters, toys, and the like could all be fashioned for comic book movies sold to children and collectors. The unlikely source of joy and money would go on to have a lasting legacy, comic book movies still being made today."," "," "," ","[1] Basosi, Duccio. \"Principle or Power?

Even though at this time he was just starting in the business, Plastino knew how to bargain with, and manipulate, those in higher positions, and how to bring elaborate visuals to a comic.","The time Al Plastino was asked to create panels for the popular Superman comic, he was also creating posters in the Pentagon’s art department. These posters were mostly pro-World War II; but Steinberg Studios needed him badly after Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster had lost the rights to the character in 1947.<sup>2</sup> Plastino was aware that the studio was desperate for his work, and so, he gave in to the requests and did a sample for the strip, but soon found out that another artist working on the comic, Wayne Boring, was making fifty-five dollars per page. He found it obscene that he was not offered the same rate, largely because he thought his quality of his work was equal, or superior to, Boring’s.<sup>3</sup>","Plastino used his other job at the Pentagon as leverage to negotiate his salary per page at Steinberg Studios. He eventually agreed to do the artwork for Superman for fifty dollars a page. Plastino revolutionized the 1950s Superman character and “brought out the human side of a modern myth.”<sup>4 </sup>The level of humanity in Plastino’s artwork of Superman had never been seen before, which made the popularity of the comic skyrocket.<sup>5</sup>","During the 1950’s, Al Plastino worked for DC Comics under Mortimer Weisinger, the company’s comic editor. Weisinger created a “cut-throat” industry<sup>6</sup>. In an interview with Silver Lantern Fanpage, Al Plastino described an instance in which Weisinger told him that another artist was willing to illustrate the Superman comics for twenty dollars per page. He told Weisinger to give the job to the artist:","They always tried to keep you below them. I don’t care what it was. ‘You’re below me.’ But I’d tell them, ‘I’m above you. I’m the artist. You’re an editor.’ I made that clear, in a nice way.<sup>7</sup>","Plastino knew how to manipulate the availability of his talent to figures who, naturally, held higher positions than his own. Although the editor had ultimate control of what was published, Plastino was aware of the great power of his art to narrow the audience’s viewpoint and focus their attention on what he wanted them to.<sup>8</sup> He made use of this talent to, ultimately, get what he wanted: his name on his own artwork.","Plastino was soon asked to take on a position in the artwork production of the daily Batman strip with artist Whitney Ellsworth. He and Ellsworth ended up working on the strip for eight years, replacing comic book artist Joe Giella. Giella had let on to Plastino that he had to sign the strip as “Bob Kane”, even though Kane did nothing in the way of illustrating the comic.<sup>9</sup> The stubborn man that he was, Plastino could not let his hard work be concealed as someone else’s work. Though Kane’s name was still on the first panel, Ellsworth and Plastino wrote theirs on the proofs of the strips, to ensure some credit to their work.","This also happened with another of Plastino’s characters, Supergirl. Supergirl “seemed to be a concerted effort to appeal to young girls; her stories were whimsical adventures that also featured Streaky the Supercat,”<sup>10</sup> the latter of which was also creation of Plastino’s. Supergirl was first understood “simply as a Superman for girls”<sup>11</sup> who was a less-interesting version of Wonder Woman.<sup>12</sup> Plastino would always ink his own name on the page; he didn’t wait for or trust the letterer to put his name down on his work.<sup>13</sup> This quality aided Plastino’s ability to be certain that he would be recognized for his own artwork.","When asked to describe comics in the 1950s, Dan DiDio, DC Entertainment Co-Publisher, said, “When you think of (comics) in the 1950s, only a handful of artists come to mind—and Al Plastino is one of them.”<sup>14</sup> Al Plastino revolutionized the comic strip through his ghost-like persona. He was behind-the-scenes, but wanted his name to be completely visible on the artwork that he around which he centered his whole life. Plastino was strong-willed and incredibly talented, though his most rewarding characteristic was his confidence in his own work."," "," "," "," ","Works Cited","<sup>1</sup> Age, Silver. \"Al Plastino Interview (Pt. 1).\" Al Plastino Interview (Pt. 1).

In a writing about this particular series, the two viewpoints were described as, “Green Lantern’s liberal responses to situations are in stark contrast to the counterculture ideologies that influence Green Arrow’s thinking”.[3]  Comics before the time of O’Neil, and arguably still to this day, had portrayed western minorities in lesser roles often characterized by their race with characters like Black Spider or Black Panther.  In an article analyzing racial issues involving comic books, O’Neil’s run on <em>Green Lantern/Green Arrow</em>, tackling the titular hero’s absence in the Black community, was hailed with, “Superhero comics represented every fantastic race possible, as a means of ignoring real ones”.[4]  This series in particular gave previously flat characters more dynamic, round qualities.","Finally, O’Neil helped shape mainstream superheroes into people who are able to learn from their misdeeds instead of infallible beings as they had often been.  While pairing Green Lantern with the former “Batman with a Bow”, Green Arrow, O’Neil elected to create new personality and status traits for the heroes in order to make them more flawed and deep characters.  In a 2007 interview, O’Neil said, “Well, Oliver Queen [Green Arrow] had never had much character… but we were evolving into more characterization, and in this particular case I needed someone to represent the non-establishment point of view… there was not very much established about him, apart from the loss of fortune, which had been my story”.[5]  Green Arrow’s leftist views fueled by his loss of fortune lead to later O’Neil characters growing, like the Question’s search for inner peace or Batman’s struggles with limitations and drug abuse in 1993’s <em>Batman: Venom</em>.","In brief, Denny O’Neil’s writing was pivotal in crafting the Bronze Age as it matured with the audience, was full of relevant social messages, and allowed Superheroes to be people capable of error rather than perfect vessels for fighting crime.  O’Neil’s works helped pave the way for diversity in the stories told and the societal value of comic books after the 1960s."],"display_date":"April 1970 - April 1985","search_date":"1977-10-15","locations":[{"id":36051,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2602,"tag":"Comic Books"},{"id":2596,"tag":"Bronze Age"},{"id":2618,"tag":"Denny O'Neil"},{"id":2619,"tag":"Green Lantern"},{"id":2620,"tag":"Green Arrow"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6324,"title":"Astro City vs. The Real World","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/95","end_date":"3/29/99","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The comic, Astor City, connects with and is shaped by events in US history. The city ages in real time Astro City connects Astro City, written by Kurt Busiek, gave a new look into the superhero comic. Contrary to most superhero comics, Astro City does not concentrate on the life of a single hero or group of heroes, but rather the city and the people living in it.","Astro City, the comic, does not have a central, lead character, like most other comics like Superman and Batman. Therefore without a single lead character the Astro City comic can change up its storylines and characters; this allows Astro City and its characters to age with the real world. In an interview with Astro City creator, Kurt Busiek, Busiek talks about how he is reintroducing the Astro City comic by continuing the story line in the first issue of Astro City published in 1995. During the talk he mentions how the first issue was made seventeen years ago, so the continuation of the storyline will show all the characters seventeen years older than what they were before.[1]","Without a lead hero to use within the comic, Astro City is able to split the time utilized in the comic for each hero in the particular issue, as well as put time towards the development and growth of the city and its civilians.[2] During the 1990's the comic book industry was in a downfall. As Bradford Wright put it \"comic books are losing their audience not because  they have failed to keep up with changes in American culture but because Americans culture has finally caught up with them.\" People were beginning to get tired of the usual superhero comics, so Astro City brought in a new look into comics.[3] The Astro City universe places the city situated in America, with real life American cities. Astro City shares our history. In the Astro City world, JFK is elected president, the moon missions take place, and there is also the Challenger space shuttle disaster, although in the comic, one of the heroes saves it from exploding.[4] In Busiek's work with Astro City, he likes to touch upon the negative effects of living with people that have superpowers. He shows how ordinary person, like someone from the real world, would experience in a city full of superheroes and villains. Many comics already do this, but in Astro City, Busiek focuses on the psychological consequences as well.[5]","The fictional world that holds Astro City connects with our own world. The Astro City comic shares our history, with slight variations, as well as the characters and city aging with the comic itself. As we the reader grow, so does the characters, comic, and city within the Astro City issues."," ","[1] Jeffery Renaud, Busiek's Triumphant Return To Astro City, comicbookresources.com,  http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=45472.","[2] Oliver Sava, Kurt Busiek's Superhero Masterwork Continues With Astro City #1, avclub.com, http://www.avclub.com/article/kurt-busieks-superhero-masterwork-continues-with-i-98722","[3] Bradford Wright, Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture In America, 282-285.","[4] Stephen Burt, The Superheroes of Your Dreams: Twenty Years of Kurt Busiek and Brent Anderson's Astro City, slate.com, http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=45472","[5] Kurt Busiek, encyclopedia.com, http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3451300016/busiek-kurt.html"],"display_date":"January 1, 1995 - March 29, 1999","search_date":"1997-02-13","locations":[{"id":42267,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2622,"tag":"Kurt Busiek"},{"id":2621,"tag":"Astro City"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6325,"title":"Marvel Comics and Roy Thomas’ Time of Horror","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/80","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["For Marvel Comics, the 1970’s brought on the revival of the horror genre with Roy Thomas working under Stan Lee and later serving as Lee’s immediate successor as Marvel’s editor-in-chief. Thomas is well known for writing X-Men and Avengers for Marvel Comics in the early 1960’s, but he also contributed greatly to the horror stories that flourished a decade later.[1] Marvel and DC comics sales were very close during the period, continuously fighting for the top spot in the market.","In the beginning of the decade, DC Comics was having success with their anthology series <em>House of Mystery</em> and <em>House of Secrets</em>. Marvel had a good hold on the horror market in the 1950’s, so it was only natural for the company to return to the genre and compete with DC by releasing <em>Tower of Shadows </em>and <em>Chamber of Darkness. </em>Marvel put out numerous books and stories during this time such as <em>Tomb of Dracula</em>, <em>Son of Satan, The Valley of the Worm, </em>and <em>The Living Mummy,</em> essentially flooding the market. Consequently, DC had to match it.[2]","Thomas worked with and advised Stan Lee extensively to create several other horror stories. Marvel’s large spread over the market allowed them to have stories with similar characters such as Dracula and Morbius, both vampires, and stories concerning a Werewolf and also a Man-Wolf. Stan Lee also found inspiration from other famous monsters. He created the Hulk with Frankenstein’s monster in mind. Yet, when he reexamined the Hulk he found it to be a good representation of what the golem, a Jewish legend, was.  The golem was first introduced in comics in <em>Strange Tales, </em>but only lasted a few issues. Thomas later reincarnated the myth of the golem however in <em>Hulk #134</em> and he stated that the Hulk was a “modern version of the Jewish golem saga.”[3]","The immense popularity of horror comics did not last extremely long though. Another kind of horror occurred in 1973 with a nationwide paper shortage that plagued all business that relied on the resource. This caused a decline in the amount of books that were put out by both comic book companies. The shortage resulted in the United Paperworkers International Union appealing to the government to let pulp and paper prices be regulated by market forces and not government control.[4] The feminist movement in the early 70’s caused both Marvel and DC to shift their focus a bit away from horror. In 1972, Marvel released three comics with female main characters, <em>Shanna the She-Devil, Night Nurse, </em>and <em>The Cat. </em>Several other issues across the nation affected the material released by comic book companies. Many stories increasingly covered topics such as the Vietnam War and racism.[5] It is therefore evident then that the companies covered any and all topics that would let them grab hold of the market."," ","[1] Lawrence, John Shelton. \"The Stan Lee Universe.\" The Journal of American Culture 36, no. 1 (03, 2013), 64.","[2] \"Comic Book Artist Magazine #13 - Roy Thomas Interview - TwoMorrows Publishing.\" Comic Book Artist Magazine #13 - Roy Thomas Interview - TwoMorrows Publishing.","[3] Weiner, Robert G. \"Marvel Comics and the Golem Legend.\" Shofar 29, no. 2 (Winter, 2011).","[4] Wilcke, Gerd. \"Paper Shortage Plagues Business.\" New York Times (1923-Current File), Jan 06, 1974.","[5] Bradford W.

Goodman purchased comic book stories from the Funnies, Inc. which included superheroes such as the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner.[1] Kevin Garcia a free-lance writer for Marvel Comics, describes in his interview his journey through the 1930s in the comic book business. In his interview, he describes the character of Namor “The Submariner” in enough detail that events in the U.S. can relate to that time period. In the 1930s, events in American politics, economics, and social culture, had an influence on the rise and development of comics, their characters, and writers.","The hunt for communists in the U.S. government began in the 1930s and continued on until the 1960s. This changed the stakes of politics and the development of the United States’ social policies. Historians argued that the anticommunist attack was triggered by the rise of unionism under the Congress of Industrial Organizations. This was also a reaction against the development of pro-labor, anti-racist, and feminist consumer movements.[2] In the 1930s the United States government believed that communism was a threat and immoral. This information relates to Kevin Garcia’s interview because he believed that Namor fought evil and rarely saw defeat.[3]","Given the right learning tools, pre-school children are able to demonstrate the extent of their learning. Comic strips have been used in many ways to enhance knowledge and education. Also, comic books and their use as learning stimuli show their historical context as well as their potential for future practice. Research shows that pre-school children respond in a positive manner to comic strips because they allow the learners to make sense of different topics through the retelling of stories, allowing a deeper understanding and a higher level of learning.[4] Kevin Garcia was a high school teacher of American literature. Since comics began to strongly rise in the 1930s, this research relates to Garcia’s comment that comics are an excellent learning tool and are part of American literature, which is why he used them in his classes.[5]","Militarization altered nearly every feature of American life from the late 1930s and the following centuries. Militarization steered the economy in the direction of a strong war production. This happened both during the actual hostilities of the World Wars and a lot longer during the cold war when hostilities threatened but were not acted upon. The nation paid unthinking attention to national security at the expense of other issues. This even had an impact on shaping social and cultural affairs, so that everything from education to the rights of women was debated in terms of the language of military struggle.[6] This document does not relate directly with Garcia’s interview but more importantly, it provides background knowledge of the struggling America that he endured during the 1930s.","In the United States, employment fell approximately 25 percent and output fell about 30 percent during 1929 and 1933, marking the beginning of the Great Depression.[7] The Great Depression began soon after the stock market crashed in October 1929. By 1933, nearly 13 to 15 million Americans were unemployed and approximately half the country’s banks failed.[8] Many comic book writers were in financial difficulties during the early 1930s and saw an opportunity in the comic book business to lift their families out of the Depression. The distance between the American dream and reality seemed particularly large at that time.[9] These facts relate to Kevin Garcia because he was a free-lance writer for Marvel Comics trying to make a living during that time.[10] Writers did not create superheroes only to entertain and to make a living, but to bring hope to the American people. Instead, the real heroes in the Great Depression of America turned out to be the American people themselves.","[1] Wright, Bradford W. 2001. <em>Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America. </em>Baltimore: T","[2] Storrs, Landon. \"LEFT-FEMINISM, THE CONSUMER MOVEMENT, AND RED SCARE POLITICS IN THE UNITED STATES, 1935-1960.\"<em>Journal of Women's History</em> 18, no. 3 (Fall, 2006): 40-67,148. http://ezproxy.rollins.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/203248794?accountid=13584.","[3] Ortiz, Ildefonso. \"Local Writer Chronicles Marvel Superhero.\" <em>McClatchy - Tribune Business News,</em> Aug 23, 2010. http://ezproxy.rollins.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/746394557?accountid=13584.","[4] Sharpe, Justin and Yasamin O.

The interview mentioned a number of superhero comic figures that he created, one of them being The Question. Albeit following the trend of fighting super villains, the people who The Question fought against were much like real people: reporters and mobsters. Furthermore, apart from the realistic perspective of his comic stories, he comes into depth when talking about the  “struggle of the mind from being corrupted and being ruled by irrational premises.” He therefore states that human beings are in control of everything they do and how they react to their surroundings, including the spreading fear of communism at the time. One of the most significant events at the time was the Vietnam War, where Americans feared the spreading belief of communism.","The Vietnam War began due to the President Truman’s belief of how Vietnam was turning into a communist state and was losing its sense of “deep-rooted nationalism”. This led to the fear of communism, as well as an increase in the amount of anti-communist propaganda displayed throughout the country. Nevertheless, forms anti-communist propaganda weren’t only prominent in advertisements and speeches, but also within comics. For example, Stan Lee’s Iron Man created his superhero armor when the Communists kept him hostage, only to come to the realization that the only way he could stay alive was to wear the iron chest plate he created along with it. The general public would feel sympathy for this fictional character even though it is clearly unrealistic, as well as feel hatred towards these communist groups.","In contrast, Steve Ditko’s The Question was used to represent his views on society and who the public should truly be fighting against: the media. The Question only ever fought against reporters and mobsters, instead of including racial groups and stereotypes that other comics focused on. This would therefore relate to other comics where the enemy is fought against, such as Lee’s Iron Man as stated previously, since it creates more unnecessary hatred and irrational feelings towards the enemies in reality. Ditko also mentions “a mind that refuses to accept or defend the truth, by that act, permits lies to exist…” and that whatever we choose to believe is what our future relies on. To him, evil would only exist if we believe it to be real.","To conclude, Ditko created a superhero that didn’t necessarily fight for solely the government’s perspective of justice like the other superheroes, but rather more of what he saw as being the brainwash and use of propaganda to make people think that what they do is right when it may not be. The Question is a clear representation of how he believes that the media and ‘realistic’ types of crime is who the people should be fighting against, not just fighting against who others think we should be fighting against and why.

Comics like Little Orphan Annie gave the people hope, as well as raised interest in comics, opening the door for later tales of less orthodox genres.","As a boy growing up in the Great Depression, Carmine Infantino, comic book legend and co-creator of such heroes as the Flash and Green Lantern, was no stranger to hard work. When he was no older than six, he already worked as a shoe shiner to help his family make ends meet. He dreamed of growing up to become an architect—a talent and passion visible in the well-designed and elaborate buildings in his comics—but the inability to afford the schooling prompted him to focus on his drawing instead, giving way to the industry he is now associated with. The influence of the Depression itself was part of Infantino’s inspiration to begin with. He grew up drawing the faces of cartoon characters depicting the times, such as the aforementioned Orphan Annie, a character known for her spunk and optimism during hard times.[2]","Infantino went to school in Manhattan, despite the fact that he lived in Brooklyn, solely because he had a burning passion to draw and Brooklyn offered few opportunities. The Depression worked against him as much as it influenced him. His parents hesitated to give him money to go to this school because they feared that all artists were starving and poor—sensations they knew well and dreaded their child having to go through. Eventually they relented. Infantino went on to meet the man who gave him his first major opportunity to learn his trade: Harry Chesler. He gave Infantino an opportunity he could not refuse: Chesler would pay him a dollar a day simply to come to his shop and learn.","Infantino eventually ended up at Quality Publishing, a new break that arose from his first one-in-a-million opportunity. It was here that his job became to work on the backgrounds of the comics, circling back to his past dreams of becoming an architect. While the Depression forced him down a path that may not have been his first choice, he discovered a new passion, and continued to explore his old one through a new medium."," ","[1] Sreenivasan, Jyotsna. <em>Poverty and the Government in America: A Historical Encyclopedia</em>.

Creator Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert built the story of Jay Garrick, known as “Flash.” In the first edition of <em>Flash Comics</em>, readers are introduced to Garrick as a college student studying to become a scientist. During one of Jay’s science experiments, he unintentionally inhales hazardous fumes that render him unconscious. After awakening, Garrick discovers that the gases had remarkably enabled him to function at superhuman speed. With his gift, Flash defends his fictional home of Keystone City while allotting time to keep up with his studies. Flash’s pursuit of education after acquiring superhuman speed is an example of how structured conduct in American culture following The Great Depression and into World War II was being implemented to it’s new generation.","Flash differs from his predecessors in that he is a less combative superhero than Superman or Captain America. Flash, who wore his father’s World War I helmet, exemplifies the rectitude that was being urged upon children of the early 1940’s and continued into the 1950’s. As <em>Comic Book Nation</em> notes, society during the Golden Age of comics became fixated on the instilment of morally just ideology in youth culture.[1] Comics, having become a hugely popular medium for youth to gain information, also began attracting a lot of attention as to whether or not their criteria was beneficial for kids. Gardner’s focus during the creation of <em>Flash Comics</em> was not rooted in forming a character mighty enough to defend America against its greatest villains, like many of Flash’s super-peers had.[2] Rather, Flash was created to allow readers an escape from the belligerent culture surrounding World War II. Because Flash was created at a time when comic criteria was highly speculated, Gardner’s vision for Flash was one that offered an escape from that antagonistic ideology.","In a 1972 interview with Gardner Fox, the creator of Flash recollects what had directed him toward writing comics, in particular Flash. In the interview with John Benson and Phil Seuling, Gardner states that, “<em>The Gods of Mars</em> and <em>The Warlord of Mars</em> opened up a complete new world for me”, continuing to say,  ”That was my goal for the original <em>Flash Comics</em>.”[3]  Perhaps more than any other comic book writer of his time, Fox’s mission was to create a hero whose job wasn’t solely to destroy the enemy by any means necessary. Instead, Fox wished to create a hero that was viewed as a human with superpowers rather than a superhero pretending to be human.","However, as the attention surrounding World War II grew, it became inevitable for from a revenue standpoint for Flash to join in on the propaganda. As Gardner states, “As writers, it was our job to adapt to the world around us.”[4] In the months following Flash’s debut, Gardner premiered a group of superheroes known as the Justice Society of America whose issues ventured far outside of the Keystone City. The Justice Society, in which Flash was an honorary member, quickly became part of the War and took the name the Justice Battalion after becoming a branch of the United States Armed Forces.[5] Much like Marvel’s Captain America, the Justice Battalion approached head on issues surrounding WWII like Nazi Fascism, which at the time, was a commonality for comics.[6] Chapter Two of <em>Comic Book Nation</em> addresses, Golden Age comic book superheroes often provide their own political input by taking action in war efforts on behalf of America.[7] Gardner accomplishes the inclusion of the world around him in his early Flash comics through the actions of the Justice Society of America. Readers began depending on the actions of their favorite heroes such as The Justice Society, Captain America, and Superman to determine how they might like to see the war handled. Whether or not they truly played a role in the outcome of World War II, it is evident that the true outcomes did not differ greatly from those that were predicted in graphic novels at the time.","Gardner Fox’s creation of Flash provides the comic world with a hero centered on the mirroring strong morality rather than one that reflects the abrasive arrogance that much of America culture during the 1940s represented. Jay Garrick’s Flash is one who tried admirably to branch away from the hostile nature attached to Golden Age comics, but ultimately became engulfed by it."],"display_date":"January 1, 1940 - December 2, 1945","search_date":"1942-12-17","locations":[{"id":27491,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2634,"tag":"Keystone City"},{"id":2609,"tag":"gardner fox"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}}]}
