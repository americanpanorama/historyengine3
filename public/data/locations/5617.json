The tests left many observers unimpressed, but this was most likely due to ignorance about the effects of radiation.","According to the article “The 1946 Atomic Bomb Test” by Lloyd Graybeal, the Navy placed about seventy out of date American and captured Japanese vessels in Bikini Lagoon to test the effects of blast pressure, heat and radiation.  McShane was assigned to one of the target ships, the <em>U.S.S. Lamson</em>, and trained to “get the ship out to the target area.”  In a separate article entitled “Bikini Revisited,” Graybeal explained that the Able Test atomic bomb was dropped two miles from its target and the <em>Lamson </em>was one of only four ships to sink.  Many observers were disappointed by the lack of immediate physical destruction caused by the test, and Dr. Frank Thone wrote in a contemporary article that some journalists described the bomb as “a sneeze in a windstorm” or “just another weapon.”  DeGroot related that the Joint Chiefs Evaluation Board reported afterward that as a result of radioactivity, any ship “within a mile of an atomic bomb air burst would eventually become inoperative due to crew casualties.”","McShane recalled that sailors and scientists were sent into the test area to clean the ships and collect data only hours after the mushroom cloud cleared, with only “coveralls, a hat, and work shoes” for protection. The second or Bravo Test, an underwater atomic bomb burst, caused an irradiated rain to fall on the remaining ships in the test area.  DeGroot recounts that sailors became “violently ill” while attempting to decontaminate vessels with soap and water in the days after the test.  Although McShane never ventured into the test area he saw that “even the scientists, and even the people who carried the scientists around” on small boats “didn’t know what was going on.”  DeGroot wrote that while journalists wrote of the “benign nature of the bomb,” the Joint Chiefs cancelled the third test and abandoned some ships due to the health risk to the sailors.","The scientific, military and media reaction to operation crossroads showed that even after dropping the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, McShane and many who witnessed the atomic bomb tests did not understand the long-term effects of radiation."],"display_date":"July 1, 1946 - August 10, 1946","search_date":"1946-07-21","locations":[{"id":26647,"lat":39.9658875933,"lng":-75.1032184193,"zoom":9,"place":"Camden, New Jersey"}],"tags":[{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5270,"title":"Levitt &amp; Sons Advertises New Housing Design","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/49","end_date":"12/31/49","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["After receiving much criticism on his first mass-produced, low-cost housing design, the influential post-World War II real estate developer, William Levitt, introduced a new design in 1949.  As advertisements for the new Rancher sprang up across Pennsylvania, many citizens, including veterans who would receive significant discounts, flocked to the Exhibit Center in the Levittown suburbs.  The innovative, mass-produced Rancher, with its “special introductory price” of $8,990, appealed to eager Americans who dreamed of home-ownership.  In an attempt to generate a sense of urgency among potential buyers, the advertisement warned that the initial price was “subject to increase at any time. Those who make application will be protected against any raise.”  With this in mind, Americans hurried to Levittown to secure reasonably priced housing for their families.","The Levittown guarantee of decent, affordable housing lured many eager, young couples to participate in the suburbanization of postwar America.  As historian Joshua Ruff noted, “Patience had been killed by 15 years of economic depression, war and an epidemic housing shortage. People wanted the full package—the affordable house, the new appliances, the suburban lifestyle—and they wanted it right away.”  Levitt & Sons promised this kind of lifestyle to potential customers, deeming Levittown, Pennsylvania as “the most perfectly planned community in America.”  The alluring advertisement also confidently announced, “There is nothing to compare with it anywhere.”  Levittown included the whole package that Americans desired—a sturdy, affordable house equipped with all the necessary amenities to live comfortably while raising a family.  By promoting Levittown as a kid-friendly community, Levitt & Sons urged families to consider the benefits of living in such a peaceful neighborhood.  For no extra charge, as the advertisement clearly acknowledged, Levittown residents could freely access the many recreational areas in the community.  Homebuyers would get all of this at one low cost.  Finally, the American dream of home-ownership had become broadly accessible.","Earlier on, critics had attacked Levitt’s first housing model, the Cape Cod, as a depressingly small and unimpressive structure.  As acknowledged by suburban historians Rosalyn Baxandall and Elizabeth Ewen, “Levitt took the criticisms seriously and spent between $50,000 and $100,000 to study new housing designs.”  Levitt’s commitment proved essential in improving the earlier design.  Historian Alexander O. Boulton attests to this accomplishment: the new Ranchers “were two feet longer than the earlier models, and they offered as standard features built-in appliances that were only just coming into general use.”  The April 1950 issue of <em>Architectural Forum</em> also addressed the influential and innovative Rancher design.  As quoted in <em>Picture Windows</em>, “‘Never before in the history of U.S. building has one house type made such an impact on the industry in so short a time…builders by the dozens junked their Cape Coddled programs, switched instead to the new Levitt type.’”  It was this innovation, convenience, and affordability of the new Rancher that constituted the major selling points for Levittown in 1949.  The Rancher encompassed all of these elements, thus attracting anxious Americans to the suburbs."],"display_date":1949,"search_date":"1949-07-02","locations":[{"id":26230,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1010,"tag":"Housing"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5271,"title":"Black Family Challenges Racial Barriers in Suburb","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/57","end_date":"8/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["On August 13, 1957, Daisy and Bill Myers moved their family to a well-developed suburb in Levittown, Pennsylvania.  They were just like every other eager newcomer to arrive in Levittown, except that they were black.  As news of this Levittown “first” quickly spread, so did the curiosity.  Drivers continuously circled the house in their automobiles, trying to catch a glimpse of the first African American residents of Levittown.  Other interested citizens gathered near the house to share in their disbelief.  Only hours after the family moved in, violence erupted in the traditionally quiet community.  This “Levittown Incident” was documented in a <em>New York Times</em> article from August 25, 1957, revealing the racism that plagued this sprawling suburban community.  A mere two days after the family had started preparing the house for the move, an angry crowd of 200 residents formed outside the home.  Demonstrators hurled stones at the house, shattering two panes of the picture window.  Police arrived on the scene to break up the crowd.  As Levittown historian David Kushner noted, “It was the first time in twenty-nine years a sheriff had been called in to restore order. But order wouldn’t come easily.”  More disapproving Levittowners returned to the Myers house the next evening.  In fact, as the <em>New York Times</em> reported, “Demonstrations continued almost nightly.”  Time and again, police arrived at the scene to suppress riots.  With the police protecting the house, “An uneasy peace descended on the neighborhood.”  However, the bitter reality of Northern racism remained.","With their innovative mass-production techniques, the housing developer Levitt & Sons helped alleviate the post-World War II housing crisis.  Despite the promise of affordable housing for all Americans, the company excluded blacks from their communities.  “This pattern of racial exclusion was set in 1947,” wrote historian Alexander O. Boulton.  However, William Levitt defended his company’s continued support of racial covenants.  As cited by historian Joshua Ruff, Levitt declared, “‘We can solve a housing problem, or we can try to solve a racial problem. But we cannot combine the two.’”  Thus, Levittown, Pennsylvania remained an all-white community.  “I have come to know that if we sell one house to a Negro family, then 90 to 95 percent of our white customers will not buy into the community. That is their attitude, not ours,” remarked Levitt in the <em>New York Times</em>.  However, as pointed out in the newspaper, “the builders had no say over the resale of houses.”  This is where the Myers family entered the picture.","In August 1957, a tight-knit, pleasant community became the scene of vicious uprisings.  The riots highlighted the bitter racial tensions of the time and revealed the legitimacy of Levitt’s concerns; Levittowners were not ready to welcome blacks into their community.  As noted by Kushner, Daisy Myers remembered picking up the little culprit that broke her window.  “‘The rock, weighing less than an ounce,’ as Daisy put it, ‘carried tons of hatred with it.’”  Such hatred rocked the town for weeks."],"display_date":"August 1957","search_date":"1957-08-16","locations":[{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5272,"title":"Whites Riot in Response to Arrival of First African American Family in Levittown, PA","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/57","end_date":"8/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Upon driving up to their new home at 43 Deepgreen Lane, Daisy Myers was filled with doubt, recalling that she repeatedly asked herself, “what would be the extent of our ostracism? Would we be able to sleep comfortably?” as she studied the four law officers standing on the lawn of her address in the Dogwood Hollow Section of Levittown. These questions regarding the neighborhood reaction to the arrival of a black family in what had been an intentionally all-white enclave, were unfortunately answered over the next two weeks. At dusk each evening, crowds of people gathered outside the Myer’s home, angrily shouting and jeering, singing the national Anthem, and throwing stones toward the Myer’s home, as apparently these “spacious skies,” they sang of were not meant to be enjoyed in an integrated setting. Levittown police failed to enforce the court ordered protection for the Myers, prohibiting more than three people from assembling near the residence at once. Mobs consequently gathered in this fashion each night, only finally subsiding due to interference from the state police. After an agonizing fourteen days, the riots ended, but the Myers continued to suffer the anxiety of the consequences triggered by the introduction of integration to Levittown. Harassment of the family persisted for almost three months, as Daisy Myers received threatening phone calls of those who “told [her] they threatened to shoot William down on sight,” the family’s deliveries of oil, bread, and milk stopped arriving, and the more than occasional unfriendly white stroller-by forced the Myers to have constant protection, or at the very least, sympathizing company. Anti-segregationist even obtained property immediately neighboring the Myers’ home, using the location to intimidate the family further, evident by their conspicuous display of the confederate flag.","The resistance seen in the August riots against the integration of Levittown, PA was not uncommon throughout suburban neighborhoods. Quite the contrary in fact, racial discrimination and the subsequent segregated communities were the norm in 1950s suburbia. Yet despite this plaguing harassment, the Myers refused to leave their Levittown home, justifiably feeling entitled “to live where [they] chose,” as William put it. Remarking on the family’s incredible determination to outlast their opponents, Dianne Harris, historian and author of <em>Second Suburb: Levittown, PA, </em>stated<em>, </em>“the Myers endured an ordeal that few could have weathered with such dignity, courage, grace, and fortitude.”"," ","This endurance allowed the family to break “the lily-white pattern of Levittown,” as Daisy Myers stated, a pattern that William Levitt had attempted to keep in existence in his planned suburban community. While he did not consider himself to hold racist ideals, Levitt had long refused to sell his homes to African Americans. Applications for home ownership in Levittown had to be made in person at the Levittown Exhibit Center Sales Office, allowing discrimination in the housing industry of the community to readily continue daily. Yet through the assistance received from the American Friends Service Committee, the Myers were able to circumvent these discriminatory practices, making headway in the racial trends of the neighborhood. Yet due to the overpowering ideals of many white residents, in combination with the ideals of Levitt and his employed real estate agents, the effects of the inequality are still seen in Levittown today, as the 2000 census identified ninety-eight percent of the town’s population as Caucasian."],"display_date":"August 1957","search_date":"1957-08-16","locations":[{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5273,"title":"Levittown Real Estate Boards' Discriminatory Housing Practices Revealed","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"8/7/54","end_date":"8/7/54","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an article published in the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> in August of 1954 journalist Craig Thompson exposed the “problem of Negro exclusion,” commenting on the discriminatory practices employed by Levitt and the preventive covenants established by the local real estate boards within his suburban communities. As the father of modern suburbia, it seemed that with his prepackaged communities, he had also manufactured the ideal enclave for whites opposed to an integrated neighborhood – an enclave that beginning in the mid-1950s, was finally exposed for the inequalities of opportunity it had maintained.","Revolutionizing the housing industry, Levitt pioneered the affordable, planned suburban community, beginning his construction endeavors on the potato fields of Hempstead Plains on Long Island. With the mass production of homes, Levitt enabled past renters of urban-dwellings to become homeowners, an “embodiment of the American dream,” according to Kyle Sabo, a lifelong resident of the area. With this revolution of the housing industry, Levitt was praised by the media, with early articles and interviews speaking of the visionary vertical organization that Levitt employed in construction. Yet as the racist ploys throughout Levittown expanded, Levitt’s reputation shifted from a genius businessman to a prejudicial one, driven by his antagonistic views toward blacks and other minorities.","In the interview Thompson conducted with Levitt in 1954, the businessman denied any racist attitudes toward the black community. He defended his tactics as nothing more than techniques that were best for his business, stating, “as a company, [his] position was simple: [he] could solve a housing problem, or [he] could try to solve a racial problem. But [he] could not combine the two.”","Despite such claims however, the growing racist policies of Levitt’s suburbias could no longer escape public knowledge. Property owners, pressured into such contracts that prevented them from leasing or selling to blacks in the future had became common practice in Levittown. Residents were warned that violation of these conditions would not only result in penalty for themselves, but would cause an “invasion” of blacks into the town, bringing with it lower property values, crime, and danger to the very essence of suburbia. Even intermingling with blacks became dangerous, as Levitt evicted white families on the basis of welcoming black company in their suburban home.","With exposure of such practices, not surprisingly, came a growing opposition. In both Levitt’s Long Island community and his Bucks County community, resistance to segregation, as well as to blockbusting, grew. In Freeport, Long Island 240 white residents signed a petition, refusing to be solicited by local real estate agents. Black newspapers across the Bucks County area, notably the <em>Tribune, </em>issued articles filled with commentary of how Levitt’s towns were “breeding hate.” The Society of Friends became dedicated to circumventing the restrictive policies in place, successfully enabling the move-in of the first African American family to Levittown, PA in 1957. Such efforts alarmed whites opposed to integration, as uncovering of the problem increasingly incited reformist sentiment throughout such neighborhoods.","Despite the exposure, and accompanying intentions of challenging such policies, however, the suburban neighborhood of the 1950s served as the forerunner for what would become the trend across American suburbias for years to come. In the following decades, white communities throughout the country, aided by federal policy and the real estate agency, “protected” suburbia for themselves, fearful of the idea of an integrated community seeping into this type of residential setting. The effects have by no means disappeared in modern times, as the impact of such actions are still felt in Long Island’s Nassau and Suffolk counties, as well as throughout Bucks county, which display significant racial disparities, regrettably referred to by residents as “a checkerboard of racially, ethnically, and economically segregated communities.”"," "],"display_date":"August 7, 1954","search_date":"1954-08-07","locations":[{"id":28529,"lat":40.9562853666,"lng":-73.0371992045,"zoom":9,"place":"Suffolk, New York"},{"id":29305,"lat":40.6374264514,"lng":-73.5488485883,"zoom":10,"place":"Nassau, New York"},{"id":30920,"lat":40.0555369225,"lng":-74.9693746988,"zoom":9,"place":"Bucks, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}}]}
