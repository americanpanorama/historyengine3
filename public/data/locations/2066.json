As the proud mother of two Confederate soldiers, James and Hines, Zillah found strength in her Bible. In her diary, Zillah wrote of her fear for her sons' safety and her pride in their dedication to the Confederate struggle for independence, but always found comfort in God's words. When both James and Hines were killed in service in late 1862, Zillah's worst fears were realized. On January 9, 1863, she wrote in her diary that the remains of our dear sons...reached home last Monday 5th of January 1863. Zillah's unwavering Christian faith consoled her and she explained that although I wept sore and do weep yet I know that in our heavenly Father's house are many mansions. It was a comfort to Zillah to know that her sons shared her religious devotion. Reverend S.S. Russell, a soldier who fought along side of James and Hines, reassured Zillah that he could testify that they had been living demonstrations that men by the grace of God could live Christians under any circumstances.","Religion was of great importance to southerners like Zillah. According to the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</em>, evangelical denominations provided education to women prior to the Civil War. Because religion was so closely tied to knowledge, women were especially religious in the South. After the Great Awakening of the nineteenth century (religious revivals in the South), evangelical Christianity became a bedrock of southern culture. The impact was felt even stronger by women because religion was family oriented. Women like Zillah raised their children according to their religious beliefs, and in Zillah's case, those beliefs were devout. Religion was also somewhat of an equalizer; women and men were equal in God's eyes in terms of sin. Women were free to ask for forgiveness of their sins just as men were.","To Zillah Brandon and women like her, religion was not just a matter of church on Sunday. It was a way of life, encompassing her education and her family."],"display_date":"January 9, 1863","search_date":"1863-01-09","locations":[{"id":365,"lat":32.5910098434,"lng":-88.1987909047,"zoom":9,"place":"SUMTER, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2880,"title":"The Value of a Human Life\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-12-25","end_date":"1861-01-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Turner Reavis was a man of details. As a judge and a state senator, he was also a man of wealth. He kept meticulous records of the accounts for his plantation, Cedar Bluff. Reavis filled his ledger with precise descriptions of purchases and sales of cotton, food, supplies, animals, and the biggest investment of all, slaves. Reavis paid the same regard to his slaves he did the mules he sold and the pork he purchased; they were simply necessary items of property needed to conduct the everyday business of running a plantation. The big difference to Reavis between the slaves and other items, however, was money. Reavis maintained a precise list of all of the thirty-one slaves he owned and made note of their names, where and when they were purchases, and, most importantly, how much he invested in them. He purchased his first eighteen slaves on December 25, 1859 for 14,500 in cash. He then purchased three more slaves for 2700 and a division with D. Waller. Reavis purchased the remaining ten slaves on January 2, 1861 for 8,225, with interest. All in all, Reavis' investment totaled 25,425 for his slaves. ","Turner Reavis' attention to detail was not unusual, considering his position as owner of a large plantation. Historian Lucille Griffith concludes that for business reasons, if for no other, planters kept detailed and extensive records. Running a plantation was similar to running a business and slaves were part of the overhead necessary for success. It was important for planters like Reavis to be aware of the amount of money they had invested in their slaves, especially for sums as large as 25, 425. This costly investment, though, generally meant profits for the planters. Historians William J. Cooper, Jr. and Thomas E. Terrill assert that slavery as a labor system was financially rewarding for masters, especially in southwestern states like Alabama, where there tended to be larger plantations and therefore a better return than smaller...farms."],"display_date":"December 25, 1859 - January 2, 1861","search_date":"1860-06-29","locations":[{"id":364,"lat":32.5910098434,"lng":-88.1987909047,"zoom":9,"place":"SUMTER, Alabama"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}]}
