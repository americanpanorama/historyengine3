Breckinridge Provides Insight into Slave Loyalty and Confederate Expatriation","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1869-01-24","end_date":"1869-01-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dated January 13, 1869, this letter written by ex-Confederate general and former United States Vice-President, John C. Breckinridge, first became public on January 20, 1869, when the newspaper of Columbus, Georgia printed a copy of the message. Four days later, the <em>New York Times</em> made it available to an even wider audience when it republished the article. After the surrender of the Confederacy, Breckinridge feared the possibility of the Union bringing charges against him for his participation in the rebellion. To escape potential prosecution, Breckinridge fled to Havana, Cuba. From Cuba, he traveled to the United Kingdom, and then to Canada, where he wrote this letter in Niagara, Ontario.","Breckinridge did not mean the focus of his letter to revolve around his post-war travels. Instead, he meant to inquire about his “faithful colored servant, Thomas.” Despite the fact that Thomas had been a slave and servant to Breckinridge, the former master spoke of his servant in a fond manner. He seemed nostalgic when he wrote of his and Thomas’s parting before Breckinridge left for the U.K. Neither of the men seemed happy about the parting, but Breckinridge thought it best for Thomas to return home. “I succeeded in sending him back to his friends from Havana, although he wished to remain with me.” According to Breckinridge, Thomas felt such loyalty to his master that he promised to once again live with Breckinridge upon his return to the United States.","This letter penned by Breckinridge to “a gentleman” in Columbus unusual in two respects. Some instances were recorded during the Civil War of slaves remaining with their masters after emancipation; however, the extreme loyalty that Thomas possessed towards Breckinridge was not the norm. While impossible to verify, the devotion from Thomas that Breckinridge wrote of, if true, was an exceptional relationship between and servant. Thomas only left Breckinridge’s side at his insistence.","The location of the letter’s composition also made it unique. Men having served in the Confederate Army were known to have left for other countries after the war. Most, however, did not flee to Canada as Breckinridge did. While Canada was not the first sanctuary Breckinridge found, his relocation to it was uncommon. Many Confederates that left the U.S. immigrated to Mexico and others to Brazil. Brazil served as an appealing option because the country still permitted slavery at the time. The United Kingdom, which Breckinridge did travel to, was also a much more popular destination than Canada for Confederate expatriates."],"display_date":"January 24, 1869","search_date":"1869-01-24","locations":[{"id":2102,"lat":32.5099595434,"lng":-84.8770433037,"zoom":10,"place":"MUSCOGEE, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":1147,"tag":"John C.

The couple met in Birmingham in June of 1942.  Stationed in Fort Benning, Georgia, Nicholas and Opal began corresponding and continued reciprocating mail throughout their courtship.  After only months of dating, “Nicky Boy” and “Darling Opal” wed in November of 1942.  After their brief ceremony, Nicholas had to return to Fort Benning and received news of being transferred to Fort Bragg in North Carolina.  After getting married and even learning of their pregnancy, the couple, especially Opal, seemed to be self-conscious about their decision.   Opal wrote in a letter dated November 19, “How do you feel about our marriage? Do you miss me? Do you love me? Do you want to be with me?”  In her next letter dated November 20, Opal asks again, “Do you love me as much as I love you?”.  The next day she signs her letter with “I haven’t taken my ring off”.","Doris Weatherford, an American History Professor, speculates why women like Opal asked such questions after tying the knot.  According to her research, many women wanted to volunteer for war work any way they could and that included direct contact with servicemen.  These women believed that marrying a soldier was the equivalence of responding to Uncle Sam.  Others sought out marriages because they feared waiting too long for the right man would result in never getting married at all.  Those that had already married hastily began to wonder about the roles they played in their marriages.  Was it for love, patriotic duty, or draft evasion?  Weatherford goes on to write that these women were advised against war marriages so not to repeat the high divorce rate by previous generations in reference to World War One.","Perhaps some of these ideas about war marriage passed through the mind of Opal Bonilla which led her to raise questions of doubt.  There was no denying that she was left in a vulnerable state to raise a child alone.  Yet Opal and Nicky continued writing back and forth as he eventually was shipped to Europe. She kept writing to him into 1944 even when months would go by without hearing from him. These months with no word proved to be unfortunate.  They were never reunited and Nicholas never met his daughter, Sandra, because he was killed attempting to thrust into Berlin with Allied paratroopers."],"display_date":"November 1942 - November 1944","search_date":"1943-11-15","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"},{"id":27496,"lat":32.3469701692,"lng":-84.78704688,"zoom":10,"place":"Chattahoochee, Georgia"},{"id":25218,"lat":35.0485350444,"lng":-78.8273232021,"zoom":9,"place":"Cumberland, North Carolina"}],"tags":[{"id":1718,"tag":"Wartime Brides"},{"id":405,"tag":"Marriage"},{"id":220,"tag":"alabama"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":110,"school_id":10}}]}
