In 1930, a high school teacher named Abel Meeropol and also known as “Lewis Allen”-his two sons died in infancy- , wrote a poem after seeing a picture of the lynching of Tom Shipp and Abe Smith in Marion, Indiana. To hear the lyrics sent the listener to the scene of the unspeakable crime, “Southern trees bear a strange fruit, Blood on the leaves and at the root, Black bodies swinging in the Southern Breeze, Strange fruit hanging from the Poplar trees” [2]. The poem, called “Strange Fruit” was turned into a song which was sung by a few vocal artists. However, the song did not attract much attention until it was performed by the Jazz artist Billie Holiday who was already a professional singer at the age of eighteen in 1933.  She became a featured artist at the Café Society, a nightclub located off Sheridan Square in Greenwhich Village, New York, which “catered to Progressives”[3]. The Café Society night club “mocked celebrity worship, right wing politics, and racial discrimination”[4]. It was a place where black and white socialized on and off the stage. The Café Society attracted many well know people such as, “Nelson Rockefeller, Charlie Chaplin, Errol Flynn, Lena Horne, Paul Robeson, and Eleanor Roosevelt”[5]. Due to the graphic nature of the song, the Café was the only place that it could be performed without persecution. The truth of the horror was much to bear, “Pastoral Scene of the gallant South, The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth…” [6]. Whenever Billie Holiday tried to perform the song elsewhere she encountered many racist attitudes and even some physical harm. The first time she sang the song at the Café Society in 1939, she felt afraid at the end of the song because the audience sat in complete silence for a long period of time. Suddenly, one person clapped, and then the rest joined in. Once that happened, Billie Holiday ended each session with the song “Strange Fruit”. “Prior to the song all normal operations of the club would cease. Waiters, cashiers, busboys were all immobilized. Servers took neither order nor delivered them” [7]. Billie Holiday would perform the song in complete darkness except for the spotlight that “illuminated” her face, ending with the verse “Here is a strange and bitter crop” [8]. Following the song, she would walk off the stage, never returning for the applause or any other reason, “in order that the song would have a profound effect on each person that experienced the performance of “Strange Fruit” [9]."," ","[1] Stone, Chris, Blood at the Root: “Strange Fruit” as Historical document and Pedagogical Tool” OAH Magazine of History, 18 (2004): 54.accessed January 12, 2010. http://www.jstor.org/stable/25163665.","[2] <em>Ibid</em>, 55","[3] Margolick, David, “Performance as a Force for Change: The Case of Billie Holiday and ‘Strange Fruit,” Cordozo Studies in Law and Literature, 11 (Summer 1999): 98.accessed January 12, 2010, http://www.jstor.org/stable/27670205","[4] <em>Ibid</em>, 96","[5] <em>Ibid</em>, 96","[6] Stone, “Strange Fruit,” OAH Magazine of History, 18 (2004), 55.","[7] Margolick, “Performance as a Force for Change: The Case of Billie Holiday and ‘Strange Fruit,” Cordozo Studies in Law and Literature, 11 (Summer 1999): 98.","[8] Stone, “Strange Fruit,” OAH Magazine of History, 18 (2004), 55.","[9] Margolick, “Performance as a Force for Change: The Case of Billie Holiday and ‘Strange Fruit,” Cordozo Studies in Law and Literature, 11 (Summer 1999): 99."],"display_date":1939,"search_date":"1939-07-02","locations":[{"id":24276,"lat":43.3136970893,"lng":-73.4307458827,"zoom":9,"place":"Washington, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":853,"tag":"Fruit, Billie Holiday"},{"id":852,"tag":"Lynching, Song, Crime"},{"id":847,"tag":"Café Society, Strange"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":6354,"title":"Breaking Point: Stonewall Riots","course_id":141,"status":"P","start_date":"6/28/69","end_date":"6/28/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 2015, the LGBT community in America sits on the edge of its collective seat, much like the African-American community in 1967 with the much-anticipating ruling of the Loving Case.  Today, we await a Supreme Court ruling on the legality of same-sex marriage.  How did we get here when only 50 years ago, interracial marriage was illegal?  The answer may be in a bar in Greenwich Village.","On June 28th, 1969, New York police raided the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in Manhattan, New York.  What followed was a serious of violent uprisings that are now considered the beginning of the fight for gay rights across the nation in the face of an anti-homosexual legal system.","Following WWII, a paranoid America cried out for the suppression of any people seemingly jeopardizing the integrity of the country, among whom were LGBT.  Homosexual acts of any kind were illegal, including not wearing outfits appropriate fore their gender.","By and large, the mafia owned the bars that catered to the LGBT community, sometimes without a liquort license.  Police often raided these establishments, but typicall gave the owners a head's up, but on the night of 28 June 1969.  In the wee hours of the morning, the police exploded into the bar, without the tradition warning of the white lights that gave the patrons time to duck out the back door, stop dancing and touching each other, or stash their liquor.  Some patrons offered a little resistance to the police officers who responded with more force, and the situation escalated.","In the height of the Civil Rights Movement in the US, tension between law enforcement and marginalized Americans were already high.  From all accounts, it was just a matter of time before the LGBT community hit their breaking point, and for the first time in history, this was the day that would happen.","The police raid, which otherwise would have lasted all of a half hour, dragged on as the surrounding crowd grew.  Crowd reaction fueled the fire of the patrons, who continued to fight back with growing vengeance.  The police answered with more force.","The LGBT patrons of the Stonewall Inn were historically among the most marginalized of the LGBT community: transvestites, homeless kids, drag queens.  Exasperated and angry, they rose up against decades of persecution.  What followed was a couple of days filled with riots in reaction to the raid.  Cars overturned, violent and combative encounters between LGBT members and police men, and manifestations of pride in what was perceived to be a perverse way of life marked the first uprising of the LGBT community.","A year later to the date, America saw its first gay pride parade.  45 years later, America awaits a Supreme Court ruling on the legality of same-sex marriage."],"display_date":"June 28, 1969 - June 28, 1970","search_date":"1969-12-27","locations":[{"id":31991,"lat":43.3136970893,"lng":-73.4307458827,"zoom":9,"place":"Washington, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2677,"tag":"LGBT"},{"id":2676,"tag":"Stonewall"},{"id":1596,"tag":"Riots"}],"course":{"name":"Intro to Digital History","school":"University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee","course_id":141,"school_id":68}}]}
