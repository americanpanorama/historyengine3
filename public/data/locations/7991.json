Rusty Sachs, a member of the Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 362, testified before Congress and explained his recollection of destroying villages and killing innocent civilians. Approximately twenty other soldiers testified from various branches of the armed forces in the Winter Soldier Investigations.","Sachs revealed that playing games with Vietnamese prisoners was a popular way to pass the time. The men in charge of loading the helicopter “in addition to maintenance on the aircraft would blindfold the prisoners, holding the blindfold on with heavy wire, safety wire.” The soldiers would tie the hands and feet of the prisoner, then held a contest to see who could toss them the farthest off the aircraft. This was done in the company of high-ranking military officials. Nothing was done to stop these actions because officers felt they were doing nothing wrong. Many Marines never received special training in the handling of prisoners. Sachs states, “...we were never told anything about the way to treat prisoners if we were the capturers rather than the captee and this was very standard.”","Historian Patrick Hagopian believes trials, such as the Winter Soldier Investigations, go a long way in obtaining the sense of justice that had been lost during the war. He states that a critical legacy of the Vietnam War was the “U.S. armed forces' and government's failure to investigate and prosecute perpetrators of war crimes in Vietnam rigorously and exhaustively.”","The soldiers who saw combat and carried out these acts were seen as less equipped mentally to handle other service missions when compared to high-ranking officers. Social Scientists Cynthia Gimbel and Alan Booth believed that only twelve percent of servicemen were in combat jobs during the war. These jobs were often filled by men “with lower mental aptitude and skills who were presumed unable to handle complex support positions.”"],"display_date":"January 31, 1971","search_date":"1971-01-31","locations":[{"id":35437,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":26,"school_id":3}},{"id":5748,"title":"Early Relationship Between Automobiles and Masculinity","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/19","end_date":"12/31/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Introduced in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the automobile became one the great advances that occurred within American society.  They soon came to greatly expand the mobility of the American people and would eventually come to dominate the travel and leisure industries.  Due to the fact that early automobiles where the “new toy” for leisure and luxury, usually only the upper-class where affluent enough to afford them.  Since at that time “man of the house” was the provider for his family and maintaining its economic stability, men where usually the key demographic who went out and purchased this new technology once it became available to the public.","The relationship between the patriarchal form of income for families in the early twentieth century and the fact that automobiles where usually meant for the middle and higher classes eventually evolved to the connection that higher-class male masculinity had with the ownership of cars.  Also Henry Ford’s breakthrough in the assembly line production of cars made this dream of car ownership within reach of more middle class men.  For the majority of the early era of automobiles, men where the one’s more interested in the automobile usage, but some women did interest themselves in the mobility and freedom that they provided.  Men where soon expected to be proficient in the cars and their repairs, culminating in the coming of age “first car” of many teenagers  later of more modern times.","This connection between masculinity can is expressed in the early days of the comic strip<em> Gasoline Alley</em>, by Frank O. King.  This comic strip, introduced in 1919, originally focused on a group of men coming together on Sunday mornings in the back alley of their apartments to talk about cars.  This comic strip appealed to the male demographic with its masculine display of “automobile knowledge” in friendly camaraderie.  Eventually even the publisher admitted that the appeal was too masculine and needed to be curved to better appeal to the female audience, a testament to the strong connection between the automobile and the male identity."],"display_date":1919,"search_date":"1919-07-02","locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1544,"tag":"automobile"},{"id":1761,"tag":"male identity"},{"id":1762,"tag":"Gasoline Alley"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":5832,"title":"An autumn afternoon on Detroit's Belle Isle","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"9/13/14","end_date":"9/13/14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It was a chilly 65 degrees in the waters of the Detroit river on a perfect Sunday afternoon in the early autumn of 1914 as revellers debated whether it was too cool for a swim in the Belle Isle bath houses. Several hundred Detroiters could brave the dip for only 15 minutes each, but swimming was not the only weekend activity available on the large, lush island of recreation for escapees of the industrial city. Visitors could enjoy a stroll through the vast and deep wooded areas of the island park and enjoy the beauty of the seasons in change; green leaves beginning to give way to russet and crimson on the tall trees. A matinee band played popular tunes to a sizable crowd while families, couples and friends relaxed around the bandstand on the benches or gazed out over the river at Canada or at the few, experienced boatmen navigating the water. Canoes were also navigating a waterway internal to the island: the canal system was at capacity as visitors tried their hand or paddle. The afternoon was made all the more pleasant for the crowds as the criminal element was apparently also on their rest day, with no pickpocketing, injuries, damage or theft of the many cars on the island.","This jovial newspaper account of the recreational uses of Detroit's Belle Isle park is an excellent representation of the many ways in which a city can shape the natural environment. Belle Isle is a particularly striking example, as it is literally an attempt to preserve an island of natural space within one of America's most industrialised cities. For the mainly hard working, blue collar, immigrant and African-American population the Isle was a space where they could escape their weekday toil and truly relax with their families. The many uses of Belle Isle reflect its role as a multi-faceted space used by all of the city's vast array of residents. As an almost purely recreational space (there was a small commercial fishery on the island) Belle Isle is expressive of the culture of Detroiters and how they had fun at the time, contrasted with the intense and dominating industrialisation of the city. Only a mile or so down stream the river was filled with ships and further on lined with polluting factories in which the men enjoying the island worked long and tough hours. The island was particularly popular for motoring enthusiasts and Sunday drivers, revealing the upper class who could afford auto-mobiles (which many of the other visitors may have helped built in the numerous car factories in Detroit) also had a use for the public park.","Many people describe cities metaphorically as organisms or natural systems, with individual but vitally connected parts.

There is much talk about the school board budget and the spending on campaign literature but only one article asks the question: why is there no talk of the highly successful urban farming progam? Detroit's mayor, Hazen Pingree, had made a name for himself and his city by initating a vacant-lot gardening program following the economic depression of 1893 in which the city donated unused plots on the edge of development to poor, mostly immigrant laborers so that they could be employed in growing their own food. After only a few years the program was considered a resounding success, as the monetary value of the produce grown on these vacant-lot gardens far exceeded the money allotted to the program in the city budget. This success had inspired many other American cities such as New York and Chicago to start their own vacant-lot gardening programs so as to deal with urban poverty and unemployment, and was a huge poltiical win for Pingree.  However, as the economy started to improve and employment increased, interest in the program began to wane. This article from the <em>Detroit Free Press</em> calls upon the city and Pingree to continue to fund the program. It quotes Pingree talking about the positive publicity that the program had generated for Detroit, going so far as to claim that it was his city's primary claim to national fame. Despite this lofty praise from its founder, Detroit's vacant-lot gardening program would only last another year before being abandoned.","This article unknowingly traces the decline in interest in Detroit's vacant-lot gardening program, which, in the context of the history of urban agriculture in the United States, is not really a novel story. Urban farming in the United States has been linked to a cyclical pattern of urban land use that can be understood as reacting to periodic economic downturns or wartime efforts.  Historically, urban farming has been in vogue when the sociopolitical and economic climate was conducive to public investment in efforts to alleviate poverty that are seen as a temporary fix. Farming on donated and unused land allows the poor and unskilled to produce something with minimal capital investment and oversight, and appeals to sensibilities that stress a strong work ethic and a self-help stance on economic disadvantage. The most recent urban farming movement in Detroit is potentially of a different ilk as it is more a grassroots effort, as opposed to an official policy, but there are many similarities with past manifestations of this idea. Detroit is once more on the map, so to speak, because of its \"innovative\" urban farms which are seen as making use of unused land and as a positive, constructive response to urban poverty and scarcity. The future of the current urban farming movement in Detroit is anyone's guess as the local economy improves, but it is useful to understand that it is drawing on a tradition started with Pingree's potato patches, and potentially sharing some of the same soil."],"display_date":"March 31, 1896","search_date":"1896-03-31","locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1905,"tag":"Urban Farm"},{"id":1904,"tag":"Pingree"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1908,"tag":"Garden"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5836,"title":"Whiskey Bottles Thrown in the River Rouge","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"5/1/09","end_date":"5/31/09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When the sheriff told Frank Akey that the whiskey bottle he had confiscated the night before was now at the bottom of the River Rogue, Akey promptly ran into the town and let everyone know.

The rapid expansion of urban populations led to concerns that the remaining farmers would not be able to grow enough to feed them all. Some urban intellectuals suggested that people should move “Back to the Farm” in order to ensure a sufficient food supply for the country.","In September of 1910, for example, an article in the Detroit Free Press used the upcoming census as a chance for people to react to both urban and rural growth. The author believed that after decades of urban growth, the country would finally outnumber the cities nationwide. The author attributes this shift to the disadvantages of country life compared to the urban advantages of technological advancements such as the trolley, the telephone and mail. He also suggests that farmers should make a lot of money because they have to feed all the people in the cities.","Almost exactly one year later, another editorial with similar themes was published about the \"Back to the Farm\" movement. A sociologist named Dr. L.H. Balley from Cornell opposes the movement, saying that there are enough farmers to feed the cities. He calls for a \"co-ordinate relationships between city and surrounding rural areas\" where both city and farm living is healthy for the well-being of the human population as a whole.  The author in the Detroit Free Press editorial is enraged at this doctor and angrily questions the existence of sociology and the doctor grouping society as a whole instead of leaving it up to the free will of individuals to make choices.","A few days later, a third article stated that Thomas Edison visited Austria and declared that everyone should have a small plot of land to grow food for themselves and their families. He says that “rural life is the basis for human happiness,” and calls urban settings “artificial.”","The arguments in this series of editorials sets up the city and countryside as polar opposites, when they are actually inherently related. We see the relationship between the cities and the countryside in the first two editorials, where the city-dwellers depend on the produce from the countryside to feed themselves and their families.

This led to blacks and whites competing for the same positions, with additional issues arising when a black man rose higher in the company than his white colleagues. Many suggest that an incident regarding housing had a direct impact on the riots. Since much of the housing for African Americans was overcrowded and in deplorable conditions, the government built a new housing project for some African American workers. Some white citizens believed that they should live there instead so the government handed it over to them. After much objection, the government once again returned it the African Americans.

Cummings recollects not only the violence of the days that followed, in which arson and looting were commonplace and 2,000 buildings were destroyed, but also how the riots impacted his ability to buy property. Business owners were eager to sell their businesses “almost on your terms” out of fear that another riot would occur to further lower property values. The 1967 riots only ended after five days as a result of troops from the Army, sent in by then President Lyndon B. Johnson, and the Michigan National Guard, sent in by then Governor George W. Romney.

Black Bottom is an example of how whites attempted to contain blacks in certain parts of the City of Detroit, out of fear that blacks would negatively affect the entire city if given the opportunity to live anywhere they chose. Thus, many homes built before the 1967 riots were built with a restrictive covenant that prohibited the selling of the home to blacks. The riots of 1967 foreshadowed continued racial tension between whites and blacks, and led whites to fear that another revolt by blacks would ensue. In the aftermath of the race riots, many whites decided to move outside of the City of Detroit to its suburbs for the safety of their families and to ensure that they could continue their business elsewhere without fear of another civil unrest.

Many of the Black leaders tried to encourage the angry masses to cool down, but their efforts went nowhere.","The Detroit Rebellion of 1967 can be attributed to multiple social injustices against Blacks. It is ultimately believed that people grew tired of unfair practices and rose up to force change. The Black population had grown tired of unfair housing policies such as \"Urban Renewal\" which displaced countless low income African American families in the 1950s so that highways for example could be built. The African American residents were also tired of being harrased by policemen who were predominately White. Although some of the actions taken by many in the Black community can be called into question (i.e. looting and general vandalism) it is believed that the people felt so oppressed by the social systems of the time that they had no other choice. Therefore their actions are viewed by many as a act of rebellion against an oppressive system and not a riot which connotes lawless behavior and is without meaningful purpose.","Despite the lives that were lost and all the property damage that resulted from the 1967 rebellion, twenty years later some things still seemed unchanged or in some instances appeared to be worse.  Blacks in Detroit still faced staggering unemployment numbers and often times nicer housing was not accessible for all Blacks.

As the designer of the first municipal park in America, he is considered the father of landscape architecture. With his pioneering expertise cultivated through years of follow-up work, Olmstead wrote an explanation for future planning of Belle Isle Park, a “gem” in the midst of the Detroit river, which runs between the United States and Canada. In it, Olmstead claimed that the possibilities for Belle Isle were as great as in his other works, such as Central Park in New York City, Mount Royal Park in Quebec, and the Emerald Necklace in Boston, Massachusetts. His plan for Belle Isle envisioned capitalizing on the island's existing wooded areas as the park's central attraction, and nurturing the trees into a majestic forest. He also saw the island's fields as possibly the best area for a marching band in all the Parks of the United States, and the rivers that ran through the island an attraction for boaters and fishermen. Olmstead also warned that fluctuations in economy would harm a city owned park if not properly addressed from the beginning. He advised that what the city may consider financially rewarding in the short term, such as a new recreation building, lessens the value in the park if not properly funded and maintained. These words would seem prophetic in the early twenty-first century, when city managers are struggling with strategies for maintaining the municipal use of Belle Isle.","Olmstead's plan was an early visualization of how parks and nature are not separate, but can exist symbiotically. The idea of a wilderness is a constructed ideology. A park which includes shelters and buildings for relaxing would not be shattering a pristine wilderness, but instead make the area more attractive for visitors. His vision of the park is also one that looks holistically at Belle Isle, as the park becomes a maintained organism. His vision to utilize the natural rivers as an attraction for boaters, and the trees as an inspiration for the architecture for future buildings, show how human interaction with Belle Isle was shaped by the island's natural resources.

Detroit, being the more powerful entity in the relationship, did end up annexing Delray, and quieting the voices of opposition that resided there. This semi-hostile takeover is an important consideration in the context of urban metabolism, and the important transition from city to metro. Even today, Delray still internalizes the environmental degradation that provides industrial outputs to Detroit. It is clear then, that both history and path dependency determine who wins and who loses as a metro gobbles up different pieces of the region, and there power dynamics, infused with many complex socio-cultural issues infuse it all."],"display_date":1905,"search_date":"1905-07-02","locations":[{"id":50025,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"},{"id":704,"tag":"Urbanization"},{"id":58,"tag":"Industry"},{"id":2031,"tag":"Annexation"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5860,"title":"Tracing the Ribbons","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/15","end_date":"12/31/15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["This is a story that spans centuries of history, beginning in the 1700s with the French settlement of Detroit. The Detroit of the mid-18th century would have looked very different from the sprawling metropolis of today. Where the imposing skyscrapers of Detroit's downtown now dominate the riverfront, there would have been a sparsely populated settlement consisting of humble farms built along the river and extending a few miles inland. These narrow, elongated, side-by-side farm plots with riverfront access known as \"ribbon farms\" may seem to be relegated to the historical imaginary as the complexity and denisty of land use in modern Detroit does not seem to betray any remnant of this pastoral history. However, the ordering logic of the ribbon farms can be seen through the modern infrastructure and development that has buried it. Like a palimpsest, the farms of the French settlers can be traced out beneath the streets of the city.","In a 1915 real estate atlas of Detroit, long after the ribbon farms had disappeared beneath an urban, industrialized landscape, the original boundaries of the plots are still marked on the margins of the map.  While this may at first seem counterintuitive given that these plots do not correspond with the land use of 1915 Detroit, a closer look reveals that many of Detroit's streets roughly traced the boundary lines of the French ribbon farms. For instance, Dequindre Street extended from the river in a line that almost perfectly traced the eastern edge of the former Dequindre farm plot. Detroit grew up piecemeal from the ribbon farm plots as they were sold off through the 18th and early 19th centuries and thus, even after Detroit had long forgotten its agricultural beginnings, one could and still can trace the ribbon farms in the design of the urban fabric.","This story of the layering of human land use makes an important point about the study of history, especially in an urban area in which the intense pressure for development leads to a high turnover in land use. Human history, in the absence of iconic landmarks such as pyramids or the like, is often discussed in abstract terms that, while certainly a proper workout for one's imaginative capabilities, do not always resonate with an understanding of ecological or geological history which attest to an immense, temporal depth to natural and man-made events. This abstraction of historical reality becomes especially problematic when it does not take the trained eye of an archaeologist to trace out the patterns of former events and practices, such as in the streets of Detroit. By recognizing how historical land use can still order our present reality we can likewise gain a better perspective on how human interactions with an environment have a profound and lasting impact on said environment."],"display_date":1915,"search_date":"1915-07-02","locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":1948,"tag":"Ribbon Farm"},{"id":769,"tag":"Map"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1965,"tag":"New France"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5867,"title":"Construction of the Ambassador Bridge","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/27","end_date":"12/31/29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When construction of the Ambassador Bridge began in 1927, railroads that met ferries connected Windsor, on the Canadian side of the Detroit River, with the city of Detroit. The bridge to Canada created an artery of commerce, and would maintain a position of great importance in trade between the two cities for decades to come. The bridge would go on to connect I-75, I-96, and Hwy 3. Creating this fluid transportation of goods through the city contributed to the need for a freeway system connecting to the bridge. As the suburbs began to grow, expressways into and through the city doubled as trade corridors, at the cost of subdividing and transforming the city below them.","When the company owning the bridge went public in 1979, Detroit native Manuel Moroun, the largest private landowner in the state, acquired the bridge through a large-scale stock buy.

However, the narrative of economic progress for blacks is not the most important component of this street’s rich history.

This freedom gave a sense of pride and achievement, which could be celebrated after historical wins by legendary boxer Joe Louis.

There was a complete disregard for the sense of community and quality of life many residents had created. Sure, the housing was inadequate and city services were awful, but the Blacks who lived there due to housing discrimination had created a living situation that was fun, safe, and prosperous. The city only saw the community for its deplorable living conditions which they refused to rectify. Instead they displaced countless families through urban renewal.

Behind them is a heavily wooded shoreline, and what seems to be a bridge.  The photo is taken after Frederick Law Olmsted, then America's premiere landscape architect, had proposed his plan for Belle Isle’s design.

Olmsted probably envisioned waterways in the park for boating and recreation (and not fishing) because he saw nature as a place for reverence and use.  The artificial waterways he planned are inherently for “use” as the original land would be altered, but the boat users would still be able to enjoy their natural surroundings. Olmsted's vision was also one that matched that of the upper class, who had the time and money to boat and use the water for leisure.  Working class families did not have this luxury; perhaps the men in the photo are fishing to feed their families.

The project held two different residental areas: Parkside Homes for white people, and Brewster Homes for black people. Eugene P. Opperman was named Resident Manager of Parkside and George A. Isabell was named Resident Manager of Brewster. Their first duties included overseeineg the applicant process for potential tenants, which was very strict. Caution was taken to ensure that \"the spirit and intent of these low-rent projects\" was upheld. Eligibility requirements included such things as inspection of the potential tenants' current living conditions, their fitness, their moral credit, and their income, as that one member of each family in the projects was required to have a full-time job. Many families who moved into the projects came from \"miserable, damp, unhealthful quarters\" where overcrowding was common and alleyways were considered backyards. To aid in giving these low-income renters a better place to live, the Brewster projects were built near the factory in which many tenants worked, so that they could walk to work and easily get back home. By the end of December of the first year, 539 tenants had moved into the available 775 units of Parkside and 551 tenants had moved into the available 701 units of Brewster. Applications for Parkside currently totaled 5,951 and 6,059 for Brewster respectively. The projects were praised as a way to provide decent, healthy, and safe living conditions in new beautiful neighborhoods that would offer Detroit's poor \"a new lease on life\".","This government-documented account of the initial ideas and creation behind Detroit's low-income public housing projects provide an excellent representation of historical environmental racism in three significant ways. First, this account from the Michigan Housing Commission shows that historically, \"the spatiality of racism is not understood, particularly the relationship between places\" (Pulido). Even accounting for the acceptance of racism at the time (such as segregated housing and creating more units for Whites, despite a higher demand from Blacks) this document still holds underlying environmentally racist issues, with the most prominent being that the housing units for Blacks were located closest to the factories, where air pollution was surely present. These neighborhoods might not have been any safer than the old ones, especially considering the amount of polluted emissions allowed in the 1940's, despite being praised on a national scale as a great step towards a safe and happy city. The placement in Detroit in which these houses were designated was not environmentally equal to those given to Whites, yet allowed to occur on the claim of mass transportation ease. Second, this document illustrates how heavily the government was involved in assessing the morality of tenants moving into the projects by determining their current living conditions as a way to assess their moral character. This coincides with ideas of the time that those who lived in poor and dirty areas were bad people, instead of realizing the political system that may have put them in such conditions. Finally, this document provides rationale behind the first step to Detroit's larger \"slum clearance\" plans to come later in the '60's. The African-Americans who were moved into the projects had been forced to leave the area they already lived in (Blackbottom) to make way for a highway. By marketing the projects as a beautiful new place to live, the government justitied their plans as best for the city and its people. However, we know today that there are many historical accounts of the injustice behind this plan, since Blackbottom was alternatively considered by its community as a vibrant neighborhood with alleyways - that the government called dirty and unsafe - serving as largely communal family spaces for gathering and growing urban gardens. Overall, this document shows that the environmental relationship and Detroit's city planner's allocation of home and neighborhood played a big part of the injust racism in Detroit's old African-American neighborhood of Blackbottom, despite being perceived quite differently at the time."],"display_date":1938,"search_date":"1938-07-02","locations":[{"id":22722,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1993,"tag":"Parkside Homes"},{"id":1992,"tag":"Brewster Homes"},{"id":1969,"tag":"Public housing"},{"id":1968,"tag":"Blackbottom, Detroit"},{"id":1921,"tag":"Housing discrimination"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5871,"title":"Home is a relative term","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/30","end_date":"12/31/39","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Between 1920 and 1970, millions of Blacks migrated from the South in pursuit of job opportunities in the manufacturing industry of the Midwest and Northeast.

The Detroit River, the natural barrier between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan, would often freeze up and interrupt shipments between the trading partners. Shipping vessels could only be hopeful for an “open” winter. Even then, ships could take upwards of two hours to cross the river, leaving thousands of cars stuck on both sides with no way to proceed. With 389,239 railroad cars ferried across the Detroit River in 1887, the railroad industry had special interests in a railroad bridge to reduce its dependency on ferries. As bridges and tunnels began to spring up (and down) in other parts of the world in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, such as the Mersey Tunnel in England or the cantilever on the Hudson River in Poughkeepsie, the McMillian Bill outlined plans for an international bridge between Windsor and Detroit.","Along with the idea of the bridge came multiple voices with suggestions on how to satisfy the immediate necessity for more rapid transfer of cars. The options were either a low bridge, high bridge, or tunnel. The option of a low bridge was eliminated as it would obstruct vessel movements along the water. The option of a tunnel depended on the feasibility and cost of such an engineering feat. While the Michigan Central Railway Station supported the construction of a bridge over a tunnel, the company was not in favor of the private company, Lindenthal Co., given the rights to build the bridge. Henry Russell, the attorney for the Central, claimed Lindenthal was an irresponsible company that only wanted to build a monumental, multimillion dollar infrastructure to honor itself. Detroit merchants critized the planned location of the railroad terminal for being too far from the downtown business district and other existing railroad terminals.

In 1927, just before the City Airport was constructed, the tank was a well-known landmark by pilots and passengers from all over the country. Spilos left the city for a while and upon his return in 1947 everything was changed. A place that once had a running creek, farm, and woods was now turning into the standard industrial city. With factories like Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, and Briggs moving into the city alongside the huge gas holder, Spilos couldn’t help but notice and document the radical changes he experienced in such a short period of time to a city he once knew so well.  He said, “The first thing one notices is the odor and the sound of dripping splashing tar… At times the tar leaks through and slides down the walls into the reservoir at the base of the tank.”","Changing landscapes can help or hurt a city, and for the Connor Creek neighborhood in Detroit, the latter is more applicable unfortunately.

Beginning work in the coal mines in DuBois, PA, John faced dire circumstances both down in the mines and above ground: whatever wages he earned were owed to the company store for sustenance before he even resurfaced with his pay. Given an opportunity to escape the mines, John moved to Detroit as an auto factory worker, promised a \"magnificent sum of $5 a day.\" Leading up to the Depression, as auto company layoffs and changeovers began, John harbored dreams of staring a grocery store, a dream to which he came one step closer when he began renting a candy shop on Hanson and Cicotte. Shortly after, John was finally able to take up renting a \"grocery-butcher shop with living quarters,\" fulfilling his dream. Working from 6:45 AM to 9:45 PM, John loved every moment and created a \"village meeting place\" equipped with the only telephone in the area. John even began extending credit to local patrons and ended every transaction with \"a little schnapps\" and a candy bar for each of the men's children. John was happy, and \"everyone was happy,\" until rationing and shortages brought on by the Second World War forced him to close the store and return to factory work. Though John never fully regained the losses from the outstanding credit, John remained \"happy and optimistic\" since he had \"achieved his dream, lived a good life, and loved his country with a passion.\"","John's fierce optimism and devotion to his community was characteristic of the time period as Sidney Fine writes in his biography of Frank Murphy. He describes the \"widespread belief in the United States before 1929 that a person who wished to work could find employment,\" a sentiment that is exhibited by John's dreams to leave a steady position and risk opening his own store. Frank Murphy, the mayor of Detroit leading up to and during the Great Depression, believed that citizens of Detroit should expect that their government should aid those in distress due to unemployment, stating that \"no one in this great city of plenty...must be allowed to go hungry, or cold, or unhoused, or unclothed.\" This belief led Murphy to start the Mayor's Unemployment Committee (MUC) to help to address issues of unemployement by sharing the importance of the issue with the whole community and framing the issue in a new light. MUC went on to establish several new programs, once of which was the Detroit thrift-gardens, a program that echoed the work of Hazen Pingree and his \"potato patches.\" In addition to providing much-needed food to the unemployed, Murphy believed that \"the psychological effect of idleness of large groups of our people...[is] dangerous to the safety and morale of the country\" and that the projects could help to cultivate work ethic for the unemployed. Though originally unsuccessful, the project eventually proved to provide work for the unemployed and allowed them to stay mentally and physically fit until they found another job while contributing to the greater community."],"display_date":"1925 - 1935","search_date":"1930-07-02","locations":[{"id":21386,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"},{"id":21832,"lat":41.000231092,"lng":-78.474128629,"zoom":9,"place":"Clearfield, Pennsylvania"}],"tags":[{"id":1978,"tag":"Unemployment"},{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1111,"tag":"World War I"},{"id":1908,"tag":"Garden"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5875,"title":"The Wealth of Michigan Lies in the Soil","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-02-23","end_date":"1842-02-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1842, <em>The Signal of Liberty</em>, a small newspaper associated with the Liberty Party of Michigan, published an article detailing the current state of agriculture in Michigan and the uncertainty surrounding its future.

Josiah Snow, a prominent Detroit resident, urged every town in Michigan to send petitions to Congress to demonstrate the state's unity on the issues facing what he described as their most important industry. Michigan's grain production exceeded New England's, New York's, and Ohio's making its economy especially vulnerable to restrictive policies.

Competition and high tariffs in eastern states, as well as Michigan's relatively cheap land, drove many small farmers from the east coast to migrate to Detroit and the surrounding areas. Between 1830 and 1840, the population of Detroit increased 309 percent due largely to the agricultural draw. The population of Southern Michigan would only continue to increase in the twentieth century, as its focus shifted to manufacturing, but the agricultural focus of the mid 1800's made it an immigration hub for people from all over the country and contributed greatly to Detroit's development as an influential metropolitan center."],"display_date":"February 23, 1842","search_date":"1842-02-23","locations":[{"id":6594,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5876,"title":"An Afternoon at the Belle Isle Conservatory","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/10","end_date":"12/31/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["It’s 1910, and the Horticultural Building on Belle Isle in Detroit has become a popular attraction since its construction eight years earlier.

As the city further declined Belle Isle remained a city park with many other recreational uses for the people of Detroit, but was beginning to fall into disrepair. The raceway was again revived in 2007 as part of the Indy circuit, only to be cancelled by 2009 due to the particularly heavy impact of economic crisis on Detroit's auto industry.","Perhaps the island would have remained better off without the extensive changes made to its roads and landscape by accommodating these large auto races and the corporate promotion that accompanies them. Mayor Oscar Marx had firmly rejected the prospect of holding the 1913 Vanderbilt races upon the Isle as he was unwilling to “turn Belle Isle over to promoters who are seeking to make money” purely because it “belongs to the people” and should not be profited from. Marx's assertion that the park and island is property of all of the people of Detroit reflects the divisive, longstanding dominant narrative of ownership of Belle Isle. As the park's administration grappled with acceptable uses of the park and the representation of privately owned property and spaces, the funding for the park has experienced periods of plenty and poverty, culminating in the late 2013 decision by the struggling city of Detroit to lease the island to the State of Michigan to ensure its upkeep and longevity."],"display_date":"June 1993","search_date":"1993-06-15","locations":[{"id":41645,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1997,"tag":"racing"},{"id":1996,"tag":"Grand Prix"},{"id":1901,"tag":"Belle Isle"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5886,"title":"Market Mingling","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"9/10/32","end_date":"9/10/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the 1930s, Detroit’s Western Market was bustling with hundreds of farmers, buyers, and city dwellers.  Trucks were arranged as close as possible and numbers of large baskets containing fresh produce lined the surrounding area.

Popular opinion was, by and large, in favor of the city of Detroit supplying the workers to build the bridge. Additionally, they felt that the city should also own and run the bridge.

The pamphlet extolled the consolidation itself, the reorganization and expansion projects since then, and described the future Department's future plans. Despite the wartime restrictions and the depression, the Department's first six years introduced a number of significant new programs in Detroit, including city-owned horseback riding, canoe rentals through Belle Isle Park, expansion plans for picnics and playgrounds, the increased productivity of the Belle Isle Greenhouse run by the Horticulture Association, and the consolidated management of six swimming pools throughout the city.","After President Franklin D.

This increase strained the recreational facilities for those who wanted to escape their job in the industrial sector.

Crime was at an all time high, the economy was in decline, and race relations of the city were in shambles. These issues were directly related to the changing demographics of the city. According to a map produced as part of a teacher training project for Detroit public schools, much of the city was geographically divided into distinct ethnic communities. The map shows designated ethnic groups throughout Detroit that compromise 50% or more of the areas' population. Identified ethnic groups included Blacks, Whites, Germans, Polish, Italians, Jewish, Mexicans, Greek, and Middle Eastern, among others. There was a heavy Polish and Italian presence in Northeast Detroit, in comparison to the rest of the city, which was majority African American. There were also quite a few areas that were indicated as having “mixed” ethnic groups, but the actual composition of this status was not indicated. Even with this, the black presence in the core of the city is very clear and well displayed on the map.","The earliest European immigrants came largely from France in the early part of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, mainly as fur traders and missionaries. Later, farming replaced fur trading as the state's primary economic activity and more immigrants began to settle. In 1825 the first wave of German immigration to Detroit began; the Irish began in 1830. This growth continued through 1890s with Polish immigrants settling as well. During the great migrations of African Americans from the south happened between 1910 and 1980 when the African American population multiplied over 100 times. Today, the Hispanic population of Detroit is rapidly increasing which started after 1940. All of these changes in waves of migration to Detroit are indicative of major international changes happening to the city in trade industries, during the war era, and during industrialization.","For a half-century beginning in the 1950s, Detroit lost nearly half of its population, almost all whites; so, there is even less diversity in the city today. Detroit has ranked among the 10 most segregated metropolitan areas in the United States since the mid-20th century.

The John C. Lodge Freeway was one of the many attractions gaining Detroit much of its attention. An aerial photograph taken in 1950 shows the city's complex and multifaceted highway system starting to take form. The photo depicts a portion of Detroit’s East Side along with an early M-10 freeway, still under construction. Today, construction of massive freeway systems is widely considered one of the main factors behind Detroit’s decline, and this photo shows how the freeway projects split neighborhoods and sectioned off large portions of the city. The freeway bisected the predominantly African-American Black Bottom and Paradise Valley neighborhoods, and was part of a larger \"slum clearance\" campaign by the city that wiped out many low-income communities without providing relocation or other services for former residents. Upon closer examination of the photo it is clear that without a car it would take some time to get across this new structure and venture to another portion of the city. In the northwest part of the city, a large area filled with countless blocks of recently constructed houses is visible, just where the freeway ends. The cranes shown at the end of the freeway suggest further expansion of M-10 into the neighboring residential areas, demonstrating the city's commitment to the growing suburbs.","The John C. Lodge freeway was just one of many projects happening across the country that made the inner cities less appealing and added to the appeal of suburbia for those who could afford it - or those who were not excluded by segregationist housing policies. In “Beautiful and Terrible: Aeriality and the Image of Suburbia,” author D.J. Waldie showcases a gallery of aerial photos that show the construction of future cookie-cutter suburbs in Southern California. Waldie notes that the developers of suburbs like these and projects like the Lodge were proud of such grand construction and expansion: aerial photographs of the projects frequently appeared in magazines and received high praise and admiration for the future they would bring. Photographs like these had significant impacts on the way the projects were perceived by the public, and were understood at the time as signs of progress, while today many of us focus more on their more problematic and overlooked aspects. Regardless of the viewer's perspective, however, it is certain that the highways would forever alter the city."],"display_date":"April 8, 1950","search_date":"1950-04-08","locations":[{"id":28980,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1510,"tag":"Suburbanization"},{"id":1989,"tag":"freeways"},{"id":1953,"tag":"Urban Renewal"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5902,"title":"Hungarians in Delray: Maintaining a Beautiful Neighborhood in Spite of Criticisms","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"10/18/11","end_date":"10/18/11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Early 20<sup>th</sup> century Detroit underwent major demographic changes, which were not easily accepted by those Americans who already lived there.

In response to Delray residents' concerns, the Reverend E. H.

However, the bureaucratized vision of it was something that was, if not new, at least enhanced in the Detroit Thrift Gardens program.  The vacant lot gardening program of the 1890s was concerned with tracking economic input and estimating output but was never quite so meticulous as the thrift garden program, which, besides its registration forms that mirrored a census data form in the nature of their queries, had an official pledge that each gardener had to sign.  The pledge laid out the ground rules for participation in the program, which included an agreement not to sell any of the produce grown, to design and manage the plot in a specific spatiotemporal manner, and an agreement to statistically track the progress of the garden plot, among other things.  Some of these pledges established a program that was much more strictly controlled than a similar program in the 1890s had been: for instance, the restriction on selling surplus produce which was not only permitted but encouraged in the nineteenth-century vacant lot gardening program.  This increase in bureaucratic management could be read in a variety of ways but something that should be considered is that while both programs were framed as a consumptive alternative for poor urban dwellers who could not afford produce the vacant lot gardens of 1893 were also understood to be a means of naturalizing and potentially ruralizing recently immigrated Eastern European populations.","It is startling what can be gleaned from the most seemingly mundane bureaucratic documents.  Often, the unexpectedly fascinating history of faceless government agencies is obscured behind the veil of boring that seems to pervade bureaucracy.  However, what is being concealed, beyond simply the untold history of the mundane, is the assumptions and social logic that serve as frameworks and operating principles for these institutions.  More importantly, the operation of power and the central role that institutions, even small-scale institutions such as the Detroit Thrift Gardens program, serve in shaping the way people live and interact with the world.  The thrift gardens, for instance, were a highly managed form of urban land-use that, through bureaucratic tools and channels, shaped the appearance of urban agriculture and shaped people’s relations to it."],"display_date":1933,"search_date":"1933-07-02","locations":[{"id":22722,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1081,"tag":"The Great Depression"},{"id":1930,"tag":"Urban Agriculture"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5907,"title":"Great Depression Gardens","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/31","end_date":"12/31/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Immediately following the Great Depression, the Mayor’s Unemployment Committee (MUC) established a thrift-garden program in Detroit.  Between 1931 and 1932, the height of the program, the gardens supplied food and benefits for about 20,000 people.  Experienced gardeners would create model gardens for thrift gardeners to follow, who were either welfare clients or those near the verge of dependency.  Experienced gardeners also seemed to mange and oversee the workers and land, sitting outside of sheds on the perimeter of the land.  They were dressed well, considering that it was the time of the depression, wearing white button-down shirts, ties, brimmed hats, and slacks.

On November 4th, 1946, Conner Park Flowers officially opened their first location on the corner of Gratiot and Conner Ave, where it still stands and operates today.","In the forties, a refridgerator was still a luxury item, especially a refridgerator large enough to store all their flowers. So they kept their flowers fresh on slabs of ice sized fifty to one-hundred pounds, delivered daily by the ice man. The flowers that the shop provided were similar to those you could find at the Eastern Market, grown locally by farmers in surrounding rural communities.","This all changed when members of a fleet of famed pilots from the Pacific Theatre of WWII, nicknamed the \"Flying Tigers,\" decided to start an independent business flying perishables from the West Coast and Hawaii to major cities in the Midwest. Now Conner Park Florist could provide exquisit and rare tropical flowers from the Pacific islands, like the Bird of Paradise and different types of delicate orchids, or sunflowers during any season of the year!","Today the original Conner Park Florist building is still owned and operated by the Adamo brothers, along with a location in Grosse Pointe Woods and Morang Drive Greenhouses.","My grandfather was someone who loved the beauty of nature and especially the happiness that it could bring to other people's lives, via a surprise bouquet or plant. As a florist, he was a vehicle for bringing nature into the heart of one of the country’s most industrial cities. His flower shop formed part of a network of production and distribution that linked the rural places where flowers were grown and the people who grew them with the city and its residents. At first, this network was primarily local, and was one example of how Michigan farmers and other producers relied on the city for their survival, and of the way that the city in turn relied on its hinterland. Over time, the network expanded globally, linking bouquets in Detroit to distant and complicated factors like the environmental conditions of the Pacific Islands and the cost of airplane fuel. This is one example of what historian Richard Wright has described as an “organic machine,” in which both technologies and natural features are inextricably tied together."],"display_date":"November 4, 1976 - December 4, 1999","search_date":"1988-05-20","locations":[{"id":35437,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2035,"tag":"Greenhouses"},{"id":2034,"tag":"Packard Plant"},{"id":2033,"tag":"Flower shop"},{"id":2032,"tag":"Flowers"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":1950,"tag":"Eastern Market"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5916,"title":"\"If you plant a seed in the city...\": A History of the Detroit Seed Company","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-01-01","end_date":"1881-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Detroit Seed Company was founded by D.M.

Detroiters displayed high rates of obesity and other diet-related health issues.","D-Town Farm was created by the Detroit Black Community Food Security Network in 2006.

He wanted the black community to have control over all aspects of their lives, including food.","Yakini's organization believes that all people, including African Americans living in inner-city areas, deserve healthy, fresh and afforable food, and D-Town Farm is one of their many answers to this. The farm uses \"sustaianble, earth-friendly food production techniques\" to produce more than thirty five different types of crops. They sell their acorn squash, zucchini, kale, collards, tomatoes, basil, green beans, cabbage, watermelon, pumpkins, beets, turnips, radishes and more at Detroit farmers markets.Since their birth, they have added beekeeping, hoop-houses for year-round production and composting facilities.

They use farming as a \"community-based resistance strategy with a political change initiative\". The farm takes on the role of the city's closed parks and community centers, uniting families and people of all ages through labor. They have annual events like the Harvest Festival where health professionals offer free support services.","The farm also fosters self-reliance in a system of racial and class privilege that disempowers people of color. Instead of petitioning their government for more stores, the citizens develop agency by feeding their families themselves. But food is just the beginning. It empowers African American's to discuss how to gain control over other aspects of their own lives like education, housing and clean water, resisting the system through taking direct action.","D-Town Farm is not the first time that food has been used as a form of black resistance.

The privately owned island is off limits to the public and there is little known about what occurs on the island. In contrast to Zug Island’s hazy present, the island had much more transparent days in the past. Located at the opening of the River Rouge, the peninsula was purchased by Samuel Zug as a potential investment. However, the marshy land made the land uninhabitable. Zug allowed the River Rouge Improvement Company turn the peninsula into an island in 1888 as a way to better connect River Rouge to the Detroit River.","In 1891, George Brady and Charles Noble purchased the island from Zug for $300,000 with plans of turning the land into an isolated industrial dumping ground for the booming manufacturing companies in nearby Delray. While searching for gas in the marshy grounds, Noble and Brady struck salt beneath their new property. A geological survey showed that the land beneath the island contained a wealth of limestone and salt. A well 1,620 feet deep was set up on the island to retrieve salt and limestone. Salt was used to create soda ash, used in manufacturing of glass, and other by-products used in manufacturing. The island’s strategic location allowed ease of transportation and made the island a desirable location for industries. in 1895, the exposition building for the International Exposition and Fair of 1889 was torn down in favor of the new Solvay Processing Company, a prominent soda ash producer. The plant was located across the River Rouge from Zug Island and on the Detroit River waterfront, serving useful for importing raw materials and exporting finished goods. The company had wells covering 100 acres of Zug Island where the salt is extracted, and then brought over to be processed into soda ash. Within a decade of the grand exposition, the grand was cleared for salt mining interests. By prioritizing heavy industry opportunities, Delray continues to invite heavy industry into the village.","While Zug Island is no longer a source for salt, petroleum coke and steel are still being produced on the island.

Complete with a cheerful cartoon of a happy, gardening family, the article discusses the success of war gardens and the spreading popularity of Victory Gardens in the aftermath of the war.  The National War Garden Commission of Washington stood behind this message, encouraging continued participation throughout 1919 and even incentivizing readers to donate funds (two cents) to the commission with the promise of a garden book for every 2-cent stamp received.  The National War Garden Commission hoped messages like this one would evoke feelings of nationalism and empower citizens to contribute to the food production effort from their own homes.","Victory Gardens, like the ones mentioned in this article, were a continuation of the war gardens, that began in an effort to help with the food shortage experienced as many young men left their farms to fight in World War 1.  These gardens sprang up in American backyards all over the United States, and the National War Garden Commission was created to monitor the progress of these gardens and encourage participation even after the armistice.  These forms of urban farming differed from many of the grassroots movements that utilized agriculture as a activism, in that victory gardens were backed and publicized by the federal government in a national campaign.  Victory Gardens were portrayed as pathways to US prosperity and rebuilding in the wake of the devastation of the war.  Many cities, like Detroit, converted vacant land to be cultivated by citizens.  In this way, the community and its members came together through pooled resources to participate in a small act of patriotism towards their country.  Within Michigan, Detroit’s victory garden design and campaigns were copied in other areas such as Hyland Park.  Cities like these used this model to begin planting gardens in elementary schools and junior highs in an effort to keep children interested and involved in the war efforts.

Despite its short tenure as a facet of the urban environment of Detroit, city plots abounding in vegetables would flourish in the public imagination for years to come. In 1908, during a hard winter for employment, an editorial in the Detroit Free Press calls for the redeployment of a vacant lot gardening scheme. It makes an appeal to the resounding success of the Pingree program and stresses the fact therefore that as a measure for reducing unemployment it would not require any experimentation. The author also points out the existence of vacant lots as a space in which imagined gardens could thrive. Almost a decade later, in a 1917 <em>Detroit Free Press </em>article, Pingree’s potato patches are again referred to as a potential solution for a city-wide food shortage.  The mayor at that time is stated as expressing his belief that a contemporary take on Pingree’s plan would resonate with the poor of the city as it would allow them to help themselves combat the famine.  Again, the success of the potato patch scheme is emphasized and its legacy is further elaborated upon.  It is evident that, far from vanishing after the termination of the program in 1897, Pingree’s potato patches lived on, populating vacant city lots with potential and imagined potatoes.","The cultivation of plants and the way in which we imagine the cultivation of plants is not a process that can merely be reduced to subsistence or economic motivations.  Labor, especially in the down-to-earth sense of agriculture, is embedded within a moral universe that valorizes the labor and the laborers and the product of the labor.  In the case of Pingree’s potato patches, there is a definite way in which the vacant lot gardening program as a historical artifact and the manner in which it was drawn on in times of perceived hardship carried with it notions about how to value the labor of the unemployed and the unemployed in general. In this sense then, the vacant lot gardening program served as something of a vehicle by which paternalistic sensibilities towards welfare and the poor were translated into different contexts and times."," "],"display_date":"1908 - 1917","search_date":"1912-12-31","locations":[{"id":50025,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1930,"tag":"Urban Agriculture"},{"id":1904,"tag":"Pingree"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5943,"title":"Victory Gardens and the Campaign for Frugality","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"2/1/42","end_date":"2/28/42","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1942, in the heat of the Second World War, the United States Department of Agriculture published a 16-page pamphlet to be distributed to homes and families across the United States.  The pamphlet was intended as an informational packet to facilitate the successful implementation of Victory Gardens in American’s backyards.  The pamphlet detailed the nutritional, economical, and national benefits of growing fruits and vegetables at home.  It provided detailed information on what to plant, how a garden should be laid out, and when to harvest.  It gave tips and pointers on raising produce, and stressed (many times) the absolute importance of creating a practical garden that could be grown and harvested without waste and with the intent of long-term, continuous production.","In World War II, Victory Gardens were encouraged to decrease the stress on the low food supply both abroad and at home.  The United States government produced posters, pamphlets, leaflets, cartoons, and other persuasive communication media in hopes that the public would see victory gardens as a way to aid in the war effort, and as a means of uniting with other fellow Americans under a common goal.  With food and resources so scarce, the pamphlets and leaflets were used to encourage frugality, and to convey waste as a symbol of anti-patriotism and an act against United States victory in the war.  Through these communication media on victory gardens, the United States government hoped to redirect the American consumer culture to reflect the direction of the country’s wartime needs.","Many persuasive campaigns by the government have failed due to Americans’ skepticism of government regulation and influence of personal values and behaviors, yet the World War II poster and pamphlet campaign “appears to have been effective in inculcating frugal consumption habits among home front consumers” (70).  It is likely that because of the war, Americans were more inclined to see government intervention into personal behaviors and values as protecting the common good of the nation. The common enemy the war produced allowed the government to campaign for frugality with more success than otherwise. The victory gardens of World War II are a perfect example of a successful poster/pamphlet/paper media frugality campaign.   By the end of the War, nearly 20 million Americans had their own gardens and 40% of the produce supply came from home-grown sources. Pamphlets, like the one produced by the Department of Agriculture, provided Americans with the information they needed to plant and harvest crops, as well as the message of the importance of frugality needed for the nation to win the war.  Urban agricultural campaigns centered around the production of food for security and independence would appear later in American history, especially during the civil right movement of the 1960s.  Though these campaigns differed, the 1940s ideal of food production by the individual to benefit a larger cause would continue to influence urban agriculture and farming movements of the future."],"display_date":"February 1942","search_date":"1942-02-14","locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1930,"tag":"Urban Agriculture"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":1719,"tag":"Victory Gardens"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5944,"title":"Black Bottom and Detroit's 1943 Riots","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"6/20/43","end_date":"6/22/43","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the aftermath of a riot that started on June 20, 1943 due to racial tension between whites and blacks, residents of Black Bottom and Paradise Valley try to repair their lives and their businesses.

Officials, on the other hand, opposed this plan. The actual move would require the cutting down of hundreds of trees in order to transport the casino. More would have to be removed at the new proposed site. Moving it on the frozen river was not an option either, as the citizens wanted, because the current was extremely strong. The entire length of the river never completely freezes.

She recalls that neighbors kept an eye on each other and their children, including her, creating a strong sense of unity in raising the community.","Teola P.

She notes that her friends and family were people who were \"poor but proud\" and determined to live their lives to the fullest. Often, her \"family\" was not real family at all as almost everyone on the block was lovingly claimed to be one of her cousins. She also accounts how familiies would often hold \"credit account(s)\" with stores and other businesses in the community so they could get items like groceries in between paydays or if they ran out.","George D. Ramsey, Sr., grew up in a flat at 952 E. Warren Ave, between Hastings and Rivard. He recalls his 18 years of childhood there as his \"Street of Dreams\". He fondly remembers childhood mischiefs, such as peeping through the windows of Cole Funeral Home to look at the bodies, sitting of the porch of noted jazz pianist Will Davis, and jumping across rooftops at the \"Booker T.\" apartment complex. He recalls \"death and despair\" always being present though, like visiting the Astoria Bar where police once shot a man and blood stained the street until next rainfall. Still, living next to a Do Wopp group, musical greatness, and a lively community showed George that great things could be realized in his neighborhood, and he always felt satisfied.","The above accounts are just a few of the many stories shared about the communal spirit of growing up in Black Bottom. There is often the saying that \"it takes a village to raise a child\" and that this held true in Detroit's Eastside. Many previous residents will similiarly reminisice on living with \"aunts\" & \"uncles\" that weren't biologically related, neighbors reprimanding other children as if they were their own, and feeling safe walking alone down the street, even for women at night. These residents knew they were poor, but almost all of them recall never feeling poor or middle class. Within the confines of their neighborhood, many as sheltered children recall feeling rich, and as if they had everything they needed in the world (despite the area having poor environmental conditions such as disease, poverty, and poor safety in housing). Moreover, there are a large amount of documented stories and photographs on the thriving economics of Hastings Street, to which so many residental streets turned off of. Theaters, Black-owned businesses, barborshops, and dime stores, were among many of the attractions along the street. Combined with Paradise Valley next door, it has been often said that neighborhoods of Black Detroit, like Black Bottom, were \"a city within a city\", created by the heavy segregation of the time.","Environmental racism predominantly includes creating the inequal distribution and equality of space, which ultimately defines where and how people live.

Some immigrated to America to escape punishment by Austrian authorities after defeat in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. At the turn of the century, 1.7 million Hungarians immigrated to America in hopes of chasing the “American Dream.” The waterfront industries, along with the Cadillac Clark Avenue plant, provided jobs for the immigrants and cultivated a Hungarian community in Delray.

The filth and litter that filled the alley ways and cramped cottages were breeding grounds for tuberculosis.

The 606 Horse Shoe Bar and Lounge, a popular spot in Paradise Valley, stands in the daylight with a few patrons congregating at its front. A sign attached to the front of the building informs those in the community about future musical talent. Located at 606 St. Antoine Street, this bar and lounge is accustomed to hosting people to and from, as it is utilized as a space for Blacks to have entertainment away from whites.

Today, the only aboveground section is a half-mile stretch before the Creek meets the Detroit River.  However, even this section has changed.  The course of the river’s mouth was completely altered in the early 2000s when a new water treatment plant was built: the direction of the creek was rotated and it no longer even actually flows into the river.  Instead, the Creek ends in little more than a small pond attached to the river; the flow essentially stops once it enters the treatment plant.  Both the treatment plant and the sewer are evidence of the many changes that have been instituted in Detroit, which have knowingly (and intentionally) changed the appearance of the area."],"display_date":"1924 - 1925","search_date":"1924-12-31","locations":[{"id":21386,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":1984,"tag":"Conner Creek"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5967,"title":"Detroit International Fair in Delray","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-01-01","end_date":"1899-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Detroit in the 1880s was growing, and seeking a reputation among the great cities of the era. When well-to-do citizens formed the exposition company, they imagined a fair that would marry agriculture and industry in a world class exposition. By early 1889, the exposition company had a capital stock of $500,000 to draw on, and the Detroit International Fair and Exposition became a reality.","Seventy two acres of unincorporated land where the Detroit and Rouge Rivers met, just south of Fort Wayne were chosen to host the fair. The countryside was valued at $150,000, and had long been enjoyed by canoeists, fishermen, and hunters.","The goal of the exposition was not only to showcase the city and state, but to draw attention to Detroit and boost its stature among other great cities. The advertisements for the fair struck this chord. Touted as the most handsome grounds in the world, little Delray to the southwest of Detroit was built up magnificently. There were to be wonderful displays of electric inventions and manufactures, as well as the \"finest blooded horses and cattle, sheep, swine, and poultry. Railcars and ferries pulled up right to the shores, \"beautifully located on the bank of the Detroit River.\"","Several important points can be drawn from these sources. One, the Solvay Process Company would go on to buy and build its factory on this very location. The easy access to the water, prelaid rail, and a city warm to industry all set this in motion. Two, the area exploded around the expostition, and the village of Delray would be incorporated, shortly after the annual fair halted, in 1897. Three, the fair was a harmony of agriculture and industry, in a beautiful area. In the decades after the fair Delray would itself change into industry and housing, and smokestacks would tower over a landscape that fair gowers and fisherman had enjoyed."],"display_date":1899,"search_date":"1899-07-02","locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2096,"tag":"International Fair"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":58,"tag":"Industry"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5968,"title":"The Closing of St. Mark's Episcopal Church of Delray, Detroit in 1922 Signlas Delray's Demographic Shift","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"2/18/22","end_date":"2/18/22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sunday February 19, 1922 marked the final day of services at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church in the Delray neighborhood of Detroit.  The Detroit Free Press announced its closure the day prior, February 18, 1922, in an article entitled “Delray Church to Close its Doors”. The article printed a photo of the front of the church, showing its elevated entry, tall pointed-arched windows, and the building’s rather extensive length. The church stood on West End Avenue and Thaddeus Street and first opened in 1897.  At that time, it was centered in quickly developing neighborhood of Delray and by 1911 it needed to be enlarged to sufficiently serve the growing community.  However, by 1922, the church was considered to be “in the heart of a foreign settlement” and not within the same proximity of its former visitors. The Episcopalians who previously frequented this church are cited as having mostly moved out of this area of Delray and into neighborhoods north of Fort Street.  Because of the population movement, the church lost most of its followers and could no longer be self-sustaining. Thus, it was forced to sell its property.","Because of Delray’s industrial development at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it naturally drew many immigrants looking for work. The predominately Hungarian population that settled in Delray opened their own churches, which were most often Catholic. The closing of the Episcopal Church thus illustrates the extent to which Hungarians transformed Delray into their own, (or as the article iterates- into a “foreign”) neighborhood. This demographic shift in Delray was summoned by the influx of factories and the availability of jobs for unskilled laborers, but as the immigrants form this phase of movement gained more skills and more income, they too would eventually move out of Delray and make way for a second great demographic shift after World War Two.  As with the closing of the Episcopal Church, Delray would later see far many more businesses close their doors as the demographics and population of Delray would continue to be in flux."],"display_date":"February 18, 1922","search_date":"1922-02-18","locations":[{"id":21386,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"},{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5969,"title":"Detroit International Exposition Fair of 1889: Delray Before Its Industries","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-08-17","end_date":"1889-09-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","<em>Harpers Weekly</em> devoted a large part of its August 17, 1889 issue to the upcoming Detroit International Exposition Fair, which would open exactly one month later on September 17, 1889.

These grand projects were built just southwest of Fort Wayne in Delray, and according to the engraving would be surrounded by bustling activity around the pavilions as well as significant boat traffic along the river, presumably bringing in hoards of tourists eager to visit the fair. The main building was designed by Louis Kamper in style that recalls great European palaces, and was prominently placed at the center axis of the engraving and at an angle that dramatically accentuated its long, ornamented halls.  The <em>Harpers </em>article points out proudly that it was “the largest building in the world erected exclusively for fair and exposition purposes,” and goes on to boast of the plethora of industries and activities that would be represented, from packaged seeds to stove manufacturers to musicians and a painting gallery with 300 artworks. The fair would be so large that the author said the only person capable of seeing everything in a day would have to be a “professional pedestrian.”","The event jumpstarted major construction projects in Delray. The city transformed the area by draining marshlands, clearing farms, building new roads and railways, and even constructing two additional docks to accommodate the anticipated increase in river-traffic.  The fair happened at a time when Detroit was bursting with economic and industrial activity and this event solidified its reputation as a booming city. The fair did draw a lot of attention, but afterwards, the structures did not remain. Delray also did not maintain this palatial appearance.

While it would be easy to say that this is why Delray was parceled off from Detroit as a whole, the location study does not connect any dots, or point any fingers. Instead it offers what has been clear in both the Master Plan of the City of Detroit and the Fisher Freeway Route Location Study: industry trumps all.","In the end, the recommended route from the Wayne County Road Commission would lead to the destruction of 1,954 residencies (including more than 400 multiple-family homes) and 33 industrial sites. The process of determining this route involved a massive effort to balance and divide a city, in order for the necessity of connectivity. Detroit was no longer growing, but the areas around it were. And they had resources to move. In the years prior to the construction of I-75 traffic jams were a major issue and the Ambassador Bridge was locked behind neighborhoods like Delray. The project was an effort to allow for the suburban commuters to enter the city, but also to facilitate the massive flow of resources through and into the inner city.","In the eyes of Detroit, the road was a necessity. But so was their industry, and Delray was front and center in the conflict of the two. What would happen was a balance that largely favored industry and avoided wealthier communities. Alternative proposals presented in the review show that while industry and residential were considered, residential uses were obviously given less weight. Not only this but Delray represented a path of least resistance. What could be defended as a somewhat natural divide, found itself in a relatively defenseless community. The people were largely poor, largely unable to put up a fight, and unable to move.","Industries along the river were largely unaffected by construction, as were the wealthier communities. The suburbs and industry, together the tax base, were aided by the additional connectivity. But the community of Delray suffered. The highway was the first major blow to the Delray community. Delray would face similar subjugation with a remodeled Waste Water Treatment, and to this day faces the challenge of industry over community.

One day Bell nearly drowned in the Detroit River but was saved by J. Adolphus, a white man who was fishing on the island. Bell and Adolphus fell in love and asked Stick in the Mud for his blessing in their marriage. Stick in the Mud refused to consent to the marriage, so Bell decided to run away to be with Adolphus. As Bell was escaping from the Island in her canoe, Stick in the Mud followed. As they neared the shore of Detroit, Adolphus saw the chase and took his own boat out to get Bell. As they neared each other, Stick in the Mud drew a gun and began to yell, “Bell, I’ll shoot!” but all he got out was “Bell, I’ll…” before a steam boat came through and crushed all three people, killing them and sending them to the bottom of the river. People on the shore had heard Stick in the Mud yell “Bell I’ll” and named the island “Belle Isle” from then on. This story is strange and ridiculous, however it does offer some insight into the feelings of people about Belle Isle.

It first started with a brief history of urban renewal in Detroit, classifying urban renewal as the term applied to programs that focused on two areas in regards to blight: conservation and redevelopment. Conservation was defined as implementing public improvements to acceptable neighborhoods and stimulating “home owners to high standards of maintenance and home improvement thus forestalling blight”. Redevelopment stemmed from earlier efforts in the city, like the Master Plan of Redevelopment set in the ‘40s that came with building Detroit’s first public housing. Blighted buildings were defined by: age, poor foundations, lack of modern plumbing and heating, overcrowding, lack of playgrounds, excessive traffic, and mixed zoning/land use. The bulletin then detailed current and future redevelopment programs in Detroit, with an explanation on each individual project, key maps, and timelines, as well as “tabular” information on acres of redevelopment and its cost in Detroit. Overall, the plan was estimated to affect 90,415 dwelling units and redevelop 7,928 acres. One of these, and also the largest housing redevelopment program noted in the bulletin, was the Gratiot Redevelopment Area, today known mainly as Lafayette Park.  The bulletin explains that the area was part of the first sector of Detroit’s rebuilding program that stood just east of the Walter P. Chrysler Freeway (under construction of the time of this publication). The plans for Gratiot Area wanted to increase dramatic intermixture of apartment buildings and continue to carry the redevelopment all the way to Jefferson Avenue. It was estimated that the area would accommodate 1,810 families, 350 in-garden apartments and town houses, and 1,460 in tower structures.","There are several important things to notice from this 1963 account. First, Detroit, like many other cities of the time, was interested in the nationwide trend of urban renewal. Choices made during this time could dramatically affect the city and its future. Similarly, it can be understood from this bulletin that the Commission genuinely thought they were aiding in improving the city by eliminating blighted areas and contributing to beautifying others that could be \"saved\". Where the Commission saw blight, high crime/disease rates, and poor housing, this account proves they did come up with some sort of plan to “fix” this blight, no matter how flawed modern and retrospective opinions of urban renewal are to us now. Today, there are numerous accounts of those who grew up in the above Gratiot Redevelopment Area (aka Black Bottom) that never saw it as blighted or crime laden. Furthermore, the line in the bulletin that announces the new development as being right next to the Chrysler Freeway shows the discrepancy in thinking of both the era and between those affected and those in power. In environmental historical terms, this lack of understanding can be described as “seeing like a state” and dealing in legibility: where those in power create a simplified rationale to centralize control (like with the redeveloping and “slum clearing” of over 200 acres of Black Bottom) without truly understanding the complexities of the area, people, or issues affected. The Commission assumed their solution for Lafayette Park and its expansion took into account all factors, despite most likely not speaking to those who lived there or including them in decisions. As history can then show, assumptions from legibility are often wrong. While Lafayette Park sustains to this day and can sometimes be considered an urban renewal success story just for doing so, it also stands on what is considered the dormant remains of Black Bottom. It replaced a neighborhood that many residents were terribly sad to see go, despite being thought of as an ideal plan of action by city planners."],"display_date":1963,"search_date":"1963-07-02","locations":[{"id":33546,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1953,"tag":"Urban Renewal"},{"id":2011,"tag":"Slum Clearance"},{"id":2066,"tag":"Building Preservation"},{"id":1550,"tag":"Conservation"},{"id":2099,"tag":"Black Bottom, Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5978,"title":"Points of Interest in Detroit to a Mid-19th Century Visitor","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-05-14","end_date":"1886-05-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the warmer summer months in the late 1800s, Detroit experienced an influx of visitors and tourists who needed guidance on locating the more interesting city locales and landmarks. As a solution, The Detroit Free Press published this article in May of 1886 to offer assistance to the \"intelligent excursionists to [the] old city\" who wished to see the historic sites that Detroit had to offer. This detailed and thorough guide to the \"first permanent colony in the Northwest\" includes sites like Fort Pontchartrain, <em>Belle Fontaine</em> (or Springwells in the Third Street Depot area), Claude Campau's grist mill on May's Creek, Judge May's house on the corner of Jefferson and Cass, the Fort Lemoult citadel, the First National Bank building, the second St. Anne's Church, multiple historic homesteads and houses (some already having been demolished by the time the article was printed), the \"Pontiac Tree\", and many other places of historic interest. Most of these site listings are accompanied by small anecdotes of their historical significance, including a lengthy paragraph dedicated to Fort Pontchartrain and the involvement of the \"treacherous\" Native Americans during the \"great Indian conspiracy of 1763\".<br /><br /> This article gives us an interesting insight into how Detroit looked during the late 1800’s (which was vastly different than the Detroit we see today). Some of the landmarks that are mentioned in this guide are still visible today, and still attract some tourists. However, tourism has severely declined since the economic boom of the automobile and industrial period of 19<sup>th</sup> century Detroit. Also, many of the places mentioned in the article no longer exist as they did during 1886; for instance, the majority of the homesteads mentioned have been demolished and built over, and the few parts of Fort Pontchartrain that remained in 1886 have since been destroyed (the majority of the Fort was burned down during the great fire of 1805 in Detroit that also wreaked havoc on most of the city). This article makes a mention of the 1805 fire when it lists Judge May’s house (no longer standing), which is said to have included bricks from the chimneys of French houses that were consumed in the city-wide fire. It is interesting and thought-provoking to compare a modern-day guide of Detroit to this 1886 version, because one can see the differences in what was considered historically important in 1886 to today’s historical landmarks in Detroit (mainly through the landmarks that were demolished by the city, built over, or destroyed in some other fashion since this article’s publication).

In the period preceding 1921, Franklin Lamb uncovered a burial mound that was near Fort Wayne that he thought to be \"peculiar looking\". He had been the quartermaster of the fort when he noticed the mound, and his curiosity could not be sated until he knew what was causing the earthen irregularity. He ordered the mound to be opened, and discovered that buried beneath the dirt were \"perfect specimens of Indian pottery, weapons, and all sorts of utensils\". He then decided to show these artifacts to the United States war department as pieces of prideful discovery, but instead of being rewarded, Lamb was instead found to be in violation of an ancient treaty between the Native American tribes and the United States government. He was ordered to replace the items in their original state in the ground, and to \"restore the mound to its original condition\".<br /><br />To shed some light on this situation, it’s necessary to first ask why the burial mound was located where Lamb encountered it. As a possible answer, we can look to the French past of the city of Detroit and Fort Wayne. In 1710, Antoine Cadillac, the founder of Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit, invited four Native American tribes to the area of Detroit to aid the French in the fur trade business (a booming economy at this period of the Great Lakes region). The four invited tribes included the Potawatomi tribe, who were given the rights to settle near the fort to be under the protection of the French during their trapping season (this establishment is illustrated in the Bellin map, located in the sources below, which includes a Potawatomi label in the area of the fort as well as “ecores de sable”, or sand bluffs/burial mounds).

Racial discrimination persisted as economic opportunity began to crumble.  Yet, within a few years, the community transformed into having a primarily African-American population.  In the decades after his family’s move and neighborhood changes, Yakini remembers the slow decline in public services, ranging from mass transit to garbage collection to fire fighting.  Today, over 80 percent of Detroit’s population is African-American and the unemployment rate stands at about 15 percent.","Now, Yakini is the chairman of the Detroit Black Food Security Network and in charge of several urban farm and gardening projects.  He believes that Detroit may be revitalized through food production, since its food production capacity is so immense. The city is spread over 360 acres and contains an estimated 150,000 abandoned parcels, causing officials to believe that the farming could clean up blight and grow jobs.  With the emergence of a local food-processing industry, 4,700 jobs and $20 million in taxes could be created.  By 2050, 29 percent of Detroit’s landscape would be allocated to farming, something that has gained the attention of prosperous landowners and entrepreneurs.","Yakini sees these changes being brought about by the community, going beyond the economics of urban farming. He thinks that the most important aspect of public gardens and farming is that it will tie people together for the common good.  He states, “African-Americans in Detroit tend to have a sense of despair and helplessness that is a direct result of oppression.

These railroads were highly beneficial to some at the time, as they allowed passengers to travel quickly from one landlocked place to another, and also ensured the delivery of goods and products form one city to another. However, the railroads have caused more than their fair share of problems in modern-day Detroit, including traffic issues, road blocks, destruction of property/buildings, and high taxes.

Sirovich, New York Representative, introduced a joint resolution “providing for the declaration of a National Slum Clearance Day by the President of the United States” to the Subcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary in Washington D.C. This short bill was designed to empower both the President and the nation to realize the state of affairs currently affecting America, in which a third of the population lived in “baneful slum conditions.” Such conditions were said to have secondary effects such as high infant mortality, juvenile delinquency, high crime, and high disease rates. Protecting, policing, and serving such “blighted areas” was extremely costly to city governments and taxpayers. Furthermore, the educational monies being spent towards these areas were “being dissipated and wasted, largely because the educational benefits bestowed [were] nullified by the unwholesome home and neighborhood environment of the children.”","Private enterprise had failed to remedy such issues, and Mr. Sirovich proposed in his bill that federal action be taken by focusing attention of the American people on the slum conditions in which millions of people lived by creating a National Slum Clearance Day. Coming from New York, Mr. Sirovich first addressed the Committee by describing the conditions found in New York City, such as 200 acres of blighted land, tuberculosis epidemics, and conditions that made young women ashamed to invite friends into their homes. He assured that these sorts of issues were the same prevailing in many other American cities, such as Detroit, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and St. Louis, and that a National Slum Clearance Day would prove the U.S. concern for the matter and empower people and government to care for “the forgotten people” living in slum conditions. European countries including England, Germany, and Austria, he claimed, had already eradicated their slum neighborhoods and America needed to follow suit. After this, Mr. Sirovich brought in witnesses from slums in New York City and Philadelphia to read accounts of their living conditions to the committee.","The meeting was not without touchy debate though. A committee member named Mr. Michener questioned the force of the bill and called it out for being a mere gesture instead of constructive action. Mr. Sirovich countered this accusation by noting that efforts at concrete action had thus far not gotten much traction: a bill for slum clearance proposal was pending before Congress, while in Michigan members of the House had risen on the floor demanding action, proving this issue was getting nowhere, despite being endorsed by the President. A nationally declared holiday, he argued, would move the issue forward by raising public awareness and putting the President publicly on the spot. However, Mr. Michener still denied the importance of the bill, stating, “All it means is that, whereas sin is in the world and we think something should be done about it”. The meeting wrapped up quickly and Mr. Sirovich’s final comments before adjournment were those of thanks and to conclude, “Now I have voted for millions and millions of dollars during my 13 or 14 years in the House for the extermination of corn borers, boll weevils, fruit flys, and so forth, now let us do a little bit for humanity too.”","This transcript from 1937 speaks not only to ideas of slum clearance and the beginnings of urban renewal in American cities, but also the nation at large. Through underlying tones, the transcript tells a lot about how people thought the environmental landscape shaped the lives and morality of the people who lived there. The evidence that the government had “forgotten” slum residents implies that they were looked down upon and considered lesser in society. While not noted explicitly in the transcript, this lower class of people was often defined not only by economic status but also by race.","The transcript also reflects a disconnect between the perception of slum residents themselves and the way they were conceived of in Washington. The idea that educational resources were wasted on such populations, for instance, would be angrily contested by residents, who often note that education was a primary value and means for advancement in their neighborhood.","The transcript also sheds light on the national movement of urban renewal during this time. Clearly, the issue was prevalent in Washington and reflected in cities across the country. This acknowledgement by the President and debate within Congress most likely helped shape the mindset of government officials and leaders nationwide about how cities should look and how the urban environment shapes experiences and perceptions among urban residents and the world in general. Though the American Housing Act of 1949 and President Truman’s Fair Deal would come a decade later, along with the height of urban renewal, this transcript certainly paints a picture of early thoughts of urban renewal and the idea of the need to improve urban life."],"display_date":"June 3, 1937","search_date":"1937-06-03","locations":[{"id":22722,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2099,"tag":"Black Bottom, Detroit"},{"id":2011,"tag":"Slum Clearance"},{"id":1197,"tag":"poverty"},{"id":1010,"tag":"Housing"},{"id":1312,"tag":"Disease"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5987,"title":"Two New State Prisons Rise in Northeast Detroit","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"10/3/88","end_date":"10/3/88","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["African American migrants who came to cities like Detroit with ambitious dreams about prosperity in the North, were sadly disappointed during times of recession in the city when there were not enough jobs available for them. As a consequence of the thousands of jobless, homeless, poorly educated and starving African-Americans in Detroit crime was high and upward mobility was low. Rather than address the underlying issues of racial discrimination, poor housing, and lack of jobs, in 1988 the Michigan Department of Corrections announced plans to build \"two new state prisons for men being built on the northeast side of Detroit.\" This massive project in the heart of Nortown, already struggling with economic decline and flight to the suburbs, was attended by strongly differing views among the community.","The new prisons, and a new police precinct station neighboring the prisons, lay directly south of several residential neighborhoods. Mildred Stallings, chairperson of the citizens' group working with the state on the project, noted that \"the flight (from the neighborhoods) has not occurred\" as had been feared when the project was announced. But critics pointed out that people had few options about where to go if they didn’t want to live next to a state prison, and the ongoing lack of resources available for the struggling community.","In response to these concerns, the state required that 15 percent of the labor involved in building the prisons go to minorities and 5 percent to women. The project was supposed to provide an estimated 350 to 500 construction jobs. Bill Richardson, a partner with the management company on the construction of the project, said the project provided an excellent opportunity for minorities, but he said there aren't enough minorities in the industry to take advantage of the situation. Minorities \"have a hard time getting into the trade unions….Because they are not in the unions, it will be difficult for them to be representative in the work force\" on the project.

As her father developed a relationship with Ray Kowalski, owner of a local Detroit grocery store, their family moved to a forty-acre farm. Wiggins spent her childhood on this farm.  However, in her teen years Wiggins moved back to Detroit.  She went on to attend Wayne State University majoring in nutrition and dietetics.","Wiggins, currently the executive director of the Office of School Nutrition for Detroit Public Schools, declares that \"in its very bones this city is agrarian.\"  The people who came to Detroit came from sharecropping backgrounds.

The article described gardening as a “healthy and wholesome” outlet for young women, and due to its usefulness and proven success the article predicted that gardening for nationwide produce distribution would likely continue in the future. War gardens and victory gardens had created an occupational opportunity for women, even though the article pointed out, “American minds revolt at the idea of women in the work field.” The maternal nurturing and nourishing ideologies tied to the movement (and women in general) made this occupation seem less threatening than other fields, but it served as a powerful tool for empowering women to think about their capacity to occupy other social spheres.","Wartime agricultural movements such as the war gardens and liberty gardens of the World War I era and Victory Gardens during World War II had an especially important impact on women. These movements created opportunity for women to do what they had not done before…work outside the homestead.

Though recognized for their contributions, these occupations within gardening and agriculture were still considered by many to be akin to the home-making and family-feeding spheres women had always occupied. Yet for many young women, being a farmerette served as a tool of empowerment. The sense of community and the success of their collective action called them to consider how they might continue to shape their identities through these assimilation into different domains.

Many African Americans hoped to leave their agricultural and rural roots in the South for a more urban lifestyle in the nation's larger and more industrialized cities. Large urban centers such as Detroit strained to accommodate the massive influx of people, both economically and socially, as these cities became meccas for Southern migrants. Lester Granger of the National Urban League feared that this \"undirected\" migration would produce \"unsound social planning\" and produce large industrial centers of African American-dominated populations with little regard to the demands of labor or these newcomers' welfare. Attorney General Frances Biddle stated that there would be no exclusion of African Americans from over-crowded areas, but that conflict like the Detroit race riots suggested that poor living and working conditions and other barriers to the rural-urban transition were likely a leading cause in the uproar and should be avoided if possible.","The Great Migration was one of the \"most significant demographic events to occur in the United States in the twentieth century\" (Tolnay, 210).  Due to the use of slaves in agriculture and farm production, the South always had a higher concentration of African Americans than any other region in the country. Even after emancipation, these people lived on plantations and farms, usually as sharecroppers, and their labor and expertise formed the back-bone of the South's economy. But by 1950, almost 2.5 million Southern-born African Americans had migrated out of the South, taking their culture and agricultural backgrounds with them. They saw Northern cities like Detroit as an opportunity to leave the agricultural pasts that had bound them to the negative after-effects of slavery, and begin anew life in urban and industrial areas.  As more and more African Americans moved North, whites became increasingly uncomfortable with the \"shifting racial balance in their cities\" (Tolnay, 210). These insecurities created racial tensions, and often ended in violent conflict.","The Great Migration marked a radical shift in the nation’s economic focus, but also in its social and cultural distributions.  Even with new jobs in urban factories in increasingly industrialized settings, African Americans had a strong historical background in farming and agriculture that influenced their assimilation to this new urban life.  Successful integration from one place to another typically relies on how well a migrant or immigrant is able to use his or her previous required skills and apply it to a new career.  African Americans were forced to take the lowest-paying, most un-skilled jobs partially due to the fact that they had little previous experience in any industrialized setting. They brought with them, however, a strong work ethic, a focus on conservation and frugality, and a history of stewardship with their environment that would later influence many individuals’ involvement in environmental justice issues and urban farming initiatives.  The Great Migration marked an important transition in the nation’s economy away from reliance on agriculture, but did not entirely destroy the cultural influence from centuries of working the land."],"display_date":"August 21, 1943","search_date":"1943-08-21","locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":81,"tag":"Great Migration"},{"id":1922,"tag":"Detroit race riots"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5993,"title":"Pet Coke Piles, Pollution \"Sinks\", and Detroit","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/90","end_date":"12/31/90","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Coal-fired power plants have long been one of the world’s largest emitters of greenhouse gases. There are various kinds of inputs that a power plant can use in the process of creating electricity, and one of these is petroleum coke. An important factor that makes pet coke desirable is the fact that it can produce fuel efficiencies in integrated steel mills. The company that first discovered this fact in the 1900s was none other than U.S. Steel, located on Zug Island in the city of Detroit, in the state’s most polluted zip code. In a wild coincidence, almost 100 years later in 2013, large piles of petroleum coke produced in the Alberta tar sands were left on the bank of the Detroit River in Southwest Detroit, only a few miles from U.S. Steel’s main facility. These forty-foot piles of black pet coke, owned by the controversial Koch Carbon under the company Detroit Bulk Storage, shed sticky, toxic dust into people’s homes, cars, and lungs, causing many more problems than just greenhouse gas emissions. The citizens of nearby neighborhoods, such as Delray, were extremely frustrated that the company was allowed to store the pet coke so near to homes and the river, and cause detriment to their health and well-being in the process. Recently, local protests succeeded in getting one of the piles removed to an unspecified location, most likely in southern Chicago. A proposal is now pending to relocate the remaining pet coke piles only a few miles down the Detroit River.

The voice of the neighborhood groups in opposition to the piles, as well as action by the city, confirm Tarr’s assertions that society today is beginning to confront the issues of simply unloading pollution burdens onto some other party instead of changing practices to reflect the fact that no community should be subject to these environmental and health dangers."],"display_date":1990,"search_date":"1990-07-02","locations":[{"id":41645,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2092,"tag":"Environmental Justice"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":908,"tag":"Pollution"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5995,"title":"1955 Research on Community Socioeconomic Standings in Metropolitan Detroit","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/55","end_date":"12/31/55","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1955, a publication on the “social rating of community areas in Metropolitan Detroit” was prepared in response to an apparent number of requests for such information from member agencies of the United Community Services. The information was intended to summarize and explain the standing/social position of all communities in Metro Detroit based on their economic relation to each other and “the incidence of community problems.” Statistical measures were used to determine aspects of each neighborhood: economic levels (value of homes, monthly rent, number of laborers and service workers, etc.), unemployment levels (old age assistance, dependent children, unemployed persons, etc.), and morality and housing conditions (Tuberculosis/death rate, overcrowded homes, etc.). The definitions of such criteria were largely defined and sourced from the 1950 U.S. Census of Population. The document shows that areas of East Detroit that would be considered Black Bottom neighborhood, such as Mack Ave, were below average” in economic levels, “above average” in laborers and service workers, and “below average” in “managerial and professional workers” relative to the rest of the Detroit Metro area. Information for any neighborhood or area (divided by 1950 Census classification tracks of the city) can be found in this document, including places like River Rouge, Belle Isle, Indian Village, Brightmoor, Pingree, Delray, Cass, and more.","The publication of such documents like this likely gave the general public, and Detroit city officials, tangible numbers to confirm the beliefs that many of them already held. The research proved with numbers that certain areas of the city were blighted with disease and death rates, surrounded by poor housing and factory workers, and were made up of those dependent on the government and poverty assistance.  Despite the fact that these numbers are most likely legitimate and were carefully calculated, they do not give the full story. Statistics, without proper explanation or context, can be very powerful. Records and accounts like these allowed certain areas and peoples to be defined as slums, to be used for city projects, and to be broken up when space was needed. This was certainly the case in Black Bottom, Detroit. For example, accounts from Blacks in the area commonly attest that they couldn’t get “managerial or professional jobs” despite having the skills, due to overt discrimination in hiring practices of the time. They were forced to work at low-skilled jobs in the factory, for lower wages than their white coworkers, which was their best option for providing for themselves and their family. The statistical record from the United Community Services ignored these factors, and allowed policymakers to write the area of Black Bottom off as “low-class.” Finally, the fact that the introduction of this document states that it was prepared in response to “requests for information from member agencies” instills a sense of suspicion. Was this research performed just to give insight onto the makeup of Detroit? Was it to figure out where help was needed and then aid those areas? Or was it perhaps requested to provide tangible evidence that certain areas were dirty, poor, slums, in preparation for the great urban renewal movements of the coming decades?"],"display_date":1955,"search_date":"1955-07-02","locations":[{"id":28980,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2099,"tag":"Black Bottom, Detroit"},{"id":1182,"tag":"social status"},{"id":2119,"tag":"U.S. Census"},{"id":2120,"tag":"Economic Levels"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5994,"title":"The True Meaning of Being \"Rich\" And Where to Find It","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/50","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Betty DeRamus’ parents moved from Alabama to Detroit sometime in the early 1940’s where they settled in the Black Bottom neighborhood on Detroit’s eastside on St. Aubin Street. Betty grew up with another Black family with the last name Shephard, whom she believed at the time were her actual cousins and referred to them as so. When she was a bit older, her family moved to 2 different homes on Mack Avenue between Hastings and Rivard. Each house was a multi-story with single-family level flats. There were no showers or bathtubs, no furnace or central heating, and the only source of heat was a stove in the kitchen. Betty remembers family members putting pails outside their back door “to catch snow before it hit the ground and turn it into ice cream”. As a single child with two working parents, Betty was able to afford luxuries other families couldn’t, such as a piano and modern appliances. She often felt that family friends were all parents to her and knew everyone in her neighborhood and around Hastings Street. She felt safe, and recalls “seldom” locking their doors and staying up on porches to chat with friends and feel evening breezes. She recalls that her world “was small, but it seemed to have everything [she] needed”. As an adult, she was surprised to read articles and books that called Black Bottom a “slum”. She admits it was worn out and weary, but she alternatively doesn’t remember it being “crime riddled” and that it was full of personality and fun. That might be why, despite her living conditions, Betty thought her family was rich. Once she broke her piggy bank and gave out money to children on the street she considered less fortunate. When her mother walked home and saw every kid on the street with an ice cream, Betty was soon to be in trouble. By the time Betty was in high school, her family moved out of Black Bottom. Still, she recalls that while never hearing anyone call the area “Black Bottom” until she was an adult, the area and people there taught her the true meaning of being rich. <em>“Feeling rich has nothing to do with how many dollars you have in a bank or in your pocket. It’s about having a sense of security. It’s about feeling cared for. It’s about growing up wrapped in love.” – Betty DeRamus</em>","Betty’s essay account of Black Bottom in its heyday is similar to many other rosy and nostalgic accounts of the area from residents who lived there at the time. Many past residents also recall feeling safe in their neighborhood, feeling like they had everything they needed at their fingertips, and feeling a sense of community that seldom exists today, especially in the modern world that we live in. Her account also tells a bit about the mindset of the landscape though, and what it may have been like to grow up in Black Bottom, Detroit. One theme that runs current is Betty’s sheltered knowledge from the outside world. In her full essay, she writes that she didn’t truly interact or speak with a White person until she was in high school. She also didn’t feel the need to explore outside of her world, she felt rich and satisfied in the lifestyle her parents could afford her, and she didn’t realize until later in life that there was a completely different outsider’s view on the land and area. She may have known it was worn down, but she still didn’t consider it a slum or blighted. There was a large discrepancy between those in who lived in Black Bottom and those who didn’t, and some may argue, it was primarily separated between race and class. This discrepancy, and a lack to successfully merge both sides and opinions, undoubtedly contributed to the forces that eventually took over Black Bottom and Paradise Valley and perhaps is a small part of why it no longer exists today."],"display_date":1950,"search_date":"1950-07-02","locations":[{"id":28980,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2118,"tag":"Detroit's Eastside"},{"id":705,"tag":"Community"},{"id":2011,"tag":"Slum Clearance"},{"id":2099,"tag":"Black Bottom, Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":5996,"title":"Delray Property Owners Welcome the International Fair of 1889","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-05-08","end_date":"1889-09-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Detroit International Exposition and Fair Project of 1889 was an exciting year for all of Delray. Pre-automobile industry times allowed room for diverse businesses, a glowing point well showcased in the Exposition. The fair was a healthy combination of agricultural and industrial.

Extending Delray’s boundaries and incorporation of the village has already been on the village’s property owners’ agenda. The owners believed that the Exposition will bring considerable property value increases and help their plan along. Expansion of Delray’s boundary would include all the territory north of Fort Street, the east of the city, south by the Detroit River, and west by the River Rouge. Street improvements and a town hall are also part of the plan. With several hundred thousand people projected to walk the streets of Delray during the 10 day exposition in September of 1889, Delray property owners are confident about the execution of such plans for the village. However, the proponents are met with formidable opposition by those concerned about tax increases and poor return on investment.

This housing project was created during the time of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s presidency, which is significant because of his New Deal Policy which allocated money to go towards housing. However money was not always evenly distributed in Black communities.  First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was a key proponent of declaring the importance of equal funds going to all communities. She was even present for the ground breaking ceremonies of the Brewster Project.","Completed in 1938, the Brewster Project consisted of 701 units in a low-rise apartment style. Although those units occupied many separate buildings, the Brewster Project was designed to foster a sense of community. It included various green spaces, which served as places for people to socialize and for children to play. The project's landscape was pretty plain -- a few trees and cut grass. Some buildings had small shrubbery in front. The sidewalks connected each building with the surrounding buildings, so there was easy access to other neighbors. Overall the area seemed to been taken care of well by residents. It was definitely not the most lavish of living arrangements, but neither was it a deplorable living arrangement, and many former residents remember it as far better than the run-down, overcrowded, underserviced neighborhoods they had moved from.","In 1941, the city began work on the Frederick Douglass Apartments immediately to the south of the Projects, consisting 941 new units in a combination of six-story and fourteen-story high rise buildings. Together, the housing development is commonly referred to as the Brewster-Douglass projects.","Housing projects in Detroit have a storied past as do the projects across the country. Many appeared to be beacons of success for a long period of time and others did not survive as long. But today, the Brewster-Douglass projects have been in serious decline for decades. The Brewster Projects have already been removed and new condos have been placed there. Demolition on the last of the vacant Frederick Douglass towers, which have become hotbeds for crime and misconduct, began in 2013.","These demolitions are painful for the people and families who lived in these places: the structures are more than just vacant eye sores to them. These structures hold special memories because it was once home. Many wish the structures did not have to be torn down and that they buildings would have been rehabilitated instead.

She lived on Hendrie Street with her parents, brothers and sisters. Her home was just four houses from Hastings (a major thoroughfare in Detroit’s Black community surrounded with small businesses). She said that “she views her years growing up in the old neighborhood as some of the best years of her life”. She explained that it was an area where people knew their neighbors and spoke to them by name. Her neighbors were also very concerned about each other and were always willing to share what they had with each other (e.g. a cup of sugar, or a dime for the street car). The community actively “looked out” for one another. She also talked about the numbers game which could be compared to today’s lottery, although the numbers game was not legal. Therefore the community would shield the numbers man from police because they felt he was a part of their community.","During the period that Ms. Lawson speaks of the proverb “It takes a village to raise a child” was personified in the Near Eastside of Detroit. It was the village and within that village/community were many neighborhoods. These neighborhoods were linked by common bonds of race and religion. It also believed that these neighborhoods were linked by a larger desire by parents that their children would live in a larger world than they had known. Many parents inspired their children to learn about the larger society, the larger world that had evaded them (the parents), and then encouraged them to go out and find or maker their place in it. Family was a paramount fixture in strong communities, it was one of the strongest supports against the injustices of inequality and racism that were present in larger society.","Furthermore community was more than an extension of their families. It was their bridge to the outside world. It was where they lived, worked, and played. Neighbors knew they needed each other in order to give their families the strength and determination to go out into the world and make a difference.

Bill of Rights (or just the G.I. Bill), to provide aid for returning veterans of World War II (and prevent another economic crisis like the Great Depression, which the country had just recovered from).  The bill’s main provisions were to guarantee that veterans would receive several things that had previously been unattainable for many Americans, let alone veterans who often did not attend college: education and job training; loans for homes, farms, or businesses; and unemployment pay.  The home loan guarantee proved very popular to millions of veterans: in the six years after the bill’s passage in 1944 until 1952, the Veterans Administration ensured that 2.4 million home loans were given out to World War II veterans.  In Nortown and other areas of Detroit, as well as many other American cities, this contributed to the building boom of the late 1940s, as many new low-cost, well-designed homes were built for all low- to medium-income groups, including beneficiaries of the G.I. Bill.","In many cities, including Detroit, in practice, this well-intentioned government action actually helped perpetuate much of the racism that was already present across America.  Rather than guarantee direct loans from the VA, the act simply provided for loans that could be acquired through the normal methods.  This meant that black veterans struggled to secure loans from banks just as much as they would have without assistance from the VA— the VA could provide up to $2000, but not the loan itself.  Thus, as it had in the past, all the new homes that were being built simply went to white veterans, and the housing that was available to returning black G.I.s was the same substandard housing that was available before the bill was passed."],"display_date":"1944 - 1954","search_date":"1949-07-01","locations":[{"id":27066,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2125,"tag":"housing segregation"},{"id":1509,"tag":"G.I.

The report begins with how important water recreation and usage is to Michigan, describing the popularity of Belle Isle, a “Water Oriented Park”, with 1,400,000 visitors in 1960.  Pollution made it unswimmable, due to possible ingestion of sewage-contaminated water.

The bank itself is not only a functional space, but through this powerful architecture and the dignified, stately staging of the photograph clearly communicates the city’s growing financial success, its stability, and its pride.","The need for the new branch of the bank in Southwest Detroit in the early twentieth century reflects the area’s growing economic and industrial success. This corner of the city was booming as industries moved into the neighborhood and as Zug island continued to be built up. The neoclassical style of the building recalls the City Beautiful Movement of the period, which held that orderly, neoclassical architecture could instill cultural and moral values into the people who lived around and interacted with the buildings. This building thus stands as a monument to the forward-thinking, confident attitude of Detroiters at the time. Sadly, though, Detroit is fighting to maintain this building. Today, instead of being surrounded by the bustling economy of the 1920s, the building (which no longer functions as a bank), as well as many of its neighboring buildings, have been borded up and have fallen into solemn disuse and disrepair."],"display_date":"March 1918","search_date":"1918-03-16","locations":[{"id":18385,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2143,"tag":"Detroit Savings Bank"},{"id":2142,"tag":"Albert Kahn"},{"id":2141,"tag":"southwest detroit"},{"id":1941,"tag":"Delray"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6011,"title":"Salvation in Industry","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/56","end_date":"12/31/56","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The negative perception of industry is a fairly recent concept and for many years in places like Detroit industry was a marker of innovation, economic mobility, and increased employment. A 1956 study conducted by the Detroit City Plans Commission presents a crucial comprehensive collection of facts and statistics about the current state of industry and its projected growth. In the section entitled “Community and Corridor Data,” city planners offer their definition of a community and clarify the distinctions between a “community corridor” and an “industrial corridor.” In their definitions they contend with the City’s Master Plan which states that no heavy industry can be in close proximity to community corridors. While the report is objective in most of its findings it presents the disadvantages to the City Master Plan in a much more enumerated and in-depth manner than the advantages of separating industry from residential. The study concludes in this area that it will be difficult for industry to exist outside of industry corridors. This alludes to another theme within the report, which is the lack of space for real heavy industry in the city. According to many of the graphs and conclusions in the report current industry provided much of the economic stability the city has and it is logical that an increase would be beneficial for everyone.","The report speaks to a long-term problem in Detroit, highlighted by urban researcher June Manning Thomas, namely the city’s tendency to “assemble land for industrial sites.” Urban development in the twentieth century reflected the city's interest in increasing industry within community spaces as a means of increasing economic prosperity. The result is a city eager to put industry next to homes, as the city could “buy existing houses and land, prepare sites, and resell them cheaply to industrial firms.” This postwar mentality of increasing industry and jobs had major repercussions for city residents who were forced to live side-by-side with heavily polluting industries, which the city has never fully addressed."],"display_date":1956,"search_date":"1956-07-01","locations":[{"id":28980,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"},{"id":2007,"tag":"Detroit Industry"},{"id":58,"tag":"Industry"},{"id":2055,"tag":"Heavy Industry"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6012,"title":"Zug Island: Environmental Problems Then and Now","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-11-21","end_date":"1897-11-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Zug Island, a privately-owned industrial site located at the junction of the Detroit and Rouge Rivers, is one of the many industrial eyesores for the nearby community of Delray in the southwest of Detroit. The usual appeal of an island is absent as this industry-heavy land mass spews pollution into the air and water. In 1897, Zug Island was already beginning to cause trouble for the surrounding residents, and an article in the <em>Detroit Free Press </em>raised the first of many environmental concerns about the activities there. The reporter describes a large fire on Zug Island with ash debris that was carried throughout the city. Down the River Rouge, the “air was full of dust.”","We might assume that in our more environmentally-conscious era a mishap on this scale would go far beyond a 100-word news article in the paper. However that assumption would be incorrect: in 2011 the same newspaper reported that a bone-shaking hum, affecting not only Delray residents but also Canadians on the other side of the river, was the result of unknown actions taking place on Zug Island.","The comparison of these two events reflects the ongoing lack of oversight of the activities on Zug Island. Moreover it begins to shed light on an issue far greater than the fire itself. With problems like this continuing into the our times it becomes almost explicitly how facilities like Zug Island were placed by neighborhoods with low populations with little pull or leverage over large companies that owned Zug. These large companies saw the environment around Zug as the perfect place for running their factories without consequences.","While at times it may seem like a conspiratorial stretch it would appear that these two instances would fit nicely into concepts of environmental racism. Industrial pollution is routinely concentrated in areas where poorer and browner populations are the worst exposed. Factories along with their hazards are not being placed in white or suburban neighborhoods due to systemic white privilege. This white privilege allows people in more affluent areas to inhabit cleaner environments. Places like Delray, with its large immigrant population, are often the victims of industry's many environmental offenses.","In 1897, investors and public officials sanctioned high levels of contamination from Zug Island because of their interest in promoting industry. In 2011, as the island continued to have serious adverse effects on those who surrounded it, there still seemed to be no way to determine who was responsible or had jurisdiction over the industrial center. Whether spewing ash and fire over the city, or emitting small tremors that cross national borders, Zug Island continues to spread problems without concern for its neighbors and their well-being."],"display_date":"November 21, 1897","search_date":"1897-11-21","locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":2054,"tag":"Zug Island"},{"id":58,"tag":"Industry"},{"id":1233,"tag":"Environmental History"},{"id":2072,"tag":"Environmental Racism"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6013,"title":"Feasible Foods","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/63","end_date":"12/31/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The story of Detroit’s \"food desert\" and urban abandonment is a common one in todays media, but as the story of the construction of the Union Produce Terminal in 1963 shows these are by no means new problems.

The report's purpose was to inform potential investors about site development opportunities for a new food distribution facility. One of the main draws of this area, according to the report, wasthe neighborhood.

In fact, it would go beyond helping the local community and help the city as a whole, since the distribution center would be providing the majority of food for the city.","The irony of this proposal lies in the fact that urban renewal projects like this often helped to further degrade the city for residents, displacing them from their homes and transforming neighborhoods. Moreover, by the late twentieth century Detroit was often referred to as “food desert” for its lack of grocery stores and fresh food, and the failures of redevelopment and urban renewal plans like this one exacerbated Detroit’s problems. Studies have repeatedly found that more than half of all Detroit residents lack access to healthy food options. Plans like the 1963 report looked to address the issue of food availability in the city while bringing back jobs, but ultimately were unsuccessful.

While streets and expressways may be apolitical on their own, their placement by city planners has had a great effect on the city. In 1946, urban planners began to work on Detroit’s local transportation plan to tackle the city's growing problem of limited capacity for \"through traffic.\" \"Through traffic,\" defined as long distance traffic consisting mostly commercial vehicles, streetcars, and buses, was growing as a result of outmigration from the city to the suburbs, a trend that was increasing all over the country. Detroit planners dismissed past methods of widening streets as ineffective, but also found that adding more through streets increased “blight and decay within cities” by increasing noisy traffic in residential areas and causing people to leave. Instead, Detroit planners decided that expressways were a suitable answer to their problem. They would decrease noisiness and through traffic presence by making the highways depressed, running below street level. These new limited-access roads, the planners believed, would bring great benefits to the city.","In practice, the outcome of the expressways was not what the planners had intended. To make room for the new roads, the city exercised eminent domain to seize the land where thousands of people, primarily African-Americans, lived and worked. All of those people were left without resources for relocation, and their displacement was a serious blow to the finances of the city. As urban researcher June Manning Thomas has noted, through \"expressway construction and other clearance projects...the city proceeded to clear out its own economic base.\" Judging by the 1963 plan, it seems clear that urban planners were looking to fix a city and make it better, and never intended the expressways to have this outcome.

Plans began for an extension to the I-75 highway to rectify the problem. The route recommended by the Fisher Freeway Planning Committee began at the southwest limits of the city, in the neighborhood of Delray. There, it would connect with three other freeways in the section under consideration: the Jefferies Freeway, I-96 and the Chrysler Freeway, serving as a terminus for the Jefferies freeway and providing interstate traffic access to the Ambassador Bridge to Canada. It also served to give traffic on both freeways access to the freeway loop. What this meant for Delray, however, was that there would be even more pollution in an already environmentally distraught neighborhood. It also divided industrial areas, residential areas and public and semi-public areas in the neighborhood, essentially splitting the community in half.","The Fisher Freeway was completed in 1959, and in the following years asthma and lung infection rates in Delray greatly increased. In part, this can be attributed to the increase in traffic, especially the diesel-run semi trucks that made up a large part of the international commerce and which emitted large amounts of carbon monoxide. Air pollution has been linked to morbidity and mortality from several diseases, including diverse conditions such as coronary disease and Hodgkin's Lymphoma. In terms of the effects on respiratory disease, exposure to air pollution has been linked to the aggravation of chronic respiratory symptoms and increased mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Encouraged by the availability of dependable engines; of light, thin alloys; and of more seasoned engineering talent; in 1922 a group of entrepreneurs organized the Detroit Aircraft Development Corporation to modernize the rigid airship and make it all-metal, like the hull of a seagoing vessel. An experimental engineering group was organized and instructed to endeavor to isolate and determine the scientific fundamentals governing the design of an all-metal structure. General Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company and other industrial concerns contributed valuable laboratory facilities; the Aluminum Company of America undertook to develop aluminum alloy in thin sheets; aeronautical engineers and metallurgists in Washington were invited to offer criticisms and suggestions. Through laborious and painstaking engineering, they set about the development of a safe and practical Metalclad Airship.","During this time, shortly after the first World War, private corporations and government and military entities in the United States military sought to provide resources and employment to the national population.

Today, one of the main issues facing Detroit and other post-industrial cities is the fact that public and private investors are no longer spending their time and resources on American soil. Instead, tax policies and the \"race to the bottom\" encourage GMC, Ford, and many other companies to move their manufacturing facilities abroad.

Millions of people worldwide died in 1918 from the Spanish flu, and cholera and typhoid were frequent threats in the cities. At this time, the medical community encouraged people to wash their walls to help avoid disease. Painted walls were preferred over those with wallpaper because the texture of wallpaper would trap bacteria. The smooth surface of paint allowed it to be readily washed with either water and soap or a disinfectant, while wallpaper, especially given the paste available at the time, could not stand up to repeated washing. This also was an era when homeowners often did not paint their own homes. Homeowners instead relied on the expertise of master painters, who were respected for their skills and knowledge of paints. Ironically, the medical benefits of painting one's walls brought with them new risks, as these master painters often preferred paints with lead pigments.","The early twentieth century saw a large increase in the demand for lead paint. In Detroit, the national leader for lead paint production, Acme White Lead and Color Works expanded its factory in 1908, and it was soon joined by competitors such as Borydell White Lead and Color Works, Detroit Graphite Company, Ditzler Color Company, and many others. With the expansion of business came a need for workers, who were primarily found in the poorer neighborhoods of the city. Those workers, in addition to living in homes with lead paint on the walls, were also exposed to high levels of lead through direct contact during the manufacturing process. Across the country, labor unions and public health officials expressed concerns with worker exposure to “clouds of dust\" laced with lead in factories. After multiple law suits against companies about deaths from lead poisoning, industries worked with labor unions and public health officials to minimize worker exposure to lead dust.  These actions reduced occupational lead poisoning without ending the use of lead paint, which would continue to contaminate homes and soil for decades."],"display_date":"1908 - 1922","search_date":"1915-07-02","locations":[{"id":50025,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1889,"tag":"occupational health"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}],"course":{"name":"Environmental History in Detroit","school":"University of Michigan","course_id":118,"school_id":64}},{"id":6050,"title":"The Delray Tuberculosis Clinic","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/10","end_date":"12/31/12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The booming Detroit industries of the early twentieth century brought enormous demand for more workers as more and more industries pushed their way into neighborhoods such as Delray. Low real estate prices and rents attracted poor immigrants from around the world. Around 1910 Romanians, Serbs, Turks, Armenians, Austrians, Hungarians, and others flooded into the area. But the low cost of living translated into low standards of living, as well: bereft of even the most basic sanitation and infrastructure, many of the new residents were living in unspeakable conditions. Overcrowding of large numbers of people in these extremely small apartments and houses caused overflowing cesspools. The wells that the neighbors had dug for drinking water were sunk only a few feet into the sand, in close proximity to the cesspools, making the water unfit even for washing purposes. Lacking an alternative source, people in Delray used the well water anyway, even for cooking and drinking. The area was constantly in danger of outbreaks of tuberculosis, typhoid, and other diseases common in poor urban living conditions.","The Delray community, while powerless to address the underlying infrastructural issues, came together to create the Delray Tuberculosis Clinic in order to fight the disease in Delray. The clinic opened in May 1911 to educate the people of Delray about the disease and how it spread. Shortly thereafter, when word of the poor sanitary conditions in Delray reached authorities, the city of Detroit put together a full clean-up process led by health officer J.W. Inches. The first thing that Inches did was to condemn the wells as un-usable and begin to mainline the water in to Delray from other sources.

In 1909, Dr. Leo H. Herbert and Dr. Emil Amberg scolded the City of Detroit for its lack of funding for the city's most vulnerable residents at the Anti-Tuberculosis society. They claimed that the conditions of the working class in the city were disgraceful and dangerous to the health of Delray residents. The city's allocation of resources was also inefficient: doctors were attempting to fight the disease, but the preventative measures of urban clean-up and improved living conditions that they had suggested were not being implemented. Along with the obscene amount of litter in the streets, for instance, Dr. Herbert pointed to the overpopulated housing situations as the disease's principal cause. When ten to twenty people were forced to live in a small cottage, that house immediately became a breeding ground for tuberculosis.

The nearby Paradise Valley commercial district provided residents with entertainment and a sustainable nightlife. The Brewster-Douglass Housing Project was the first federal housing project built for African-Americans. The siting of these projects was intentional, as it helped to ensure that African-Americans would remain in segregated neighborhoods, away from whites.

Evolution of the Motor Idea.” The article focused on what to call the new motor vehicles that were beginning to appear on the streets of cities in Europe and the United States. The late 19<sup>th</sup> century was a time of great excitement and inventiveness in the field of the automobile technology. At the time, no one in Europe and the United States was sure what to call these new inventions with four wheels and an engine that enabled people to get from point A to point B much faster. While the word “automobile” would ultimately become a household term, this was not the common name at the time the article was written.","The January 1896 article described the various names given to automobiles, such as “auto motor” and “petrocar” in England. “Auto cycle” was also put down as a name because of the word “auto.” However, this would imply that the motor would be automatic and wouldn’t require any human control, even though the essence of the automobile is having a human <em>control</em> what the automobile does. Petrocar implied that the vehicle was made of stone or for hauling stone. The main reason the name was even developed was because it was also translated to mean petroleum, which the car would run on. But not all of the motor vehicles were petroleum powered. One word for automobiles in America was “motocycle.” As the author of the article tried to find the root of this name, he figured out that it wouldn’t work because moto-cycle was a specific and not generic term, the word “cycle” was normally expressed in terms of a bicycle and this was just a euphemism for motor cycle.","The only common parallel word was “horseless carriage,” and this name was used commonly until people began to see the automobile as more than just a carriage. In 1905, when Michigan solidified its claim as a host to the emerging automobile industry, the name began to finally settle into either “motor vehicle” or “automobile.” People love the idea to be able to travel on different schedules, or to travel whenever they wanted to go anywhere in distance. The point that this information is getting at is once the popularity of the automobile began to rise, that is when they were able to produce the name of the automobile because they needed a centralized name that would catch on as the sales and popularity grew. The name became household and by 1912 the Cadillac was the first <em>vehicle</em> to have an effective self-starting engine. The self-starting engine was much easier to help with the depiction of the automobile name.","The name began to be a household name and the technology of automobiles would soon give birth to more manufacturers such a Ford. The name and understanding of what the main intent of the vehicle helped Ford build the Rouge manufacturing empire. Rouge had 800 car bodies coming out of the shop every day as popularity of the Model-T vehicle was produced. The Model-T was a vehicle produced by Ford.","It was not clear what the word used to describe automobiles would be at the beginning because no one really knew the main focus or direction the vehicle was going in. But once a motor was developed and there was a self –starting engine, the automobile name was birthed. Once the main idea and name of the automobile was put into play this would soon play a big part in the automobile being a household name and manufacturers like Cadillac and Ford began their dominance and their own twists they would put on these vehicles. The name/ direction of the vehicle produced the lucrative profits that were generated."],"display_date":"January 1896","search_date":"1896-01-16","locations":[{"id":6599,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"WAYNE, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1900,"tag":"Automotive Industry"},{"id":1544,"tag":"automobile"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":124,"school_id":43}},{"id":6129,"title":"<strong>Smog Madness: Remembering the Vacuum Carburetor Era</strong>","course_id":127,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/73","end_date":"12/31/73","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The 1973 edition of the <em>Chevrolet Emission Control Systems</em> reference manual is a special supplement to the standard mechanic’s repair reference. General Motors produced this manual as a guide for its dealer-level mechanics, who would be tasked with repairing and adjusting emission control systems for Chevrolet owners. The manual contains a host of novel names and corresponding acronyms for parts of the new emissions-control system: Air Injector Reactor (AIR), Controlled Combustion System (CCS), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), Coasting Richer System (CRS), and many others. These new technologies represented the industry’s best short-term effort for reducing toxic exhaust gas emissions. However, their acronyms would be liberally intermixed with swear words throughout the 1970s, as both mechanics and their customers struggled to adapt to the new technological regime.","The main problem with 1970s emission controls proved to be the difficulty of keeping them in tune. In the era before inexpensive, compact microprocessors revolutionized engine management, emissions control systems relied on comparatively crude technology. Copious lines of fragile vacuum hoses, complex mechanically actuated carburetors, and hot-burning catalytic converters were virtually impossible to maintain in concert with one another. Datsun equipped its cars with “Floor Temp” warning lights, to keep catalytic converters from igniting the floor carpeting. Other manufacturers warned consumers not to park in tall grass for the same reason. Vacuum carburetors were notoriously devilish devices, with a tendency to produce stalling at the worst possible moments. Newly established emissions testing frequently devolved into shouting matches and frustration. To add insult to injury, these emissions-control systems actually made cars less fuel efficient in the short term, at a time when gas shortages and embargoes were menacing the land. In short, the 1970s proved to be an inauspicious time to own a car, or to be a person that worked on them for a living.","As Kevin Borg writes in <em>Auto Mechanics:</em> <em>Technology and Expertise in Twentieth-Century America</em>, mechanics bore the brunt of consumer criticism of the new technology. When the cars of the 70s stumbled and stalled in traffic, their drivers naturally blamed the men responsible for maintaining them. Auto mechanics were forced to choose between tuning their customers’ cars to meet emissions standards, or to run well in everyday use. The <em>Chevrolet Emission Control Systems</em> manual is a relic of this era of hard choices, and a reminder of the difficulty of introducing complex technological systems quickly."],"display_date":1973,"search_date":"1973-07-02","locations":[{"id":35437,"lat":42.107446354,"lng":-83.1351982696,"zoom":9,"place":"Wayne, Michigan"}],"tags":[{"id":1544,"tag":"automobile"},{"id":1354,"tag":"Air Pollution"},{"id":1899,"tag":"Detroit"},{"id":1919,"tag":"1970s"},{"id":599,"tag":"Technology"},{"id":2296,"tag":"emissions"},{"id":2297,"tag":"mechanics"},{"id":2298,"tag":"regulation"},{"id":2299,"tag":"car"}],"course":{"name":"Fundamentals of Environmental History","school":"Auburn University","course_id":127,"school_id":73}}]}
