The earliest services were conducted in Woodlawn Cemetery, General Farragut’s resting place. Boats carrying marines, naval officers and the Grand Army of the Republic and services began at sunrise. Statues of Washington and Lincoln were decorated and then the Grand Army proceeded to different cemeteries to decorate the soldiers' graves. Over 8,000 people participated. The procession moved down Broadway. The military parade continued into Brooklyn with flags flying and salutes and speeches made. Decoration Day 1872 was held on May 30<sup>th</sup> around the country  (<em>Memphis Daily Appeal</em>, 1).","            The Memphis Daily Appeal captured all of the day’s events in different parts of the country. President Grant delivered a Decoration Day address to 8,000 people at the National Cemetery at Arlington. Musical pieces were played and graves decorated everywhere. Ceremonies were observed throughout the country. Five thousand gathered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A beautiful granite monument was dedicated in Ohio. Over five thousand assembled in St. Louis, Missouri to hear speeches and to decorate soldier’s graves. Confederate as well as Union soldiers took part to decorate over ten thousand graves. In Indianapolis, businesses closed in the afternoon in observance of the day. Throughout the nation people took time to remember the Civil War dead. In all places, soldiers were remembered, graves decorated, flags waved and speeches and music filled the air. Remembering was the order of the day (<em>Memphis Daily Appeal</em>, 1).","            In David Blight’s book “Race and Reunion” the history of Decoration Day is detailed. In the <em>Memphis Daily Appeal</em>, Decoration Day events of 1872 from different parts of the country were detailed. This information is significant for it shows how the nation healed during the aftermath of the Civil War. Decoration Day, which was later called Memorial Day, was a way for the nation to heal. Both the North and the South found a way to healing the scars of death by honoring and remembering their dead. Over six hundred and twenty thousand soldiers died as a result of the Civil War (Blight, 64). How to remember the slaughter of all the participants became the legacy of the war.","            In May 1868, General John Logan, Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, called on all northern soldiers to decorate the graves of their dead comrades. Twenty-seven states participated in this May 30<sup>th</sup> ritual of placing flowers on the graves and making speeches. The next year, some three hundred and fifty six cities, both in the North and the South, participated in Decoration Day activities (Blight, 71). In the South, Confederate Memorial Day was celebrated on different dates at first. April 26<sup>th</sup>, the date of General Joseph Johnson’s surrender to General William Sherman, was used by many of the southern states (Blight, 77). Some southern states such as North Carolina and South Carolina used May 10<sup>th</sup>, which was the birthday of Stonewall Jackson. Virginia used June 3<sup>rd</sup> in honor of Jefferson Davis’ birthday (Blight, 77 – 78). By 1872, both the North and the South celebrated together with May 30<sup>th</sup> as the official day for Decoration Day as the holiday helped socially heal and bring together everyone. Black veterans marched and placed flowers alongside white veterans of the Civil War (Blight, 78 – 81). Today, Memorial Day observes all who died in all wars but the focus now is on World War I, World War II, Korean and Vietnam veterans. In 1872, Civil War dead was the only focus of the May 30<sup>th</sup> remembrances."],"display_date":"May 30, 1872","search_date":"1872-05-30","locations":[{"id":52830,"lat":39.768403,"lng":-86.158068,"zoom":8,"place":"Indianapolis"},{"id":52829,"lat":38.6270025,"lng":-90.1994042,"zoom":8,"place":"St. Louis"},{"id":52828,"lat":40.4172871,"lng":-82.907123,"zoom":8,"place":"Ohio"},{"id":52827,"lat":43.0389025,"lng":-87.9064736,"zoom":8,"place":"Milwaukee"},{"id":52826,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington D.C."},{"id":52825,"lat":40.7127837,"lng":-74.0059413,"zoom":8,"place":"New York City, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2803,"tag":"Decoration Day"},{"id":2802,"tag":"Memorial Day"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6519,"title":"A Snapshot of Lincoln's Acts of Clemency In the Year of 1864","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-01","end_date":"1864-11-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Civil War, Lincoln reviewed over 1600 cases of military justice. The largest single topic that can be found in Lincoln’s telegrams is the reviewing and answering of appeals of military court martial decisions, especially the pardoning of scheduled executions (The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln). Lincoln recognized the strategic potential of clemency during a time of war. He pardoned a considerable number of Union soldiers in a conscious effort to boost the morale of the Union’s fighting forces. Lincoln was also widely admired among Union troops because of the perception that he took a genuine interest in the their well-being. This perception was re-enforced with each pardon of a military offender (Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 1). ","This episode begins in early 1864 wherein Lincoln orders the War Department to commute the death sentence of deserters to confinement until the end of the war and to allow commanding generals to reinstate convicted deserts if it was thought that they would be of use to the service. Lincoln said,","<em>“They are the cases that you call by that long title cowardice in the face of the enemy, but I call them for short, my “leg cases.” But I put it to you, and I leave it for you, to decide for yourself: If Almighty God gives a man a cowardly pair of legs, how can he help their running away with him?\"</em>","(Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 1) ","Then on April 5th, 1864, Lincoln mitigated the sentences of groups of soldiers in a telegram in which, John Hay, on behalf of Lincoln, writes to Governor John Brough of Ohio, stating, “The President has ordered the pardoning of the soldiers of the 12th Ohio, in accordance with your request.” ","Favoring soldiers convicted of war crimes be put to hard labor, rather than they be executed, Lincoln had the sentence of Jesse Broadway commuted to three years hard labor in September of that year. According to John Hay, Lincoln states his rationale for clemency on these grounds,","<em>“I don’t believe it will make a man any better to shoot him, while if we keep him alive, we just may get some work out of him.\"</em>","As the year progressed, Lincoln continued to pardon soldiers and on November 3rd, 1864, Lincoln sent a telegram to the officer in command in Lexington Kentucky saying, “Suspend execution of Vance Mason until further order.” Earlier that day, Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin J. Spaulding had telegraphed Lincoln stating: “Vance Mason … on the charge of desertion is condemned to be shot on the sixth of this month. I pray you that you reprieve him or grant a respite until I can bring the matter before you in form. There are mitigatory circumstances about his case which I am sure will recommend him to your clemency.” Mason’s sentence was then suspended and he was given the option to return back into the army and serve out his enlistment term in the year of 1865. (Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Volume 8) ","Lincoln would go on to offer more acts of clemency in the next, 1865.","Ruckman and Kincaid suspect Lincoln thrived on the hope that each request that he granted further educated a portion of the public as to the necessity of a clemency power in the justice system. Lincoln's extensive effort to provide numerous and explicit explanations for clemency decisions and his willingness to exercise the power upon the advice of individuals and mass public suggest that he may well deserve credit for having utilized one of the most unilateral and imperial of executive powers in the most democratic manner” (Ruckman and Kincaid 1999) Though Lincoln’s justifications for clemency are widely ranging, it can be ascertained from his words, his written word in telegrams, and through his actions, that adopting a policy of clemency in order to save the lives of Union soldiers whenever possible, was of great importance to Lincoln."],"display_date":"January 1, 1864 - November 3, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-02","locations":[{"id":52916,"lat":38.0405837,"lng":-84.5037164,"zoom":8,"place":"Lexington, KY"},{"id":52915,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"D.C."},{"id":52828,"lat":40.4172871,"lng":-82.907123,"zoom":8,"place":"Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":2981,"tag":"Lincoln's telegrams"},{"id":2980,"tag":"1864"},{"id":2979,"tag":"lincoln's clemency"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}}]}
