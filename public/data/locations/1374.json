A win in Kentucky could be a possible turning point for the Confederate army, as it would probably add Kentucky to their side.  However, Bragg failed to execute his troops efficiently and could not gather political support from the Kentuckians.  Bragg's troops were largely outnumbered by Major General Don Carlos Buell's Federal army and he was forced to flee to Tennessee after a day of fighting.   &lt;br /&gt;General Bragg's official report recounts the details of the battle.  The two armies confronted from opposite sides of Perryville.  Bragg found the Confederates remaining stagnant and decided that this would be the opportune time to attack, as the Confederates were only going to receive more reinforcements.  He describes how his troops were quite outnumbered, yet fought courageously and accomplished all the positions while pushing the enemy back a good two miles.  Bragg claims that they might have finished the job with more daylight.  However, continuous replenishment of Union reinforcements brought the defeat of General Bragg's army."],"display_date":"October 8, 1862","search_date":"1862-10-08","locations":[{"id":5243,"lat":37.2357439505,"lng":-83.2211252814,"zoom":9,"place":"PERRY, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}]}
