The majority of these slaves identified as Gullah and Geechee people. As Southerners left the islands to escape the occupation, slaves had the opportunity to buy land from their former owners. The Gullah and Geechee people who bought this land kept their African heritage alive. "," ","Gullah and Geechee refers to two different groups of African Americans; Geechee refers to those who are from the Georgia sea islands and Gullah refers to those who are from the South Carolina sea islands. The Gullah and Geechee people were and still are isolated from mainland culture. The Gullah and Geechee people live collectively on the same property. Since they like to have minimal ties to the outside world, they grow their own crops and cook traditional meals. Furthermore, they honor their ancestors that worked on the very plantations where they currently live, by speaking in their unique dialect and practicing rituals that date back hundreds of years."," ","The result of the newly freed slaves created an extraordinary culture that is unique to the sea islands of the Lowcountry and has withstood nearly six generations. Although the people are still  present on the islands today, their property is under legal fire. The turn of the 20th century brought about discomfort for the Gullah and Geechee. Resort towns began to pop up around the islands of Cumberland, Jeckyll, Ossabaw, Sapelo, and St. Simons became reservations and popular tourist destinations. Today, resort towns, like Hilton Head Island, are quickly developing near Gullah property. Even more troubling, the Gullah people have heirs property, meaning property was passed down through verbal will without legal documentation. Because of this, real-estate moguls are finding loop holes to obtain the coveted property. "," ","The Gullah and Geechee people have seen trials throughout their entire existence. From being enslaved to being newly freed, they had to confront the adversity of mainland culture and are currently in legal and communal battles over their heirs property on the sea islands of Georgia and South Carolina. "," "," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1861 - January 1, 1961","search_date":"1911-01-02","locations":[{"id":52942,"lat":32.3790843,"lng":-80.6926069,"zoom":5,"place":"port royal, sc"},{"id":52943,"lat":32.216316,"lng":-80.752608,"zoom":4,"place":"hilton head island"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2978,"tag":"Confederate"},{"id":1609,"tag":"georgia"},{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"},{"id":3065,"tag":"gullah"},{"id":3066,"tag":"geechee"},{"id":3067,"tag":"port royal experiment"},{"id":3068,"tag":"sea islands"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War through the Lens of Biography","school":"Furman University","course_id":160,"school_id":4}},{"id":6665,"title":"Harriet Tubmans Raid","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1863-06-01","end_date":"1863-06-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Harriet Tubman’s Raid"," ","            Between 1815 and 1822, Harriet Tubman was born to Ben Ross and Harriet Green in Dorchester County, Maryland. Many people know this courageous woman to have saved anywhere from 50-70 slaves in her time conducting the Underground Railroad. But what many people do not know about her, is she is responsible for rescuing an additional 720 slaves in a reconnaissance mission for the Union in 1863. The first raid led by a woman in the Civil War. Freeing over 10 times the number of slaves during her 11 years running the Underground Railroad."," ","            In 1862, Harriet Tubman arrived in Port Royal, South Carolina to support the Union. She started teaching freed slave women how to make a living with the Union Army with certain skills. She then began to spy for the Union Army and then began getting news of more slaves in the country and started taking trips up the Combahee River to investigate."," ","             “On June 1, 1863, Tubman and Union Colonel James Montgomery steamed into the interior with 300 black Union soldiers. The troops swept through nearby plantations, burning homes and barns as Union gunboats sounded their whistles. Slave men, women and children came streaming from the countryside...” In this quote, you can get a sense of how Tubman and her “army” wanted this mission to be. A slash and burn operation to say the least. She was asked to speak on this event, “When our armies and gun-boats first appeared in any part of the South, many of the poor negroes were as much afraid of \"de Yankee Buckra\" as of their own masters. It was almost impossible to win their confidence, or to get information from them. But to Harriet they would tell anything; and so it became quite important that she should accompany expeditions going up the rivers, or into unexplored parts of the country, to control and get information from those whom they took with them as guides.” "," ","            After this successful raid, Tubman went on to spy for the Union Army and complete other missions with the Massachusetts 54th Infantry. Then 100 years later, in 1963, a group of black feminists formed calling themselves the Combahee River Collective, in honor of Harriet Tubman’s daring efforts to help bring slavery to an end.
