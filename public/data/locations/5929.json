He proposed the construction of a huge public park that would \"be enjoyed by thousands of all classes, without distinction.\"  The ideals of Romanticism and the Republican view of the importance of nature were at a peak among educated Americans at this time and this commentator proposed a way to manifest these ideals.  New York City, being the largest city as well as the informational center, certainly had many who supported the idea that nature should be valued and used respectfully to enrich one's mind and refresh one's spirit.  From these beliefs arose the idea for the creation of a huge park to be enjoyed by all the citizens of New York City.  This journalist, in <u>The Horticulturist, and Journal of Rural Art and Rural Taste</u>, was one of the first to publish his opinions on the issue and explain the beginnings of such a park.  He criticized New York for not having enough open public spaces, and emphasized the Republican idea that nature is closely linked with virtue and comparing New York to cities in Europe, most of which had public parks.  The mayor of New York at the time, Ambrose Kingsland, had recently proposed 160 acres for a park.  This proposal was the first of its kind in America for park of such large scale, but the writer condemned this as being too small.  He suggested a 500 acre plot of land between the Harlem River and 39th, land that is in fact today part of Central Park.   Although this author's passionate essay on the importance of establishing a large park brought no immediate action, it marked the beginning of a huge public interest in such an endeavor.  Two years later, in 1853, there were still only 143 acres out of New York's 14,000 dedicated to public spaces, including cemeteries.  Many later authors continued the journalist's argument; one enumerated the reasons why such a park was a necessity for the city, being a haven for health, recreation, and driving and riding.  The park's approval and design finally took form in the late 1850's.  The proposal for Central Park had a huge impact on New York City as well as the patterns of urban development across the country."],"display_date":1851,"search_date":"1851-07-02","locations":[{"id":8924,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4093,"title":"Women&#39;s Benevolent Societies\n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1831-09-14","end_date":"1831-09-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 14, 1831, members of the Female Assistance Society of New York met to discuss preparations for their charitable work for the upcoming winter.  Eighteen years previously, the organization had been founded by wives of high status New York men who wished to do more than simply be an ordinary housewife.  The main focus of this non profit organization was to provide as much assistance as possible to the poor and homeless people living on the streets of New York City.  It was to be made clear to the rest of society that these women were not focusing on their own charity work out of selfishness; their simple goal was to aid the poor, sick, widowed, and homeless, and provide these people with a fraction of the sense of security they themselves felt.  At this particular meeting, the officers discussed how they should be preparing for the approaching winter in regards to helping the homeless.  The previous winter had been terrible, and the members of the organization wanted to ensure that they would have the capabilities to provide assistance to more people than they had in earlier years.","The Female Assistance Society of New York was not the first formal organization of women.  Primarily in New York and Boston, females of prominent Protestant households had been working in organized groups to assist the less fortunate for decades.  During their early years, the procedural aspects of these societies were managed solely by women, but in order to reach their goals, male counterparts were called in for financial management purposes.  Some groups were more successful than others, and this depended largely on the demographic of the group they were attempting to assist.  The New York Society for the Relief of Poor Widows wit Small Children campaigned successfully for funds, while the Boston Female Moral Reform Society faced more trouble finding financial support, as the most prominent members of society were reluctant to donate to a charity for \"unrespectable\" women.  ","By 1850, the most prevalent female organization was the Ladies Benevolent Society, which had many of the same goals as the Female Assistance Society.  Founded by the wives of prominent Protestant men of the time, this society provided aid and a foundation of Christian beliefs to those less fortunate, particularly widows and orphans.  The creation of such societies that were managed entirely by women were the early foundations of the women's rights movement that dominated a large part in the history of the early twentieth century.  Although these women were not seeking independence from their husbands or any rights of their own, the way in which they organized entire societies on their own accord with little or no help from the men in their lives shows how women were able to take initiative to accomplish what they wanted on their own.

The caricature of \"Jim Crow\" was meant to represent a low class runaway slave who used cunning to reap the benefits of middleclass lifestyle without any of the responsibility.  Rice performed this character on stage using burnt cork black face makeup, and was the most popular performer in England and in the United States for two decades.

Embury on December 10, 1831. Embury spoke at the anniversary ceremony for the Brooklyn Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies. She pointed out that although schooling was becoming more prevalent across the country, female education and its reputation was still lagging behind the education that males were receiving. Embury emphasized that intellectual women were \"enough to convince any unprejudiced mind that heaven has conferred upon woman, no less than upon man, the gifts of talent and genius.\" She proclaimed that men and women were equally capable and that increasing the education of women was of utmost importance. Embury declared, \"A good education includes the culture of the heart as well as the mind.\" Individuals should be well-rounded, capable, intelligent citizens. Therefore, early childhood education was extremely important. Since mothers generally did most of the nurturing, Embury said, the education of women was extremely beneficial for society. ","Embury was not the only person to promote education for women in the United States. Female seminaries began to develop between 1820 and 1850. By 1850, there were 6,085 academies and seminaries in America. A large percentage of these were co-educational or open exclusively to women. Schools continued to open and expand their curriculums. Many educational reformers believed that such schools would not only provide women with a large knowledge base, but also \"prepared [them] for their important duties as virtuous wives.\" They felt that women would be better prepared to nurture their children and \"uplift the moral character of their sons and husbands\" if they were well-educated. Embury's speech outlined the benefits of the education of women, informing her readers of its necessity and pointing out that even \"the character of our illustrious [George] Washington was formed by his mother.\" "],"display_date":"December 10, 1831","search_date":"1831-12-10","locations":[{"id":8867,"lat":40.6450686304,"lng":-73.9495584018,"zoom":11,"place":"KINGS, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":6,"school_id":2}},{"id":4123,"title":"Record-Setting Railroad\n","course_id":5,"status":"P","start_date":"1876-06-01","end_date":"1876-06-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Shrouded in a mist of smoke and steam, the train lurched into the station. Having completed its cross-country trip more than four hours ahead of schedule, the Transcontinental Express finally ground to a halt.  The <em>Friends' Intelligencer </em>claimed that the trip, leaving from Jersey City at 1:00 A.M. on June 1, 1876 and arriving in San Francisco approximately half past nine on the morning of the 4th, was made by a speed train in \"26 minutes less than 84 hours,\" or three and a half days. Such a journey in a normal locomotive would have taken seven days. The <em>Scientific American </em>professed the Transcontinental Express \"to be the longest and fastest continuous run that has ever been made on any road in any country.\" This statement reveals the sentiment favoring technological innovation and record setting pace that prevailed in the society during that time. ","Historian Sarah Gordon claims that \"express trains\" were passenger trains that carried express packages and did not stop at every station. She states that these trains \"usually traveled about thirty miles an hour, somewhat faster than other through trains.\" Due to America's burgeoning economy during the 1870s and 1880s, most trains carried a combination of passengers and goods for exchange in other areas. However, slower passenger trains that stopped at every station were available for those who needed it. According to Gordon, these \"accommodation trains ran along through routes, usually at ten to twenty miles per hour.\" While practical use usually dictated the speed of trains, the social status of passengers usually dictated the service, luxury, and safety found onboard, at least initially. The luxurious Pullman cars, decorated in the style of Victorian England, and various private cars were often used by the rich for extended travel. These cars stood in stark contrast to the rancid, poorly lit, and anachronistic passenger cars and day coaches that were frequented by the poor, who often used the railroad for transportation over shorter distances. Eventually, as Gordon postulates, \"the railroads sought to draw all lines under the same rules of operation, regardless of passenger needs. Beginning in the 1880s the science of railroading began to displace remarkable social diversity of passenger travel.\"","Therefore, as railroads such as the Transcontinental Express became faster, more powerful, and more widely used, problems in the system led to the need for regulation and standardization. \"Especially between 1870 and 1900, railroads leaned in the direction of national standards in ticketing, time, track gauges, baggage, the structure of train cars, and the behavior of passengers.\" Not all attempts at standardization were successful. For instance, the Master Car-Builders' Association suggested standard brakes, seats, couplings, heating apparatuses, and ventilating systems on cars during the 1870s, but not all railroads could afford such upgrades to be made. At the same time, attempts were made to set ticket prices, yet none were very successful. On the other hand, many efforts at homogenization were successful. Standard time was universally adopted in 1883, making scheduling significantly easier and more predictable. Also in 1883, railroad companies placed a 250-pound limit on passenger luggage. Three years later, between May 31 and June 1, 1886, most railroads conformed to standard gauge of four feet eight and one-half inches wide, vastly improving the efficiency of transportation as railroads could connect with one another. By 1890, \"a new national standard of reasonable behavior\" permeated the railroad as employees, as well as passengers, were called to abide by a pragmatic code of conduct, \"to make public behavior compatible with urban technology and with the needs of crowds rather than the needs of the individual,\" according to Gordon. While trains such as the Transcontinental Express were setting transportation records, the standards on faster and more powerful trains \"developed to promote the efficient and safe transfer of passengers in all parts of the country.\""],"display_date":"June 1, 1876 - June 4, 1876","search_date":"1876-06-02","locations":[{"id":8523,"lat":40.7416518725,"lng":-74.0773468609,"zoom":11,"place":"HUDSON, New Jersey"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2007)","school":"Furman University","course_id":5,"school_id":4}},{"id":4139,"title":"The Washingtonian Temperance Society and the Influence on Women \n","course_id":6,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-05-01","end_date":"1842-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["    The Washingtonian Temperance Society started in May 1840 by six Baltimore drinking buddies who decided to write and sign a pledge stating that they would no longer consume alcohol.

By the end of 1841 Washingtonians claimed that over 200,000 had signed their pledge, and by 1842 they had recruited over one million people. The Washingtonian Temperance Society took a new approach to curing intemperance.

Embury argued that a proper education would finally help women gain the recognition that they felt they were worthy of receiving. ","With the growing interest in female education, many of those advocating for it were apprehensive of how the men would respond. For years women were not treated with the same equality as men; they were seen as the weaker sex thus female education was not seen as a necessity. Editor Sarah Josepha Hale voiced her belief that the only reason the intelligence of men seemed superior to that of women was because women were only involved in duties as a housewife, and men had more chances to acquire greater knowledge. Slowly, after much debate, the views on the education of females began to shift. Eventually a women's education was seen as being necessary in order for them to properly carry out their obligations as both a mother and wife. They believed that if a woman did not obtain appropriate knowledge, how could she impart proper wisdom upon her children?

Simms believed that generations to follow would remember the triumph of the women who exemplified the best qualities of both men and women.","            The Civil War years offered women in both the North and the South new ways to participate in society.  A small number disguised themselves as men and snuck onto the battlefield, others became nurses, and still more stayed at home to sew uniforms and pack provisions.  From the start of the war in 1861, magazines such as <em>Harper's Weekly</em> encouraged women to sacrifice their resources, time, and families for their nation.  After kissing their husbands and sons farewell, women set up domestic labor groups to fulfill their patriotic duties and show courage even while far removed from the battlefield.  This courage demanded that women suffer emotional wounds sometimes considered more harmful than the physical wounds suffered by the men they loved.","            As the war progressed, resources in the South grew slim and women became impatient.  As more sons and husbands died, women began to question their role in society without a man - should they devote themselves wholeheartedly to the war or fight for their own freedom?  The elite women's dresses grew dingy while the lower classes struggled to find bread and coffee for each night's meal.  Over time sewing groups turned into political discussions, and the boldest women began writing letters to government officials and army officers beseeching them to bring the men home.  Others wrote poems and prayers published in magazines, trying to impress the magnitude of their suffering.  Letters to their husbands begged them to come home to protect their families.  Southern women feared God was no longer on their side.  As they debated whether it might be easier on the battlefield than at home, they tried to find the balance between gentleness and valor required of them.

Barnett's <em>The Ignoble Savage </em>tells us the colonists often regarded the Indians as \" 'aesthetical, proud, wild, barbarous, bruitish (in one word) diabolicall creatures.'\"","The conclusion we can gather from Thatcher, Fairchild, and Barnett is that during the 19th century there was a sort of growing sense of romantic naturalism associated with the Indian, and that the view of the Indian was indeed dynamic, although there was still a considerable force of prejudice and racism to be reckoned with.

Henry W. Grady was born in Georgia and was throughout his career a spokesman, a proponent, and an ambassador for the South to the rest of the world. Growing up in the disenfranchised and embittered South, Grady had a vision of a reintegrated South that would take its place of glory and prominence in the newly restored nation. Harold Davis describes how Grady, who was barely in his thirties when his career took off, became a \"household [name] in the homes of most educated Americans.\" His most famous and influential speech came in 1886 when he addressed the New England Society in New York. In that renowned speech he referred to what famously became known as the \"New South.\" It was a speech and a phrase that would forever change the perceptions and views of the South.","One of the chief editors of the Atlanta Constitution and a key politician in the city of Atlanta, Grady was a very influential man. Davis describes that despite his poor health, Grady, in 1886, accepted an invitation to speak for the annual New England Society's convention. Lots hype was created and centered on this southern politician's coming to New York and speaking in front of such a prestigious group. Grady was not to disappoint. As soon as he began his speech, the audience was rendered spell-bound. The Atlanta Constitution reports that the speech was \"the best speech that [had] been delivered in years\" and that its \"triumph was instant.\"  Delivered with great zeal and charisma, the speech spoke of a \"New South,\" one of redemption and glory. Davis tells of how Grady invoked his audience to remember the \"prophecy of [Daniel] Webster when he said that 'standing hand to hand and clasping hands, we should remain united...all united now and united forever.'\" Davis retells how when the speech was over, Grady was \"mobbed where he stood.\"","On the home front in the South, the speech was met with similar success. The Constitution relates how both Louisiana and Virginia \"cordially approved\" of the speech. Also in Tennessee the speech was \"well received\" and \"the sentiments therein [were] heartily endorsed.\" All in all, the South was pleased that it was so well represented by Grady and that \"the ideas that prevail[ed]\" throughout the South \"made such a favorable impression\" upon a northern audience. A brave and bold yet caring and cordial man, Grady was the champion that the South needed at that point in its history. Through the mediums of the media and journalism, Grady attempted to restore prominence and legitimacy to the South, and for his efforts he became a southern and even a national hero.

According to the New York Times in July of 1888, there was \"a vast army of men and women and a few children in New York engaged in making clothes.\" Historically, the clothes industry had undergone many tariff protections. For instance, all the parts of a woman's dress or a man's suit were \"protected\" by astronomical tariffs: on such items as \"raw wool, the cotton yarn, the print cloth, the thread, the buttons, linings, trimmings and woolen cloth.\" The article, \"Clothes Makers and the Tariff,\" argued for the Mill Bill, a bill that would allow for laborers to enjoy higher wages and, consequently, a better and cheaper standard of living. This piece of legislation hoped to encourage these positive alterations by making wool \"free,\" like cotton, which already enjoyed freedom from large duties. ","    In 1888, cotton's rate of duty was approximately 40 percent, compared to the 69 percent experienced by the wool industry. The New York Times discovered that this increase in duty did not benefit the wage earners. Instead, it merely added to the profits of the companies. Meanwhile, there were large numbers of people smuggling foreign goods into the country, which only further increased the problems instilled by the current duty. The Mill Bill hoped to take positive actions to \"excel\" in the worldwide clothing manufacturing market, a foreign idea in the \"cloth making business\" in the late 19th century. Instead, countries such as England dominated in these areas because of the United States' high duties. ","    The factories, which should have been filled with the \"music of contented labor,\" were instead filled with the miserable sounds of the \"poverty-stricken.\" The introduction of the Mill Bill would allow factories to become happier places, with lower costs to the manufacturer and lower costs of materials. With the reduction of duties as proposed by this bill, the United States and New York City would be able to compete with foreign competitors, have happier employees, and extend the clothing market. ","    The sentiments expressed through both this article and the Mill Bill were supported by the women and the Democrat Party's campaign throughout 1888 and 1892. Women worked in these clothing factories in an 11:1 ratio of females to males, and shopping and consumerism had continually become a female duty. The Democratic Party and the tariff reform movement involved both working-class women and middle-class women, whose voices strove to be heard through the ballots of their husbands. The Democratic Party employed moral arguments for economic reforms as Democratic women argued that these tariffs were stealing incomes from hard-working families, and they blamed the Republicans for this insanity. Through reforms such as the tariff reform, women gained their political voice as they marched their husbands to the ballot boxes. As reported by the Woman's Tribune, \"political parties [began] to take note of what will be women's wish.\" In the 1890 election, women's influence and the tariff issue seemed to dominate the Democrat's \"sweeping victories,\" as women gained political power through the ballots of their men and under the pretext of tariff reform and legislation, such as the Mill Bill.

In these typically Republican states, votes were counted, thrown out, and bought, but the final results favored a flabbergasted Hayes. The final verdict was that Hayes had defeated Tilden by one electoral vote, even though the popular vote had favored Tilden by a narrow margin.

This was an important event because the international slave trade had been considered piracy but had not been prosecuted due to the existence of slavery in the United States. Now, however, the Lincoln administration changed all that with the first execution by hanging of one of the most notorious and successful of all of the slave traders.","Gordon, a native of Maine, had been engaged in the slave trade for many years. On August 8, 1860 off the West Coast of Africa his ship stopped and was boarded by Lieutenant Henry D. Todd, U.S.N. of the United States steamer <em>Mohican</em>. When Lieutenant Todd boarded the ship which was flying the American flag he was horrified by both the sight and smell of what he saw.  On board, he found eight hundred and ninety-seven men, women and children. They ranged in age from six months to forty years; half were children and the other half, one quarter men and one quarter women. They were so crowded together he could not move without stepping on someone. The smell was so foul as to be sickening. Disease ran rampant. Twenty-nine had died and been thrown overboard.","The sailors claimed that they had been told this was a legitimate voyage or they would have never signed on. They also said that it was obvious that Gordon was the Captain. Gordon eventually admitted to them that the <em>Erie</em> was a slave ship and they were told they would receive one dollar for each slave who arrived safely at their destination.","Gordon was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to death by hanging. All attempts to have him pardoned were unsuccessful and he was scheduled to be hanged. The night before, he somehow managed to come into the possession of a poison, probably strychnine, and attempted to commit suicide rather than face the hangman's noose. Unfortunately for him, his attempt was thwarted by the efforts of physicians who pumped his stomach and saved his life. ","Gordon's last request was that they cut a lock of his hair and send it to his wife along with a ring he removed from his finger. Gordon was given rather large amounts of whiskey to keep him alive for the execution and so he was not sober when he went to his fate. ","The execution of Gordon was so important a signal of the impending end of the slave trade that the execution was held in an unlikely place – City Prison, New York City – better known as \"The Tombs\". Gordon was the only slave trader ever executed in the United States.

At the time, no one knew exactly where the sparks had ignited and the fire begun, but by Thursday afternoon, the flames had engulfed approximately seventeen square blocks on and surrounding Wall Street. An article in the magazine The Albion indicated that by Thursday evening between 700 and 1000 buildings in the financial district, many only five or six years old, had been damaged.  Firefighters desperately attempted to extinguish the flames, but the unusually cold weather was accompanied by high winds.  As a result, flames quickly spread and water hoses froze, making the job near impossible.  Finally, fire companies chose to collect gunpowder from Navy Yards nearby and demolish buildings in the path of the fire to prevent it spreading to other parts of the city.","The final estimate suggested New Yorkers lost the equivalent of fifteen million dollars in private property during the fifteen hour fire. Insurance companies holding policies on many of the city's downtown buildings were ruined, some able to pay only twenty-five to fifty cents on the dollar in benefits.  Remarkably, shipping facilities along the river's banks remained safe from major damage.  Yet New York lay in ruins, and local officials sent in militias to protect against looting and damage over the coming weekend.  \"The arm of man was powerless…\" a journalist wrote, \"and many of our fellow citizens who retired to pillows in affluence, were bankrupts upon awaking.\"","New York had grown quickly in the early nineteenth century, and as the city expanded, fire companies, which had served as social clubs to many property owners in the past, now became associations for the poorer and much larger working classes of the American city.  Not only did these companies grow rapidly (some individual companies exceeding memberships of 300), but they became rallying points of community loyalty, oftentimes based on ethnicity. The result was fierce rivalry between the companies themselves.  In Philadelphia, for example, Irish Catholic and Irish Protestant companies raced horse-drawn hose carriages through the streets en route to a fire while in the process sabotaging one another's equipment, disabling truck wheels and cutting tow lines.  Competition between rival companies would often become so fierce that riots began.  In New York, as in Philadelphia, this trend only worsened as time went on, as some companies carried overlapping memberships with community gangs that could lead to further violence.  Naturally, these tensions directly related to the effectiveness of companies in extinguishing fires."],"display_date":"December 16, 1835 - December 17, 1835","search_date":"1835-12-16","locations":[{"id":8919,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4450,"title":"Bayard Rustin and Israeli Air Support\n","course_id":19,"status":"P","start_date":"6/28/70","end_date":"6/28/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1970 Bayard Rustin gathered many civil rights leaders and black public officials in support of an appeal to Washington.

Hine's work often demonstrated the dignity of the worker, but reflected the purposes of those who hired him. Hines was surrounded by and influenced by the vibrant reform movement and worked closely with Felix Adler, head of the National Child Labor Committee for which his photo entitled 'Home Work' was taken. It was believed by these Progressives that poverty might be eliminated by publicizing the plight of the poor. The ills of tenement life, the exploitation of child labor, and the practice of homework as evident in the photo by Hine became three issues Progressives toiled to change in urban environments like the Lower East Side of New York.","In most tenements, there was only one room that had access to outside air, leaving the interior rooms dark and unventilated. Overcrowding, neglect on the part of the owners, and violation of the simplest rules of sanitation by the tenants, together with the design of the building, created serious hygienic problems. These living quarters usually had no more than two rooms. One room typically served as a kitchen and living space, and the other as a bedroom. Families often set up one of these rooms as a sweatshop as well and together the family would spend long hours rolling cigars, making artificial flowers, or most commonly sewing clothes.","The industry of producing ready-made clothing increased greatly at the turn of the twentieth century and coincided nicely with the influx of immigrant laborers. This particular industry was organized as a contract system where cloth was purchased by the contractor from the textile manufacturer. The fabric was then cut and finished by hired garment workers who completed the work in their apartments. The practice of home work became a serious issue because it often meant the use of child labor, exploitation of workers outside of the factory setting, and the development of goods under unsanitary conditions. In response to public concern about industrial homework, some states, including New York, tried to regulate tenement homework. These regulations aimed to protect the consumers from health problems associated with purchasing goods produced under unsanitary conditions. This was done by prohibiting the manufacture of certain articles in dwelling places and that these tenements meet certain sanitary and health provisions. It would still take several years and further efforts by Progressives to have regulations of homework put in place to benefit the lives and rights of the families performing the housework.","Despite these initial regulations, tenement manufacture was still being done under unhealthy conditions for low wages, long hours, and through the continued exploitation of child labor. Although several compulsory education and child labor laws were passed in New York at the end of the nineteenth century, these laws were difficult to enforce. The Compulsory Education Law of 1874 had tried to require all children between eight and fourteen to attend school for fourteen weeks a year, but one survey of 371 home workers from 110 families found that nearly half of those workers were under the age of sixteen. Further attempts to strengthen the regulations on home work came in 1913 with licensing provisions which meant that employers were required to obtain special permits before they could give out material to employees for tenement manufacture. The Child Labor Law was also extended to cover this type of manufacturing. These stronger policies did not alleviate the problems with home labor, however; an investigation conducted ten years later found that practically nothing had changed. It was not until the 1930s when laws were passed at the federal and state level to prohibit homework."],"display_date":1910,"search_date":"1910-07-02","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":65,"tag":"Child Labor"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4470,"title":"Class Tensions Arise in the Markets of Hester Street","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-01-01","end_date":"1898-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"The true heart of the Lower East Side beat in the street,\" and Hester Street was no exception. It served as the hub of life in the Lower East Side – teeming with women shopping, children playing and peddlers manning their pushcarts full of food. While the tenements towered high above blocking out the sky, the streets were overrun with peddlers and their pushcarts and their female clientele milling about from cart to cart, bartering and looking for the best deal. Between 1880 and 1890 over 60,000 Jews inhabited the Lower East Side, and for them, the streets served as their community center, marketplace, and playground. Everything that Jewish immigrant families needed could be found in the markets and carts on Hester Street crowding the streets: groceries, books, and even house wares. Interaction, especially for Jewish women, in the markets of Hester Street was vital to their survival in the new American culture","Immigrant women in New York's lower East Side lived a decidedly different life than the progressive reforming women. The staunch lines drawn public and private space did not apply to everyday immigrant realities. The cult of domesticity promoted the virtues of women managing their private sphere docile passivity, By contrast, Jewish immigrant women of the Lower East Side readily and actively engaged in public life and the market economy. Some even operated their own pushcarts and stalls. The streets of the Lower East Side were more than mere thoroughfares and marketplaces a place for women to congregate, forge social networks, and exert their influence.","The active place that Jewish immigrant women held in public market life was at odds with the established American bourgeois ideals concerning women's roles and propriety. It was not uncommon for Jewish women to work in the markets, peddle goods, while also managing the fiscal affairs for the family. They were accustomed to these breadwinning roles from the old country. But though Hester Street closely resembled European street markets, the moral reformers did not approve. Instead, they saw the poverty of the Lower East Side as a sign of a moral failure on the part of the Jewish mothers. The reformers sought a regeneration of the immigrant population through the adoption of the reformer's own Protestant work ethic. Female social workers at the time, like those of Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago, did not see Jewish women's role in the market place as a way for these women to exercise their authority and autonomy. Rather they saw it as an example of idleness and chaos. They disapproved of women's participation in street life. The tension between the dueling views of a woman's place –connecting with the other immigrant women in the street versus acting solely as the queen of the household came to a head not in the first generation immigrant, but rather their daughters.

As American Jewish historian Hasia Diner notes, \"at the right moment in time, under the right conditions, ordinary places become transformed into spaces throbbing with meaning.\"  Such was the case with New York's iconic Lower East Side.  The photo shows Hester Street, a main avenue through the Lower East Side, clearly depicting the neighborhood's massive population.  The scene is inundated with adults selling goods and children playing in the street, framed by dozens of towering tenement houses crowded closely together.  Due to the living conditions within the tenements, most activities like business and recreation took place in the street.","As author Deborah Hopkinson details, in the mid 1800s, tenement buildings were hurriedly and inexpensively built in the Lower East Side to quickly accommodate hoards of new immigrants.  Hearing stories about new opportunities available in a predominantly Jewish atmosphere, multitudes of European Jews flocked to New York, America's hub of immigration, in search of a new life.  By the late 1800s, the Lower East Side quickly earned a reputation as America's ultimate Jewish neighborhood, filled with Jewish immigrants.  By 1910, more Jews lived in New York City than any other city in history.  But, with such a rapid influx of people, the Lower East Side neighborhood was forced to deal with a serious urban housing problem: overcrowding.","Tenement buildings served as the main source of housing, providing very modest living spaces for newly arrived immigrants.  But, over time, most Lower East Side tenements fell into disrepair as many landlords lacked interest in maintenance or improvements.  Therefore, by the 1880s, the already overcrowded tenements became unsafe and unhealthy havens of filth, often lacking necessary amenities.  The worsening living conditions of the Lower East Side drove some individuals to action, including Jewish immigrant and journalist Jacob Riis.  Noting that \"nowhere in the world are so many people crowded together on a square mile as [the Lower  East Side],\" Riis drew attention to the urban overcrowding problem through photographs.","With the invention of flash photography in the 1880s, Riis and other individuals were able to clearly depict Lower East Side housing problems by capturing indoor images of the actual dark, decrepit, overpopulated living spaces inside the tenements.  Riis' revealing photos later appeared in his famous 1890 book, <em>How the Other Half Lives</em>, influencing later New York City housing reforms like the Tenement House Law of 1901 and the creation of the Tenement House Commission.  These decisions enforced new safety and health standards for New York's overcrowded tenement buildings and set a precedent for urban renewal in the United States."],"display_date":"1880 - 1901","search_date":"1890-12-31","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4472,"title":"Murder of Geographic Proportions","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-06-25","end_date":"1897-11-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["","What is more interesting than a story that involves a jealous love triangle that results in the murder of a man and the arrest of another who has been betrayed by a friend and lover? It is the realization that this is not a plot line for a fictional soap opera, but a real account that occurred in the Lower East Side of New York City in 1897. Martin Thorn and William Guidensuppe were both competing for the love of Mrs. Nack. When the barber, Thorn, discovered the encounters of Nack and Guidensuppe he was overcome with jealousy and killed Guidensuppe with Nack's help. The role that gender plays into this murder is not unusual when the urban circumstance is considered because the strict limitations placed on individuals by their close proximity to others.  When people are placed closer together there is more violence between males because they are hoping to establish a sense of dominance not only in the community, but also to protect their resources.  In this situation it could be argued that Thorn saw Guidensuppe as a threat to his relationships and his territory. Furthermore, it is the role that geography played out in development and resolution of this crime that is truly unique.","While the actual murder occurred in the Woodside community in Long Island, the body was purposely cut into pieces and hidden around New York so that the authorities would not be able to identify the victim, Guidensuppe. Two children from the Lower East Side found one part of the body when they were playing along the East River. They discovered only the torso and arms, while they discovered that the rest of the body was missing. The lower half of Guidenssupe's trunk was found in the northern part of the city by the Washington Bridge, and eventually the legs were found in a Navy-Yard in Brooklyn. The deliberate placement of the body pieces shows that Thorn and Nack's perceptions of communities within the city and the constraint that it places on the citizens was too strong to extend beyond the neighborhoods they lived in. The Chicago School of sociologists would argue that this had a huge impact on their decision to carry out the murder in such a unique way because they theorize that environmental characteristics like density, housing types, land use, social heterogeneity define the social constraints of an individual. If we hold this theory to be true it is understandable why Thorn and Nack would have thought this was the perfect crime because the threesome lived in a close proximity despite the size of the city: Guidensuppe worked for a Turkish bath on West Forty-Second Street and Mrs. Nack lived on near by on Ninth Avenue.","Location, however, was not a limiting factor and this was due mostly to the influence of the media.  As the men who found the remains at the Washington Bridge location recognized the unique packaging as a result of reading about the Lower East Side reports of a mutilated body being found in similar packaging. This is explained by the sociodemographic theory in which social interactions with neighbors are based in differential access to resources that allow people to deal with their social environment, and the paper being a constant resource in New York City these various enclaves were drawn together rather than being kept separate. This murder also showed the role of national media and its growth in this period as this article about the Guidensuppe murder was found in the Chicago Tribune. The editor and founder of the Chicago Tribune, Joseph Medill, was known for publishing sensational stories in hopes of gaining readers. This story certainly fits the bill with its articulate and vivid language like, \"body shockingly mutilated.\" While the motives of Medill were most likely profit driven to publish this piece it gives New York City a sense of legitimacy as their news was being published in other cities, and also gives rise to the spread of information around the country.  "," "," "],"display_date":"June 25, 1897 - November 8, 1897","search_date":"1897-09-01","locations":[{"id":8931,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":70,"tag":"Geography"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4473,"title":"Triangle Factory Fire","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"3/25/11","end_date":"3/25/11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The immigrant women working in Triangle Shirtwaist Factory called it a \"prison.\" Its safety and working conditions were abysmally low, but these conditions were not unique: New York was an epicenter for industrialization, containing thousands of unsafe factories filled with recent immigrants. In 1909, many factory workers organized a strike to protest unsafe conditions, and most factories met their demands, but among the resisters were the owners of The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory.  On March 25, 1911, as the 600 workers of the factory, the majority of whom were Jewish and Irish immigrant women, were preparing to leave, a fire broke out in the factory.  In no more than half an hour 146 workers were dead, either burning or jumping to their deaths.  This accident was one of many that occurred that year, but it became much bigger than a tragedy for a few blocks of immigrants from the Lower East Side.","The fire was especially memorable because it was witnessed by so many people and because so many groups used the memory of these women to call for political and social reform. Those defending the factory owners presented the women as whorish and impressionable, but those in the middle class using the event to call for protective legislation presented the women as helpless victims. The working class challenged both these views, calling for more power for oppressed but competent workers.  One of the groups who most effectively propagated the memory of these women was the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. An article in the Ladies Garment Worker published shortly after the fire reflected the sense of outrage common among working class women after the fire, blaming the owners for the incident. Acting on these emotions, ILGWU made funeral arrangements for the unidentified women.  The purpose of the ceremony and protest was twofold: to honor the dead and protest the injustice done to them.  By honoring these women, the ILGWU was creating one of the greatest displays of class solidarity New York had ever experienced.","The main voices behind the protests following the fire were those of members of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. To the ILGWU the women who were killed during the fire were representations both of the injustice many unskilled workers faced in factories and the powerlessness of workers: these women were killed by the apathy of owners who were more concerned about profit than safety. Leaders like Rose Schneiderman used the images of competent but oppressed women during mass demonstrations and strikes to gain support for a movement towards industrial democracy. Pointing out that this tragedy would not have occurred if concessions were made during the 1909 strikes, Schneiderman cited the need for social justice in the workplace.  While the ILGWU stressed needs of all workers, they also pushed for women's suffrage, arguing that women had died because they were not able to act politically.","Through the manipulation of the worker's images to fit their purposes, various groups made the Triangle Factory Fire a very accessible event.  Although it was often simplified to an example of gender oppression or poor working conditions, it also made many aware of the need for reform and a greater sensitivity to the needs of those on the gender and socioeconomic margins. Through their protests, the ILGWU used the event to represent the plight of immigrants, workers, and women everywhere.  The event became more than something that would be preserved in the collective memories of a few Italian and Jewish neighborhoods in the Lower East Side of New York, it was claimed by those oppressed in various conditions and situations."],"display_date":"March 25, 1911","search_date":"1911-03-25","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":71,"tag":"historical memory"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4474,"title":"The New York Milk Committee Preaches Pure Milk by Moving Pictures","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"3/24/13","end_date":"3/24/13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Urban infants in the 1840s had only a 50 percent chance of living to the age of five. Progressive reformers believed that high infant mortality was linked to adulterated and infectious milk, a concern that remained even after New York passed regulation laws. On March 25, 1913, the Committee of Women's Organizations of the New York Milk Committee held a meeting to educate mothers living in the tenements of the Lower East Side on the importance of \"pure\" milk and of clean living areas. Dr. Lee W. Thomas, a member of the New York Milk Committee, encouraged the mothers to get milk from New York Health Department milk stations, to keep clean homes, and to influence their husbands to vote for the passage of pure milk bills, which were introduced to the New York Legislature by the Milk Committee. After Dr. Thomas spoke to the mothers, films were shown to illustrate the dangers of impure milk.","During the mid-nineteenth century, most of New York's milk supply came from \"swill\" milk stables attached to breweries and distilleries in the city. The cows in these stables ate the leftover grains from the fermentation process in the brewery or distillery. Unfortunately, the milk produced from these stables was very low quality and often full of bacteria. Even milk brought to the city from the country was often adulterated with water and carrying bacteria. In 1842, social reformer Robert Hartley published his <em>Essay on Milk</em>, which both praised milk as the \"perfect food\" and argued the importance of pure milk in New York City. Though New York City began to pass milk regulations in 1856, milk continued to be a concern for social reformers as a potential carrier of germs and diseases. Milk reform was part of a larger reform movement to regulate food, drink, and drugs, a movement that eventually resulted in the Federal Food and Drug Act of 1906, which made it illegal to adulterate or mislabel food or drugs. This put the power of information and choice in the hands of consumers, most of whom were women. Thus, even after this law was passed, social reformers felt impelled to guide tenement mothers in the importance of choosing good quality milk and keeping a clean home.","One of the means used by Progressive reformers, eager to use new technology, to preach cleanliness was moving pictures. Though this is an early instance of moving pictures being used as health propaganda, it is not the first. Three years before this meeting, Thomas Edison made a series of health propaganda films for the Tuberculosis Association. Whether or not the New York Milk Committee was aware of Edison's use of film, they obviously recognized the \"universal appeal\" of film and its potential as an educational device."],"display_date":"March 24, 1913","search_date":"1913-03-24","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":68,"tag":"Progressive Reformers"},{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":72,"tag":"Food Regulation"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4475,"title":"A Liberty Party Leader Assists A Fellow Abolitionist\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-07-27","end_date":"1852-07-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"Y","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Gerrit Smith was a prominent abolitionist and leader of the early Liberty Party during the 1840s and 1850s.  He worked to help slaves and promote abolitionism in his lifetime, including spending his own money for the cause.  In a letter to a friend, Smith described how he had posted bail on different occasions for a man named Chaplin, who was being punished for enticing slaves away from their southern masters.  Gerrit Smith felt that the money he spent on bailing Chaplin out of jail, though costly, was necessary because it was for a good and just purpose.  He wrote, \"I am robbed of these 12,000.  I have been robbed of a great deal from time to time, in the sums which I have felt myself morally compelled to pay in the purchase of the liberty of slaves.\"","As described by historian M. Leon Perkal, Gerrit Smith, along with other radicals of the Liberty Party, advocated an idea that interpreted the Constitution as providing abolition of slavery in all states, and guaranteeing the equality of African-Americans.  As a whole, the Liberty Party did not completely accept this novel interpretation; however it did represent the stances of some of its members on slavery.","Having the leader of a political party bail someone out of jail for trying to illegally free slaves demonstrates the contrasting range of political views in the 1840s and 1850s.  The radical abolitionists in the Liberty Party wanted to free all slaves, and believed they were constitutionally empowered to do it.  At the same time, law enforcement had every right, according to the Fugitive Slave Act, to put someone in jail for aiding in the escape of slaves.

Riis in his groundbreaking 1890 work, <em>How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York,</em> describe a desolate corner of the urban decay that characterized New York's Lower East Side in the late 1800s. Riis, a Danish immigrant who came to New York in 1870, used cutting edge flash photography to illustrate the depraved conditions of the city and quickly gained notoriety as one of the leading \"muckrakers;\" a name referring to group of reformers who used journalism to lead the way in exposing social problems and the call for reform.","One of the chapters in the book focuses on the conditions of Mulberry Bend just north of the Five Points, which Riis illustrates with a photograph showing the chaotic look of the street on a typical day. Riis describes in detail how street crime and gangs prevailed in \"the Bend\" over the local law enforcement and how the death rate was extremely high within the area, which was fifty percent higher than the rest of the city. Especially tragic was the death rate for children under five, which was significantly higher than all other areas. Central to the problem facing Riis at this time was a way to solve the issues of urban decay and the slums in a way which would go beyond the limitations of philanthropy but without advocating a socialist doctrine, which would be condemned by those in power. Beginning in 1888 and continuing into the 1890s Riis began giving lectures that incorporated photographs of the conditions of \"the Bend\" to philanthropic groups and the general public, which supplemented his journalistic newspaper writing to help spread awareness about the slum problem.","In 1888 the Tenement House Committee of New York had drawn up plans for Mulberry Park in the block between Bayard, Park, Baxter, and Mulberry streets, which made up the area known as \"the Bend.\" It would take six more years until the property was bought for the park. The major reason for the slow action by the committee stems from the hesitancy of city officials to mettle in the affairs of the landlords of tenements in the most need of change. It was the release of Riis's book and the public outcry that accompanied it that finally helped to push the city toward purchasing the land and building the park. On December 21, 1893 Riis offered a solution to the unemployment of the city in the New York <em>Evening Sun </em>in which he called for the use of public funds to hire workers to demolish the depraved buildings that made up \"the Bend.\" Even after the land was purchased and the buildings were demolished in 1895 the area remained barren until 1897 when the park opened. It was only due to increased pressure from Riis and other reformers that the park within the urban slum could be finally realized. Possibly the greatest irony involved in the creation of the park came at its dedication on June 15, 1897; a ceremony in which Riis was not invited to attend."],"display_date":"1888 - 1897","search_date":"1892-12-31","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":68,"tag":"Progressive Reformers"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4478,"title":"Boys and Baseball","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-02-09","end_date":"1883-02-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Boys do not like sitting around and talking. They would much rather be running, jumping, throwing, and screaming.","So it comes as a complete surprise to see that on February 9, 1883, a group of adolescent boys, aged anywhere from ten to sixteen, gathered together as delegates of eleven of New York's grammar schools to form a baseball club. The boys came from the city's schools, known by numbers and not by designated names, to elect officers, discuss membership, and resolve important problems like whether or not teachers should be umpires (According to the boys, teachers would make lousy umpires because they do not understand the game and may show favoritism). Acting very much like adults and unlike immature kids, the schoolboys committed to meeting the next week to continue discussion about the organization.","There are several interesting points in this simple meeting. Baseball, quickly becoming America's pastime, was still in its infancy. Major cities did have forms of professional teams, but often players had regular jobs, making baseball little more than a serious hobby. The idea of a highly organized league for professionals was still years away, and in most cases, those wanting to play the game would have to join a baseball club structured very similar to the one the schoolboys designed. Moreover, sport as a spectacle had not yet become popular, and games did not draw the crowds or the money they do today.","But this story also brings out ideas about the city during the late 19th century. Today, no respectable parent would allow adolescents the free reign of the city, an idea imperative for the boys to form the group. Instead of isolation kids might find in cities today, kids of the late 19th century had options for all kinds of action.","This article also speaks about 19th century home life. Baseball was still somewhat of a renegade sport, played at this time in spare lots which were a far cry from the manicured palaces found in city parks today. And while parents disapproved of the game—mainly because it seemed to replace work with pleasure—boys needed the baseball diamond as a refuge from home. In the hot summer months, staying inside without air conditioning was impossible, and it was very likely that mothers would be caring for younger siblings or dealing with sickness caused by the still limited understanding of sanitation. In addition, socially, baseball provided an important opportunity for boys to belong to a group that promoted fun instead of mischief. For these schoolboys, playing baseball in a dusty lot was much more comfortable (and more fun) than returning home."],"display_date":"February 9, 1883","search_date":"1883-02-09","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":76,"tag":"Adolescence"},{"id":75,"tag":"New York City 1880s"},{"id":78,"tag":"City Life"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4480,"title":"Great Migration, Religion, and Churches in New York City","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-01-01","end_date":"12/31/09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The \"Great Migration\" of African Americans to the north in the early 1900's was the result of years of enslavement. The migration introduced new eager American citizens to the north during a time when new faces were foreign faces. For African Americans, the lure of freedom from Jim Crow laws, a higher and fairer wage for labor, and a fresh start to life was reasons enough to move to \"the promised land\". New York among other big cities was the destinations of choice for African Americans. The newly emancipated African Americans brought to the north a lifestyle they adapted to in the south. This lifestyle became integrated into communities African Americans inhabited. My primary source is a postcard from the early 1900's of Forest Avenue in New York City depicting a Congregationalist church at a corner street in a supposedly black neighborhood. The postcard not only depicts many traits of the turning century, but also provides small but significant insight into how the church acted as an aid and an outlet for those making not only a transition into a new century but also a social and cultural transition at the same time.","            The settlement in the north proved the church served as an alleviation and refuge from the acclimation to a strange new home and community. The church's role in the north was often similar to the way it was in the south during slavery. As conditions in New York became overcrowded, places of worship were hard to find among the busy streets. However once churches were developed, often being erected from older buildings, the church served as the center of a community. One of my supporting sources is also a primary source that is a newspaper article describing the events of the dedication of a new location for the <em>Forest Avenue Church</em>. Before it took the name <em>First Congregational Church of Morrisania</em> it was known as <em>Forest Avenue Congregational Church </em>and was established in 1851. The dedication described by <em>The New York Times</em> was not a long article, but gave only the basic details of the ceremony. The actual ceremony was long and included many keynote area speakers indicating this was a significant event for the community. The African American population boom brought new ideologies in denomination and Christian perspectives and accounted for more and more African American churches and communities springing up. Once many African Americans migrated north religion and worship continued to be a very key practice. However, the spirit and style of African American worship changed significantly once the migration occurred. More specifically was the Negro spiritual and how song and dance was incorporated in church. The worship services were not as stringent as they were in the South and for good reason because they now had reason to celebrate their deliverance. As this \"second emancipation\" occurred northern cities and people were forced to handle the product of victory in the Civil War. ","            Like many foreign immigrants, African American immigrants had to live in close quarters and earn small wages. They escaped much of the discrimination experienced in the south, yet hardships were not far off. Religion was a backbone of African American life in the south, and it was the same in the north. The church was able to unveil the well-beaten Underground Railroad allowing many more African Americans to travel northward. This was a time of change in American history that ushered in new developments for regional development and identity. Along with providing a link between the north and the south, the African American migration and subsequent expansion of the church provided a visibly direct by-product of the events of slavery and Civil War.

The only problem was that having rice, cooking utensils, and water casks together on board the vessel could be considered \"conclusive evidence of an intention on the part of the master or owner to employ the vessel in transporting Negroes from Africa to be sold as slaves.\"  Because of this, they had to sneak the water casks on board somewhere quiet, usually at the latest time possible before departure.  \"Nineteen vessels out of every twenty fitted out in the United States for this illegal traffic on the coast of Africa, manage to evade the law,\" one newspaper editor observed.  After having left port safely, the vessel had nothing to fear because British ships believed the United States government would not allow slave ships to sail under an American flag.

Downtown merchants of wealth and respectability engaged in buying and selling African slaves throughout the 1850s with little interference from the government.  \"During eighteen months of the years 1859-1860 eighty-five slavers were reported to have been fitted out in New York harbor, and these alone transported from 30,000 to 60,000 slaves annually,\" wrote historian W.E.B. Dubois.  \"The United States deputy marshal of that district declared in 1856 that the business of fitting out slavers was never prosecuted with greater energy than at present.\"  Because there were few United States war-ships in Brazil, American smugglers easily ran in cargoes, in spite of the prohibitory law.  Ships often used the flag of the United States to conceal acts of piracy.  When Brazil's trade declined, Cuba's trade greatly increased, and the illegal trading continued until British enforcement and further diplomacy finally ended the Atlantic trade in the 1860s.

Men like Stewart and Tweed invested in new construction projects throughout the city, which in turn brought more people into the city.  Meanwhile, New York's horse-drawn street cars, already carrying over 35 million passengers a year by 1858, were littering the streets with horse manure; early elevated trains were quickly filling to capacity and blocking sunlight and ventilation of the streets along which they ran; and immigrants continued to poor into the city's Lower East Side, almost 400,000 in 1873 alone.  The city needed new and innovative ideas to solve its problems and a number of interesting solutions came before the New   York state legislature.  One proposal to alleviate the crowded streets was the depressed Arcade Railway, which would have run along Broadway before branching out to the East and West Sides.  The plan, as portrayed in a color lithograph in the New York Public Library's Moving Uptown Exhibition, also called for the conversion of the cellars of street-level buildings into new subterranean shops to line the railway at an estimated cost of 2,296,950.00 per mile.  ","Extensive coverage by the New York Times shows that the Arcade Railway was opposed from its inception by A.T. Stewart who feared construction would disrupt the business of his department store.  The proposition was also opposed by Boss Tweed, who had introduced legislation to the senate for a pneumatic tube transit system just one day before the introduction of the Arcade bill.  While Tweed would have received large kickbacks from the pneumatic line, the Arcade line, which would have alleviated crowding and decreased travel time for many of his constituents, would not have been in the back pocket of the Tammany Hall political machine. ","The construction of an underground line was feasible for nineteenth century engineers, but was almost twice as expensive as an elevated line.  The Arcade railway would have required considerable alteration of sewage, water, and gas lines in the city, and would have caused major disruptions to street traffic during construction.  Despite construction complications, the Arcade idea was extremely popular both with the masses and with state legislatures.  Stewart and Tweed were influential men however; Stewart held protest meetings at his department store and led a delegation of concerned business owners to the governor's mansion, meanwhile Tweed manipulated New York politics to dissuade the project's popularity.  Their tactics worked as the bill passed through the legislature four times, only to be vetoed by Governor Hoffman, and New York's first subway, the IRT, only opened after the turn of the century."],"display_date":"1865 - 1875","search_date":"1870-07-02","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":82,"tag":"A T Stewart"},{"id":134,"tag":"Boss Tweed"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4494,"title":"Post-Colonial Art Development\n","course_id":20,"status":"P","start_date":"1790-01-01","end_date":"1800-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"They [Americans] are depreciate, unprincipled inciters having ruined themselves through proliferation and debauchery of every kind,\" ranted a scathing excerpt from an English editorial. \"The whole nation is thrown [itself] in contention... Such has been the degeneracy of modern patriotism, that they would expunge every word from our dictionary, or frame [canvas].\" Through the eyes of the British, the Americans, even thirty years after the revolutionary war, were uncultured and ill-mannered. But as the fledgling country struggled to establish a stable socioeconomic status, its culture blossomed, making strides in the aesthetics.","Perhaps the most intriguing artistic achievement was political cartooning. Coupled with the printing press, although it may not seem an artist's medium, it was in fact the greatest mode of spreading American aesthetics. Political cartoons were pivotal to swaying the general public to adopt a way of thinking, implement a social trend, or show fault with a particular person or regime. This was important because a large majority of the populace was illiterate; caricatures and stereotypes allowed them to understand a specific message or movement. The political cartoon was also a good mode of humor to make poor political judgments of the era somewhat humorous and palliative.","Another art form that caught on late in the postcolonial period was the realism movement. Up until the Revolutionary War, Americans had very little desire to create a painted medium. Instead, metallurgy and ceramics were more popular. The few painters who did in fact continue their trade largely focused on landscapes and architecture. As the war ended, the focus shifted to human portrait and candid rural settings. The figures in these pictures were very realistic: the bodies were well proportioned, light was focalized, and objects seemed dimensional instead of flat; the facial features, however, were greatly exaggerated, taking an almost egg-like look, which may account for the name \"egg-head.\"","Art Historian Wayne Craven argues that the painting movement was a late enterprise likely resulting from perhaps the scarcity of resources; for example, paint required oil, turpentine, and pigment. All of these goods had to be directly traded from foreign ports, which was difficult due to bad relations with other countries. Lead-based paints, while not as popular as oils, were also very hard to get, mostly because they required lead powder and paint thinner in the form of linseed oil, neither native to America. Other artists turned to alternative means of painting; using egg whites as thinner (commonly known as Tempera), pine resin, tar pitch, and even meat fat. A small contribution to the painting industry was the indigo plant from South Carolina, commonly used to make a deep blue dye, in the place of cerulean, which had to be imported from South America.  While the aesthetics had no prolific institutions in American society until the early twentieth century the ideas, creativity, and expressions of early folk art retained immensely popular amongst the general public and even the social elite for centuries.

Her neighbors frantically stand at her side, their eyes darting back and forth across the busy streets looking for the lost little ones.  Finally, what seems like hours later, there is a banging at the tenement door.  It is a New York City policeman, toting the lost children by the hands.  Historical photographer Lewis Wickes Hine captured this emotional moment in a flash.  ","    Living in the Lower East Side in the early 1900s was a very dangerous undertaking, especially for children.  There was disease, gang fighting, murder, and fast and unpredictable street traffic.  Landlords let such dangerous activities continue in and around their buildings, as long as their tenants were paying the rent.  ","    Immigrants often encountered diseases both in their journey to and in America that they had not previously encountered.  These diseases flourished in the unsanitary and overpopulated conditions of the tenements.  There was very little access to fresh air, and children were forced to find places to play in dirty alley ways, often among trash and refuse.  ","    The neighborhood in which people lived became their identity.  Children innocently walking with their friends often would find their way onto another street, where it was not uncommon to be attacked just for being foreign to the neighborhood.  Immigrants frequently settled in pockets based on their nationality or race, and formed their own communities.  This segregation led to rivalries and hostile street fighting among neighborhoods, simply over these strong identities of location and race.  Children were afraid to venture outside of their block for fear of who and what they might encounter.  ","    Murders were also common in the city.  Cities were a relatively new phenomenon in America, and with the help of the industrial revolution cities like New York were expanding at a rapid pace.  The expansion was so fast that law enforcement officials were having a hard time keeping up.  Therefore, it was often up to neighbors to look out for one another until police could arrive on the scene.  Children were especially vulnerable to attacks from criminals, since they were small and weak.  ","    Street traffic was dangerous.  Carts filled the streets, and laws were frequently broken.  People in the city were in a hurry, always trying to race deadlines.  Wagons were constantly swerving to miss hitting people, darting in and out of the way of other wagons, and trying to remain within the confines of the street.  It was easy for small children to get caught underneath a wagon speeding recklessly down the street, especially in the dark of night.  The rules of the road were not the same, and crosswalks were non-existent.  Laws did not protect people against the dangers of street traffic, so a constant battle existed between pedestrians and drivers.","    The photographer, Lewis Wickes Hines, believed that by capturing the hardships of life for the Lower East Side Immigrants, he could bring about reform.  He often used his images to help start reform campaigns, with help from social welfare agencies.  ","    When a child went missing, even for a short period of time, it was natural for their mother to worry if they were dead or alive.  With the dangers that Lower East Side residents faced, it was a huge relief to see your missing child appear on your doorway in the hands of a capable police officer.

the dawn of the twentieth century, women discovered exciting new things to do with their bodies.  Women fell in love with exercise and this helped heat up the debate over the healthiness of wearing corsets.  An ad carried by the December 1902 issue of Munsey's Magazine, written like a letter from \"the family doctor,\" immediately noted that articles debating the merits or faults of tight lacing often appeared in the pages of the magazine written \"by all sorts and conditions of people.\"  The writer of the article, supposedly a medical doctor, agreed that there was much to be said for both sides of the argument.  The letter stated that \"stays are useful to support the female figure if used in moderation, and they are constructed with a due regard to health.\"  The ad, disguised as a letter pertaining to medical advice, then went on to recommend Mr. Thomas' Duchess Corset because it \"adds materially to the elegance of the figure without causing any injury to the vital parts.\"","While still wearing corsets, women in America discovered the joys of exercise.  Cycling, tennis, and basic aerobics became very popular, particularly among younger women.  Gyms for ladies sprung up in larger towns, and gymnastics evolved in to an important part of the curriculum in female education.  Fashion, however, mostly refused to keep up with the trend.  Though the popularity of exercise grew, women continued to wear restrictive corsets.  Much of the country fiercely debated the merits of wearing a corset, or at least the degree of tightness to which one laced the garment.  Experts weighed in on both sides of the debate offering no clear answer.  Many doctors warned wearing a corset led to problems with internal organs, especially the reproductive system.  Other doctors called those claims overblown.","Early twentieth century corset advertising did not over look the importance of altering the female figure, but it reflected the population's growing concerns and put more emphasis on health issues, even though many companies made false claims.  The author of this ad from Munsey's Magazine failed to mention what features made the Duchess corset more safe for women to wear.  The illustration included in the advertisement, if looked at as a technical drawing, shed no light on the subject either.  Often, manufacturers made claims of improved safety but failed to deviate from the standard production of a corset model.  The Duchess corset appeared to be one of these models.","Though many groups protested claims made by corset manufacturers, they failed to stop companies from making outrageous claims about their products.  Many women learned the hard way that corsets advertised as exercise friendly or more medically sound than past models showed little, if any, difference from corset models already on the market.  The false advertising continued as long as companies sold corsets and left the job of scrutinizing claims to the consumer.","<a

Today it is not that big of a deal that a black man is running for president, or for any office in the government.  However, one hundred and fifty years ago, a black man was not even considered a person, much less someone who could run for political office, especially Secretary of State.  Fredrick Douglass, a former slave, was about to change all that.  Facing much persecution, he ran for the office Secretary of State of New York in 1855.  This idea had been opposed by many.  As it is said in the <em>Macon Weekly Telegraph</em>, \"the whole thing is supremely ridiculous and can only issue in increasing the feeling in New York against this class of people.\"  Most did not think or believe that a black man should be allowed to hold such a position.","Douglass's race would be a big issue in his run for office.  In the mid 1800's a black person was not considered a whole person, much less a candidate for a government office.  Under the Constitution an African American was only considered three-fifths of a person, and was sold like property.  Also, most African Americans had limited access to education.  As a former slave, Douglass taught himself how to read and write in many different ways.  He educated himself and then escaped to freedom.  After he became free, Douglass became an abolitionist, fighting to end slavery for all blacks.  He would play a huge role as one of the few abolitionists who had actually been through slavery before.  This would help him in his run for office.  It allowed people to know his name, and know what he stood for before he ran.    ","Douglass's run for high office brought him a lot of unwanted attention, though.  The more people who became informed of Douglass's goal, the more people who would try to stop his progress.  It is written in the <em>Macon Weekly Telegraph</em>, \"if the Negroes cannot vote, they can be voted for and if under a social ban, they can be ennobled.\"  But since blacks could not vote yet, Douglass had to rely on whites to vote him into office, and the chances of a white man voting for a former slave, or any black man, seemed impossible.  Although Douglass did not receive the position of Secretary of State that he longed for, he did write books about his life.  He wrote about his thoughts, his slavery, and his freedom using what education he gathered through the years.  After documented his life as a slave and made aware of many of the brutal things that slaves had to do, he used his writings to help end slavery."],"display_date":"October 1, 1855","search_date":"1855-10-01","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"American Civilizations to 1877","school":"University of North Carolina at Pembroke","course_id":20,"school_id":9}},{"id":4564,"title":"African Slave Trade in the United States","course_id":20,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-04-01","end_date":"1857-04-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The United States Congress outlawed the African slave trade in 1808, but there were some who still took part in the slave trade, knowing it was illegal.

Advertising promised more energy and support from a \"light, flexible, durable, easily washed\" garment that also eliminated bulges and smoothed the figure, and these promises really resonated with the target audience.","When women opened the pages of the Ladies Home Journal in 1943 and saw this article, a war raged on two fronts thousands of miles away.  A large percentage of the country's young men fought on those fronts, and women found themselves in new and exciting positions performing tasks that their mothers and grandmothers never dreamed.  These previous generations of women might also be surprised at the sort of garments passing for underwear near the mid twentieth century.  The rigid font busk corsets of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, made with a one inch or more wide piece of steel down the center front making motion difficult, fell out of favor.  Women replaced the unyielding corsets with garments resembling modern girdles and brassieres.  These support garments still laced up at the front, side, or center back for a tight fit, but they now came with stretchy elastic sections so less pressure was exerted on the wearer's waist.","The 1940's also saw a shift in how corsets companies marketed their products to women.  In decades past, advertisers made much of how small a corset shrunk the wearer's waist.  It was such an important detail that companies often altered photographs and encouraged artists to render drawings with skewed prospective to make waists look unnaturally small.  In contrast, the woman drawn in a Spencers Support appeared with normal proportions. Older advertisements also preyed on women's fears of inferiority pertaining to social expectations.  When manufacturers choose to use these fears in a positive light, the ad sometimes included claims that their corsets made it easier to keep up with young children or gave the wearer energy to take on household chores.  When advertisers used such tactics in negative ways, they doomed women without the proper corset to the lives of old maids.  The Spencers ad, however, highlighted cures for medical complaints rather than promises of a social and family life.","The clothing women wore evolved in to a much more practical state in the 1940's.  Undergarments followed suit and also changed for the better, because women looked for different qualities in their underwear than the ladies of previous generations.  Women attained new roles in society and fashion moved forward to meet the changing needs of the twentieth century woman.","<a href=\"http://s647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/?action=view&current=img0112.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/img0112.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>"],"display_date":"February 1943","search_date":"1943-02-14","locations":[{"id":27491,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":198,"tag":"corsets"},{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"},{"id":199,"tag":"working women"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}},{"id":4636,"title":"The Double Hip “Ironsides” Corset shapes American Women","course_id":22,"status":"P","start_date":"1885-01-01","end_date":"1885-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Victorian women liked their corsets tight.  If a person looked up and down any busy street in the late nineteenth century, they saw townswomen that struck dramatic silhouettes.  The corset, a tight fitting, boned garment, restricted movement and reshaped the natural position of organs inside a women's body.  A trade card from 1885 featured a corset typical of the period dubbed the Double Hip \"Ironsides\" Corset.  The construction of this corset placed stiff cords diagonally under the boning that ran perpendicularly over the hips.  The advertisement proclaimed that the hip bones are longer than those found in competitor's corsets \"producing a corset of great strength.\"  The card then explained that \"the bones on the sides and hips, and also the sides steels, are doubly protected by three or four thicknesses of jean\" which diminished the likely hood of snapping a steel bone from wear and added \"much to the durability of the corset.\"","From a construction standpoint, this corset was solidly built.  It is no wonder the manufacturer used the nickname of the USS Constitution, a ship whose \"ironsides,\" made of tough oak were said to be impenetrable by cannonballs.  However, four layers of denim over the hips, even before the addition of steel bones and cord, made moving the hip joints very difficult.  A woman wearing such a rigid undergarment found even simple tasks much more difficult to complete.  Household duties such as chasing after children, cooking a meal, or even tidying the house while wearing a corset made some women begin to wonder if the practice made any positive impact on their lives.","Middle and upper class women found themselves restricted in many ways during the Victorian era.  Though Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton launched the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869, women did not have the right to vote on factors that affected their lives.  In addition, the majority of women did not have jobs outside the home.  In the home, society expected a woman to keep her household running seamlessly.  However, restrictions placed on women branched into other areas beyond social expectations.  While performing the roles assigned to them by society, Victorian fashion expected women to maintain specific hemlines and necklines.  The clothing that women wore took restriction to another level, and the corset led the way.","The difficulty of performing daily tasks as well as health concerns soon led to the formation of rational dress societies and movements across the Western Hemisphere.  Many of the members simultaneously fought for the right of women to vote, and encouraged them to choose clothing more appropriate for healthy lifestyles.  The rational dress voices represented a minority at the time this trade card was printed.  The fight to loosen the corset raged for several decades, but by the time women won the right to vote in America they were able to show up to polling places in much more comfortable clothing.","<a href=\"http://s647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/?action=view&current=img012.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/img012.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>","<a href=\"http://s647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/?action=view&current=img013.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i647.photobucket.com/albums/uu197/alteredtyme/img013.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>"],"display_date":1885,"search_date":"1885-07-02","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"},{"id":198,"tag":"corsets"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}},{"id":4572,"title":"A Bounty Hunter&#39;s Execution","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-02-18","end_date":"1865-02-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["An article appeared in the <em>Altoona Tribune</em> on February 18, 1865, detailing the execution of James Delvlin, accused of bounty hunting.

In July of 1863, New York City became engulfed in a wave of mob violence that swept through the city. Irish immigrants made up the majority of the rioters in opposition to the Enrollment Act of Conscription set forth earlier that year by President Abraham Lincoln. The rioters did not believe that they should have to fight in a war that they did not hold a substantial stake in. The Draft Riot of 1863, as it would later be called, raged in New York from July 13 to July 16 , eventually it was quelled by the Union Army. However, the riot would not be stopped before the death of around 100 civilians and numerous casualties had taken place.","Before the Battle of Gettysburg, the Union Army had a growing need for more troops. Due to this shortage of men, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Enrollment Act of Conscription in March of 1863. Lincoln called for nearly 300,000 more men to bolster Union forces. By mid July of 1863, the time when New York received its first draft notices, the Battle of Gettysburg had just been fought. The horrors of the battle shocked many New Yorkers, causing them not to want to enlist in the military. ","The unskilled laborers of New York, Irish and African American alike, did not have the capabilities to pay their way out of military service. The Irish became enraged at the fact that they did not have a way out of the draft. The Irish believed that they should not have to go to war for a group of people, whom they did not care for. For these reasons, the Irish rioted, and in so doing, directed much of their violence towards the African American population in New York City.  William A. Hall, an established member of New York society wrote to Montgomery Blair, member of Abraham Lincoln's cabinet stating, \"We have had…a bloody riot and the destruction of large amounts of property…\" Oddly enough, Hall goes on to tell Blair not to recall the draft in New York City, even though it incited the riot. ","The Draft Riots in New York, born out of unskilled labor competition between African Americans and Irish immigrants, in conjunction with Irish discontent at being forced to participate in the draft without any feasible way out, raged for three days ending nearly 1,000 people having been either killed or wounded.

By this point, the war had only been going on for one year and civilians already had begun to grow weary of its costs.

One of the complaints concerning this matter appeared in <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">The</em> <em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\">New York Times </em>in January of 1862 in a letter to the editor.

As historian Byron Price remarks, \"The censorship process is essential to the conduct of war for two reasons: First…keeping the enemy from knowing what we are doing on the home front...Second…censorship helps us learn what the enemy is doing. Examination of mail and cablegrams…turn up vital information…\" The Union certainly believed in censorship as a necessary instrument of war and enacted it through field orders, in this case by 77 year old Union General John Wool. Union citizens who wished to contact southern relatives could only do so by, \"…direct permission of the military authorities, and under flags of truce… Gen. Wool…will probably have them examined and forwarded…if there appears to be nothing objectionable…\" Union citizens had to submit their letters to the authorities for inspection. The President did not condone the censoring of mail and media. He was quoted as saying, \"…you do not…comprehend the danger of abridging the liberties of the people…\" The orders for censorship, given by the commanding officer in a specific region, based on the reasons listed above, proved to be a difficulty for many Union and Confederate citizens wishing to communicate with their relatives on the opposite side of the conflict.

Leading up to the riot, there had been a rivalry between the English actor Edward Macready and the American actor Edwin Forrest.   Baker wrote that this rivalry began when Forrest believed that Macready sabotaged his recent tour of England.  The nativist trend in the United States at the time did not help Macready's popularity in New York as most of Forrest's fans were poor working class citizens.  \"The quarrel, then, waxed warmer and warmer, until it has ended in a fearful riot, in which thousands of excited people engaged, incurring a serious loss of life.\"  The May 10 riot was the second time that theatergoers tried to force Macready from the stage.  Historian Bill Kauffman writes that on May 7 they had succeeded by throwing anything possible onto the stage including vegetables and chairs.  Afterwards leading New York citizens apologized to Macready and convinced him to stay and perform Macbeth again on May 10 by promising such an incidence would not occur again. Meanwhile, Forrest's fans circulated handbills asking if Americans or English should rule the city.  In response to threat of violence a large number of policemen were stationed at the theater for the performance.      ","  Starting around 6:30 PM and continuing throughout the performance a crowd began gathering outside the theater.  The performance started off calm enough, but erupted into violence after police arrested four audience members and confined them in a small room.  The arrested men attempted to set the room on fire so were placed in irons.   When news of the arrests spread the mob gathered outside exploded.  The police were soon overwhelmed by the mob so the military was called in.  A cavalry company arrived, but was also driven off.  Then the National Guard came and was attacked by the mob, but eventually was able to force their way to the theater.   The soldiers fired over the mob's heads after the captain was struck down with a large stone.  When this did not stop the mob from attacking, the soldiers then fired three rounds of ball cartridges dispersing the crowd.  More troops were called in and two artillery pieces were loaded with grape shot directly in front of Aster Place Theater.  By 11:30 pm the crowd had dispersed, carrying off the dead and wounded.   ","Both Baker and Kauffman agree that twenty-two rioters were killed instantly and more soon died from their wounds. Baker goes on to say that this riot sent shock waves through New York's upper class.  Hardly any of them believed that shooting was necessary to save Macready or Astor Place from destruction.

It also showed how eventual abolition in the United States would be a failure to both Southern States and Northern States.","Throughout the nineteenth century, the islands of the West Indies abolished slavery, which resulted in catastrophic consequences for their economic structures. Like his anti-abolition peers, Van Evrie believed that the fundamental nature of black people was responsible for the dramatic decay of economies in the West Indies. He maintained that, once freed from their slave ties, \"negroes\" only fell back upon their tendency to idleness, returned to the \"savagism of their African ancestors,\" and converted back to their \"heathen\" way of life. Van Evrie used statistical elements to show that the abolition of slavery in islands such as Jamaica and Haiti resulted in the ruin of their economy and trade, the return to uncultivated wilderness of the lands, and the \"desolation\" of the plantations installed by the colonist countries.  ","For Van Evrie, \"freed negroes,\" as \"inferior human beings,\" would be a burden for American laborers in many ways: they would live on the labor of White people, stop producing goods and therefore generate an increase of price for these goods. They would not be consumers of northern goods any more, and they would increase crime and pauperism in the States.  He therefore encouraged American people to reflect upon these elements before abolishing slavery. Destroying slavery in the West Indies and in the United States would be equivalent to destroying hundreds of farmers, or of laborers.","Van Evrie claimed his tract about \"Free Negroism…\" to be a response to the \"innumerable\" abolitionist tracts published in the early 1860s. He wanted to give an answer to the \"false and pernicious doctrines\" spread by the North for decades, and tried to awaken the consciousness of people of the North about the good of slavery. As part of the anti-abolition movement and of the South, Van Evrie remained concerned about the election of anti-slavery candidate Abraham Lincoln. According to the historian John David Smith, Van Evrie was very representative of the \"anti Negro propaganda\", and was the \"first professional racist in American History.\" In his pamphlet Van Evrie responded to the concerns of the middle classes, looking for social stability in a changing society, giving them arguments against changing the state of things."],"display_date":1862,"search_date":"1862-07-02","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":176,"tag":"trade relations"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4617,"title":"Doubleday Takes Baseball from Brooklyn to the Battle Fields of Dreams","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1839-01-01","end_date":"1861-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Sports can bring groups of people together like few other activities.

Baseball also served as a means of something that connected the civilians with the soldiers. In a letter sent from Brooklyn to a soldier, \"I was pleased to hear that you had had a base ball match […] for I think you poor soldiers need a little recreation once and a while.\"  The letter was dated July 11, 1861 signed by <em>Phobe</em> of Brooklyn. Many other letters were sent as well, soldiers sharing stories of their baseball games rather than stories of war. Baseball proved to be very helpful for many in getting through the day in and day out life of a soldier during the Civil War. \"Suddenly there was a scattering of fire, which three outfielders caught the brunt; the centerfield was hit and captured, left and right field managed to get back to our lines. The attack…was repelled without serious difficulty, but we had lost not only our centerfield, but… the only baseball in Alexandria, Texas\" George Putnam said in a letter from his Union army camp.

The heavyweight bout lasts only two minutes and four seconds, and “the ardor of German radio parties and café gatherings are quickly dampened.” Schmeling’s maid is so embarrassed by the fight that she keeps the news from Mrs. Schmeling. Louis avenges his earlier loss to “Unser Maxe” Schmeling and dealt a major blow to the Nazi idea of Aryan supremacy. Parties and riots break out in major cities in the United States.

This leads to a search by fans and media for “the Great White Hope” to snuff out the success of the black athlete. This anomaly leads to the media creation of racial feuds between black and white players. One of the most significant examples is the basketball rivalry between Larry Bird and Earvin “Magic” Johnson which began in college and continued into the National Basketball Association.","     The stories of boxing legends Jack Johnson and Joe Louis established the dominance of African American athletes in sports in America. While Johnson may be one of the founders of the tension between the superior black athlete and the white fan searching for their athlete avatar, Louis is viewed as a sports hero. Because of their polar personalities Johnson is seen as a brute among his contemporaries and Louis is portrayed as an “Uncle Tom” in some circles.    "],"display_date":"July 4, 1910","search_date":"1910-07-04","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"},{"id":17575,"lat":40.6774734233,"lng":-119.692996384,"zoom":8,"place":"Washoe, Nevada"}],"tags":[{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":235,"tag":"Sports"},{"id":239,"tag":"Boxing"}],"course":{"name":"The Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":22,"school_id":10}},{"id":4688,"title":"Restrictions on Immigration grow in popularity.","course_id":26,"status":"P","start_date":"7/1/86","end_date":"7/4/86","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","A joint <em>New York Times</em> and <em>CBS News</em> poll showed the United States to have contradictory feelings towards immigrants. Despite the U.S. being founded on immigration, and containing the world’s largest immigration population, those polled show an increasing percentage of natives disapproving further immigration. On a personal level, the American citizen was welcoming to immigrants individually. But a decrease of support for higher immigration numbers occurred compared to statistics collected twenty-one years prior to this poll. A decrease of four percent was collected regarding the question of whether immigration levels should be kept the same or increased. A dramatic increase of sixteen percent favored a decrease of immigrant populations.","In terms of demography voting, college graduates preferred increasing diversity, whilst those with only high school education appear tired of America’s ‘melting pot’ identity. The poor, suffering from a lack of employment opportunities, thought their position could be improved if immigration were restricted. Thirty-five percent of the white demographic in the poll believed in installing the military along the Mexican border in an effort to stop illegal immigration. This drastic approach can be attributed to the growing dissatisfaction within the U.S. public with corporations hiring illegal immigrants as low-pay workers. The Immigration and Naturalization Service estimated that at the time of this poll that approximately three to five million illegal aliens lived in the U.S. Not only was the hiring of non-naturalized people illegal, the practice took jobs from domestically born Americans, and was exploitative of illegal immigrants and violated human rights.","Against the national trend, the most supportive of increasing immigration levels was in the U.S.’s multiethnic northeast area – such as New York, New York.

This reporter had credibility on the subject of U.S.-Central American relations because it was his journalistic specialty from 1970-1989.","Alan Riding reported in the article that the Guatemalans greatly anticipated Reagan coming to power “The conservative Government and private sector in Guatemala, which had been strongly critical of President Carter’s human rights campaign, were delighted by his defeat and seemed hopeful of resumed American military assistance to help combat leftist guerrillas.”","The historical context leading up to this involved official policy from the previous administration.","In 1977 President Jimmy Carter ordered a human rights report on the actions of the Guatemalan military. What the study found was later confirmed by the United Nations Commission for Historical Clarification. The Guatemalan military was responsible for 93% of the human rights violations committed during the war, the guerrillas for 3%. The Guatemalan government reacted to these negative findings by refusing United States military aid.","Reagan immediately voiced his support for funding Guatemala once again in his first presidential news conference. He stated: “You can [not] turn away from some country because here and there they do not totally agree with our concept of human rights.”  Public opinion at the time about United States involvement in Central American Civil Wars is hard to gauge. While some, like former Peace Corp volunteer John Elder actively participated in the process of bringing Guatemalan refugees to the United States, most Americans remained inactive. The United States Military’s involvement was mostly logistical, so the violence did not have a direct effect on American citizens. Our aid to Guatemala did not cause the same public out rage that Vietnam did because few Americans died. The reinstatement of funding was a political success from Reagan’s point of view and by 1983, most of the Guatemalan countryside was subdued. This episode correctly previewed the situation in Central America and the changes that Ronald Reagan's administration would bring to US policy for that region."," "],"display_date":"November 16, 1980","search_date":"1980-11-16","locations":[{"id":40259,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":39105,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":293,"tag":"Ronald Reagan"},{"id":294,"tag":"Containment"},{"id":295,"tag":"International Relations"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":26,"school_id":3}},{"id":4762,"title":"Charles Knowlton and <em>The Fruits of Philosophy</em>","course_id":40,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-01-01","end_date":"1832-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Charles Knowlton was one nineteenth century doctor who was not afraid to talk about sex. Despite prosecution and jail time he stood behind the ideas of his 1832 work <em>Fruits of Philosophy</em>. The book was deemed obscene for its discussion of sex for pleasure and birth control methods. Knowlton saw sexual desire as a passion that started in the nerves of the genital organs and extended to the brain. He saw sexual desire as natural, but realized that no “sensations” could be excited without causing some kind of negative reproduction. In the case of sex negative consequences included having children out of wedlock and contracting venereal diseases. However, Knowlton also believed that man was gifted with the ability to discover ways to prevent these negative occurrences. If mankind desired sexual gratification and could prevent the disagreeable aspects of engaging in such activity, Knowlton believed there was no reason not to engage.","He advocated the use of four types of “checks” to limit the negative consequences of sex. The first was entire withdrawal by the male. But this was not his preferred method due to the loss of some enjoyment. The second check was a sponge that had been dipped in chloride of soda and then inserted into the female’s vagina. This was agreeable since it was effective at managing venereal diseases. The third method was the use of a thin skin to cover the male sexual organ. This was objectionable on the basis of cleanliness and the expense for an item that is not reusable. The fourth check was what Knowlton advocated as the best option. This practice involved syringing the vagina directly after sex. It could be used after the sexual act, was very clean, and the materials were cheap and easily obtained.","The ideas put forth in <em>Fruits of Philosophy</em> were an innovation in the nineteenth century. This book was the first text published in the United States to deal with contraception from an empirical medical standpoint. As Knowlton published new editions of the book the descriptions of the anatomy of the sexual organs and their functions became more elaborate. The book represented cutting edge knowledge concerning women’s bodies and reproduction. Knowlton moved the discussion of sex from a moral issue to the realm of physiology. He was one of the founders of a framework that historian Helen Horowitz has called \"reform physiology,\" which was concerned with the functions of the reproductive organs and recommending healthy lifestyles. Sexual desire was then recognized as being part of the mind, in the communications between the nerves and the brain. The nineteenth century did see a decrease in the average number of children born to white women. Couples sought to have fewer children for reasons such as their new urban lifestyles, the sense of responsibility brought by the concept of republican motherhood, and ideas of romantic love that separated sex from conception. These goals could be achieved with the advice of doctors', such as Knowlton, describing how to prevent sex from resulting in birth."],"display_date":1832,"search_date":"1832-07-01","locations":[{"id":8919,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":364,"tag":"sex"},{"id":362,"tag":"contraception"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"}],"course":{"name":"Sex and Culture in the 19th-century United States","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":40,"school_id":2}},{"id":4889,"title":"Colorblind","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/24","end_date":"12/31/40","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Harlem Renaissance was a period of immense African-American intellectual advancement and culture revitalization. However, leaders in the African-American community were divided on the best way to portray their newfound ideas. The majority of intellects believed that desegregation was the ultimate goal, which was achievable by integrating their culture with white culture. The other school of thought was led by Marcus Garvey and his ideas of Black Nationalism and separatism. Zora Neale Hurston was a major actress in the Harlem Renaissance, publishing many literary pieces; however it is difficult to classify her in either of these two schools. In a letter to a fellow poet, she states, “Now, as to segregation, I have no viewpoint on the subject particularly, other than a fierce desire for human justice…I have no desire for white association except where I am sought and the pleasure is mutual.” Hurston was shunned by many of the Harlem Renaissance activists and critics of her time, as well as many white “liberals” because of her view. Hurston was beyond her time, seeing that the true path to end Black oppression was to eliminate the misconception that Whites were naturally superior to Blacks, and that White people were doing Blacks a favor by associating with them.","Zora Neale Hurston’s personal history deeply influenced her view on segregation as well as the literary work that she produced. Hurston was born[1] in 1901 and raised in Eatonville, FL, the first all black community in the United States. Her father was a pastor and her mother was a school teacher, although she passed away when Hurston was 13. Hurston received her high school diploma in 1918, and continued her education at Howard University. At Howard, she pursued a degree in English and received several accolades; including being a member of Zeta Phi Beta, a contributor to <em>The Stylus</em> and a group called The Saturday Nighters, all prestigious academic and literary groups. Her early work was mainly in poetry where she wrote about love. Late in her college career, she began publishing short stories in <em>The Stylus</em>, most notably “John Redding Goes to Sea” which was heavily influenced by her home town of Eatonville and her family. These stories were written in the broken African-American dialect of Eatonville, a style which was largely unpopular by the Black critics of the Harlem Renaissance.              Incredibly talented, Hurston was an asset to the Harlem Renaissance, although her work was largely ignored by several critics of her time. The Harlem Renaissance was a period of intellectual advancement and creativity for the black community. Leaders of the movement, including W.E.B. Dubois and James Weldon Johnson, saw the Harlem Renaissance as an opportunity to advance the African-Americans past segregation and that black artists were tools to accomplish those means. The two primary schools of thought were desegregation versus black Nationalism and it was concluded that Hurston did not truly fit into either one of these categories. Sub sectioned into this central debate is whether or not Blacks should truly embrace their heritage and selfness and incorporate that into their literary work, or if they should try to modify their work to appease the white crowd and impress upon them their equality of intelligence and creativity.  In other words, should Blacks be “censoring” their literary work, allowing only art that conforms to White culture to be published?  In a letter Hurston wrote to Countee Cullen, she clearly expresses her opinion, one that was largely unpopular at the time.","Cullen was one of few leaders in the Black community that encouraged African-American artists to incorporate heritage into their work and not sacrifice any of their creativity in order to cater to Whites. Hurston deeply admired Cullen for this, writing in her letter, “I have always shared your approach to art. That is, you have written from within rather than to catch the eye of those who were making the loudest noise for the moment” (Hurston 1979). Throughout this letter, she elaborates on the resistance she has encountered from white “liberals” who are associating themselves with blacks in the fight for equality. Her outspokenness against those who believe in appeasing a white audience has tormented these white “sympathizers”, as they realize the asset she could be if she would conform to the idea of changing her work to be more compatible with white culture. She speaks of one instance where these white “liberals” offer her a white husband if she can, “see things right” (Hurston 1979). She reiterates, “I am utterly indifferent to the joy of other Negroes who feel that a marriage across the line is compensation for all things, even conscience” (Hurston 1979). She does not see how marrying a white man is advancing her race in anyway, and that by settling for interracial marriage is actually a statement of inequality. Hurston’s view on desegregation and equality seem uncaring, although the underlying idea she portrays in this letter is more than 30 years ahead of her time. She is truly colorblind, not seeing the difference between whites and blacks and holding both of equal value. She is simply an artist, producing literature that honors her heritage and Blackness and those who like it, white or black, are welcome to enjoy it.","Zora Neale Hurston was truly a visionary of the Harlem Renaissance, seeing beyond the goals of desegregation onto the advancement of true equality. In the face of scrutiny from Whites as well as Blacks she refused to conform, using her brilliance to exemplify the culture of her race in its true form. Drawing on both personal experience as well as her elite education she was able to produce literary work that survived her, and expressed the ideas and concerns of an African-American woman during the Harlem Renaissance."," ","[1] Actually Born in Alabama in 1891, although she denies this (Boyd)"],"display_date":"1924 - 1940","search_date":"1932-07-01","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":505,"tag":"Black Poets"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4898,"title":"How one woman helped to valut African American culture into the spotlight","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"10/29/32","end_date":"10/29/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Born in 1891 in rural Alabama, Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood in the first incorporated black town in the nation, Eatonville, Florida. Zora attended school in Eatonville until only 13 years old, when she traveled to New York City with a traveling theatre company. In the city that never sleeps, Zora would develop her creative mind and make her mark on history. Hurston seized the tremendous opportunity of living in New York during the Harlem Renaissance, a period of blossoming of African American culture through music, poetry, dance and other forms of media. First, she obtained three degrees from illustrious learning institutions including Columbia University and Howard University. Soon after, she was blessed with a shot to work with Langston Hughes, arguably the most famous black writer in American History, on a play entitled, “Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life in Three Acts.” Hurston went on to publish books such as the 1934 work “Jonah’s Gourd Vine,” detailing African American life in the deep-south and bringing it to the forefront of society. Through her life’s work and experiences, Zora Neale Hurston exposed the masses to African American life and folklore, broke racial boundaries, and inspired change here in Central Florida and across the nation.","Growing up in Eatonville, Hurston was fully immersed in African American culture and folklore. She specialized in theatre and comedy decided to pursue her interests further at Columbia. During her academic years, she conducted extensive field studies throughout the American South, becoming an expert in the field. Here at Rollins College, interest in American folklore was mounting. In a letter from October 29<sup>th</sup>1932, Professor W.R. Wunsch pleads with school President Dr. Hamilton Holt to allow an African American folk performance in the Annie Russell Theatre. Wunsch challenges the President to “break the ground as it were: to make the students sensitive to the lyric beauty of swamp and citrus grove, […] find the drama in the life of fisherfolk and sponge divers, […] to get the students to ‘dip their nets where they are.’” He goes on to specifically request Hurston, insisting that he “can think of no better way to introduce the students to the honest-to-the-soil material at their own doorsteps than to present to them in a program of folk songs and dancers a group of Eatonville negroes, headed by Zora Hurston. Zora, a national authority on negro ways, has won an enviable place for herself in American dramatics.” Clearly, there was desire for Zora’s expertise and creativity in the field local folklore here at Rollins, but the President was somewhat apprehensive to approve because of the well established racial boundaries of the time.","These pre-existing racial boundaries were tremendously difficult for African Americans to overcome, as the Jim Crow laws of segregation were still widely in effect. Dr. Holt illustrates this in his response to Mr. Wunsch’s letter. He allows the performance to take place, however, he adds, “Of course we cannot have negroes in the audience unless there is a separate place segregated for them.” Holt continues by hinting that he fears the judgment of others, warning, “I do not think I would advertise it very much outside our own faculty and students.” This mentality held widely throughout the south was a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to overcome. Hurston did an incredible job of shrinking the barriers by thrusting the lives and cultures of African Americans into mainstream society. Her first book, entitled “Jonah’s Gourd Vine,” was critically acclaimed as something totally new and fresh. Additionally, her academic success provided opportunity and paved the way for many African American women to follow.","The Harlem Renaissance set the stage for real progress in America. The timeless works of Hurston, Hughes, and countless other intellectuals, artists, poets and entertainers provided the building blocks for the Civil Rights Movement. This cultural movement shined the African-American experience in the spotlight, and in turn changed how African Americans were perceived. As rural, southern blacks moved north to larger cities, they developed a new image, one of urban sophistication. The idea of the black identity was forming, and antiquated, racist laws could no longer suppress it. In his response letter, Dr. Holt acknowledges that he is in favor of racial progress, telling the courageous Mr. Wunsch, “I am glad you are doing this as it is one of the best steps in the right direction.”","Zora Neale Hurston achieved incredible things in her lifetime. She won numerous awards as an actor, playwright and author. But arguably her most important contributions to this world came in the form of advancing her people and fighting for equality. Through hard work, a will to succeed, and being in the right place at the right time, she inspired true change in our country.

Rather than seeing this as a setback, American women grew more aware of their limitations and demanded the right to vote. <em>The Social Elevation of Woman</em>, refers to a time when patriarchy was most apparent and women’s voting rights remained undervalued. Men of the early nineteenth century, feared that women would gain such power in society, which might later jeopardize their status. On the other hand, some believed that women, viewed as the picture of <em>perfection</em> and <em>purity</em>, would become tainted when coming into contact with men in the voting polls. The article shows a clear shift towards a more <em>gender equal </em>society. While many men decided to avoid this claim, they knew that <em>old</em> ideals were being left behind and that women were now taking on the role of both the domestic and intellectual head of households. Not all men disagreed with the right of women’s vote in government, believing that this can only empower them to help cultivate <em>better</em> <em>dinners</em> at the table. This meant that through the intellectual awareness gained within social involvement, women could also enhance their roles within the household and bring to the table more intellectual conversations, while expanding both their social and domestic skills.","Meanwhile, in Elsa Barkley Brown’s, “<em>To Catch the Vision of Freedom”, </em>included in the book <em>Unequal Sisters</em>, she poses the idea of what it means to be freed, experiencing full political right. Freed women, while sometimes being accepted into society, were denied many rights, including the moral right to vote. Suffrage, as presented in the reading, was thought of as a God-given right for women and that there should be a clear distinction between the <em>right</em> to suffrageand the <em>right </em>for liberty. While many white Southern men experienced the right to vote, freed women were denied such liberty, showing that they never reached a point of full freedom. As the reading suggests, that since much of the field work was done by women, who were left to take care of the home, agriculture, and religious duties while their husbands were away, could have used their time more wisely by participating in the polls. Simply, a woman engaging just in controversial conversation was not enough to compensate for fair political participation.","Both readings, focused on women’s fight towards gaining voting rights, help support the idea that voting was not merely a right for one class nor one gender, but a universal privilege. Women also helped <em>purify</em> the polls, with their moral and trustworthy decisions. Women proved to be successful both intellectually and domestically, and were ready to take advantage of their full rights as lawful citizens. Overtime, women have also confirmed that they do take into consideration the importance of discussing political issues outside the home, but that their participation is needed to help alleviate the country from <em>portentous warnings</em>."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"1849 - 1868","search_date":"1859-01-01","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":523,"tag":"voting"},{"id":524,"tag":"white women's rights"},{"id":525,"tag":"African American Sufferag"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Women, 1790-1890","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":41,"school_id":2}},{"id":4949,"title":"Courageous Irish Brigade","course_id":27,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-11-18","end_date":"1862-11-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["       Their eager face showed no doubt or fear.

Generally women who were forced into slavery at an early age did not have an education, Truth helped the women learn how to succeed in the outside world. Black women in society were seen with little respect and a low social status. Twenty years after Truth’s moving speech, historians felt “the silence had been broken and the veil was raised to reveal the long obscured and ignored activism and experiences of one half of the black population in America”[1]. When historians look back on Sojourner Truth’s speech, they realize she stated a radical idea for the mid 1800’s because she proposed and questioned why black women were not treated with the same respect as white women."," ","[1] Clark Hine, Darlene. \"Ar'n't I A Woman?: Female Slaves In the Plantation South-Twenty Years After.\" (2007): 14."," "],"display_date":"1850 - 1860","search_date":"1855-07-02","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":582,"tag":"Ain't I a Woman?"},{"id":581,"tag":"Anti-Slavery Act"},{"id":580,"tag":"Sojourner Truth"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History: New York, New York","school":"Stonehill College","course_id":27,"school_id":22}},{"id":4961,"title":"Reactions to Intigration in Baseball","course_id":27,"status":"P","start_date":"10/25/45","end_date":"10/25/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["      In the New York Times article entitled, “Rickey Takes Slap at Negro Leagues”, Branch Rickey, the president of the Brooklyn Dodgers faced a hailstorm of critics as he announced his decision to sign Jackie Robinson to the previously all white Brooklyn Dodgers farm team.  Facing the press, he dispelled the rumors that he had been forced into making the deal, that the Negro leagues had been raided, and that he had in mind twenty-five Negroes who might be signed to contracts. Rickey stated, \"I have not been pushed into this “, and, “I signed Robinson in spite of the pressure-groups who are only exploiting the Negroes, instead of advancing their cause. I signed him because I knew of no reason why I shouldn’t.  I want to win baseball games, and baseball is a game that is played by human beings.” What if an African American was able to play baseball within the white baseball leagues, would others agree and approve of this? The idea of an African American playing in the Major League Baseball Association during the 1940s was seen too many as just plain nonsense, and to others  nothing but a dream.  In a segregated America, the chance of an African American playing organized baseball in the white leagues was slim to none. Although the blacks had their own organized leagues, they weren’t nearly as popular, paid only a fraction of the salary as a white player, nor were they seen as major contenders compared to the white players in the Major Leagues.  Branch Rickey's decision to sign Jackie Robinson not only marked a defining moment in baseball history, but also was a major adjustment for the American public against the integration of African American athletes into the big leagues.","     Jackie Robinson was the first African American to play organized baseball in the white leagues. Recruited by Branch Rickey, the president of the Brooklyn Dodgers at the time, Robinson went on to become the first African American player to sign with their farm league. While signing Robinson might seem like a good decision now, in 1945, the decision of signing Robinson to the Dodgers farm league, made by Rickey, created a huge controversy.  Critics against integrating baseball, once again, suggested Rickey might have been pressured to sign Robinson. Also, players at this time such as Hornsby, a player for the Texans, and Dixie Walker , with the Dodgers, thought the situation wouldn’t work out .They assumed that African American players would be unable to travel, use the same busses, stay at the same hotels, or eat in the same restaurants, as their white counterparts.   These reactions tell us that many Americans at the time viewed sports, especially baseball, as solely a “white” hobby, that African Americans didn’t belong in the white \"professional\" baseball league, and that they should remain in their own leagues.","      Branch Rickey’s signing of Jackie Robinson to the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1945 (minor   league affiliate and then 1947, major league) was because of his innovation, determination to desegregate, business sense, and idealism.  Robinson was baseball’s first rookie of the year, and the Dodgers made it to the World Series the year he signed on.  Rickey chose the most talented man for the job, not based on his color. He opened the door for more African American athletes as well as other visionary leaders and executives in Major League Baseball."],"display_date":"October 25, 1945","search_date":"1945-10-25","locations":[{"id":27491,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":233,"tag":"Baseball"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":592,"tag":"Rickey Branch"},{"id":593,"tag":"Jackie Robinson"},{"id":594,"tag":"Reactions to Intigration"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History: New York, New York","school":"Stonehill College","course_id":27,"school_id":22}},{"id":4963,"title":"An Influx of Irish Immigrant: Young Women arrive in New York","course_id":27,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-01-01","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The woman from Ireland looked around the chaos on Ellis Island visibly upset, as the immigration officials accused her of giving them the wrong name of the person picking her up.  Migrations to the United States “did not always occur without problems or disruptions and occasionally the colleen arrived with no one to greet her.”[1]  On April 30, 1897, The New York Times published an article that focused on the influx of immigrants from Ireland.  The ultimate goal of these immigrants was to find work that paid a decent salary and offered better opportunities than the jobs available back home.","While the workers at Ellis Island extolled the “promise of better times in this country”, numerous Irish women faced fear and confusion upon arrival.  When it came to immigration, a great deal of the chaos was due to the miscommunication or misinformation exchanged between individuals.  “Immigrants frequently failed to find one another because they constantly changed residencies, expecially if they were poor, and because Irish women continued using their maiden names after marriage.”[2]  In the 1897 newspaper article, a woman named Cassidy was looking for a lady named Maggie Molloy, but was told that her name was not on the list.  Maggie Molloy’s name was in fact on the list, however due to the miscommunication, Cassidy was very upset.[3]  Events like this were not uncommon, and this is what caused much of the confusion on Ellis Island.","The Irish invaded America by the thousands from the late 1800’s into the early 1900’s. Much of the incentive to leave Ireland was due to the unfavorable living conditions in the Irish countryside According to the Irish who remained in Ireland, many of the women were frustrated by the male dominated agricultural society and had left their homes in hopes of finding luck in the United States.  These oversea journeys were life threatening, but foreigners were willing to take a chance.  To the immigrants, anything was better than what they were leaving back home.[4]","A portion of the women immigrating to the United States via Ellis Island had their voyages paid for by other relatives already living in America; however, it was not uncommon for the father to emigrate first, earn money, and then send it back home to pay for his other family member’s voyages or for a family to emigrate as a group or for single members to travel alone.","These girls faced many difficulties in America, due to the fact that they were uprooted from their homes in Ireland.  Previously, these Irish women were accustomed to working around the house and caring for others, but life in America was going to be much different.  Once the young women arrived, they needed to begin to search for work immediately.  Coming from an area where most people were agriculturalists, their transition to an area in the heart of New York City was drastically different from their familiar surroundings.","Of all the different groups of immigrants, Irish women were of the greatest amount.  This difference was due to the “emergence of the modern Irish family structure”  With the newly evolving land and family forms that were coming about, there was a decrease in the number of children emigrating.  Between the years of 1852 to 1921 the median age for female immigrants was 21.2 years old.  This age was “younger than the median age of marriage”, and therefore explains the reason why so many of the immigrants got married upon arriving in America.[5]","“Emigration was the end of peasant live in Europe; it was also the beginning of life in America”.[6]  Ireland depended on their crops for survival, and therefore life was miserable at home for many of the Irish families.  Providing for everyone became difficult, and as a result many Irish left their familiar hometowns to start a new life in America.  The decision to come to America marked a huge milestone in an individual’s life, because they were leaving their native land and putting their lives at risk. Assimilating to life in America was not going to be easy, and immigrants needed to be taught about the way of life in America."," ","[1] Diner, Professor Hasia R.. \"The Search for Bread: Patterns of Female Migration.\" In <em>Erin's Daughters in America: Irish Immigrant Women in the Nineteenth Century (The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science)</em>.

Waters Schwab, the president of J.R. Wood & Sons, Inc., the increase was due to the Korean crisis.  It was mere weeks before this escalation of ring sales that the Korean War began.  Mr. Schwab noted that this increase in sales was following the same pattern that occurred at the beginning of the Second World War.   One of the executives of Lambert Brothers, Inc., Henry Lambert, explained that jewellery stores were filled with young couples purchasing rings.  This occurrence seemed to grow in just under a fortnight, and had not been seen since the end of World War II.","<br />Throughout the twentieth century this trend of increased weddings, and ring sales before, and during a major conflict was noted in both America and Europe.  During the months prior to World War I and World War II, young couples were joined in matrimony much more frequently than in times of peace.  In addition to the increase in marriages, there was a change in the average age that men and women were wed.  Throughout the first half of the twentieth century the average matrimonial age for men dropped from twenty-six to twenty-three, and for women dropped from twenty-two to twenty.","<br />Some argue that, the major influence on this sudden explosion of romance in the United States was the Selective Service Act of 1948 which reintroduced conscription.  The original act was passed in 1917 and revised in 1940.  Volunteer enlistment in the years following World War II was not enough to satisfy the needs of in this new Korean conflict.  The new act required all males over the age of eighteen to register for the draft and made all males between the ages of nineteen and twenty-six eligible to be drafted, thus increasing the number of conscripts by 100,000.  When the Selective Service Act was imposed in 1917 there appeared to have been a corresponding rise in the sale of wedding and engagement rings.  This trend was again seen at the outbreak of the Korean War.  The Selective Service Act was further revised in 1951 (Universal Military Training and Service Act) introducing a college or training exemption and reducing the draft age from nineteen to eighteen and a half.   While the war cast a dark shadow over these rushed marital vows, the uncertainty of the times and the notion that these men and women did not want to take the chance of deferring their weddings until after the war may shed some light on this upward trend in weddings and jewellery sales."],"display_date":"July 15, 1950 - July 27, 1953","search_date":"1952-01-19","locations":[{"id":28501,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":665,"tag":"Conscription"},{"id":664,"tag":"Korean War"},{"id":405,"tag":"Marriage"}],"course":{"name":"American History since the Civil War","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":42,"school_id":28}},{"id":5087,"title":"<strong>The Inescapable Sectional Tensions Leading to the Civil War</strong>","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-01-01","end_date":"1845-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Compromises concerning slavery, states’ rights, and economical issues were created to satisfy the North and South, but were not sufficient enough to ease the differences to prevent the Civil War.  The nineteenth century marked the westward movement of many American settlers and revealed the sectional differences among the North and South.  In Stephen Oates’ novel, <em>The Approaching Fury, </em>he explored the embarking of America’s Civil War from the viewpoint of thirteen different people such as Thomas Jefferson, Henry Clay, Nat Turner, and John C.

Here the four presidential candidates dance with members of their supposed respective constituencies.”  This political cartoon, along with many others, shows the main differences between the four major candidates and what the main issues of the time were. In the end, Abraham Lincoln proved to be victorious.  The <em>Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association</em> says that Lincoln was able to

loss of untouched and pristine nature began in nineteenth century America in the age growing urbanization and industrialization, yet a few places remained, allowing Americans to discover themselves in nature.  An 1854 illustration in Richards’ <em>American Scenery:  Illustrated</em> called “Lake in the Adirondacks, New York” revealed that these places did still exist in the nineteenth century.  The illustration showed one man fishing in a lake in the Adirondack Mountains, surrounded by nature untouched by human hands.  The image depicted mountains, lakes, trees, rocks, and shores, with no mention of the evidence of human society growing exponentially around it.  The sun was streaming over the water, a true depiction of calm and tranquility compared to the hustle and bustle of mid-nineteenth century life.  It was a true picture of the American frontier, even though it is actually located in the urbanized Northeast.   The chapter following the image compared the Adirondack Mountains of northern New York to Broadway Street in New York City.  Visitors to the area were “…astonished that Nature should yet remain in such primitive solitude and grandeur, so near the crowded marts of commerce and the ceaseless hum of human life and enterprise.”","Environmentalism was born in America in the nineteenth century as Americans began to feel the loss of what was once “the final frontier.”  As the American machine was developing its conquest of nature, the idea of preservation became prevalent in society.  Americans looked to protect undisturbed nature in the early nineteenth century before conservation became the dominant course in America.  Environmental thinking like this led to the creation of national and recreational parks in order to preserve nature.  The Adirondack Parkwas created in 1892 by the New York legislature to preserve the wilderness of state and protect it from modernization and an expanding population.  This act protected the area of loggers, and forever preserved from loggers that were destroying one of the few areas remaining that was different from the growingly urbanized and commercialized world.  In the 1800s, Urbanization was destroying the natural world that was viewed to be beneficial both for its own good and for its spiritual impact on people.  While the wilderness of the Adirondacks was unfit for economic and agricultural uses, it was rich in more than physical things; the loneliness of the area was both health-giving and soul-cheering.  This image spoke of American culture and society, as it moved toward urban and consumer life and away from the natural world.  Citizens of cities in nineteenth century America would have been unable to survive in the mountains of northern New York, even though in reality going from the city to the country should be from a more complex life to simplicity.  As Henry David Thoreau wrote in his book, Walden, “…as he simplifies his life, the laws of the universe will appear less

changing role of nineteenth century women from a worker on the farm to a woman of society was reflected in fashion transformations, with fashion magazines that spoke directly to women, stating that “every lady loves it.”  Magazine stressed the novelty and desirability of the clothing pictured.  MME Demorest’s Illustrated Portfolio of the Fashions was a popular biannual women’s magazine, costing individuals ten cents.  Directions were given in the magazine for measurements and the type and amount of fabric; patterns were then sent from New York City for ten to thirty cents each.   The magazine was delivered all over the country, directly from the nation’s fashion capital, New York City.  The 1875 spring and summer edition of the magazine pictured items such as demitrain skirts, overskirts, basques, polonaises, bonnets, and aprons.  The fashions showed women what was “in” and what to wear, what was “useful, practical, and reliable information.”  All styles were elegant, meant for high society women; women pictured were standing, acting prim and proper.  The magazine illustrated the fact that appearing well-dressed was very important to people in the nineteenth century; many were willing to have inferior homes and diets to wear symbols of supposed status and success in society.  The creation of fashion styles demonstrated the more general change in America to a consumer culture and market society.","Even as early as the 1830s in America, \"the lady of fashion had arrived.\"  As women moved from the fields to the home, attire accommodated to the new expectations of the female gender.  Many women had acquired a new aversion to working and managing household affairs, creating terrible wives, as this was the expectation of women at this time.  All of the styles and suggested materials were heavy, even though the styles were for the spring and summer; this revealed that fashion was to make a statement, not to be comfortable or practical.  The specific magazine was sold in Greenville, South Carolina residents, and while the fashions may have made sense for New York City, they may not have been as applicable to Southern or rural women.  The magazine did not show the distinct differences between city and country that were very apparent in the nineteenth century, only picturing the styles of the nation's fashion capital.  Also, fashion styles for girls even under the age of ten were elegant and unreasonable, if more jaunty than the women’s styles.  The magazine illustrated that women had a new role in society:  to be seen and not to work or be on the same intellectual or political level as men.  In nineteenth century society, women were to be, “the graces of purity, gentleness, kindness, modesty, constancy, sincerity, resignation, and of a meek and quiet spirit are your bright ornaments.”  American women's fashion also depicted the wider changes in nineteenth century society from the ideal of republican simplicity to aristocratic decadence."],"display_date":1875,"search_date":"1875-07-02","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New

exploration debates the larger question encompassing nineteenth century America:  do we play it safe, or take risks to gain knowledge?  Do we preserve what we have, or seek new things?  Arctic exploration is one debate that centers on these issues, and the 1873 <em>New York Tribune</em> article, “Arctic Exploration,” addresses these difficult questions.  The late nineteenth century saw the beginning of the adventurous explorers who dared to face the unknown of the Arctic Circle.  The article addresses the conflict between risk and knowledge.  Many people did not support Arctic exploration, claiming that it made prisoners of explorers and the risk was not worth the gain.  Arctic exploration in the 1870s came at the same time as the Panic of 1873, and many believed that money should go to things closer to home with more tangible results.  This newspaper article, however, defends Arctic exploration, stating that Arctic exploration can satisfy our natural “thirst for knowledge.”  Science, knowledge, and experience do not come from the majority of Americans that were becoming comfortable in their urban lives; instead, they must accept and support the brave souls who were willing to face the Arctic wilderness for answers.  And often, it involved looking forward; results from expeditions often seemed unimportant at the time, but the writer claims that one had to look to the future as grounds for Arctic exploration.","The nineteenth century is often noted for Western expansion in the United States, but many also began to look beyond the Americas.  Arctic exploration of the nineteenth century can be compared to the twentieth century’s space race, as quests involved competition and distinction, as well as tragedy and failure.  It is true that many men died, many ships were lost and, on the surface, discoveries were not major or life-changing.  Perhaps the compulsion for Arctic exploration comes from an “Arctic Fever,” and that explorers felt and urge to go into the unknown against better judgment and with little chance of knowledge or success as a result.  And yet the article describes the “softening” of Americans, from the tough and adventurous people they once were.  The drive and spirit of Ulysses that brought people to America to better their lives is gone in most people.  The fear of death comes into play, as it often does in the nineteenth century.  \"Shall adventure be given up or the field of discovery abandoned because there's peril in it because some men suffer and others die for sake of it!\"  The writer claims that death comes to all, and that dying in pursuit of a greater truth in the unexplored North is worth the risk.  Arctic explorers were men of the future, who moved society forward and lived life through risks as all Americans should.  And it all comes down to the idea of creating a history worth remembering; without risk, there is no gain."],"display_date":"May 13,

eighty-one-year old Mr. Paul reflects back on the seventy-four years he lived in Bronx, New York, he paints an image of the city he remembers as far different from the one in which he now lives after the surge of industrialism.  An avid gardener, Mr. Paul describes the old Bronx in terms of rose gardens, flowers, and cherry trees in stark contrast to the “bleak and stony” “shadows” that “blot out the sun.”  Fire-escapes, aerial wires, and tenement dust have replaced the precious patch of earth which was his garden in the backyard in which he cultivated flowers. ","In referring to the subject of commerce, Mr. Paul remembers the stores and shops by their owners with whom he was in community.  His next door neighbor “the baker” was known throughout Bronx for his rye bread and for his kindness to those in need, and passed the family business down to his son.  The way Mr. Paul describes the interactions with others in the neighborhood resembles a strong sense of community and is steeped in personal interactive relationships. ","Scenes of despair about the decreasing sense of community were commonplace in nineteenth century cities.  Often alone and isolated, city folk found themselves cut off from the traditional support of family and neighbors.  Feeling that it was necessary to create new forms of life in the modern metropolis, many turned to journalism as a venue for connecting with the world around them.  As much as public life was flourishing, the rise of the private spectrum also sought nationwide attention.  The power, prerogative, and sanctity of private property encouraged the spread of new ideas about business organization into almost every enterprise, large and small."," ","Mr. Paul’s personal testimony a","The transformation that took place in New York City was first a work of the imagination.  Every structure in this newly developing metropolis added to the good or bad impression of the city dwellers; all who ambitiously set out to erect new buildings were either enhancing or deteriorating public taste.  It was linkages between landscape, culture, and power that informed the discourse of the city building, and behind the design of the new city was a moral environmentalism, a belief that natural and built environments exert profound influence over the ideals and capacities that make of the city life.  American civilization would now be tested in urban areas as the drama of legitimization had shifted scenes.  Imbedded in the motives to create and develop a vast metropolis was a sense of spirituality and moral ideology.  The growth and progress of New York City began in the imagination of ambitious city-dwellers devoted to the idea of progress and advancement.  Though the whole process was one of a trade-off between the old and the new, most individuals of the age believed that given a chance to grow, New York City could become the imperial metropolis of the world.","bout the physical and intangible changes brought about through urbanization reflect the large scale transformations that cities were undergoing across the country.  Though his story represents the negative personal effects of urbanization, economists and

issues, events, and ideas were spread and divided among many American journals, newspapers, and periodicals, but in June of 1850 Harper & Brothers of New York sought to “remedy this evil” and provide all of this information in one place for anyone who wished to read it.  The firm introduced Harper’s New Monthly Magazine as the first general interest magazine in America.  They prefaced the issue with a quick word to their readers, explaining the reasoning and need for such a magazine in the United States.  The idea was to “place within the reach of the great mass of the American people the unbounded treasures of the Periodical Literature of the present day.”  They wished to bring the most current works of the most brilliant and innovative minds into the lives of as many as possible, offering their magazine monthly for only three dollars a year.  This was an attempt to keep minds fresh and informed in an age when so many things seemed to be happening and changing so quickly.","Great Britain and France had been in the practice of publishing periodicals for years, with growing popularity.  Harper & Brothers was trying to keep America up to date.  All of the brightest minds and all of their greatest works had been enriching European culture for years and Americans wanted the same for themselves.  Harper’s was a rather liberal arts publication, covering “varied intellectual movements of this most stirring and productive age.”  Scientific discoveries, political activity, and mechanical inventions were to be found among its pages with the fine art and literature, a regular Renaissance magazine. ","Harper & Brothers included the most recent information, not only from America, but from Europe, too.  It was an innovative concept and a way to advance and improve American culture and society.  By catering to “any class of readers…for any kind of reading,” the firm was able to deliver a magazine with a value “so much beyond its price…into the hands or the family circle of every intelligent citizen of the United States.”  Every copy of the issue in June sold and half a year later there were up to 50,000 readers.","Initial issues quickly shifted from the notable European works to the fresh American pieces.  Writers such as Horace Greeley, Horatio Alger, Stephen Douglas, and Mark Twain put forth their ideas for America.  During the 1850s the country was enjoying the access to printed materials that the printing press allowed and the spread of railroads assisted.  Culture was becoming a possible investment, rather than the bare necessities of yesteryears.  Many authors and artists were working to accelerate this process, and Harper’s New Monthly Magazine offered a brilliant and accessible means of doing so."],"display_date":"June

“Personal insecurity is the great motivator to shop.”  Middle-class women of the 19<sup>th</sup> century struggled to keep up with fashion trends set by the wealthy in society in order to feel stylish and modern in a time where modernity was prized.  Sarah Tytler, a member of the American Tract Society and a contributor to The Young Lady’s Guide, wrote about this focus on fashion and decried it a senseless waste of time, effort, and resources by middle-class women. If a woman is not wealthy, attempting to keep up with the latest trends robs her of her money and subsequently her peace of mind. Staying abreast of and setting the fashion trends of the day is a task, a responsibility, a job of the wealthiest women.  Tytler instructs the women of her time to dress within their means and even instructs her readers to wear clothes out of affection for that is when the most joy will be gained from their use.  If stylishness is sought after just so that a woman looks better than those around her, garnering more attention while walking down the street, then she displays very bad taste. "," A woman naturally desires to have all things nice and pleasant, but laboring after an elusive fashion ideal that is constantly shifting leads to a lack of commitment to that which is normally within a middle-class woman’s sphere.  According to Tytler, this includes “honest hospitality, dignity, and loyal-brotherly kindness,” among others.  This emphasis on the household labor of care was a mainstay of the cult of domesticity that redefined women’s roles in the household in the nineteenth century.   A woman’s role was no longer that of a breadwinner for the household but of the nurturing caretaker that performed her duties as a mother, wife, and runner of the house out of and with love and affection.  A middle-class women, therefore, should focus on her “natural” duties in the home instead of looking outward, wasting time, money, and her talents which should be utilized elsewhere."],"display_date":"1870 - 1871","search_date":"1870-12-31","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":718,"tag":"Women in the Household"},{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5046,"title":"Marriage in Margaret Fuller's \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\"","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-01","end_date":"1845-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the nineteenth century, one female author stood out as a voice for women during a time when many were not acknowledged.  Margaret Fuller wrote “Woman in the Nineteenth Century” and spoke with a voice for every woman who lived during the nineteenth century.  In particular, Fuller had an especially critical view toward marriage.  She explained that the idea of marriage “has been inculcated on women for centuries, that men not only have stronger passions than they, but of a sort that it would be shameful for them to share of even understand”.  She further explains that woman are expected to tell their husbands everything on their mind, and when they begin to show signs of “coldness or withdrawal” the wife is then labeled “wicked”.","The role of women gained increased attention during the nineteenth century, especially in women’s movements throughout the country.  As described by Carole Shammas in “A history of household government in American,” the U.S. was “the site of the first full-fledged uprising of female dependents…There were a few like Margaret Fuller, the Boston intellectual, who would maintain that if they wanted, “women should be sea captains!” but the primary objectives of the first feminists were not equal opportunities in the job market or in the political arena.” Shammas explained that the reason for their outrage was for others to acknowledge “the empowerment of women in households”.  During the nineteenth century, women desired to be seen as influential members of society instead of the “housewife” label with the expectations to constantly serve their husband.","Fuller asserted her confidence in understanding women and marriage when she explained that the married woman viewed men as “wild beasts” but actually view them all the same.  The unwed women were often told by the married women that if they were in their position and married to a man, “they would not expect continence or self-government from them”.  Women’s expectations were high for marriage, but in reality they received little in return, expected to run the household, and were taken advantage of."," "," "],"display_date":1845,"search_date":"1845-07-02","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5054,"title":"America's First Fashion Magazine","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-11-02","end_date":"1867-11-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The issues discussed in the first issue of Harper’s Bazar are not different from concerns of twenty-first century women.

The design of the magazine title was quite different from today’s title in part because today, the magazine spells Bazar with two A’s instead of one. The font of the title was also quite different because it was written in an old English style and had ivy intertwining between the letters.

However, the biggest difference between  attire of the nineteenth century and the twenty-first century did not lie on the outside. The major differences were what the women wore underneath their dresses.

The magazine took on the daunting task and discussed marriage in its first issue on November 2, 1867. The first issue contained several articles that discussed various concerns of nineteenth century women. But, its most controversial article was entitled, “Expensive Matrimony.” The piece was one of the firsts of its time because during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, most newspapers and magazines did not discuss matrimony.","The author contradicted the idea that the reason for the decrease in marriage is women and their bad spending habits. She said it was wrong to blame women for the decrease in marriage rates because there was no statistical data to support the idea. She believed that men, in fact had worse spending habits than women did. The author stated that although women did tend to spend on clothing, men spent on larger, pricier items. She also stated that when it came down to it, men were greedier than women and men would put money before family. Men were more business oriented and would choose their careers and money over anything else. She said that since men usually focused more on their careers than family, they were more to blame for the decrease in marriage than women.","She also explains that not all women had bad spending habits. Some women were good with finances and saving money and it was wrong to simply assume that all women were bad with money. The author made several more valid points, such as the fact that women had self control and could stop shopping and spending money on clothing if need be.","The article demonstrated that marriage rates had been decreasing since the nineteenth century.

Porter was a man of many talents.  Born in 1792 in Massachusetts but moving to Maine when he was nine, Porter was apprenticed to a shoemaker by his family, but he was far too restless for that kind of life.  After leaving home he played the fiddle, traveled to Hawaii, taught dancing school, had 15 children by two wives and became one of the most accomplished mural painters of his day.  However, his true avocation was inventing.  Among his creations (he had over 100 patents) were a fire alarm, signal telegraph, fog whistle, washing machine, and a revolving rifle.  Showing the kind of business sense that has rendered his name obscure in the annals of American history, in 1844 Porter sold this last idea for $100 to Samuel Colt, who then used it to build his renowned firearms company.","Porter may have struck out in the weapons industry, but his contribution in the field of journalism was just as long-lasting.  He took over the <em>New York Mechanic</em> in 1841, but sold it after relocating to Boston the next year in order to work as an electroplater.  Back in New York City, on August 28, 1845 he put out the first issue of <em>Scientific American</em>, a magazine that survives to this day.  In his first editorial, Porter gives the goal of the new journal as “to furnish the intelligent and liberal working man and those who delight in the development of the beauties of Nature…with a paper that will instruct while it diverts and amuses them, and will retain its excellence and value, when political and ordinary newspapers are thrown aside and forgotten.”","The first issue certainly made a good effort on these promises.  There are, as might be expected, scientific articles such as a discussion of the first principles of mechanics and another on how two compounds mixed together could make a very different color than each separately, a fact no doubt related to Porter’s artistic career.  There are also descriptions of the latest technology, improved railcars and the steamship <em>Great Britain</em>, complete with engravings.  There is a list of all of the patents recently granted.  Then there are some articles of a different bent, like the surprising assortment of poetry.  One article is entitled “Rational Religion,” that no doubt provides a distillation of Porter’s own sunny philosophy and the first in a regular theological column.  The story of a horse that is sensible enough to go by itself to the blacksmith is found between an article on lithographic painting and another on the properties of zinc.","One article that deserves of particular notice discussed the invention of one Signor Muzzi.  Muzzi claimed to have invented a method of aerial locomotion, which was basically a propelled balloon.  The author of this article dismissed the practicality of this claim with scorn, writing about how Muzzi’s plan received undue attention simply because he was Italian while a far more rational plan proposed by an American had previously been dismissed.  The vehement dismissal of Muzzi could perhaps be explained by realizing that Porter’s lifetime goal was to develop a working airship and the American referred to in this article was likely none other than himself.","Porter would devote most of his life until his death in 1884 to working on his airship plan, retaining his optimism in the face of business and technical failures.  As for the <em>Scientific American</em>, Porter sold it to two patent lawyers, Orson Desaix Munn and Alfred Ely Beach, for $800 just 10 months after the first issue was published.  He would stay on as editor for another year, but it was under their leadership that the broadsheet would begin to flourish.  Porter himself passed away in Connecticut in 1884, a man whose “eccentricity of genius” was too little appreciated in his day."],"display_date":"August 28, 1845","search_date":"1845-08-28","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW

However, during its most viable years, new philosophy about the nature of government was introduced in America, as well as older theories being reborn and advocated. From an analysis of <em>The American Whig Review</em>, Whigs were influential in the debates regarding tariffs and the free market, federalism versus nationalism, and ultimately the question of slavery.","The Whig Party was defunct before the advent of the Civil War, but may have perished sooner without its vast print infrastructure – newspapers and journals spread Whig ideas about the role of government that were adopted by the Republican party, especially Lincoln, who was a Whig for the majority of his adult life and became part of a bridge that allowed Whig concepts to cross into the Republican Party platform."],"display_date":"June 1, 1846","search_date":"1846-06-01","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"},{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":767,"tag":"Political Parties"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5101,"title":"A English tourist documents his travels from Liverpool, England to New York.","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-06-01","end_date":"1848-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1848, Archibald Prentice composed “A tour in the United States” during his journey from Liverpool, England to New York. In his letters, Prentice recorded observations of his experiences throughout his tour of America.","During his stay in the Astor House in New York, Prentice wrote about what he observed after touring Brooklyn. He was particularly fascinated by the working man of America. In one of his journal entries, he noted that the labor market for incoming immigrant men was plentiful throughout the city. In the following passage he described the lure of moving to America. Many poor immigrants had nothing but hope that the simple opportunity to promote themselves through higher wages could improve their lifestyles. “Much misery must prevail. Tens of thousands of immigrants land here and linger here without a definite object; but yet the wages of common labour are about fifty percent. more than they are in England, and the price of food is one-third less. It is true that rent, clothes, and coals are fifty per cent. higher; but where a man has scarcely earned more than has kept him in food, the change by coming here is decidedly to his advantage, always premising that he brings the kind of labour which is in demand. If the labourer has earned three shillings a day in England, he will earn four shillings and sixpence here.\"","Although Prentice painted a portrait that sounded hopeful to any poor immigrant, not everyone entering the United States was able to obtain good employment or maintain a successful lifestyle. Prentice noted that alcohol such as whiskey was cheap and plentyful which caused problems for immigrant workers. He wrote how alcohol abuse often ruined the progress of hopeful immigrants by causing ill mental and physical health.","Those who were destitute often ended living in charitable homes for the poor called Almshouses. “Life in many 19th-century immigrant urban neighborhoods was squalid and mean. Immigrants were disproportionately represented among the ranks of the inner-city poor. By 1860 nearly 90 percent of New York City’s paupers were immigrants. When not begging for food or accepting charity, they lived in dank, dark, filthy, crowded tenements. Such conditions served as a breeding ground for alcohol abuse and crime. In 1870, 65 percent (32,322 of 49,423) of those in New York City’s prisons were foreign-born, with 68 percent hailing from Ireland .”"," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"June 1848","search_date":"1848-06-15","locations":[{"id":8868,"lat":40.6450686304,"lng":-73.9495584018,"zoom":11,"place":"KINGS, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":602,"tag":"Transportation/Migration"},{"id":34,"tag":"Crime/Violence, Economy, Law, Slavery, Urban Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5103,"title":"<strong>Full Steam Ahead; Coming to America on a Steamship – How the Steamship and the Industrial Revolution Changed America.</strong>","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-06-22","end_date":"1852-07-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On June 22, 1852, Edmund Patton took off upon a massive steamship from London on a voyage to America.  He noted the scene upon leaving within the pages of his book, “One of these noble ships leaves the port of London weekly; they are fitted up to carry several hundred emigrants, who are glad to leave Europe, in the hope of improving their condition in the New World, which offers a fair prospect to clever mechanics, agriculturists, and others able to work, who have seldom had cause to repent bidding farewell to Fatherland, especially those having large families to settle in life.”  The scene he describes is a scene of people embarking on a new life.  The accumulation of these lives creating new stories of their own in a New World would change the course of the country they were in search of.  Patton held these immigrants in contempt throughout his encounters with them on the ship, dismissing them as an unwashed mob and holding nothing back in implying their inferiority to himself.  His haughty narration is a good example of the reason why these people were leaving in search of something better.  The story of the changing of America wouldn’t be because of people like Patton, however, it would be the story of that rabble with whom he was traversing the Atlantic on a steamship.","The advent of steamships and the migration which followed produced a cyclical function; the advent of large steam ships in place of sail ships made migration easier, which in turn increased the population of the country.  The immigrants provided cheap labor, which the new, growing American industries needed to produce massive amounts of steel, etc.  So, the immigrants who showed up to work in American factories produced more volumes and better additions to the transportation industry, which fostered the ability for more immigrants to pick up from where they lived before and establish new roots in America.","The advent of steam power and the Industrial Revolution which followed on its heels changed the way life was lived in the United States.  These innovations increased the allure and therefore the power of cities, which could provide a large number of people in a concentrated area for a workforce in the industrial factories which arose during the Industrial Revolution.  Before the massive immigration to American shores and the advent of steam power in ships and trains, the United States was a largely agrarian country, with farm communities linked to each other by muddy roads which were travelled mainly on foot or by horse.  As the train lines expanded across the country over the course of the century, and immigrants poured into cities, creating new opportunities to chase the American dream in a new economy, the balance of what we would consider an average American life shifted to something that looked much more urban than it had in the past.  “Wherever it occurred, the Industrial Revolution shook people loose from traditional ways of life. It made factory workers out of artisans and, even more dramatically, turned millions of rural farmers into urban wage-laborers. Most of those migrants from countryside to city, from agriculture to industry…”","If it weren’t for the steamships like those which Edmund Patton travelled on across the vast Atlantic Ocean, the United States may have become a different, less diverse place.  The Industrial Revolution that followed made the country into an economic power, and it connected the country in a way that it hadn’t been in the past.  Shorter transport times meant more fluidity of movement throughout the country.  If it was for leisure or for the search of a better life, the steamship and the Industrial Revolution that followed allowed people to pursue their free will of travel in a country that was established on the belief that people are entitled to that kind of freedom."],"display_date":"June 22, 1852 - July 29, 1852","search_date":"1852-07-10","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5111,"title":"Bertha Bülow-Wendhausen and the Women of America","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-01-01","end_date":"1897-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Bertha Bülow-Wendhausen was pleasantly surprised when she arrived in America in 1897.

She found no discontent in the way they behaved, in the way they dressed, or in the way they spoke. They were intelligent, graceful, and motherly. All of the women busied themselves in womanly accomplishments, such as organizing charity groups, kindergartens and clubs.","Bertha also noted many female attendees in her lectures about kindergarten in New York.

In fact, the American woman was perceived to be in a far better position than her mate, as she was confined to her quiet house and spared from the rough and cold world that loomed outside. However, as Bertha noticed, women could still be equal to men in their intelligence.

They were very well behaved, but they were too mature for their age. Children this young must not be too reflective or solemn, but playful and carefree. Kindergarten would remedy this and mold children into what they were supposed to be. The children were also very polite and respectful to their elders, a trait, Bertha noted, that was lacking in many European children. Even the boys from the slums were polite and courteous as she drove by.","Bertha visited many schools and kindergartens while visiting America, and she was struck by the children’s seriousness. Although well groomed and neat, they did not laugh or play often and were quiet. She recounts the story of a young 13 month old child, already independent. The child, she claimed, could walk forward and back, up and down stairs, and feed himself with a fork cleanly and without any aid. She thought of the importance of independence and self-reliance in America, and marveled that it was taught to babes even at such a young age.","During Bertha’s time in the United States, children were still seen as helpers in the household. Education for children was carried out mostly by their mothers and perhaps fathers at home. James Marten agrees that children were molded into miniature adults early in life, their childhood a sacrifice for family prosperity. Children of both rich and poor families were brought up in order to contribute to the family income, not to leech it and indulge themselves in frivolous affairs.

The German Foreign Office promised to pass on all pertinent information regarding their investigation into the case of Dr. Mulvihill on to the United States government. They promised the same for similar cases as well, such as that of Mr. Roland Velz, who had been similarly assaulted by two German men when he failed to salute an emblem of the Nazi party.","In these cases, the severity of the punishments may seem somewhat harsh, and also appear unusual to us due to the fact that our knowledge of the use of prison (or concentration) camps generally derives from the post-war period and not before, and we are rarely informed about non-Jewish, German prisoners.  However, at the same time that the Nazi régime was investigating and punishing the men involved in these crimes, the articles notes that there were also “problems arising from Germany’s severance with the League of Nations and the arms parley at Geneva.” Regarding the latter issue, between the years 1932 and 1933, a World Disarmament Conference was held by the League of Nations in Geneva at which the constituent countries (primarily the United Kingdom, the United States, France and Germany) could not come to an agreement. On the one hand, according to Historian Marlies ter Borg, the German representatives believed that their country had taken the initiative in beginning the disarmament process and asked that the others follow suit. France, however, refused to do so unless they could have a promise of “collective security” from the United Kingdom and the United States, whereby those nations would intervene if war should break out in Europe. As Borg mentions, unfortunately for France, neither of those countries were willing to do so at the time.","In terms of the former concern, Historian Colum Duffy notes that when the nations who afterward became the Axis Forces during the Second World War (Germany, Japan and Italy) were accused of “committing acts of aggression” by the League of Nations, they made known their intention to withdraw from it “in order to prevent the machinery of the [League] from functioning effectively against them.” In light of these events – and their mention in the article – it is likely that the Nazi régime made their promise to hand over the information about these cases in an attempt to alleviate (somewhat) the issues that were quickly developing at the time and would damage their international image."],"display_date":"August 8, 1933","search_date":"1933-08-08","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"},{"id":806,"tag":"League of Nations"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":56,"school_id":28}},{"id":5128,"title":"The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire of 1911","course_id":54,"status":"P","start_date":"3/25/11","end_date":"3/25/11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire of 1911","By: Louis Daleandro","<br />Within fifteen minutes, a massive fire broke out in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in New York City in 1911.  Dubbed a model of modern efficiency, the Triangle factory was large in scale as were the specially designed bins that held hundreds of pounds of scrap cotton and tissue paper.   The blaze that ensued ultimately took the lives of 146 mostly young, immigrant women workers who either burned or jumped to their deaths.  Out of the tragedy came progress as the trial and outcry sparked by the even led to improvements in safety and sanitation.  Witnesses of the account, however, tell haunting tales of the event.  William Shepherd’s first hand account, provided over a telephone to a reporter as the fire burned, depicted the gruesome nature of the fire.","<br />William G. Shepherd was walking through Washington Square on the night of the fire and was drawn to the scene when he saw a puff of smoke.  The sound of a speeding, living body making a thud on the sidewalk became a sound he quickly learned.  His eyewitness account gruesomely described the horror of the event.  Shepherd explained that the first ten thuds he heard shocked him.  He was able to look up and see a girl falling while waving her arms and trying to keep her body upright until the instant she hit the pavement.  Through shouts of horror for the fire department, Shepherd could see the young women climbing out onto the windowsill and then dropping.  The ladder of the fire department could only reach the sixth floor; the factory took up the top three floors of the ten-story building.  A life net was set up below but the bodies of the workers just broke through it.  Shepherd explained that he witnessed a love affair amid the flames when a young man held out women away from the building and let them drop, with the fourth woman grabbing the man and giving him a goodbye kiss.  Girls jumped and tried in vain to grab the short reaching ladder.  Shepherd went around the corner and witnessed tragedies unfold on the ninth floor where girls were screaming, as they burnt alive.  The windows were jammed offering them no chance to jump.  The sidewalk became the home of heaps of broken bodies where a policeman began fastening tags to the wrists of the girls, one of whom he noticed wearing an engagement ring.  Shepherd recalled the strike of the previous year where these same girls fought for better sanitary conditions and more safety precautions.  In less than seven minutes, however, the fire had amassed the factory and the street below was covered in bodies.","Well before the fire engulfed the factory, efforts were taken to improve the safety conditions of the workers.  At the turn of the twentieth century labor laws and safety codes were not aggressively enforced if they even existed.  The garment workers of Triangle struck in 1909 on the basis of being overworked and underpaid.  The strike soon spread to other shirtwaist manufacturers and by Christmas of 1909, 723 employees had been arrested.   The public, however, mostly sided with the laborers.  In thirteen weeks time, the strike ended with new contracts that created a 52 maximum hour workweek and wage increases of 12 to 15%.  Conditions in the factory, however, still remained unsafe in the end leading to a grand jury indicting Triangle Shirtwaist owners Isaac Harris and Max Blanck on charges of manslaughter.","The trial that emerged over the guilt of the factory owners, Harris and Blanck, rendered its final decision of not guilty on December 4, 1911.  The judge reminded the jury that the dramatic testimonies of the devastating event was not the key to the case, whether or not the owners knew the door that could have given the girls an escape was locked was. The all male jury set Harris and Blanck free with some of the jurors remarking that the women probably just panicked and guilt could not be found unless they believed Harris and Blanck knew the door was locked and in that regard what real reason the door was locked in the first place.  The tragedy, however, inspired workingwomen to fight harder for their rights.  Strikes increased and membership in the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union skyrocketed.  Female labor leaders such as Leonora O’Reilly demanded suffrage for women in order to be empowered to vote in politicians who would change sweatshop conditions.  New York City created the Bureau of Fire Prevention and began enforcing stricter safety regulations and finally under Franklin D. Roosevelt, the precursor to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) was created.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","Bibliography","Drehle, David Von. “Trial by Fire.” Smithsonian 37, no. 5 (August 2006): 93-98. http://vnweb.hwwilsonweb.com/hww.results.getResults.jhtml?_DARGS=///advanced_search.jhtml.4 (accessed November 15, 2010)."," ","Linder, Doug. “The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire Trial.” Famous Trials. http://www.law.umkc.edu//projects///.html (accessed November 15, 2010)."," ","Shepherd, William G. “Eyewitness at the Triangle.” Interview by Roy Howard.

The case was commonly known as the “Lemmon Slave Case”. The events that led to this appeal dated back to 1850. The court case brought up hard questions about slavery within the United States of America and challenged the slavery laws between the northern states and the southern states.","The events that inspired the Lemmon case began in 1852 when the Lemmon family and eight of their African American slaves traveled from the state of Virginia, where slavery was legal at the time, to the state of New York, where slavery was illegal. While the Lemmon family and their slaves were in New York City, an African American man named Louis Napoleon found the slaves owned by the Lemmon family and determined that they were being held against their will. This was illegal within New York City. So, Napoleon went to the Superior Court of New York City and filed a writ of habeas corpus, which is Latin for \"that you have the body,\" for the African American slaves. On November 6, 1852, Justice Elijah Paine granted the writ of habeas corpus for the slaves, which required Lemmon to produce his slaves before the court.","The <em>New York Times</em> article from January 24, 1860 discussed the plaintiffs’ points of argument before the Court of Appeals in the Lemmon Slave Case. The plaintiffs’ lawyer Mr. Charles O’Connor first pointed out that New York State could not forbid slavery because it was not illegal in the United States. In 1860, the Constitution of the United States did not yet have an amendment making slavery illegal. O’Conner next noted that the Judicial Department of New York State has no right to declare African American slavery illegal contrary to the law of nature. Finally, he argued that New York State could not prevent citizens of sister states, where slavery was legal, from passing through New York.","A follow-up article in the <em>New York Times</em>, dated January 26, 1860, addressed the counterarguments of the Counsel of New York, Mr. William M. Evarts. Evarts responded to O’Conner’s arguments before the court. The first point was that every human being within the state of New York was entitled to the writ of habeas corpus. The second point was that the relationship between slave owner and slave did not continue from Virginia to New York then Texas. The third and final point his argument was that travelers are bounded by the laws of the state in which they reside, no matter whether they stay one day or several years.","The State of New York Court of Appeals made its decision on the Lemmon case in March 1860. The Judges ruled 5-3 in favor of the African American slaves. One of the majority opinions was written by Judge Denio. In his opinion Denio said that some cases concerning the Commerce Clause would be able to protect slavery as property when dealing with interstate commerce but this case was not one of them. The Commerce Clause is part of the Constitution of the United States that allows the federal government to regulate interstate commerce so there is no wrong doing between states. Another member of the majority, Justice Wright, stated that the United States Constitution denied any power affecting slavery, which does not involve the Fugitive Slave Clause. This clause requires that slaves that escaped to another state to be returned back to the owner in the state from which they escaped.","The judges who favored the Lemmon family were Justices Clarke, Comstock, and Selden. Justice Clarke stated that citizens of other states traveling through New York State must be allowed to pass through with their property even if the property includes slaves. Chief Judge Comstock and Judge Selden also “expressed a concern at the violation of comity and justice in interstate relations wrought by the New York statue” [1]. Following the New York decision the Lemmon family appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Before the United States Supreme Court could hear the case the US Civil War started in April 1861. Then in September 1862 President Lincoln made the Emancipation Proclamation which freed all slaves in the United States.","In conclusion, the <em>New York Times </em>article from January 24, 1860 provides fascinating insights into the legal issues affecting slavery and interstate travel before the Civil War. This court case was part of the final stage in the United States history that triggered the Civil War and made all Americans free no matter where they came from and what color their skin was."," ","_________________","[1] Gordan, III, John D. \"The Lemmon Slave Case.\" The Historical Society of the Courts of the State of New York, 2006: 1, 12."],"display_date":"January - March 1860","search_date":"1860-02-14","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":858,"tag":"habeas corpus"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":857,"tag":"Lemmon Case"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":5143,"title":"Fighting Back, Lola Montez","course_id":52,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-07-15","end_date":"1852-07-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In July of 1852, Lola Montez opened a copy of the <em>New York Daily Times</em> and came face to face with column after column of slanderous comments directed at her. Defamation of character is probably one of the most challenging things that one person can go through. People expressing half-truths without actually knowing the real story is a battle most people will face at some point in their lives. In the case of Lola Montez, the <em>New York Times</em> and the Common Council, an elected legislative body of the city of New York, called her a brazen prostitute and said that there are certain crimes that cannot occur without accomplices. They claimed that she proved herself guilty to everyone what her true character was by fleeing and hiding from the public. Finally Lola had enough, and on July 15th she wrote a letter to <em>Times</em> editor H.J Raymond, the gentleman who had allowed the slanderous comments to be printed in the newspaper in the first place."," ","Marie Dolores Eliza Rosanna Gilbert, or Lola as she was more famously known, was born in Limerick Ireland; her dream was to leave Europe for America believing that she would live among generous and justice loving people there. She was an Irish adventuress; she took dance lessons in Spain and proclaimed herself to be Spanish dancer. With her dance training she was able to tour throughout Europe. She was the daughter of an army officer.  When she was a child around eleven years old she had acquired her wild and free eccentric habits. She came to America with the same mentality as most immigrants did, and with the same premonitions as most females during that time period. Her goal was not to do harm to others but to look for a better paying job and escape from poverty. Desperate for money, she turned to prostitution. During this time period, the number of brothels had sky rocketed in New York. Lola was not the only prostitute looking for a chance to escape poverty. Many others such as, Maria Williamson bought and controlled a few brothels making her a substantial amount of money."," ","In her letter to the editor of the <em>New York Times</em>, Lola never depicts herself as a prostitute. Instead, she depicts herself as a Spanish trained dancer, who happened to catch the attention of a very noble king looking for companionship. She met King Louis of Bavaria in 1846 while touring as a dancer in Munich. She soon became his mistress and influenced him greatly in supporting things that she believed in such as liberal and anti-Jesuit policies. She married King Louis in 1847, and her power over him provoked angry reactions and once she realized that she was unsuited for his character, she divorced him in 1848 and fled the country and returned back to the stage, leaving King Louis to abandon his throne. Never once did she ever believe that her name would be used in vain and used for so many cruel and unjust things."," ","History shows that in the nineteenth century New York City was a thriving location for unscrupulous landlords, consumers and prostitutes. Unregulated and unsupervised, the red light districts exploded across the city, which eventually lead to twenty and twenty five thousand prostitutes working there by 1869. In fact, between five and ten percent of women in the city were involved in prostitution. With time, prostitution transformed to reflect and cater to consumer demand. During this time period, prostitutes were among the freest, wealthiest and most educated women in the United States. Like Lola Montez, many prostitutes befriended and gained the confidence of men that were looking for outside companionship. While some feminists were seeking to free women from slavery, prostitutes married later in life and divorced more frequently than other American woman. The <em>New York Times</em> stated that the Common Council had been taking lessons from Lola Montez, and said also that she hides herself in shame. They claimed that she took advantage of public charity as well. Lola challenged these accusations and called on her accusers to specify and prove her alleged offences."," ","In the final part of her retaliation against the editor of the <em>New York Times</em>, she requests that he admit his ignorance and state that he wrongly accused her of immoral activities. Otherwise she would be seeking legal action and let the courts decide who was actually being unjust, even though that was a road she did not really want to walk down. She was defenseless at that point; no one would take her seriously in order to prove that she was nothing more than a dancer and a companion to men. The letter makes it clear that Lola was tired of people belittling her without giving her a chance to clear her name.   She appealed to the editor to write another article in which he admitted that his cruel words were nothing more than pure ignorance, however no such letter had ever appeared in the column of <em>Times</em>."],"display_date":"July 15, 1852","search_date":"1852-07-15","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":859,"tag":"Nineteenth Century"},{"id":83,"tag":"Prostitution"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":52,"school_id":43}},{"id":5154,"title":"The Changing Public Attitude towards Slavery","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1841-03-10","end_date":"1841-03-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, the changes in the public mindset towards slavery had not yet been fully reinforced by law but the distaste with which other countries had viewed the institution for some time was clear.  Blatant racism was still plainly evident, yet the abolition movement was now growing and the public response to prejudice was now becoming very different.  After recent written accounts of slavery in the United States had been published by intellectuals such as Harriet Martineau and James Silk Buckingham, there were others from overseas taking on the voyage to the United States.  They wished to reveal and record what they saw about this young, powerful republic with such controversial politics at hand, in wonderment of the idealized American principles burdened so heavily by slavery’s contradiction of them, and to participate in the abolishment of the institution.","On March 10, 1841, one such voyage carrying many passengers of international backgrounds from Great Britain to America.  Joseph Sturge, an author and anti-slavery movement member, recalls how an inebriated British man, in calling to attention a waiter standing by, referred to him as “blackey”.  The waiter responded, “My name is Robert; when you want anything from me, please address me by my name; there is no gentleman on board who would have addressed me as you have done; we are all of the same flesh and blood; I did not make myself; God made me”.","His intoxication was of no excuse, and while many passengers on board indeed held their own opinions as to the lesser status of black men, it was also understood by the observers that there was not a man present, no matter their prejudices, who would have supported the initial offender against this much-deserved return. Sturge’s observations reflect that the passengers on the voyage to America could see the waiter as a man, much as themselves, and could not deny the accuracy of his response.  In decades earlier, few black men standing alone would have dared speak out without fear of immediate and unanimous reprisal, yet this was 1841, and here was a glimpse of the gradual but necessary progressions of the public outlook about slavery as an unacceptable institution.","Abolition-movement members such as the American brothers Arthur and Lewis Tappan were working diligently towards their cause, an attempt to “ma[ke] the whole nation look the captives in the face”, as yet another overseas onlooker noted.   People were becoming uncomfortable with slavery and racism as it seemed uncivilized and sinful amongst developed men.  Author St. George Tucker noted how even in pursuit of  independence and the hope for a better life which the Americans had sought for themselves, somehow they had turned from the oppressed into the oppressors, and in many cases, much more viciously.","The traveling writers from overseas were being joined by many American intellectuals, such as Emerson and Thoreau amongst others, all pointed in their goal of revealing a changing attitude about slavery in the United States.  Developments in communication allowed this perspective to circulate more widely than ever possible before.  Many people now not only understood the institution of slavery but were faced with its details every day.  The cultivation of thought encouraged by publications seemed to require a new evolution in behavior."],"display_date":"March 10, 1841","search_date":"1841-03-10","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":64,"tag":"Anti-slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5159,"title":"America Experiments with Medicine","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/00","end_date":"12/31/00","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["With the idea that America was the new Promised Land, many Americans were open  to everything new including ideas on health.  Diet, nutrition and wellness were topics of debate, often with men claiming to have the latest and greatest cure-all remedy.","Reverend Sylvester Graham was an advocate for healthful living.  He introduced a restrictive diet excluding meat, butter, coffee, tea and any intoxicating drinks.  He felt that these impurities would cause sexual desire and lead to disease.  Graham was also a strong advocate for maintaining a moral lifestyle that included exercise, proper attire, good sleeping habits and continence.  He had many followers, some of whom would call him Dr. Graham despite the fact he was not formally educated as one.  Upon a visit to an orphan asylum, James Silk Buckingham found they applied Graham’s diet to the children by feeding them a strictly vegetarian diet.  The orphanage claimed this helped the children build better bodies than that of meat eaters and protected them from diseases.  Graham's radical views often provoked opposition from the meat industry as well as husbands who did not want intercourse limited with their wives.","Although there were some educated doctors who followed more conservative practices, the majority had little education and was of lower class.   Of these doctors, there were some who would make radical health claims for cures.   A Chinaman noted in his writings of American doctors that many of them would make absurd claims for remedies and dismisses the Chinese medicine practiced for thousands of years stating it was outdated.  He commented, “Indeed, in no other field does ignorance, superstition, credulity, and lack of real education display itself as among the American doctors or healers.

First, he wrote about why he came to U.S., “I came to America to see men and women and not simply bricks and mortar, to understand a national life rather than to moan over sooty cities and industrial wildernesses. Hundreds of thousands of healthy Europeans passed annually to America. I wanted to know what this asylum or refuge of our wanderers actually was, what was the life and hope it offered, what America was doing with her hands, what she was yearning for with her heart. I wished to know also what was her despair,” he says. Graham and most of the immigrants believed that in the United States it was easy to get a place and earn an honest living. In the first chapter “The Arrival of the Immigrant”, he described how he and other immigrants arrived in New York. All the approved immigrants were overjoyed. These people were mostly Europeans, such as Germans, Swedes, Italians and Russians.","Graham then expressed how he was impressed by the advanced technology, diversity of language, people’s hospitality and kindness and the natural environment.  He was also impressed by Americans' culture and faith: “America breathed kindness. New York seemed to me more friendly and hospitable than any other great city I had lived in,” he says, “I for my part have to thank numberless farmers, east and west, for kindly interest and good talks, loaves of bread, cups of coffee, and pleasant meals. Several times when I have been cooking by the side of a road a farm wife has come running out to me with something hot from her kitchen, with an ‘Eat this, poor man, and God bless you, you must be hungry.’” Graham was very touched by these kind people and the way they lived.","Graham basically loved America rather than his home country, in every aspect such as culture, religion, society and economy. “We live in a tradition; they live in an expectation. We are remedying the old state; they are building the new. We are loyal to the ideas of our predecessors, they are agape to divine the ideas of generations yet to come,” Graham once says in his book. In the end of the book, he expresses how he thinks of the United States and how the United States is better than his home country.  He says, “Back to Russia! From the most forward country to the most backward country in the world; from the place where ‘time is money’ to where the trains run at eighteen miles an hour; from the land of Edison to the land of Tolstoy; from the religion of philanthropy to the religion of suffering--home once more.”","Graham’s book reflected the image of the United States in the European’s eyes. His experiences perfectly explain why Europeans craved to come to the U.S. during the early 1900s. In the book <em>The Huddled Masses: The Immigrant in American Society, 1880-1921, </em>Alan Kraut explains that the depression of the 1890s greatly enhanced the number of Eastern and Southern European immigrants in United States. By 1910, Eastern and Southern Europeans made up seventy percent of the immigrants entering the United States. Kraut argues that immigration to America was but one of the many choices available to the immigrants, and that individual aptitude and desires were just as influential as cultural, social, and familial pressures to find a better life, which is exactly what Graham was talking about. As Kraut discusses, escaping religious, racial, and political persecution, or seeking relief from a lack of economic opportunity or famine, were the main reasons why they wanted to come to United States. To sum up, what Kraut explains about the immigration of early 20<sup>th</sup> century perfectly illustrates Graham’s experience and the reason why those Europeans were craving to move to the United States during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century."],"display_date":1914,"search_date":"1914-07-02","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":892,"tag":"European immigrants"},{"id":797,"tag":"America in 19th Century."},{"id":759,"tag":"Immigrants"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5169,"title":"Lower Working Class Life of New York City","course_id":66,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-01","end_date":"1830-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the 19<sup>th</sup> century New York City was a populous municipality, with over 220,000 inhabitants by the 1830s. It was diverse, consisting of both prosperous and impoverished areas. Many buildings were beautifully created with an artistic impression, while others were insignificant and deplorable.  Prince Maximilian of Wied’s chronicled his travels in New York during this time and described the contrast between its beauty and unattractiveness. This proved the strong gap that existed between the wealthy and poor, with both groups calling the city their home. Additionally, it was easily accessible to travelers because of its convenient location on the ocean’s edge. With all its activity and work, in a boisterous setting, immigrants from several areas of the globe, especially Europe, congregated in New York City. Recent immigrants as well as second and third generation natives made up the city’s lower working class. The people adjusted to American urban life, inhabited residences, and took up whatever jobs were available throughout the city.  These circumstances enabled a prevalent, dynamic, and industrious commerce.","With the perception of the American dream in mind, people’s natural ambition was to get money, become successful, and reach happiness in life. What better place to aspire for and live out this dream than New York City?  Immigrants exhibited the strong desire to obtain a good job that paid well and expectations of achieving the American dream. The jobs attainable by the lower working class consisted of industrial and factory work. These were tedious roles that demanded back breaking work and paid minimal wages. Additional occupations like maids and seamstresses were also typical for the lower working class of New York City. The hours entailed in these jobs were long and once again pay was minimal, yet the labor required was arduous and physically demanding. Seamstresses were paid only by the pieces of their work, as opposed to an hourly rate, and this was oftentimes unpredictable. Other jobs for the lower working class included lamplighters, chimney sweepers, and couriers.","Residential circumstances were not always optimum for the lower working class. Greed driven landlords found it unprofitable to rent to that specific type of family. However, there were some landlords that did rent out to working class families. Their property consisted of two-room apartments located in brick buildings, known as tenements. One apartment would get rented out to two separate families, resulting in communal living.  Unfortunately many of them were left to rent in wooden buildings. These variations were typically neglected, rundown and dilapidated because the landlords felt it was inconsequential to repair or replace anything. Their main purpose was to gain as much profit as possible by cramming families into living quarters, and the families had no choice. New York had a shortage of tenements, and it was imperative for the inhabitants to reside within walking distance to their job locations.","Public hygiene conditions were far from sanitary, and with the combination of families residing in cramped living situations, the repercussions were repugnant. Since plumbing had yet to reach the tenements, human waste was kept in large containers, just below outhouses. When the containers would become backed up or storm flooding would occur, human waste would wash into the streets among the other debris and, occasionally, seep into homes. This brought forth exposure to many infectious diseases. This was particularly dire because the medical field was still developing. They were still researching what caused epidemics, while recognizing newer ones brought from overseas.  People were unaware how to prevent and treat these diseases. Consequently, several illnesses ran rampant through the population, including cholera. The proliferation of the population, inadequate transportation and cramped and unsanitary living conditions made lving in the city for the lower working class almost unbearable."],"display_date":1830,"search_date":"1830-07-02","locations":[{"id":8919,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":267,"tag":"Health"},{"id":896,"tag":"Labor"},{"id":598,"tag":"New York"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5227,"title":"The Irish Riot on Saint Patrick’s Day","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-03-17","end_date":"1867-03-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Four leaf clovers adorned the street corners of New York City, soft bagpipes in the background-accompanied fiddles, and the whiskey flowed forth with a seemingly endless supply.

The day we celebrate” signifying that the Irish rejoice in fighting with the police, spilling blood, and drinking rum.","<br />This representation of the Irish is characteristic across the country during this time period and was representative of the views of American Nativists. Nativists were American born citizens who sought to blame the Irish for the poor labor conditions in the United States during the middle and late nineteenth century. Because of the poor conditions for laborers, the unavailability of jobs, and low wages – the simple option was to blame the disparity on the new immigrants. Continually, this attitude towards the Irish was repeated and spread throughout the country – fueling Native anti-catholic, anti-Irish sentiment.","<br /> No single item from Nast’s engraving is grounded in truth. While the Nativists had their own frustration towards the Irish, they placed many more challenges on the immigrants because of their own irrational harassment."," ","[Image] <strong>ttp://tinyurl.com/3v6qj3q</strong>"],"display_date":"March 17, 1867","search_date":"1867-03-17","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":958,"tag":"Irish Immigration"},{"id":957,"tag":"St. Patrick's Day"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5232,"title":"Captain O’Brien Gives Birth to Theatre in Birmingham","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"12/31/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The citizens of Birmingham lived without art. That was until Captain Frank O’Brien, Birmingham, Alabama’s fourteenth mayor, leased the upper floor of a small brick building in the city’s Southside in 1872. It was named Sublett’s Hall in honor of a Confederate Major from Mississippi and was the first theatre in Birmingham. Captain O’Brien is best remembered for his other contribution to the city: O’Brien’s Opera House. Like Sublett’s Hall, O’Brien’s Opera House opened in the upper floors of a brick building. However, the Opera House was built ten years later in the city’s Northside. The theatre’s opening night was a sell-out. On that night, the theatre showed <em>The Black Cook. </em>The Parisian musical had been controversial when it played in New York. Sermons were even preached against it. Opening night was eventful for another reason. The lights would not turn on. Captain O’Brien borrowed headlights from locomotives from the nearby train yard.","In 1899, a New York company, Klaw and Erlanger, leased the theatre for five years for $4000. The story attracted attention because New Yorkers were taking interest in Birmingham’s new theatre life and <em>The New York Times </em>even reported on it. O’Brien’s Opera House attracted large crowds from all parts of the young city until 1900 when the larger and more beautiful Jefferson Theatre opened a few blocks away. The Opera House would reopen in 1906 under different ownership as The Gaiety, a burlesque house. The Gaiety closed in 1912 and was demolished in 1915, but theatre was just beginning to flourish in Birmingham.","According to Don Haarbauer, theatre in Birmingham is unique in the South because the city was founded after the Civil War and therefore has few ties to the society of the “Old South.” The city never had an aristocracy devoted to the arts. Instead, artistic interests were left to the middle class. Haarbauer says that this allowed theatre to thrive in downtown for many years. It started to see its decline, however, with the rise of suburban multiplexes."],"display_date":"1890 - 1910","search_date":"1900-07-02","locations":[{"id":206,"lat":33.553582253,"lng":-86.8959288939,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Alabama"},{"id":8931,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"},{"id":955,"tag":"Theatre"},{"id":579,"tag":"New York City"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5255,"title":"Southern Trees","course_id":67,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/30","end_date":"8/31/40","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["\"Strange Fruit<em>\" </em>is a haunting poem with verses that illustrate in vivid detail a dark facet of Southern life in the United States in the early-mid twentieth century.","“Southern trees bear a strange fruit,<br />Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,<br />Black body swinging in the Southern breeze,<br />Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.","Pastoral scene of the gallant South,<br />The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,<br />Scent of magnolia sweet and fresh,<br />And the sudden smell of burning flesh!","Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck,<br />For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,<br />For the sun to rot, for a tree to drop,<br />Here is a strange and bitter crop.”","Written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish school teacher from New York, \"Strange Fruit\" was inspired by the infamous image of the beaten and lynched bodies of two African American youths in the south, Abram Smith and Thomas Shipp. The men were overtaken by a mob of an estimated 10,000 white southerners who stormed the jail in which they were held. Smith and Shipp, who had been imprisoned under accusations of rape and murder, were dragged from their cells one August night in 1930 violently beaten and ultimately hung by the rabid mob. Meeropol loathed the indiscriminate and unmerited lynchings of African Americans in the South and spoke out against it in this poem. That common hate, for both action and perpetrator would provoke anti-lynching campaigns across The United States, often spear-headed by women. Many of whom who would soon call upon \"Strange Fruit\" to be one of its most recognized anthems. African American Jazz Singer Billie Holiday would take the poem and make it into one of the most infamous Jazz recordings of the time. Enabled initially by the open mindedness of New York neighborhoods, most famously Greenwich Village, integrated establishments like the Café Society allowed the song, \"Strange Fruit,\" to reach a far wider audience then ever thought possible. The simplicity of Meeropol’s words bought to life by Holiday’s signature deep and husky voice epitomizes a pivotal yet overlooked aspect of American Society in the thirties.","Significant numbers of Southern women, in a parallel effort with their northern contemporaries like Meeropol and Holiday, began to take a stance against the very societies of which they were part. Women, who frequently saw the lynching of many African American men, formed groups such as the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching(ASWPL)which advocated for an end to, what was for them, the all too common scenes depicted by Meeropol’s \"Strange Fruit.\" The use of their insider status as Southern women enabled them to actively attack the all too common male fueled misconception that white southern men partook in lynching as an active effort to protect the Southern Bell against men like Shipp and Smith. Women such as those in the ASWPL actively petitioned for the cause not just their own communities but throughout the South. Their goal, to put an end to this twisted illusion of southern chivalry which to them was nothing more then sadistic barbarism, painted pretty for bigoted southern men. Acting with equally as much fervor as Meeropol and Holiday, such examples stand as a testament to how injustice does not adhere to the neatly drawn lines of a map, nor those who fight it defined by where they happen to fall on that map."],"display_date":"August 1930 - August 1940","search_date":"1935-08-16","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"},{"id":22726,"lat":39.7816126185,"lng":-86.1384147396,"zoom":10,"place":"Marion, Indiana"}],"tags":[{"id":999,"tag":"Strange Fruit"},{"id":998,"tag":"Abel Meeropol"},{"id":997,"tag":"Billie Holiday"},{"id":226,"tag":"Southern Women"},{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"},{"id":889,"tag":"Racism"}],"course":{"name":"US History Since 1865","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":67,"school_id":28}},{"id":5258,"title":"<strong>Leary, Metzner, and Alpert Instruct LSD Initiates on How to Achieve</strong> <strong>a Successful “Psychedelic Session”</strong>","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/64","end_date":"12/31/64","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1964, psychologists Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, and Richard Alpert published <em>The Psychedelic Experience</em>, a manual intended to prepare the users of psychedelic drugs for sessions. The authors had researched the therapeutic aspects of psychedelic substances, as well as their religious possibilities. The book is heavily influenced by the <em>Tibetan Book of the Dead</em>, (also known as <em>Bardo Thodol</em>) a funerary text that describes spiritual after-death experiences. The authors’ experiments with LSD and other psychedelics began at Harvard University, until unfavorable representations in the press led to the suspension of the research and, in 1963, the dismissal of Leary and Alpert from their faculty positions at the institution. The authors continued their own research, through observation of others and under the influence of hallucinogenic substances themselves.","The text focused on the use of psychedelics with the intention of achieving spiritual enlightenment. The authors devoted Part 3 of their text to an explanation of how to achieve a beneficial experience through proper preparation for a session, noting proper drugs and dosages as well as the critical importance of an experienced “guide.” A guide was expected to serve as a relaxed, secure, and wise presence to help the “voyager” through their trip, “always ready to help navigate their course, to help them reach their destination.” Also important to a successful session was what Leary frequently referred to as “set and setting.” This idea emphasizes proper mental and physical preparation by participants, as well as a suitable environment for the experience. Most significantly, the authors stated that the manual “prepares the person for a mystical experience according to the Tibetan model,” and instructed participants to delay religious interpretations until the end of the session when they could best benefit the individual spiritually.","A significant proportion of those drawn to Buddhism and other Eastern traditions in the 1960s—like Leary, Metzner, and Alpert—were influenced by the effects of psychoactive substances, and vice versa. Reflecting on psychedelic drug use in the 1960s, scholar Richard Batchelor asserts that “it is all too easy either to dismiss claims of spiritual significance for drugs as thinly veiled justifications for hedonistic indulgence, or to invoke the tragic consequences of heedless excess as grounds for denying the validity of any drug-induced experience at all.” LSD advocates were continually forced to defend the legitimate benefits of its use.","The authors of <em>The Psychedelic Experience</em>, trained in medicine and psychology, were pioneers in the exploration of consciousness and spirituality through the use of psychedelics like LSD. Their research, during the short window of time when LSD was legal, gave some legitimacy to the possibilities of personal and religious development through the use of hallucinogenic drugs. Their work on the spiritual benefits of psychedelics would become even more significant in debates over the use and control of such substances in the late-1960s—debates over one’s right to control their own brain.

Stept. It was a version of the nineteenth-century English folk song <em>\"Long, Long Ago\".</em> Lew Brown and Charles Tobias wrote the lyrics and the song debuted in the 1939 Broadway musical Yokel Boy. It was written as a pledge of loyalty between two young lovers while one of them is away serving in the war.","After the United States entered the war in December 1941, Brown and Tobias modified the lyrics to their current form, with the chorus ending with \"...'till I come marching home\". In February 1942, two months after Pearl Harbor, the Glenn Miller Orchestra recorded the song with vocals by Tex Beneke, Marion Hutton, and The Modernaires. In May the song was featured in the film “<em>Private Buckaroo” </em> as a performance by the Andrews Sisters with the Harry James orchestra.

The crush of pedestrian traffic that gathered on the bridge's promenade deck was anxious to experience what was described as the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\", and no doubt contained shoppers. In the lower left-hand corner of the cover page of this booklet, the figure of a young woman draped in Romanesque robes stands on a pedestal inscribed with the words \"Excelsior\" (meaning <em>ever higher</em>). The commemorative laurel wreath she holds in her left hand is pointed toward the bridge while her right hand holds an unfurled American flag with staff. The young woman appears to cast her gaze out over the harbor where a view of the bridge's expanse can clearly be seen. Engineering genius, workmanship, and size are suggested by the artists' renditions on the front cover of the souvenir booklet and in the fifteen sketches contained inside the official book and program chronicling the <em>Opening Ceremonies of the New York and Brooklyn Bridge</em>. On its cover page are portrait insets of both John A. Roebling (1806-1869), the original engineer (upper left-hand corner) and his son, Washington (1837-1926), the current Chief Engineer for the project (lower right-hand corner). The front-cover acknowledgement of their role in the achievement is heralded by a cherub that playfully frolics between their portraiture in the shadow of the bridge's massive span.","While the booklet and book/ program were produced to commemorate the bridge's official opening, cumulatively these artists' renditions appropriately exalt American know-how, excellence, and spirit of determination in the dawning decades of the Second Industrial Revolution. The economic promise of this 17-year engineering marvel was touted by a litany of regional political and religious dignitaries as throngs of promenade onlookers followed the 41 pages of proceedings and drawings. However, the general public deferred their judgment and celebration. Quite possibly, because thousands watched the fireworks after the proceedings that day from within less than a mile of the multimillion-dollar bridge. They watched from decaying slums where New York's immigrants lived in abject poverty. When viewed from the center promenade area of the bridge, the slums may have taken on the ambience of the peaceful horizon; however, one would beg a closer look.","Under the bridge expanse, a busy harbor gorged with sailing vessels can be seen. Many, no doubt, are on their way to New York City's busy piers and waiting stevedores, their cargo holds brimming with building supplies, produce, dry goods, and other merchandise. Soon, efficient access to the bridge would accommodate their cargo via its freight rails ? fueling consumerism. The advent of increased commerce would add momentum to the rate of growth of merchandising and other business activities in New York and across the nation. Like Loeser, business owners had stakes in the new bridge. It is indeed suitable that a female portrayed the figure on the souvenir booklet, since she typified the nation's primary consumer. The official book/program provides insight into the pomp and circumstance of the event, which was heralded by a full complement of fireworks, music, and speeches. A popular pastime from opening day, a stroll on the promenade deck of the bridge was such an attraction that one week after its opening, confusion within an exceptionally large crowd ended with the deaths of twelve people. After a formal inquiry, modifications were made expediently to the narrow stairwells leading to the promenade entrances and egress.

Written in 1918, Clarke clearly explains that she plans, with this publication, to “permanently record the greatest massed effort of women the world has ever known” [1]. It is clear that Clarke feels that these great women go under-appreciated, hence why she published this document. Clarke’s target audience for the publication is women. She seeks to encourage women in their future endeavors by describing the great successes of women during the first World War. Her goal is to bring well-deserved attention to the efforts of women during the war.","Clarke begins by discussing the creation of the Woman’s Committee, a useful tool that gathered together groups of women across many states in mutual cooperation [2]. The Committee was so well-organized that it began to acquire sub-divisions such as Child Welfare and Home and Foreign Relief. The women of this Committee delivered valuable lectures about food conservation and also gave their time to help with the Red Cross. Although the Red Cross work was very helpful to the sailors during this time, women during the war also volunteered at home by overseeing playgrounds, parks and other various charities [3]. Clarke also goes on to describe that these women did their patriotic duty by nearly solving the problems of food conservation and food production during the time of the war.","Although there are many triumphs discussed in American Women and the World War, women also faced several injustices. While women were able to enlist in the US Navy during World War I, they had to settle for typically “female” work. This work would include nursing and telephone operating. The women were also denied an auxiliary corps, as per the War Department. Along with the war ending also concluded any hopes of women enlisting in the US Army [5].","While women during World War I faced many ups and downs, one can say that their efforts were eventually recognized. Popular belief holds that women were recognized because they had truly proved themselves during the war [6]. Undoubtedly, the women’s war efforts also helped lead to their gaining the right to vote in 1920 with the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment.","In conclusion, Ida Clarke successfully achieved her goal in proving the heroism and patriotism of American women in American Women and the World War. Women finally were given the chance to prove themselves as the everyday heroes that they were, at home and during the war. By doing so, they continued their legacy of equal rights and eventually gained the right to vote."," "," ","<sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup> Ida Clyde Gallagher Clarke, <em>American Women and the World War</em> (New York: D.

To do so, they needed to relocate to areas that were less populated than the North. Despite their admiration for South Carolina’s “lands and climate,” northerners feared living in the state, because of the potential violence. During this time, South Carolina began enacting black codes to restrict the freedoms and movements of freedmen. Northerners believed it to be only a matter of time until blacks started protesting the laws. While other states in the South enacted similar codes, these northerners thought South Carolina’s to be the harshest. Because of this, they chose to settle in the northwest rather than the South.","White residents of South Carolina did not believe the state had a lack of migrants due to the black codes. Instead, they expressed the opinion that white northerners were apprehensive to live among such a large number of free blacks. A writer for the <em>Nashville Press </em>article vehemently denounced this claim. “It is not true white immigrants will not go where there are negro laborers, or where there is negro competition. The sole condition of immigration is embraced in the word security.”","For these settlers, the number one concern was safety. They believed that as long as the codes were in effect, security could never exist in the state. Settlers, or emigrants, were not the ones negatively affected by the codes. They found suitable land for their intended purposes in other parts of the country. The people who the codes hurt, the article argued, were the residents of South Carolina. As long as the black codes were in place, immigration would not occur. If the codes were abolished, there would be “unprecedented progress of the South” as a result of new settlement.","South Carolina began passing black codes immediately following the war. The state ratified a constitution in 1865 that forbade blacks from voting. In order to prevent blacks from combating the laws, South Carolina set up racial restrictions for entering office. This way, no black person could enter South Carolina’s legislature and attempt to do away with the codes.","Besides preventing blacks to enter political office, the black codes in South Carolina stopped freedmen from becoming an “artisan, mechanic, or shopkeeper” without the proper license from a judge. This license cost more than $100, making it unlikely a free black could afford one. Perhaps the most restrictive of all parts of the codes, was the section that limited black migration to the state. If a black person moved to South Carolina, he or she was required within twenty days to enter into a contract and bond to a white master."],"display_date":"December 8, 1865","search_date":"1865-12-08","locations":[{"id":11457,"lat":32.8753704415,"lng":-79.8417496964,"zoom":8,"place":"CHARLESTON, South Carolina"},{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":366,"tag":"Migration"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":477,"tag":"Black Codes"},{"id":719,"tag":"South Carolina"},{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5364,"title":"State of Liberty and Immigrants: First Days","course_id":76,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-01-01","end_date":"1886-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Statue of Liberty is an icon of today, just as it was for immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th Century.  The inauguration of the Statue of LIberty took place on Thursday, October 23, 1886.  The day started with a military, naval and civil parade in New York City.  After the parade, a signal was given for steamers in the bay to move in a particular and pre-calculated order towards the island.  There were certain ceremonies that took place at the base of the statue, which concluded around sunset that day.  To conclude the day's festivities, there was a national salute from all batteries, both on and offshore.  Finally, the statue was illuminated, for all of the citizens to see."," ","The Statue of Liberty would be the first thing an immigrant sees when approaching the American coast.  The immigrants would arrive on ships, which needed to be checked by health officers before being allowed further into the bay.  The immigrants were then moved to a barge for further examinations by United States authorities.  These immigrants were divided into groups of 30.  Each group was tagged or numbered, to distinguish the different groups.  These groups moved onto examination rooms, where each immigrant would be checked for diseases and physical defects.  Those immigrants who were found to have diseases or physical defects were detained.  Examiners had lists, which were organized by groups, where each group told their name and how much money they had, in addition to whatever else the examiner wanted to know.  The immigrants without funds, friends or prospective homes were deemed \"undesirable\" and were marked as such."],"display_date":1886,"search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1170,"tag":"Statue of Liberty"},{"id":759,"tag":"Immigrants"}],"course":{"name":"ENGL 305: Literary History and Writing","school":"St. Norbert College","course_id":76,"school_id":44}},{"id":5368,"title":"American Women’s Social Status in 1800’s","course_id":80,"status":"P","start_date":"1883-01-01","end_date":"1883-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Emily Faithfull, an English women right’s activist and writer, discovered an interesting phenomenon during her trips to the United States in 1872 and 1882. Many middle class and upper class women she met were leading a harsh life after losing their fathers or husbands. In two cases, the daughter of a navy Commander and the wife of a General of the United States Army were not able to make a living after the death of their father and husband, respectively. These two cases were only the tip of the iceberg: many upper and middle class women also suffered when their kinsmen dead, lost the ability to work or became unemployed. Even though most of them were willing to take up jobs to improve their living conditions; unfortunately, they did not have the ability to do so. Faithfull discovered that this was due to the “short-sighted policy” in many American families that females did not need to work as they would be married have no necessity to do so (Faithfull, p.281, 282). This illustrated that in the early history of the United States, women were mostly being nurtured in a “green house” and being considered as dependents of the male family members.","The above story reflected the passive role of women in early American society. At that time, women were expected to stay home and take care of the family and housework instead of taking up jobs. According to Faithfull, in 1836 there were only seven occupations opened to women. Although some women had a chance to take up jobs, they had to face low pay. In Vermont, the average salaries of male teachers was 20 dollars a month and 1600 dollars a year. But female teachers only received 8 dollars per month and 750 dollars per year because of tradition and prejudice.

Flappers, jazz, and speakeasies were cultural fixtures of this period. There was a shift in social norms that brought with it a new sense of freedom and a different idea of what the modern world should be. One aspect of this time-period which is often overlooked is the emergence of cigarettes as a social staple. Brands like Camel and Lucky Strike were able to change public perceptions of smoking. In the past women smoking in public was seen as faux pas. Additionally, cigarettes were seen as feminine so men often stuck to cigars or chewing tobacco. A man named Edward Bernays changed all that.","Edward Bernays is often referred to as the father of public relations as well as the master of spin. He was famously commissioned by Lucky Strike cigarettes to make the brand more appealing to women. Bernays was nothing if not clever; he conducted research showing that most women wouldn’t buy Luckies because the green packaging clashed with their clothing. Bernays teamed up with Barney’s of New York to make green a staple in the fashion world. The now infamous “green campaign” was extremely successful. The shop windows up and down Fifth Avenue featured green suits, dresses, and evening gowns. Women across the country wore green from head to toe. Luckies sales grew exponentially and eventually surpassed the powerhouse that was Camel.","In an effort to keep Lucky Strike at the top Bernays turned to the advertising experts on Madison Avenue. He used a plethora of famous faces as well as testimonials from “experts” to ensure that Lucky Strike would become a household name nationwide. Posters, magazine ads, and radio spots rebranded smoking as something that was chic and cool for both men and women. One of his most famous advertisements features an interview with actress Delores Del Rio standing in a green and white gown while smoking a Lucky Strike. Del Rio was the embodiment of this new breed of woman. She was strong and confident while also being glamorous and seductive. Bernays selected Del Rio because men wanted her and women wanted to be her. Her poise and sex appeal made her the perfect representative for a product that was meant to be chic and sexy. Her intensely alluring gaze had the ability to captivate you… while selling you a Lucky Strike."],"display_date":1920,"search_date":"1920-07-01","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1252,"tag":"Del Rio"},{"id":1251,"tag":"green campign"},{"id":1250,"tag":"Father of Public Relation"},{"id":1249,"tag":"Barney's"},{"id":1248,"tag":"Edward Bernays"},{"id":1247,"tag":"Smoking"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":77,"school_id":10}},{"id":5412,"title":"Macy’s: The Temple of Retail","course_id":77,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-01-01","end_date":"1876-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During medieval times villiages were often centered around one building, the cathedral. These places of worship were the hub of not only religion, but community, politics, and commerce as well. Palaces like the Notre Dame cathedral served as the heart and soul of the town and its people. In modern times, the center of commerce and congregation has shifted far away from the church and landed on the temples of retail, the department store. Much like the church did in medieval times the department store offers people living in modern villages the chance to gather together, connect, and socialize with people from their community. One of the best examples of this can be seen in the landmark that is Macy’s. Macy’s of New York first opened its doors on October 28, 1858. This iconic New York landmark serves as not only a department store but a tourist attraction as well. Like their famous advertisement says, “If you haven’t seen Macy’s, you haven’t seen New York.”","Historians like Vincent Miller argue that retail is the new religion of the modern age. People go to their local temple and worship the gods that are wealth, status, and luxury. They claim that socioeconomic status has become the new measure of a person in Western society. Some go as far as to say that people have become walking billboards for various brands by sporting logos and trademarks on everything from their shirt to their shoes. Department stores and other various retail outlets have been vilified for everything from sales practices to profit margins.","In his book, <em>The Practice of Everyday, Life</em> the French author Michel de Certeau poses a very different argument. He suggests that the “ordinary man” is the one who is in control. Certeau uses the poetic example of maps and walking down a city street. A city, like New York, finds its heartbeat in its inhabitants. While walking down the street all of the sights, sounds, and smells you encounter are completely subjective. This is also true for a walk through a department store like Macy’s. He goes on to say that maps exist as a way for people to pin down a cityscape, a feat that can never really be accomplished because it is composed of the people who are ever changing. Certeau argues that executives, leaders, and even academics are disconnected from the city by their offices that are high above the rest of the world. Therefore, they are virtually powerless over the public who use various tactics like alteration and mobility to process the world around them in a unique and unknowable way.","In either case, Macy’s has managed to become and remain an iconic American institution for over 150 years.

Located in the heart of Manhattan, Macy’s flagship store has been attracting shoppers and tourists alike for over 150 years.","Macy’s, like many department stores, is a major destination during the holiday season. Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade as well as the Christmas shopping rush have become just as ingrained in American culture as the store itself. A famous article appeared in the December 1948 edition of <em>Life</em> that offered a glimpse into the world of Macy’s. This article details the massive shopping frenzy that occurs between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve. An average of 250,000 shoppers flooded the store every day looking for everything form pearls and fur to imported foods and wine. A team of 14,000 employees worked feverishly from opening to close selling roughly one million dollars worth of merchandise per day. This was an astronomical figure at the time especially when you consider that Macy’s was a cash and carry store during this period.","The popularity of the department store is something that exploded during the post World War II era. This was the time when the economy was on the rise and the very fabric of shopping changed. Larger retailers like Macy’s were expanding and becoming increasingly popular. The United States began to move away form small mom and pop shops and towards larger chain stores.

This is what many like the writer below quested to experience and understand.  Stephen Graham, a British traveller, walked about New York City and stopped to converse with an American man in a club. The man opened Graham’s eyes to the American mentality when Graham asked if it was embarrassing to take such great risks such as death and disease all for the sake of expansion of the city. The man replied: \"You play chess?\" said he, laughing. \"That's it exactly. He did not care to sacrifice pieces; he was entirely on the defensive in his chess, eh? And in life he would be the same, hoarding his pennies and his dollars, and economizing and saving. That's just how the American is different. He doesn't mind taking great risks; he is playing the large game, sacrificing small things, hurrying on, building, destroying, building again, conquering, dreaming. We are always selling out and re-investing. You are concentrating on yourselves as you are; we want to leave our old bodies and conditions behind and jump to a new humanity.\" This American, as opposed to Graham, did not save and count on every event to be safe. Rather, he took pride and joy in knowing that he was taking risks. The Americans as this man saw it were not afraid to fantasize about bigger and better things. Once they thought up something they wanted, they pursued it without fail until their desires were realized. The Americans were neither complacent nor fearful. They celebrated the trials and tribulations of normal men and realized that things may be less than ideal at times.","For many, the journey to America consisted of working in factories to procure better lives for themselves and their families.  \"In the period between 1866 and 1900, over 13 million immigrants entered the United States...Most immigrants left their homes seeking jobs and better financial opportunities in the United States. Some, like the Jews in Russia and Poland, left because of religious or political oppression. Most arrived with little money and no professional skills. Many immigrants were young males who intended to stay in the country only long enough to earn some money and then return home—and, in fact, many did return. Others settled permanently in the United States and saved money to pay for their loved ones to join them.\"  Thus we see that people came to the United States to work.

In May 1849, in his small New York cottage, he wrote what was to be his last completed poem, “Annabel Lee,” in which he returned to the themes that had haunted him for much of his life. The poem, set long ago in a kingdom by the sea, describes the speaker’s undying love for the beautiful Annabel Lee. Despite their youth, they share a “love that was more than love,” a love so powerful that envious angels send an unnamed illness to shatter their happiness. Though she dies, his love for her endures, and even years after her death “the moon never beams without bringing me dreams / Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.” He is drawn each night to her \"sepulchre...by the sea,\" where he lies down to sleep beside her lifeless body. Having lived only for her, his life without her is bereft of purpose. Now, he yearns only for death, to return forever to the happiness they shared so briefly in this world.","The rhythm of repeated words and phrases creates a haunting, mournful melody that mirrors the speaker’s mood. Even the poem’s meter, scholars argue, was structured to echo the very ebb and flow of the sea to which the speaker is drawn. Again and again, in “Annabel Lee,” “The Raven,” “Lenore,” and “To Helen,” Poe returned to what he called “the most poetic topic in the world—” the death of a beautiful woman. Indeed, love and death drove much of Poe’s writing, reflecting a life defined by tragedy. Abandoned by his father, orphaned as an infant, he found happiness in his marriage to his young cousin Virginia—only to watch her slowly waste away from tuberculosis. “Annabel Lee,” written two years after her death, was Poe's attempt to give words to the love and sorrow that still consumed him.","This obsession with death typified Victorian culture, which responded to the disease-defined realities of the nineteenth century by blending Christian and classical understandings of death. They infused death with beauty and redemptive power, transforming it into a work of art capable of giving meaning to one’s entire life. A “good death” was one in which the individual embraced their own mortality with hope and acceptance. Death was spiritualized as focus shifted from the dying, decaying body toward the soul. Their vision of heaven was of a physical, material place, a place of natural and artistic beauty where they would be reunited with those they love. Heaven was, as Mark Schantz argues, “a tabula rosa upon which Americans could inscribe their most profound hopes and aspirations.”","Americans blurred the boundary between heaven and earth, as if a breath of poetry—as if the power and passion of one’s love—was enough to reach those they had lost. In “Annabel Lee,” Poe describes such a love—a love that literally triumphs over the forces of heaven and earth, a love that haunts the living and that transcends death itself. It is the anguished cry of a man giving voice not only to his own pain but to the entire cultural climate of his age."],"display_date":"May 1849","search_date":"1849-05-16","locations":[{"id":8921,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":724,"tag":"Cult of Death"},{"id":1312,"tag":"Disease"},{"id":536,"tag":"Poetry"},{"id":1317,"tag":"Edgar Allan Poe"},{"id":1318,"tag":"Annabel Lee"},{"id":1319,"tag":"tuberculosis"},{"id":1320,"tag":"love"}],"course":{"name":"Nineteenth Century Urban Epidemics","school":"Furman University","course_id":82,"school_id":4}},{"id":5447,"title":"Cholera and boosterism in New York and Chicago","course_id":82,"status":"P","start_date":"1866-01-01","end_date":"1866-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Disease epidemics of the mid to late nineteenth century caused an immense amount of fear among everyone and further led to the rivalry and boosterism prevalent between New York City and Chicago during the 1866 cholera epidemic. On August 29, 1866, <em>The Chicago Tribune</em> reported that cholera deaths in New York were at a standstill, and reports extensively from an article from <em>The New York World</em> that “not a single case occurred in the hotel,” and business on the streets and cleaner parts was “free from disease.” Transmission and prevention measures were also being taken to ensure that disease rates were controlled, which was quite the opposite for Chicagoans. There were reports that cholera in Chicago was caused by fall trade, lack of precautionary measures, not having a grasp on the sanitary aspect of the disease. Reports continued to bash the residents of these Western cities (Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Memphis), claiming that it was “their fault” for not taking precaution even after being warned about the preventive measures of the disease and its deadliness. Aside from only a “few dozen” cholera deaths, however, the overall health and cleanliness of New York was excellent.","About 12 years prior to the 1866 cholera epidemic, John Snow found that cholera was a direct effect of the lack of sanitation within the city. The broad street pump in London was contaminated with feces and led to the cholera epidemic that ravaged the city. Snow discovered this after removing the handle on the pump, which prevented further use of it. After doing this, there was a sharp decline in and then no more cholera deaths at that time. With this information during the epidemic of cholera in New York and Chicago, both cities were aware of the cause. However, blame was placed on the immigrant population or a person’s predisposition for the disease, possibly in an effort to reduce fear, sustain commerce, and encourage tourism.","The <em>Chicago Tribune</em> further reports, however, that the cholera epidemic was actually quite different in Chicago than the New Yorkers made it seem. The city of Chicago was in reality, ahead of New York City in terms of municipal cleanliness and overall health of the area. Unlike New York, Chicago did not have “those cellars two stories below which breed pestilence” nor “those crowded courts and miserable masses of tenement houses,” which is where cholera often thrived. Due to apparent overcrowding in New York, cleaning the city and escaping the fate of cholera was actually impossible for them. Reporters claimed that New Yorkers knew this to be true, and slandered Chicago in an effort to maintain business and get rid of the guilt they had from misrepresenting their disease data. Furthermore, Chicago’s grasp on reporting deaths from cholera seemed to be better in terms of value and accuracy then that of New York, in their effort to provide the most information about the progression of disease in their city. New Yorkers, however, were negligent in this regard because they did not bother to report accurate numbers. If anyone were to travel to New York, they would actually find the death toll from cholera to be extremely high. To make cholera appear less brutal, however, it was sometimes referred to in reports about disease in Chicago as “Cholera-morbus,” which was less rapid and less severe symptomatically, but equally as fatal.","There is no doubt that disease during 1866 epidemic brought about fear and panic, and there is no wonder why those individuals responsible for reporting wanted to make their city seem like they had better concept of disease and more control over the prevention and spread of cholera."],"display_date":1866,"search_date":"1866-07-02","locations":[{"id":8925,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"},{"id":2539,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"COOK, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":1322,"tag":"disease in the north"},{"id":827,"tag":"Chicago"},{"id":579,"tag":"New York City"},{"id":1315,"tag":"cholera"},{"id":1323,"tag":"rivalry"}],"course":{"name":"Nineteenth Century Urban Epidemics","school":"Furman University","course_id":82,"school_id":4}},{"id":5453,"title":"American Food Rations in the World War II Era","course_id":86,"status":"P","start_date":"1/14/42","end_date":"11/29/48","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<br /> World War II brought industrialized nations into combat with one another on an unprecedented scale, and to keep the people of a nation willing to fight, it was important to keep a steady supply of food and munitions coming to its soldiers. More importantly, the morale and efficiency of troops was dependant on the fact that these food and munitions were particularly good. For this reason, the food rations provided to American soldiers were specifically monitored by the Army Medical Corps in an attempt to ensure their superiority over the supplies of the German or Japanese troops. The significant resource cost of the war made it difficult to ensure a fresh supply of food and beverages was getting to the front line or being available to the workers back at home. According to the US Army, American soldiers consumed about nine million pounds of food daily. This meant that a considerable amount of food had to be brought to the battlefront which would be nutrient rich, in eatable condition, and available quickly. The American soldier's ration was made up of easily mass produced, canned, and shipped goods such as beans, packaged meats and vegetables, soluble fruit drinks, chewing gum, and cigarettes.","Though the American soldier's rations were processed and not freshly made, the availability of genuine, vitamin-rich food should not be taken lightly. The Germans and Italians, by comparison, had trouble supporting their troops and munitions workers with food in the same way. The production capacity of the United States was colossal and was not subject to the same stipulations as some of the European powers. The Germans were largely dependent on domestic food resources which, while enough to survive on, could not provide both soldiers and munitions workers with enough nutrients to remain at full efficiency. As a result, the Germans suffered a loss in the supply of food and munitions due to worker malnourishment while the Americans were able to provide for the Allies.  Winston Churchill is even quoted as having said \"We have won the war!\" after hearing of the attacks on Pearl Harbor, knowing well the industrial power of the United States.  During war time, the importance of efficiency and support of the home front should not be underestimated, and it is without a doubt that well-fed and nourished soldiers and workers have a distinct advantage over their malnourished counterparts. People under the Axis often had to eat substitute \"sawdust\" food and rely on foods which engineered specifically for mere survival, and this was a clear advantage that the United States brought to the Allies.","The importance of steady and healthy food supplies was not lost on the United States, and the great economic advantage of the nation has always been something which could be exploited. After World War II, the Medical Corps continued to improve the supplies received by American soldiers, upgrading the synthetic food drinks of wartime into instant coffee, and providing a wider variety of meat as well as pastas and treats such as cookies to the troops.  Well nourished troops are very important to a war effort, and there is no doubt that the superior food rations of the Allied troops, particularly those of the United States, helped in part to ensure victory over the Axis. <br /><br /> <br />Works Cited: <br /><br />Merriman, John M.

Unfortunately, in spite of the three attempts for an anti-lynching bill that successfully passed through the House of Representatives, it continued to fail in the Senate. Lynching was protected under the Constitution as it protected the right of local government to control crime thus giving them freedom from interference or scrutiny.","The early twentieth century was the era of ‘The Declaration of Principles,’ a call to “restoring to ‘blacks’ the right to vote, an end to racial segregation, and complete equality in economic and educational opportunity”  created under the leadership of W.E.B. Du Bois, being adopted in 1905. Yet, as African Americans began to show assertiveness and independence, racial tensions were amplified and whites reacted in violence, in order to maintain their white supremacy.  Horrifically, more than 5,000 African Americans were lynched by white mobs between 1882 and 1932, with the express purpose being to “terrify ‘Negroes’ as to dissuade them from ever asserting themselves or their rights.” Incredibly, the lack of concern over the murder of thousands of African Americans was because whites believed that their lives were cheap and “inherently and permanently inferior,” to the point of being as low in value as animals. In fact, lynchings were committed by respected and regular citizens and celebrated as social events attended by families. The real horror about this period in American history is that, regrettably, racism would continue to raise its ugly head for three more decades before many of the African Americans dreams for true freedom and equality would begin to be realized through the crusades led by Martin Luther King, Jr.  <br /><br />"],"display_date":"July 11, 1930","search_date":"1930-07-11","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":367,"tag":"Lynching"}],"course":{"name":"US History since the Civil War","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":86,"school_id":28}},{"id":5465,"title":"Potential Danger for Prohibition","course_id":84,"status":"P","start_date":"1/31/20","end_date":"1/31/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1920 Linton Smith, also known as the Bishop of Hereford, wrote a controversial article on the Temperance Movement and Prohibition. Linton claimed that prohibition could possibly divide political parties on a, “Sex basis,\" meaning that female prohibition proponents could vote as a block against male opponents of prohibition.<br /> <br /> Strong drink was very popular in the lives of men during the time. In this time men were turning to alcohol because of work conditions, social, and sanitary reasons. In most cases this would affect the home life and relationship between husband and wife.  Because of the large amounts consumed men would become violent with their wives or spend all their income on alcohol rather than providing things needed for their family. Tension was rising between both men and women because of alcohol.<br /> <br />During the mid 1800’s to the early 1900’s women played a dominant role in the Temperance Movement and Prohibition. By 1892 the Women’s Christian Temperance Union, the largest temperance union at the time, had nearly 150,000 members. Historian Ruth Bordin writes that, “Through the WCTU, women became visible as leaders in communities and cities from coast to coast” (Bordin 157). Not only was the WCTU the largest temperance movement, but also the largest women’s organization in America. Because of the growing number of followers, the union began to respond not only to temperance but larger issues they were facing, such as women’s suffrage. Bordin also writes, “Through the Union women learned of their legal and social disabilities, gained confidence in their strengths and talents, and became certain of their political power as a group and as individuals” (Bordin 157). The Union allowed for women to push the envelope and fight for their rights, one of those rights being the right to vote. This right was given to women in 1920 with the passing of the 19th Amendment.<br /> <br />It is for reasons like this that Smith wrote the article on the danger of Prohibition and the Temperance Movement. Women were already aligned, in large numbers, with the WCTU and would vote for Prohibition. Smith felt as though the passing of this law would cause tension between the two sexes and split the political parties based on this one idea. He writes that, “The law will certainly be passed, if it is passed at all, by women for men, and it will be resented the more for that reason”."],"display_date":"January 31, 1920","search_date":"1920-01-31","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":644,"tag":"woman's suffrage"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":84,"school_id":10}},{"id":5484,"title":"Excellent Progress on the New York Subway","course_id":85,"status":"P","start_date":"9/27/02","end_date":"10/28/04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","On September 27, 1902 the <em>Scientific American</em> highlighted the development of the first New York City subway. The monthly <em>Scientific American</em> magazine, which focused on scientific discoveries and technological innovations around the world, detailed the progress of the subway through the use of various diagrams and articles.  The New York Subway was well underway during the publication of the article and was scheduled to be completed ahead of its previous publicized date. The newly created transportation network would be utilized to further stimulate the economic, social, and transportation needs of New York City’s residents."," ","Subway systems were integral in the economic development of New York City. The subway system allowed citizens to continue to expand outward from the densely settled area around Manhattan and Brooklyn and thrive by allowing traditionally geographically disadvantaged citizens to travel further from their homes. This allowed many citizens to have a greater sense of freedom and a broader social and economical reach. The availability of new forms of transit allowed these individuals to get to their destinations cheaper and more efficiently without sole reliance on elevated commuter railroads or horse drawn forms of transportation. The construction of the New York Subway facilitated the creation of many new jobs and a consistent supply of work by linking many different businesses with customers that were previously inaccessible and allowing both parties to benefit from its usage."," ","The creation of the New York Subway system was a great engineering achievement in the early 1900s. The <em>Scientific American</em> article stated the project required the excavation of over 1,700,000 cubic yards of earth and the employment of over 65,000 tons of steel in its construction.  One of the biggest concerns with a project of this magnitude was allowing other transportation systems to operate without disruption during construction. Much of the modern infrastructure of New York City was already in place and it was of great concern to leave it undisturbed. It was necessary to relocate gas, water, and electric lines while excavating the tunnels and connecting the underground network. While removing the millions of yards of debris, it was of great importance to maintain the structural integrity of the tunnel. Tunnels were dug using a method known as \"Cut and Cover\". Through this method, one side of the street was excavated to a depth of at least 30 feet, the subway tunnel was constructed, and eventually it was covered upon completion. In contrast to previously constructed shallow subway tunnels, the New York City Subway tunnels were supported in all directions by concrete walls and utilized a network of steel beams and waterproofing. This structural composure added many different benefits to the subway system. In cases when it was necessary to excavate both sides of a street simultaneously, support bridges and trestles were erected to maintain street access for ground transportation. Engineers used these systems to minimize any detrimental effects above the surface while they continued to further expand the New York subway system belowground."," ","Many of the building supplies that were designated to be used in the production of the New York Subway were shared with above-ground transportation systems. The materials used for the subway tracks were adopted from the above-ground trolleys. While the availability of trolley tracks was a benefit, it also facilitated the need to develop new solutions in regards to powering the tracks. Engineers carefully worked to retrofit the trolley tracks and modify the foundation the tracks were laid on to facilitate the delivery of electricity to the subway line."," ","Upon the first day of its completion, over 150,000 eager riders rode the New York subway system according to an article in the<em> New York Times </em>dated October 28, 1904. The first train arrived at One Hundred and Forty-Fifth Street from City Hall Park in exactly twenty six minutes and the reality of rapid transit was realized by many New Yorkers. The articles in <em>Scientific American</em> and <em>The New York Times </em>did an exceptional job stirring public interest for the new transportation system. These articles placed an emphasis on the many attractive features that the New York Subway had to offer and highlighted the many different architectural and engineering achievements. The<em> New York Times </em>article had a broader focus and placed a lesser emphasis on the intricate construction process of the system.    In contrast, The <em>Scientific American</em> article focused primarily on building details and engineering aspects of the project and was intended for readers with a scientific interest in the project."],"display_date":"September 27, 1902 - October 28, 1904","search_date":"1903-10-13","locations":[{"id":49747,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"},{"id":598,"tag":"New York"},{"id":1364,"tag":"Subway"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":85,"school_id":43}},{"id":5574,"title":"<strong>The Fight of Ultimate Rivals</strong>","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"3/8/71","end_date":"3/8/71","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The night of March 8, 1971 is one that will never be forgotten in sports history. This was the night of an international sports spectacle. This was the night that Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier attempted to settle the controversy over the world heavyweight boxing championship at Madison Square Garden. Never before had a boxing match meant so much, cost so much, viewed so much, or edged out the My Lai massacre trial off of so many front pages. The night of March 8, 1971 marked “The Fight of the Century” between the ultimate rivals; “the bull” and “the bee”, however, every American felt like they were right in the ring with them due to the social implications that went beyond the arena.","At first glance, Ali and Frazier seemed like strikingly similar public figures. Both were undefeated professional heavyweight champions; Ali with twenty-five knockouts in thirty-one straight wins, Frazier with twenty-three knockouts in twenty-six consecutive victories. They each were guaranteed the same pay day of two and a half million dollars and would be watched by the same three hundred million viewers during these ultimate showdown. Along with that, both were also Olympic Gold Medal champions; Ali in 1960 and Frazier in 1964. Both these uncontested champions also were prominent African Americans during a the height of the Civil Rights Movement when fighting took to the streets while they were fighting in the ring for millions of dollars a knockout.[1]  Despite all these similarities, however, Ali and Frazier had been on a collision course since 1967, when Ali was stripped of his title while Frazier was approaching the stature of a contender. In 1970, Frazier earned world recognition as Ali’s successor as champion by stopping Jimmy Ellis, who was once Ali’s sparring partner.[2]","Adding to this infamous rivalry was the fact that Ali and Frazier represented the two different sides of America at the time. Ali had been born Cassius Clay and changed his name to Muhammad Ali upon his conversion to the Black Muslim Faith. This was the same religion that was tied to the militant Civil Rights group; the Black Panthers.[3] Then, in 1966, he avoided the draft by failing his mental exam and became a Muslim “minister” in order to claim a clerical exemption. After he would state, “I ain’t got no quarrel with those Viet Congs.”[4]  A year later, he was then convicted of draft evasion. This caused the WBA to then strip him of his title, clearing the way for Frazier to take his place.  Both of these sentiments, being a black Muslim and speaking out against the war at a time both of these issues were reaching a breaking point due to violent protests on both issues throughout the country, caused him to represent the anti-establishment movement and counterculture.","While Ali during came to symbolize the image of the counterculture; Frazier became to embody the other-half of America the “good citizens”, while also being dubbed the white man’s champ, mostly due to trash talking from Ali. Frazier, was a Baptist whose mother was “a real church-goin’ lady” who taught him “respectfulness”, standing in deep contrast to the militant Black Muslim religion that Ali spoke vocally towards.[5]  In the months leading up to the fight, Ali would also yell fighting words in Frazier’s direction, calling him names like “Uncle Tom”, leading Ali to represent more and more of the Civil Rights Movement even when Frazier tried to counteract these claims. In contrast to Ali’s views of the Vietnam War, Frazier again stood with contrasting views and became a symbol of the conservative, pro-war movement. In his autobiography, Frazier said that the only reason why he did not fight in the war was because he was a father, but that he would have fought if he were drafted because his country had been so good to him.[6] Clearly, going into this supposed, “Fight of the Century”, it was a fight between to seemingly similar, yet vastly different champions; with the liberal anti-establishment counterculture on one side, and the conservative and traditional rule followers on the other. This was a showdown that everyone in America felt a part of.","By the time it was finally the night of the match, Madison Square Garden had a circus-like atmosphere that was fit for the occasion. Scores of policemen tried to control the crowd of outrageously dressed fans as countless celebrities, from Woody Allen to Frank Sinatra, sat among the masses.[7] The fight itself exceeded even in its massive promotional hype and went the full fifteen round championship distance. Ali dominated the first three rounds, however, Frazier began to dominate in the fourth rounds. Despite continuous pinning to the rope and massive body blows, Ali’s speed and combinations kept him on roughly even terms with Frazier and the fight remained very close until late in round eleven. At the end of round fourteen Frazier had held a lead on the three scorecards while giving Ali a brutal beating. Then, early in the final round, Frazier landed a spectacular left hook that put Ali on his back. Ali, his right jaw swollen grotesquely, got up from the blow quickly, but it would be too little too late.","On March 8, 1971, in the “Fight of the Century” at Madison Square Garden had ended. Frazier won by a unanimous decision. Ali lost. The Garden sizzled. The unbeaten Frazier officially handed Ali the first defeat of his pro career, and secured his own title as world champion.[8] Despite this, the rivalry between Ali and Frazier, along the fight of the morals and the people that each represented, still had decades before its final call."," ","[1] Mike Sielski, \"Frazier battled Ali in timeless trilogy,\" (ESPN Classic, 2012).","[2] Thomas George, \"Fight of the Century: Muhammad Ali's Legacy Grows in Defeat,\" (AOL News, 2011).","[3] David Horowitz and Peter Carroll, <em>On the Edge: The United States Since 1945</em>, (Belmont: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2002).","[4] Stan Wilson, \"Muhammad Ali returns to the Olympic stage, once again, in London,\" (CNN, 2012).","[5] Sielski, \"Frazier battled Ali.”","[6] Ibid.","[7] Victor Navasky, “All Our Conflicts On Violence, Sex, Race And Money: The Fight,”(<em>The</em><em> New York Times</em>, March 14, 1971).","[8] Ibid."],"display_date":"March 8, 1971","search_date":"1971-03-08","locations":[{"id":36051,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":239,"tag":"Boxing"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5585,"title":"Morality and Birth Control- What Every Woman Should Know","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"2/1/18","end_date":"2/28/18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","<em>Morality and Birth Control </em>by Margaret Sanger is a pamphlet written in 1918 questioning the morality of denying the knowledge of birth control to working class women. She compares the lack of education given to women at that time to the “shackles of slavery.” Sanger believes that birth control is the first step towards women’s freedom. She gives several examples of how not only women, but also society suffers by the current standards of morality."," ","First Sanger describes a working class family with six children. The father and mother work hard to keep their kids in school. Two years later she visits the same family only to find that they have had five more children! The three youngest were born with a disability, the two oldest girls were prostitutes, and three of the boys were in jail. The mother works outside of the home scrubbing floors and the father has become an abusive drunk. Sanger concludes that present day morality has caused this family to live as paupers."," ","Sanger points out the over-crowded tenements in which children sleep in the same rooms as parents and borders offer no privacy. She recalls a 26-year- old woman who died giving birth to her seventh child. Her oldest, a girl of ten, took over her mother’s duties, including keeping four male boarders. A few years later Sanger found the girl dying of syphilis. She blames society’s attitude of “Sacred Motherhood” for keeping young girls ignorant to basic knowledge and hygiene."," ","The last example she gives is of a large family in which the two oldest girls worked in the factory in order that the younger ones could go to school. One of the younger girls fell in love with a bum and had an illegitimate baby. She was shamed and ostracized. She left home with her child to work as a servant. Her baby eventually died. By this time her self-worth was so low that she became a prostitute."," ","Another sister fell in love with a respectable man. She also became pregnant without the benefit marriage. She was given sympathy and taken to a doctor to have the problem fixed. She returned to school and later became a principle and a respected woman. Sanger argues that the morality of the time forces women to be either celibate (which means neglecting her marital obligations to her husband) or to seek abortions."," ","Meanwhile wealthy women are given access to information about birth control. They are happy and healthy. They do not contribute to any of the social problems of the times. Sanger asks the reader to imagine what the country would be like if the wealthy were denied the knowledge of birth control, just as the working class has been. She concludes that if there is to be any morality, changes need to occur so that all women have the same control over their lives."," ","In 1913 Margaret Sanger worked as a nurse in New York’s Lower East Side where she witnessed first-hand the suffering of poor women from frequent births and self-induced abortions. One day she heard a doctor tell a woman who became sick after a home abortion to avoid pregnancy by “having her husband sleep on the roof”. Months later Sanger found the woman dead after another self-induced abortion. This inspired Sanger to devote her life to legalizing birth control and making it accessible to all women. Sanger believed that numerous and often unwanted pregnancies resulted not only in poor health for women but also in preventing economic freedom for both men and women of the working class. Poverty and large families went hand-in-hand. The stress of trying to feed, clothe, and educate so many children was a strain on the physical and mental health of the parents."," ","According to the Centers for Disease Control, six-nine of every 1000 women died in childbirth in 1900. Distributing information about contraception was illegal under the Comstock Laws passed by Congress in 1873. In 1916 Sanger challenged these laws by opening the first family planning clinic in New York. Although police closed the clinic, court proceedings led to doctors being given the right to hand out birth control information if medically warranted. Sanger established the American Birth Control League in 1921 in order to provide information and education on the prevention of pregnancy. This organization would later be known as Planned Parenthood Organization of America."," "],"display_date":"February 1918","search_date":"1918-02-14","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1524,"tag":"women's health"},{"id":1393,"tag":"Margaret Sanger"},{"id":481,"tag":"birth control"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":94,"school_id":43}},{"id":5586,"title":"\"US Declared Able to Wage Cold War\"","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"11/10/52","end_date":"11/10/52","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["How ready was the United States ready for the Cold War? On November 10, 1952, an article was printed in the New York Times.  Its purpose was to cover a dinner forum at the New School for Social Research at 66 West Twelfth Street, Manhattan, New York to discuss the need for the continuance of the newly coined “Cold War,” as well as the economic and social ramifications of the war that would persist for a maximum of ten more years, according to their projections. The three speakers at this forum were former first Chairman of Economic Advisors Edwin G. Nourse, and economists Eliot Janeway and A. Wilfred May. Nourse, a federal economist since 1946, viewed the Cold War as a substantial but manageable drain on America’s resources. May believed that as a super power, the USSR would be unable to wage a war of this scale for such a long period of time. Janeway viewed the Cold War as war that must be met, regardless of cost, so that the civilized world can prosper. As history can tell, the Cold War lasted substantially longer than the proposed decade. What was going on in 1952 that lead to this urgency and sense of duty instilled in the American people? The final months of 1952 saw the increase in paranoia through the rages of McCarthyism and the Korean War, mixed with the uncertainty regarding the newly elected president Eisenhower. The New York Times needed this article to reaffirm the populace that they had to remain vigilant and prepare for future economic woes. Yet, it made things blatantly obvious that the wars had to continue for the good of liberty. In this article, Nourse posed the question “Will people stand what ten more years of this kind of cold war involves?” However, the prevailing attitude of the time was that it all of these gripes <em>must </em>be met for the good of the nation.","The social climate in 1952 was rife with controversies, paranoia and uncertainty. A veracious Congress spurred on by Republican fear mongers like McCarthy and Nixon passed the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act over Truman’s veto, which made immigration more preferential and selective than ever. Partisan divisions became more and more entrenched as each party accused one another of communist affiliations. Republicans used the slogan “K1C2” (“Korea, Communism, Corruption) to describe the incumbent administration, while many Democrats openly denounced McCarthyism and radical anticommunist sentiments. This led to the landslide victory of Dwight Eisenhower in the 1952 election, who agreed with Republican platforms like cleaning up Washington, but also quietly denouncing McCarthy’s allegations within his party. Many questions were being asked about the president elect. Republicans believed that concentration of power in Washington meant a greater communist influence, while Democrats believed in restraint in foreign policy. Eisenhower was above party lines and disputed planks of both parties, especially those regarding the continuation of the Korean War.","After the Chinese entered North Korea to protect their fellow communists, panic ensued over whether or not this would result in another World War. Had Truman not restrained MacArthur’s proposed counter-invasion of China, the possibility of a World War with nuclear arms seemed ever looming. By mid to late 1952, there was a stalemate at the thirty-eighth parallel. Talks of peace began between Communist and U.N. forces, but at the same time there were fierce hill battles and tactical bombings. The populace back home was torn between those who were terrified that one slip could spell doom for the world, and those who believed that America had a newfound duty to stamp out communism. The war drained the funds of the treasury, and the morale of the American people.","The article quotes Nourse as saying that a sustained state of military preparedness over a decade would optimistically cost about eight percent of the GDP, down from the current fourteen percent. However, in reality the cost percentage of GDP in the most expensive year of the war (1952) was 4.2 percent, making the cited eight percent only comprise less than two years of sustained warfare. These projections mirrored the simultaneous denial and horrified acceptance over the prospect of a long, drawn out Cold War that extended far past their wildest predictions.","Economist Eliot Janeway says in the New York Times article that the Cold War “must and can be met. For the cold war is war, and war assigns survival priority over economics.” From the perspective of many Americans, the Cold War was not treated as a long-term political crisis, but a threat to human life itself. The article also addresses a Mr. May, who proposed that the U.S. was “in a far stronger position to withstand increased economic strain than the Soviet bloc.” This is contradictory information, considering that the USSR showed an annual 3.6 percent GDP growth starting in 1945, and continuing well into the 1950s. It is possible that May made this statement out of ignorance or optimism: ignorance due to the Soviet Union’s secrecy regarding economic status may have been closely guarded, and optimism due to the uneasy and tentative political-economic state of the United States at the time.","The Cold War was probably the most heated diplomatic crisis in world history. This article goes on to prove this fact by showing how divided the country was during the early years of the crisis. The stances of the three economists- Nourse, Janeway, and May- embodied not just the possible economic approaches to a continued Cold War, but also the three main ideological stances of the American people themselves: the skepticism of the United States’ ability to wage a Cold War on this continued scale, as addressed by Nourse, the belief in the States’ illusory economic superiority, as addressed by May, and the belief in fighting as a means of self-preservation with the human race at stake, as addressed by Janeway.

Elizabeth Janeway’s “Why They Become Communists: Americans seeking an effective answer to communism’s internal danger must first be aware of its influence,” was the entire title of the article and resolved to serve as an indicator as to why and how American citizens could fall victim to the ideology of the Red Menace. The first half of this article revolved around two former communist converts and their acceptance and cooperation with the Soviet Union: the infamous atomic spy Klaus Fuchs and the prolific English poet Stephen Spender. The second half detailed the steps to be taken to recognize and avoid communist influence. These two halves came together to form a typical, yet intellectual Red Scare era article that promoted concern, but discretion, and alertness, but awareness. This was an important statement during a time when Americans believed that communism was the antithesis of freedom and independent thinking.","The summer of 1953 was the height of the Red Scare in America. Fear mongers like Joseph McCarthy accused everyone from Hollywood actors to government officials of communist affiliation of varying degrees. The Korean War was at a tentative truce, but the Eisenhower administration was staging covert action all around the globe to “contain” the communist threat. For Janeway, the communist threat at home was more important due to Eisenhower’s public and determined efforts to stamp out communism abroad. In the article, she first delves into the psychology and mental state of the typical communist using two highly publicized examples: Fuchs and Spender.","At this time, German expatriate and nuclear physicist Emil Klaus Julius Fuchs was imprisoned in England on a fifteen-year sentence for giving highly classified research on the Manhattan Project to former ally Russia during the war. Janeway described in her article that Fuchs was drawn to communism out of “some kind of explanation for the horror and confusion which had invaded his world.”According to her, communism fit Fuchs because he was mentally unstable and communism offered him a new perspective on reality; this granted some sense of purpose and direction that adherents to capitalism just could not understand. Even though Fuchs was incredibly intelligent and instrumental in developing and patenting the implosion trigger for the first atomic bomb, Janeway wrote off his affiliation to the communist party as a reaction to his difficult life and genetic history of mental illness. Up until Fuchs’ death in 1988, he still believed that the power of the atomic bomb had to be shared between the two great powers as a gesture of trust and mutual respect. Thanks, in no small part, to his deeds Russia was able to develop atomic ordinance by 1949.","Janeway’s other example of a repentant communist convert was Stephen Spender, the English poet. She likens his experiences to that of an outsider looking in, which was indeed the truth. While never conforming to NATO capitalism, Spender was also not a true believer in communism. From being exposed to intellectuals from Cambridge and Oxford during the 1930s, Spender was subject to socialist ideals that made him interested in the communist party. Cambridge in particular was infamous for the Cambridge Five: five Cambridge graduates who fed secrets to the Soviets from the 1930s to 1960s. Undoubtedly, Spender would have known, or at least heard about, these men; this may have affected his decision to leave the party. Janeway again used the concept of a struggling man desperately turning to communism for him to make sense of a terrifying and confusing world. She states in the article that communists “cling to the…structure of unreality” in order to become part of a larger being than themselves. She said that Spender was able to break from the allure of communism because he was able to recognize the absurdity and clandestinity of Soviet communism.","Janeway’s argument for the education of the American populace against the allure of communism started with the minds and mindsets of two ex communists. The first was Klaus Fuchs, a strong believer in communism and a devotee until his death in 1988. The second was Stephen Spender, the British poet who only joined for a look into another perspective separate from capitalism. This article then describes the measures to take in order to not end up like these men. Janeway dives deep into the supposed psyches of communists to find them deeply disturbed and enthralled with the concept of unity and service to Moscow. She describes one of the central tenants of communism as the duty to spread its influence across the world. In order to do so, communism must take seductive forms that must be recognized and avoided by the American people. Contrary to the stance of fear mongers like McCarthy and Vice President Richard Nixon, Janeway called for discretion and the ability to discern liberalism from communism. She feared that blatant hatred and paranoia would fracture and divide the American people. Then, Soviet influences could sneak in and turn policy towards Moscow’s favor. Whether or not this was indeed the case, this pragmatic approach towards communist influence – as popularized by Dwight Eisenhower - was provocative in a time where polarization of the populace was the basis of the majority of the 1952 presidential election. It also served as an incredibly powerful social influence. In a small, curious addendum at the very end of the article, Janeway stated that America must not only be vigilant against communism, but also actively express a global attitude and demeanor to which all the other nations of the world could aspire.","Janeway’s “Why They Become Communist” is an interesting look into the hearts and minds of ex-communists while simultaneously shedding light on the situation of communist insurgency and how to prevent it. With the inclusion of admitted ex-communists Klaus Fuchs and Stephen Spender, Janeway painted a picture of a self-destructive and all-consuming ideology that catered exclusively to the mentally unstable. She then explained why the ability to keep a cool head in the face of the nefarious structure of communism was paramount in maintaining national security. “Why They Become Communist” is a look into the more levelheaded approach to the Red Scare and an intellectual attempt to rationalize the seductive nature of communism."],"display_date":"June 14, 1953","search_date":"1953-06-14","locations":[{"id":28501,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1525,"tag":"Red Scare"},{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5608,"title":"\"Bill and the Water Wagon\"","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/20","end_date":"12/31/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the Second Industrial Revolution in the United States, the consumption of alcohol became very popular, especially by men before and after work.  In thirty years, from 1870 to 1900, the number of bars in the nation grew from 30,000 to 100,000.  Since the late 19th century, years before Prohibition went into effect, moral reformers saw alcohol consumption as a problem and pushed constantly for Prohibition laws to be passed at the local, state, and federal levels.  Finally, in 1920 a Prohibition law (the 18th Amendment) passed Congress making the manufacture, transportation, and the sale of liquor illegal.  There were many people that were against Prohibition because people enjoyed their time at the bar and many men enjoyed their few glasses of alcohol daily.  One group of people that did support Prohibition was factory owners.  Factory owners supported Prohibition because they thought it would increase how effective their workers were and help them prevent factory related accidents and injuries.[1]  In addition to factory owners being in favor of Prohibition, many women were also in favor of Prohibition mainly because alcohol consumption often encourages men to talk in a derogatory way to their families, beat their wives, and spend money unnecessarily.[2]"," ","Bar owners were definitely against Prohibition because that is how they earned their money and made a living.  Since many men went to the bar several times a day throughout the week they spent a nice part of their hard earned money on alcohol, but since many blue-collar workers earned low wages, this could impact a family financially over the years without being noticed.  Bar owners made a decent living, while the working class man could not move forward in life financially.  Bar owners purchased nice clothing, jewelry, and could even afford an automobile while the men at the bar could not give their family nice clothes."," ","In a 1914 article “Bill and the Water Wagon,” Bill is asked if he is “wet” or “dry,” meaning if he would vote for or against Prohibition.  He replies that he is “wet.”  When Bill sees a sign advertising Budweiser with a slogan “Budweiser is a good friend of mine,” he starts to think about whether Budweiser really had been his friend?  After thinking for a while, Bill realizes that neither Budweiser nor any other type of alcohol is his friend.  Bill concludes that by going to the bar for a couple drinks before work in the morning, going in the afternoon for one or two more, and then going in the evening to have anywhere from one to three drinks he gives a lot of his money away to the bar owner.  Bill calculates that he has spent $1,859.22 in ten years at his local bar.  He spent this money making the bar owner rich while his wife and children did not have anything nice to wear or a nice home to live in.  Bill realizes he can put his money to better use by caring for his family rather than supporting the bar owner and his wife.  Bill begins to think that maybe Prohibition isn’t such a bad thing. [3]"," ","“Bill and the Water Wagon” was published in 1914 to show people in the United States the downside to alcohol consumption and promote Prohibition to those who were on the fence about banning alcohol.  The author of this article, M.H.P., wanted to show readers the negative side to alcohol consumption and the financial benefit of being on the “water wagon.”  Being on the water wagon symbolizes people drinking water rather than drinking alcohol.  This article really shows readers the benefits of Prohibition and how much their families could benefit from it they voted “dry.”  Readers would have had to consider the amount of money they were spending on alcohol and possibly rethink their priorities in life."," ","Though the 18th Amendment banning alcohol production and sales was overturned by the 21st Amendment in 1933, a short thirteen years after it was passed by Congress, it did seem that Prohibition held the potential to better the lives of many people.  While rich people did not have to worry about watching their dollars, working-class people like Bill did, and, for moral reformers, keeping people away from alcohol seemed like a way to help keep everyone out of trouble.  Ultimately, President Franklin Roosevelt, who won the election in 1932, opposed Prohibition, because he felt taxing alcohol production would help raise money for the government and he also saw alcohol production as a way to help the American economy get back on its feet and to put people back to work during the Great Depression.  Ultimately alcohol could be a good thing for the United States economy, but if not used in moderation by each individual man it could ruin his finances and his relationship with his family."," ","[1] “Prohibition”","[2] “A Look at Prohibition, Hardly Dry”","[3] “BILL, and the Water Wagon”"],"display_date":"1920 - 1932","search_date":"1926-07-02","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":1563,"tag":"18th Amendment"},{"id":1564,"tag":"Bill and the Water Wagon"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":94,"school_id":43}},{"id":5630,"title":"A New York Doctor’s Supports Slavery","course_id":93,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["As many northerners opposed slavery, some certainly did not. The idea of the abolition of slavery became the central political issue in the North as well as the South during the 1850s. In 1853, Doctor John H. Van Evrie of New York explained, “Gigantic efforts are now being made to convince the people of the North that the overthrow of the present relations of black and white races in the South, or what is mistakingly called ‘the Abolition of Slavery.” Doctor Van Evrie argued against the benefits of the abolition of slavery for whites, blacks, and the whole of the United States civilization. As he clarified, “To overthrow the present relation of the races is to injure both the white man and the Negro, and to inflict a deadly blow upon the cause of humanity, civilization, and Christianity.” Fortunately, his political opinion was not overwhelmingly popular in the North. However, racism remained rampant in the North and especially in the South. Dr. Van Evrie argued that a philanthropic movement, sparked by the Quakers, led to a gradual emancipation of slaves in the northern states. He concluded that, “Several states were induced to follow the example of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.” Gradual emancipation occurred in New Jersey and New York followed by the rest of the northern states. The movement gained significant strength in the latter part of the decade.","Historian Leon F. Litwack explained that, “Fundamental differences existed between a condition of legal servitude and freedom, municipal, state and federal statutes which relegated northern Negroes to a position of legal inferiority.” Northern freedmen were not held captive by slavery; however, they did experience discrimination and certain prejudices which subjected them to poor socio-economic standing. Litwack detailed in his article that, “Northern Negroes found themselves systematically separated from the white community.” Although Van Evrie’s argument may be immoral, he was right that the abolition of slavery would cause problems for the population as a whole. Integration of blacks into the communities had been a disaster as Litwack points out. Blacks were mistreated greatly and the political debate on the abolition of slavery annihilated the wig party altogether. Dr. Van Evrie would certainly argue that the abolition of slavery caused more harm to the United States than good."],"display_date":1853,"search_date":"1853-07-02","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5634,"title":"The Campaign of Louis Kossuth and the Slavery Question","course_id":96,"status":"P","start_date":"1851-10-20","end_date":"1851-10-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1851, Hungarian revolutionary Louis Kossuth became an international celebrity who found himself trapped in the divisive slavery politics of the United States. He gained notoriety worldwide as a brilliant crusader for the liberty of his country, and upon announcing a tour around the United States to enlist support for his cause, Kossuth was met with the enthusiasm of the American media. The <em>New York Times</em> welcomed him and published his “Address to the People of the United States.” In his address he explained Hungary’s “struggle of independence” as not much different from America’s former struggle. Kossuth flattered Americans, suggesting that American liberty inspired the rest of the world: “May your great example, noble Americans, be to other nations the source of social virtue; your power be the terror of all tyrants- the protector of the distressed; and your free country ever continue to be the asylum for the oppressed of all nations.”"," ","Though Kossuth intended his message to be an invitation to help him, different parts of the nation interpreted it in their own way. Kossuth never mentioned slavery in his address. However, his appreciation of the US as a “free country” and his condemnation of “tyrants” caught the attention of abolitionists who hoped to enlist Kossuth in their cause. Abolitionists felt something of kinship with Kossuth as they viewed the oppression of slaves and Hungarians to be similar causes. Abolitionists urged Kossuth to endorse abolition but felt betrayed when he refused to do so. Knowing that such a declaration would cost him support in the most of the country and hoping to raise funds from rich southerners, Kossuth tried to avoid associating with abolitionists. He appealed to Southerners in supporting states' rights but ultimately was unable to advocate for democracy abroad when many leading Southerners would hardly promote democracy at home. His image as a freedom fighter was too much for conservative southern slaveholders to handle, so they rejected Kossuth’s presence and mission during his tour."," ","After a stay of about a year in the US, Kossuth failed to raise adequate support and funds for his cause. His tour of the US revealed how avoiding slavery politics was impossible during a time when the question of slavery consumed the nation. Though his cause was separate from slavery issues, Americans managed to interpret Kossuth through an American lens. Since his mission did not fit exactly into any side of the slavery debate, Americans felt comfortable ignoring Kossuth and focused on their own issues. The strong divisiveness of slavery politics shaped how Americans confronted foreign policy, and Kossuth’s visit proved the US was not ready to confront issues of freedom internationally when freedom was being contested so heatedly on their own soil."],"display_date":"October 20, 1851","search_date":"1851-10-20","locations":[{"id":8923,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":95,"tag":"Abolition"},{"id":1218,"tag":"The New York Times"},{"id":1597,"tag":"Louis Kossuth"}],"course":{"name":"Transatlantic Abolitionism","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":96,"school_id":11}},{"id":5667,"title":"Agricultural Labour-The Secret Jobs Done by Children-A look into the secretive world of hiring children as child labourers during the Great Depression.","course_id":104,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/30","end_date":"12/31/38","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Agricultural Labour-The Secret Jobs Done by Children"," ","Industrial child labour was a very important issue in New York and the Southern part of America during the 1930s, but a large number of children also worked in agricultural farms for wages. There was no means to end this and it was a largely unknown issue at the time (Feld, 2). Feld’s article described New York citizens in 1935 fighting for more child labour amendments to be included in New York Legislature of 1921 for children working in sweatshops and industries (1). From 1921 to 1935, only few changes to the amendments regarding child labour were made, including the minimum age for a child to work, which was 16, by President Roosevelt (Feld, 1). Child labour was seen as a fairly cheap source of labour and many adults competed with children in New York for work. This was especially evident from 1928 until 1935 as the Great Depression hit, a result of the crashing stock markets. Subsequently many families grew poor and, “children found work while their elders waited for relief in bread lines”, (Feld, 2). Financially, children supported the families while their care-givers waited for food to feed their families.","Though many people believed child labour did not occur in the factories following the 1925 child labour amendments, children worked in farms as labourers as, “the laws did not apply to the fields”, (Feld, 3). In the census of 1930, two million children aged 10-18 still worked and 700,000 were under the age of 15. Most worked in the agricultural sector during summer vacation (Feld, 4). Federal surveys said children worked twelve hour shifts on tobacco, beet and, cotton plantations, all over the country (Feld, 3). One specific type of child intensive labour was when children worked on their parent’s farm (Feld, 5). Parents could use their children’s work for their own benefit and there was no legal way of limiting the hours children worked, nor regulation for their safety. As a result of fluctuating market prices for the crops of farmers, Feld states that farmers’ only sure economic strategies were, “their own labour and that of their children”,(Feld, 2). Using a lot of child labour was one way that a farmer could survive economically due to the unstable markets. This was very true about the tobacco fields as tobacco was, ``fashionable``, (Young and Young, 51)  and used children as young as five years old to pick the best, lowest leaves and de-worm crops (Feld, 6).","This article aimed at showing the significance of a largely unknown American condition of working children under the age of sixteen in farms. Many adults were in competition with the children because employers knew, ``children are a cheap form of labour without demands``, (Hindman, 71). Especially during the Great Depression, children were, ``willing to work long hours, as a way of cutting costs``, (Hobbes, McKechnie, et al, 191), and compete with adult workers until the 1940s (Nanjuda, 23). Working children took on the role of adults and were a main source of income for their families. Finally, “technological improvements in agriculture can never keep up with technological improvements in technology”, (Feld, 3). Much faster, easy labour was provided by children but that was no match for machine power in relation to industries."," "," "," "," "," ","Works Cited","Feld, Rose, “America’s Vast Army of Child Workers.” <em>New York Times</em> (2013): 18-19."," ","March 24, 1935, Accessed February 5, 2013."," ","http://search.proquest.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/docview/101577232/13C81D7A"," ","5E05BEAFEEC/1?accountid=14771"," ","Hindman, Hugh<em> .Child Labour an American History</em>.

The Feminine Mystique was a book that encouraged women to seek new roles and responsibilities, and to seek identity both personally and in the workplace. Soon after it’s inception The Feminine Mystique was a pivotal point in the fight for women's rights. “Chosen motherhood is the real liberation. The choice to have a child makes the whole experience of motherhood different, and the choice to be generative in other ways can at last be made, and is being made by many women now, without guilt.” Friedan’s book finally made it possible for woman to work outside of the house and at real jobs. Three years after Friedan’s book, in 1966, 28 woman including Betty Friedan herself established the National Organization for Women. Since then NOW has been responsible for many of the major changes to the equality of women, Including the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. “Through more than five decades of activism, Friedan showed the ability not only to formulate feminist theory but also to develop her thinking response to social and cultural change.

Although they took the movement seriously, they could not help but ridicule the idea of a housewife movement. As they poked fun at the group, however, tension grew over the “politicizing of the traditional roles of wives and mothers.” No matter how much the media lampooned the movement, its pervasiveness in contemporary American culture was undeniable. The topic was one of hot debate, reflected by its presence in newsprint throughout the period. Society’s idea of what women were capable of was undergoing a significant change.","Milton Caniff, a cartoonist who had become famous at the time for his <em>Terry and the Pirates </em>strip, had sensed this influence and incorporated it into his comic. While the eponymous character, Terry, fought many a foe, the most famous was known as “the Dragon Lady”. She was a sly and capable foe, and at the advent of World War II, led the resistance against Japan’s invasion of China. She is shown to be an equal match for Terry on numerous occasions. This portrayal of a competent, attractive female antagonist was revolutionary for the time. It is also worth noting that the Dragon Lady was not only a woman, but also ethnic, being Asian. Caniff’s comic contained several other strong, female characters, but none were quite as influential as her. This can clearly be seen today where the term “dragon lady” refers to a negative stereotype of strong or mysterious women of East Asian descent."," "],"display_date":"1920 - 1945","search_date":"1932-12-31","locations":[{"id":21355,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":30,"tag":"Urban Society"},{"id":1158,"tag":"Great Depression"},{"id":258,"tag":"World War II"},{"id":788,"tag":"Sexism"},{"id":617,"tag":"Feminism"},{"id":1774,"tag":"Milton Caniff"},{"id":1775,"tag":"Comics"},{"id":1776,"tag":"Dragon Lady"},{"id":1777,"tag":"Cartoonist"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":5763,"title":"Harlem Renaissance: A cultural battle for equality","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"9/19/26","end_date":"9/19/26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A new movement rose in the 1920s as African American Jazz began to sweep the nation. Marking an influential Harlem Renaissance, this “New Negro Movement” resembling an outburst of African American culture included literature, music, and art.  The new jazz that rose during this period challenged conventional white music by emphasizing the need for more culturally inherent music; it asserted the emergence of the “New Negro”[1], one that would attempt to revive culture and make it significant to the African-American race, creating their own identity.  On a deeper level it challenged de jure segregation that began with the Jim Crow laws[2], laws that would cause them to express themselves culturally, rebelling against the mainstream.  This resistance towards the mainstream would increase significantly after the wartime period where they experienced more freedom from the French than their own country causing them to turn towards literature and the arts, to argue that the mainstream should begin to take them more seriously.","Zora Neale Hurtson’s iconic book <em>Their Eyes Were Watching God</em> was a landmark for African American women featuring a title character who broke society norms by choosing an independent lifestyle where she became very active in finding a partner and crafting her own identity.  Her race and her gender does not stop Janie Crawford from achieving an established role in a 1930s environment that attempted to oppress African American women. African Americans were struggling to achieve their own national identity, one example of this struggle was distinguishing Negro music with American Jazz.  The misconception was that they were the same but African Americans in 1926 gave key notes on why this was inaccurate.  Like African tribes and commu­­nities, the music of the Negro was one that relied on group effort, “no one sings just one part.”[3] Instead, they have emphasized creating their own system of orchestrating music that differs from American processes. This group effort would foreshadow African American’s attempt to separate from mainstream society in the 1960s, creating their own racial community through groups like the Black power.[4]"," ","[1] Harriss, M.

Propaganda ensued and, three months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Japanese internment commenced. All Japanese-Americans and anyone of Japanese descent on the west coast of the US were herded into internment camps or forced to leave their homes. At this time the Japanese were depicted and thought of as sub-human and deceitful.

While the US never sent direct military support to China, they began airlifting supplies to the Chinese in an attempt to relieve some military pressure.

They were not satisfied with such inequality. A visiting European dignitary -- Paul H.B. d'Estournelles de Constant -- noted the commitment shown by American women to achieve their rights. He noted that people laughed at the woman who claims the right to vote. Therefore, women pushed the boundary in setting up movements that enabled them to get involved in political activities. “The movement in favor of votes for women is a protest of outraged morality against the masculine infringements of politics on private life, conscience and individual liberty” (Estournelles de Constant p.72). \" I have heard the most frivolous society women admire the grandeur of an immense procession that went past their windows in New York. it was a women's demonstration, carried out on a winter day, amid rain and mud. Thousands and thousands of women, of all ages, all classes and all kinds, marched past, without distinction of place, forgetful of the times in which they lived, of their inequalities of station, of their joys and sorrows, their minds fixed upon a common purpose -- the emancipation of their sex and the right to act, compete, protest and vote in public as well as in private.\" (p.68)","Estournelles notes that eventually women finally earned the right to vote, in eleven states initially.

New York City resident Oscar England had been without sight his entire life and died earlier that day apparently due to trusting too highly in his ‘eerie’ (the <em>Globe and Mail</em> reporter implied) innate ability to know where he stood in relation to his surroundings(“Blind” 14). The<em> Globe and Mail</em> reporter professed that England’s ability had proven dependable for nearly three and a half decades, and turned out to be especially useful during a nearly decade-long period of frequent subway travel (“Blind” 14). England required no accompaniment whether navigating New York City’s packed walkways or confusing mazelike subway terminals (“Blind” 14). This talent allowed England to precisely discern the distance and way needed to reach various destinations, such as different underground trains… until December (“Blind” 14). On that date, England overestimated the distance to the boarding zone and tumbled down onto the tracks, directly in the path of a train that steadily drew nearer (“Blind” 14). It took close to sixty minutes for an accident response teamto extricate England’s remains out from the middle of the solid platform and the subway cars (“Blind” 14).","England’s death (perhaps ironically) occurred shortly after the initial introduction of United States government aid towards individuals with disabilities (“Blind” 14) (Shriner 480). Parties, ranging from relatives of individuals with disabilities, to state bureaucrats, to a team involving a mental health patient and a medical professional, founded prominent mental and physical disability societies early on, in 1909 and 1927, and as late as 1950 (Shriner 480). The aforementioned societies officially identified with, or complimented efforts by, the American government (Shriner 480).","Some of this increased American state disability-assistance specifically benefitted the blind (Shriner 480-481). Since the year 1920, state-run workforce-rehabilitation agencies were directed towards individuals with disabilities (Shriner 484). However, these rehabilitation agencies initially displayed an inability to adequately meet the requirements of individuals without sight (Shriner 482). The resulting early-1940’s Barden-LaFollette Vocational Rehabilitation Act (BLVRA) allowed government-run blind-assistance-organizations to operate blind-individual-specific sections within government rehabilitation agencies (Shriner 482). The BLVRA addressed the aforementioned limitation of the rehabilitation agencies, but also had an overarching purpose of tapping into a hitherto-unexploited potential labour force (visually-impaired individuals) (Shriner 482). Also in the early-1940’s, blind-individual advocacy groups made government officials aware that proposed tax rate modifications, if implemented, would disadvantage the blind citizenry to a greater extent than the non-blind (Shriner 483). The United States Congress thus decided to allow a set amount of blind individuals’ costs to be exempted (Shriner 483). Earlier on, in a somewhat ‘eerie’ coincidence (as the <em>Globe and Mail</em> reporter implied about England’s ability the same year), 1936 saw the advent of the Randolph-Sheppard Act (Shriner 481) (“Blind” 14). The Randolph-Sheppard Act ultimately allowed blind persons a near-total monopoly over holding positions as merchants in federal government structures (Shriner 481-482)."],"display_date":"October 1936","search_date":"1936-10-16","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1812,"tag":"blind"},{"id":1811,"tag":"disability support"},{"id":1810,"tag":"disability"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":117,"school_id":28}},{"id":5778,"title":"\"Comstockery in America\", <em>The Woman Rebel</em> - by Margaret Sanger","course_id":114,"status":"P","start_date":"7/1/15","end_date":"7/31/15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","In 1914, Margaret Sanger fought for women and their right to have control over their own bodies. She was shocked that working-class women were unable to obtain safe and effective birth control. Sanger began providing them with the information and the knowledge to have a say regarding what they would do with their bodies in and out of marriage; the right to decide if they would become a mother or not, and the right to prevent conception if they wished. During this time she published a monthly newspaper titled <em>The Woman Rebel</em> for working-class women where she openly discussed many of these topics with her readers. This was the first publication of its kind in America, and many topics the newspaper discussed were touchy subjects that U.S. postal authorities and Anthony Comstock , U.S. Post Office Inspector, called obscene. Many of her publications advocated the use of contraception and for that reason three issues of <em>The Women Rebel</em> were banned from the mail. In August of 1914, Margaret Sanger was indicted for further publication of newspapers and, not wanting to go to prison, she fled the country under a false identity. While out of the country, she had friends release 100,000 copies of a 16-page pamphlet she had written with instructions on the use of various contraceptive methods entitled “Family Limitations.” This infuriated Anthony Comstock, who went on the hunt to bring Margaret Sanger to justice.","Anthony Comstock was a powerful American reformer who led a fight against what he viewed as obscene material in literature and other publications. The term “Comstockery” was born in regard to his war against stopping this type of material from being shared amongst Americans via the U.S. mail. In 1873, he successfully lobbied Congress for a ban on mailing obscene or inappropriate material. This act became known as the Comstock Laws of 1873. During that time he served as a special agent or inspector for the U.S. Post Office and founded the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. He devoted his life to fighting against what he felt was obscene material, which included attacking Margaret Sanger and her newspaper. He would not rest until she was brought to trial for her writings in the paper.","In July 1915, Margaret Sanger was indicted under the Comstock Law for her discussions regarding birth control in <em>The Woman Rebel</em>. During this time she responded to the Comstock Laws in her paper in an article titled “Comstockery in America.” She writes that Europeans are laughing at Americans in regard to this Comstockery in America.  The young women of Europe look up to Americans for their freedom and opportunities, Sanger argues, but are saddened when they learn that American women have to fight for their right to have a say in what they will and will not do with their own bodies. Margaret Sanger informs her readers that in order to fight Comstockery, they must know who and what is behind it. She assures her readers that the purpose of the paper is to make the working-class woman aware of their rights. To give them knowledge to know what great power they have over what they chose to do with their own body. She states how it is the working-class woman that is suffering because she does not have access to the knowledge and resources like women of wealth. Margaret Sanger says the working-class women are the ones who are having the big families and who fill the death lists from abortions. She states that she will defy the law and not hide behind the walls, but continue to fight for the working-class women. She will continue to provide them with the knowledge and information they deserve. She asks Americans to join her in her fight against the Comstock Laws and to realize they deserve to know their rights. She believes Comstockery must die and education on the methods to prevent conception must continue.","Margaret Sanger continued to fight for women’s rights regarding birth control and in 1921 she started a campaign based on education and publicity which was aimed to win mainstream support for birth control by opening the American Birth Control League. Her efforts helped the movement gain the support of medical professionals and social workers. Possibly her biggest contribution, and what she is best known for today, is her role in the Birth Control Federation of America in 1939, which was later renamed Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Sanger, until her death in 1966, continued to fight for what she had always wanted for the women of American; less costly and more effective birth control."],"display_date":"July 1915","search_date":"1915-07-16","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1819,"tag":"The Woman Rebel"},{"id":1818,"tag":"Anthony Comstock"},{"id":481,"tag":"birth control"},{"id":535,"tag":"Comstock Law"},{"id":1393,"tag":"Margaret Sanger"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":5788,"title":"\"What!

The name of the author appears to be a fictitcious name that was used by the anonymous writer of the pamphlet to personify alcohol and to better get his point across. The article was published for the use of the Woman's National Christian Temperance Union.","Organizations such as the Women's National Christian Temperance Union were key players in the fight for national Prohibition of alcohol and utilized documents such as \"What! Rob a Poor man of his Beer!\" to get their message across to readers. The exact date of the pamphlets publication is not noted in the document, but it was created by the National Temperance Society and Publication House in New York sometime between December 24th 1873 when the first protest by the Temperance group occurred to prior to the January 16th, 1920, adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment which prohibited the sale and distribution of alcohol.","The document is a poem that describes the possible pitfalls of alcohol consumption and attempts to focus on the important negative aspects of the consequences of its use such as the financial strain, domestic violence, and immoral behavior that its abuse promotes. It is obvious that the document is a pro-Prohibition document that was designed to enlighten the reader and was used as a tool by the Christian Temperance Union to gain support for a nationwide ban on alcohol production.","The pamphlet points out how much money is wasted on alcohol consumption that could be used to improve the lives of the families that it affects. It places a great deal of emphasis upon how funds are wasted in the saloons that could be better the economic situations for many families. This was a definite concern during those times.","As stated in the poem \"What! Rob a Poor man of his Beer!\" there is mention of a few examples of the type of financial issues that alcoholic abuse contributed to. One such example was mentioned in this statement \"Of ten thousand dollars paid upon the spot, two-thirds was paid directly to the saloons.\" (Barleycorn n.d.) This statement alone proves that alcoholism was a major cause for economic problems that were hurting the economy of families across the nation. Violence is also hinted towards in the pamphlet.","There are several lines in the poem which point out alcohol as being the reason for violence in the family. One such line states \"What! Rob a Poor man of his ale, and prevent him from beating his wife.\" (Barleycorn n.d.) This one line speaks of how violence in the family directed towards women was a serious issue and a justification for Prohibition to be ratified. It is clear from such statements that the author wanted to alert readers that domestic abuse occurred when intoxicated husbands returned home from a night out at the saloon.","Overall the document is a perfect example of how organizations got their message across in regard to their views on Prohibition during an era when print media was the only way to spread information and influence public opinion. The pamphlet's author utilized a poem to explain the downfalls of alcoholism and more importantly promoted and drew attention to the benefits of a dry nation. It was also a way to deliver a message to the general population in a language that everyone could understand at that time. This is clear in the simplistic, informative, but also somewhat entertaining, way that the author attempts to get the attention of the reader by his or her use of a poetic form of writing."," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"December 24, 1873","search_date":"1873-12-24","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1840,"tag":"Womens Temperance"},{"id":860,"tag":"Principle of Prohibition"},{"id":699,"tag":"Temperance Movement"},{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":5790,"title":"Women, Automobiles, and Advertisements.","course_id":114,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/20","end_date":"12/31/29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","“Motoring can ruin the finest skin,” the Pond’s advertisement boasts. Beauty products and motor vehicles may not seem to go hand in hand, but the ever changing cultural landscape of the 1920s saw many companies addressing the needs of the new age woman. In 1920 Pond’s published their advertisement in the <em>New York American Sun </em>newspaper; the product was a vanishing cream that, the company promised, could protect from sunburn and pore clogging dust. It also offered a cold cream which could help cleanse the skin after “a long motor trip.” This advertisement clipping highlights the trend of women who enjoyed “motoring.”","When automobiles were first created, many saw them as a luxury. By the early, 1920s the moving assembly line gave way to true mass production, which, in turn, created lower prices for automobiles. Vehicles were no longer seen as luxuries or toys for vehicle enthusiasts. Although vehicle registrations increased from 8.1 million in 1920 to 23 million in the late 1920s, motoring was still considered a manly sport. Motor cars were seen as a piece of masculinity that was both difficult and dirty to drive. Yet, many women sought driving as an act of independence and ignored naysayers who believed that women were incapable of learning how to operate a vehicle.","Famous women like Edith Wharton, Gertrude Stein, and Rose Wilder Lane publicized their use of the vehicle, inspiring housewives all over the country to do the same. The Suffragette Movement also pushed women to gain independence from their husbands and fathers. Women who lived in urban areas where roads were paved and petrol stations were readily available began owning and driving vehicles. In the country, wives of farmers used the automobile as a way to shop in nearby towns, run errands, take care of farm business, and visit with friends.","The push for the woman’s suffrage amendment and World War I made women a primary consumer. During the war many women became the sole providers in their households, when their men returned many continued their lives in the workforce which created disposable income. With the new trend of female drivers and workers many companies found new ways to market to them. Despite women no longer being seen as simply housewives, advertisers still kept up the “housewife” image. Ads did not promote women’s political and economic status, but focused on their social status instead. There were two ideas behind marketing campaigns centered on automobiles in the 1920s: (1) women were only concerned with the aesthetic quality of the vehicle they drove and (2) they were concerned with their appearance while driving.","Advertisers were not above pushing the image that women placed a higher importance on their personal style and appearance than other aspects of life. It was believed that women spent time choosing gowns, hats and shoes that complimented her driving habits and did not pay much attention to the mechanics of motoring. Pond’s understood that while many women enjoyed their newfound independence they did not stop subscribing to “Victorian” social mores, which instructed women to remain classy, elegant and fashionable at all times. If their skin was damaged by the sun, dust and wind it would ruin their flawless image.

Whitman’s poem poignantly explained the horrors that one could find at field hospitals during the Civil War: “Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made, Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps, And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke, By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in the pews laid down.”","The field hospitals were a horrifying sight for Whitman. This is surprising, in many ways, since Whitman served as a nurse during the Civil War.  For Whitman, the field hospitals lacked sufficient space for all the wounded soldiers in their care.  They reeked of blood and other odors. Not to mention, they presented endless labor for the surgeons and their assistants, who did everything in their power to end the suffering of the wounded and dying soldiers. What Whitman saw in the field hospital haunted his memories the rest of his life.","Nightmares, like the one experienced by Whitman, were common at field hospital during the Civil War. Because field hospitals were the quickest and most efficient source of medical care throughout the years of the war, they existed at essentially every battlefield. In a piece concerning the topic of medical care during the Civil War, historian Victoria Holder wrote that at the beginning of the war, neither the Union nor the Confederacy had any plan for hospitals because they did not believe fighting would last more than a couple months. By 1862, the Union and Confederacy had passed laws creating hospital systems, but by that time, field hospitals were the most relied upon source of treatment for wounded soldiers.

In response to the violent acts that the Ku Klux Klan had committed, a special committee of Congress had been called together. The committed responded that “…the remedy seems to be simple. Removal of every pretense of complaint, and complete personal security, are now required. General enfranchisement, and the summary destruction of the Ku-Klux, should be simultaneous.”","For the committee, the disablement of the Ku Klux Klan was a necessity. <em>Harper’s Weekly</em> noted on the matter, “Plainly, if disabilities are removed, the Ku-Klux may come into possession of the State governments.” The threat of the Ku Klux Klan gaining political power frightened the special committee. The Klan was a threat that required the US to intervene and stop. This was reflected strongly in the news brief’s ending: “The Ku-Klux terrorism indefinitely postpones the tranquility which is indispensable to the Southern States.” Thus, only with the Ku Klux Klan out of the picture could the southern States peacefully be assimilated back into the Union.","This news brief from <em>Harper’s Weekly</em> accurately reflects the fears of many people in the South during the years of reconstruction. The<em> Encyclopedia of American Religious History</em> contended that the KKK was originally a social fraternity. This changed, however, once Confederate veterans, under the guidance of Nathan Bedford Forest, took control of the Klan. Furthermore, historian Eric Foner argued that the KKK was a military arm of the Democratic Party in the South. In addition to Confederate Veterans, planters, merchants, and members of the Democratic Party also joined the Klan. the Klan became involved with political terrorism aimed at preventing Republicans from gaining political clout within the former rebel States. The Klan’s regular victims consisted of white Republicans, teachers, blacks, and those promoting Reconstruction.","As mentioned in the news brief, many people demanded the US government dismantle the threat of the KKK. In response to these demands, Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act (a.k.a the Third Enforcement Act) on April 20, 1871. This act enabled President Grant to use military force or suspend the writ of <em>habeas corpus</em> in order to stop any display of “insurrection” in the former Confederate states. While the Ku Klux Klan Act had moderate levels of success, in the 1876 Supreme Court case of <em>US </em>vs. <em>Cruikshank</em>, the Court’s holding was that the Ku Klux Klan Act was only applicable to state and local governments. Since the KKK was not part of the government, the organization was out of the jurisdiction of the Federal government. Thus, the KKK would survive and continue to haunt the South many decades following the end of Reconstruction."],"display_date":"March 25, 1871","search_date":"1871-03-25","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":151,"tag":"Ku Klux Klan"},{"id":680,"tag":"Harper's Weekly"},{"id":470,"tag":"Reconstruction Period"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5796,"title":"<em><strong>The New York Times</strong></em><strong> Commemorates Jefferson Davis' Death</strong>","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-12-12","end_date":"1889-12-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In an article describing the funeral of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, <em>The New York Times </em>wrote, “it [the funeral] was one of such magnificence and taste that the recollection of it will never vanish from the mind of any beholder.” People from all over the South attended Davis’ funeral, which was held in New Orleans on December 11, 1889. Describing the procession, <em>The New York Times</em> noted, “The cortege was more than three miles long, and contained many thousand persons.","Due to the influx of people in attendance, the city of New Orleans delayed the ceremonies for Davis’ funeral from 11 AM to 12 PM. Around 3 PM, Davis’ casket and the rest of the funeral procession arrived at the gates of Metairie Cemetery. Once the procession had reached Davis’ temporary tomb, <em>The New York Times</em> observed the following: “the military formed in double lines around the mound at parade rest, the veterans grouped themselves inside this line, and outside of the glittering line of blue and gold soldiery were tens of thousands of the foremost people of New Orleans.” Once the ceremonies were over, a single-file line was formed in order that people could get one last look at the first and only president of the Confederate States of America.","Undoubtedly, Davis’ political career was the reason that so many people attended his funeral. Even before his time as president of the Confederate States, however, Davis had an impressive career in politics. He was a West Point graduate, a US Senator, a US Representative, and served as secretary of war. At one point in time he was even married to President Taylor’s daughter! During Davis’ time in Congress, he resigned from the US Senate in 1861 to show his support of Mississippi’s quest for secession. The act, along with his already stellar reputation, earned Davis notable fame in the newly seceded southern States. This eventually led to his election as the only president of the Confederate States on February 9, 1861.","Many historians have questioned the value of Davis’ leadership for the South during the Civil War. Historian Eric Foner argued that Davis lacked the ability to effectively manage the South’s economy and deal with obstructionist governors. Davis also lacked skill in diplomacy, which greatly hurt the South.","Despite his lack of skills, throughout the Civil War, and even in its final days, Davis never submitted to Lincoln and the North. Upon the fall of Richmond at the Civil War’s end, Davis was arrested by Federal troops and held in prison for two years. Though he was eventually released, Davis was never pardoned for his acts concerning the Civil War, nor did he ever apologize for any of them. Davis endured a lot of criticism for the defeat of the South throughout the rest of his life, but as seen by this article, people lauded his unwavering devotion to the South.

For three years President Wilson tried to keep America out of the overseas conflict. However, by 1917 President Wilson no longer felt that the U.S. could remain neutral due to attacks against American shipping and threats to the nation’s security. As the nation entered the conflict, patriotic activities and rhetoric became more popular. This show of patriotism was shown in many different ways, such as through songs like “Over there” by George M. Cohan. An even bigger show of patriotism took place when the New York State Commissioner of Education, Henry Sterling Chapin came up with the idea of creating a national creed. A creed is a system of principles or beliefs that is usually accepted by that group. The national creed would summarize America’s political faith by drawing from fundamental elements of American history and tradition. A nationwide writing contest was launched to find who could best put the national creed into words. The end result was what gave birth to the American Creed:","“I believe in the United States of America as a government of the people, by the people, for the people; whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed, a democracy in a republic, a sovereign Nation of many sovereign States; a perfect union, one and inseparable; established upon those principles of freedom, equality, justice, and humanity for which American patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes.","I therefore believe it is my duty to my country to love it, to support its Constitution, to obey its laws, to respect its flag, and to defend it against all enemies.","-William Tyler Page"," ","More than three thousand entries were submitted. The winner, William Tyler Page, was from Friendship Heights, Maryland. At the young age of thirteen, Page had served as a U.S. Capitol page in Washington. He then went on to serve as an employee of the Capitol building for almost sixty-one years. Winning a contest that shows patriotism probably came naturally for Page since he came from family deeply rooted in American politics. In 1650, one of his descendants arrived in America, and later settled in Williamsburg, Virginia. From 1789-1797 Congressman John Page served in the House of Representative. Page was also related to Carter Braxton, who signed the Declaration of Independence. The tenth president of the United States, John Tyler is another one of William Tyler Page ancestors.","America was a nation of immigrants that was engaged in a war against some of the counties from which many of the immigrants or their descendants originated. Some feared that this could cause conflicts and divide the American people. The American Creed reminds people to give power and support to the U.S. government and any challenges it will face in the future. The creed also reminds people to uphold their duties to the government in the land in which they now reside.","It was just a little over a year after the start of World War 1 when the National Creed of America was approved by the speaker of the House of Representatives and the commissioner of education of the state of New York. On April 3, 1918 in the House of Representatives Office Building the mayor of Baltimore James H. Preston presented the award to Page. The <em>Congressional Record</em> printed the proceedings that were related with the award on April 13, 1918. A year after the Creed was adopted by Congress, Page was elected clerk of the House. Thirteen years later, when the Democrats were the majority party, they created the office of minority clerk of the House of Representatives for Page. He held that position for the rest of his life.","At a time when patriotic sentiments were very important, the American Creed was the perfect compliment. Page’s short statement drew on American history and tradition to remind people what they were fighting for in 1918 and encourage them to give all to their country."," "," ","Sources:","Copyright ©1995-2013 by the Independence Hall Association","This Page Established on 20 November, 1994","Copyright © 1999-2012 by HomeOfHeroes.com"," "],"display_date":"April 3, 1918","search_date":"1918-04-03","locations":[{"id":15927,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1858,"tag":"America's Creed"},{"id":1859,"tag":"World War 1"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":114,"school_id":43}},{"id":5809,"title":"Political cartoonist Thomas Nast depicts his thoughts of racism in America during the Reconstruction era.","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1874-01-01","end_date":"1874-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":null,"display_date":1874,"search_date":"1874-07-02","locations":[{"id":8927,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":11,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1114,"tag":"Political Cartoons"},{"id":1864,"tag":"The Civil War"},{"id":1865,"tag":"Thomas Nast"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6061,"title":"George Abuses Labor for Personal Propagation","course_id":122,"status":"P","start_date":"1886-10-01","end_date":"1886-10-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A short stocky man with a baldhead and bushy red beard rose to the podium and faced the 2,300 eager faces in the crowd. On September 2,1886 Henry George stood aside John McMackin, Chairman of the Convention of Organized Labor in New York City, and accepted the candidacy for mayor. He begins his speech by formally accepting the nomination, but quickly takes a sobering tone when he warns the audience not to “imagine that the politicians who have made a business of politics for years and have grown fat upon it will allow the working-men to smash their machines without trying their utmost to prevent it.” Various union factions constituted the majority of George’s voting base, but were also joined by Irving Hall Democrats whose anti-Tammany Hall sentiment was strong enough to break them from their traditional voting trends. Similarly, many Republicans were disenchanted by Theodore Roosevelt’s description of labor as “crude, vicious, and un-American,” leading them move to George's third party.","Despite the multitude of support George had accrued from across the political spectrum, George’s self description as a public servant of the working class was a guise, behind which laid ulterior motives; mainly the self-serving purpose of the using the candidacy to propagate his own theories. After all, George had been close acquaintances with both Terence Powderly, and Samuel Gompers the two most influential labor leaders of his day, but stood in constant defiance of the principles they promulgated.","Although he topped Republican Theodore Roosevelt in the polls, the election saw George receive fewer votes than Democrat Abram Hewitt. In an era when the voting base of the working class was numerically superior, what kept the vote of labor from victory? While many workingmen might cite political corruption, and indeed George did, historians often point to factionalization within the already disjointed labor movement. Was this why George was unable to bridge the gaps between men whose best interests were clearly aligned?","While George was a dear friend to both Gompers, and Powderly, they clashed on many of the major issues within the labor movement. Powderly’s Knights of Labor held membership of around 68,000 in New York, enough to effectively direct the outcome of the election. However, George openly disagreed with the Knight’s policy of trade tariffs, and the theory of protectionism. George openly criticized the fallacies of protective tariffs having seen by his own eyes that they did more harm than good. Powderly attempted to avoid what he recognized was a divisive issue that would only further split solidarity among the labor movement, but George was outspoken, and unwilling to censor his beliefs during his campaign.","Gompers too had problems with George’s qualifications to lead the labor party. Leaders such as Gompers believed that intellectuals were not to be trusted. Their sense of ‘right’ was self-serving, and any good intentions they may have had were quickly swept away by their tendency towards individualism. Furthermore, Gompers saw trade unionism as an end-all be-all for the plight of the laborer. And while George did care a great deal for the power of unions, and the working class, it would be mistaken to assume that George believed in the efforts of the labor party as a panacea to industrial sickness he observed.","Unlike his union compatriots George insisted that his effort was not against capital, but in alliance with capital against the landlord. Unlike many of the workingmen, George was strictly anti-socialist, having fervent belief in the power of self-help that “affirms the dignity of the individual to prosper, or suffer as he sees fit.” The idea that capitalism was not to blame was shocking to many unionists, whose ideals focused on the abuse of capital. It was statements such as these that lead historian Frank Genovese to believe that ideological discrepancies proved the greatest barrier to unity. In his speech George addresses what he believes to be the true systematic discrepancies that left such unfavorable outcomes for workingmen. He notes that in New York “enormous value, that the growth of population adds to the land of this city is taken by the few individuals for the benefit of the idle rich, who look down upon those who earn their living by their labor.” In line with his most noted contribution to Political Economy George proposes “tax on land exclusive of improvements, so that a man who is holding land vacant will have to pay as much for it as if he was using it.” This method attempts to discourage land speculation, a dangerous practice that in George’s eyes cause misuse, and by consequence grave inequities. So while he clearly cared a great deal about the predicament of the working class he never truly believed that trade unionism served any greater purpose. This misalignment of interests and theories proved to be most divisive in the election of 1886.","In the end, the election of 1886 served as a sad display of how self-interest lost the day for labor. After his victory Hewitt noted; “they could not allow a man like Henry George to be major of New York. It would upset all the arrangements.”"],"display_date":"October 1886","search_date":"1886-10-16","locations":[{"id":8929,"lat":40.7805662337,"lng":-73.9388482485,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2184,"tag":"Single tax"},{"id":2186,"tag":"Election of 1886"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":122,"school_id":10}},{"id":6075,"title":"Family of Andrew Goodman Spoke at News Conference","course_id":123,"status":"P","start_date":"8/6/64","end_date":"8/6/64","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 06, 1964, <em>The New York Times</em> reported an expression of “grief and hope” by Andrew Goodman’s family to the public at a news conference. Andrew Goodman, the dead civil rights worker killed near Philadelphia, Mississippi, had been working on a voter registration drive in Meridan, Mississippi. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. Robert Goodman, ensured the public their pain, although personal, belonged to the entire nation. Despite the death of Andrew and the other two civil right workers, the Goodmans remained adamant the three young men “shall not have died in vain[; the] struggle for equality…shall continue” and not end with the slaying of civil rights activists Goodman, James Chaney, and Michael “Mickey” Schwerner.","The three civil rights activists were a part of the Mississippi Freedom Project under CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) which prepared and encouraged men and women to vote in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. Among those opposing the Freedom Project was the Ku Klux Klan, who had approximately 750 members in Mississippi by the 1960s. The prominent presence of the Ku Klux Klan in the state of Mississippi fostered an environment of intimidation in almost every political office and allowed the extremist group to use fear tactics to prevent minorities, such as African Americans, from voting. Schwerner and Goodman, both twenty-one year old, Jewish men from New York City met at the Mississippi Freedom Project training session. Chaney, a twenty-year old African American and Mississippi native brought local knowledge to the team including his navigating skills needed for the back roads of the Magnolia State.","Goodman, Chaney, and Schwerner had ridden out on the June 16to investigate the arson against the Freedom School, at Mt. Zion. Shortly afterwards they were arrested on the June 21 for a traffic violation and held until the fine of $20 was paid. Klansmen, working in cooperation with some local police stopped the car, and killed the three men. They burned the vehicle and dumped it in a swamp, and buried their bodies in dam. No one was charged for the murder for the three activists, although nineteen men, including the sheriff and deputy sheriff, from the Lauderdale and Neshoba Counties of Mississippi were arrested for “depriving the three [murdered] victims of their civil rights,” in 1967 according to writer Bill Scheppler.","The news conference held by the Goodman family reinforced the philanthropic behavior the civil rights activists pursued in Meridian, Mississippi. With the loss of these young men, the Goodman family voiced hopes of, personally, continuing their son’s civil rights duties. James Farmer, the national director of the CORE released in the news conference that a drive headed by Jackie Robinson, former baseball player, would collect funds for the Schwerner-Chaney-Goodman Memorial Community Center in Meridian. The openness of the Goodman family created a spirit of resilience in the nation during a time of mourning for the African American community.

She argued that discipline was the best way to build character. Children’s ability to reason in society comes from the parents’ enforcement of obedience. Her argument suggests parents are responsible for their child’s development; therefore, they must help build confidence, structure, and self-control through a variety of disciplinary actions. She suggests, “a generation ago it was the custom to feel that a child should be made to obey without understanding; nowadays we feel that prohibitions are useless—there are too many means of getting away from authority these days . . .”[1] Roosevelt had a new outlook on children. They were the future workers and decisions makers of the United States, so she believed parents should take responsibility for cultivating their children’s character.","Roosevelt was most commonly known for her dedication to political movements and rights for women and for bringing women into press conference meetings and other political contexts.  But she was lesser known for advocating for successful child rearing. Her drive to focus on child rearing stemmed from the economic crash. The Great Depression had negative and long lasting effects on jobs and trade. American men and women experienced many hardships of the recession, taking drastic pay cuts and resorting to volunteer work. Roosevelt knew that strong citizens working in a struggling environment could have a positive effect on the economy; so delving into the effectiveness of childhood development would change the outcome of the economical downturn. By instilling hard work and motivation into youthful minds, children growing up in the Great Depression would become stronger adults.","Along with changing children's behavior, Roosevelt also called for the improvement of the parents' behavior: “She encouraged parents to maintain a distance between themselves and their children and advised them to exercise control over their own emotions and act calmly and reasonably in all circumstances surrounding childhood development.” [2] Maintaining proper conduct was a challenge for parents because they had to focus on their own conduct as much as their child’s.","Eleanor Roosevelt was a role model not just in the political sphere, but also in the domestic sphere. She could not do it on her own, seeing as many people saw her vision for democracy clichéd and obtuse. She relied on the media to spread her word; her editorial found its way into the homes of families all across the country. Roosevelt proposed old ideas of child rearing for a modern society and changed the roles of parenthood in hopes for a stronger, united country. Her contributions not only pushed the economy in a positive direction, but also set the standards for future citizens to come."," "," ","[1] Roosevelt, Eleanor, 1931. “Building Character,<em>”</em> <em>The George Washington University</em>,  Accessed November, 13 2014."," ","[2] Dennis, Paul M, \"Between Watson and Spock: Eleanor Roosevelt's Advice on Child-Rearing from 1928 to 1962,\" <em>Journal Of American Culture </em>18(1995): 41-50"],"display_date":"June 1931","search_date":"1931-06-15","locations":[{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2469,"tag":"Eleanor Roosevelt"},{"id":2470,"tag":"Child Rearing"},{"id":2471,"tag":"20th Century"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":125,"school_id":69}},{"id":6247,"title":"Black Feminism and The Women's Liberation Movement","course_id":125,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The 1970s were characterized as an era of protest, activism, and change in America. Anti-war protests against the war in Vietnam and the involvement of the United States in Indochina were popular. As the women's liberation movement continued, the disparity between the needs and agendas of black feminists and white feminists became more evident. In the \"Black Women's Liberation\" pamphlet, two articles, \"Why Women's Liberation is Important to Black Women\" by Maxine Williams and \"Take a Look at Our Problems\" by Pamela Newman, identified the unique needs of black women that served to divide black feminists from the women's liberation movement. The authors identified the aspects of the women's movement that hindered the involvement and development of minority women, like racist sentiments and a narrowly-oriented set of goals that favored white, upper-and-middle class women. The narrow, class-focused orientation and goals of white feminists led many black feminists to value racial liberation over gender liberation.","A major source of tension between black feminists and white feminists was the push by upper-and-middle class white feminists and Southern Republicans for Congress to pass the Equal Rights Act (ERA) that granted both sexes equal rights under the law. The ERA was strongly opposed by the American Federation of Labor and other labor unions because they feared that the amendment would invalidate and weaken protective labor legislation for women. Black feminists, like the labor unions, favored state protective labor laws because they protected the minority women, who disproportionately formed the bulk of the women's labor force, from horrible working conditions like extreme hours, unfair pay, and dangerous work environments. Upper-and-middle class white feminists, however, unfamiliar with labor-intensive jobs and their harsh conditions, saw these laws as restrictive for upwardly-mobile women in the workplace. Black women and black feminists experienced a far greater array of oppression than their white counterparts-- as a woman, as a worker, and as an African American. As the case on state protective laws illustrates, the oppression that black women faced also came from the women's liberation movement.

In this case, Marvel Comics (Hulk, Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, etc.) traveled safely out of the 1950s’ comic slump bigger than ever into the 1960s’ and onward.","Additionally, the widespread episodic possibilities available on television let superheroes invade the homes of millions of people across America.  When speaking of the influence of superhero television shows, it was assumed that one will speak of the <em>Batman</em> (1966-1968).  However, it would be unfair to include the shows that were the product of this show’s outrageous success, shows such as <em>Wonder Woman </em>(1975-1979), <em>Shazam</em> (1974-1977), and the classic <em>Spider-Man Cartoon </em>(1967).  Each held cultural significance in their own right, but <em>Batman </em>truly stood out as the one that shifted popular opinions on comic books, though it is criticized for saturating the art with camp value.  In a study of merchandizing of television brands it was said, “Scholarship on the Batman TV series has largely been concerned with its appeal to multiple audiences - generational, countercultural, or queer-and with its relationship to the emerging pop art movement and camp sensibilities of the late 1960s’.”[2]  The manner in which <em>Batman </em>appealed to so many different walks of life allowed comic culture to work its way into the mainstream.","Finally, the matter being discussed (aside from camp coming from some television related materials) was more mature in nature.  Marvel Comics was praised by the youth movement of the 1960s’ for creating characters that faced problems and fears shared by their generation.  Robert Genter explains the Marvel formula in his exploration of their impact on Cold War America: “Fantastic powers aside, most Marvel heroes were laden with typical problems plaguing the 1950s’ and spoke to the anxieties of a culture in an atomic age.”[3]  The relatability present in Marvel Comics allowed readers to, for the first time, interject themselves fully into the superhero fantasy.  In <em>Comic Book Nation</em>, Bradford Wright explains the impact of Marvel characters at this time, “Heroes like Spider-Man helped keep code approved comic books relevant and profitable in the age of television and rock-n-roll, a prospect that had seemed quite unlikely only a few years earlier”[4].","In short, comic books grew back into pop culture icons during the late 1960s’ and 1970s’ through youth culture, television appearances of superheroes, and significance of subject matter in mainstream comic stories.  The culture that grew out of comic books in the mid and late 20<sup>th</sup> century incubated and gave through to the present third way of superhero/comic book fascination in America."," "],"display_date":"January 30, 1966 - May 2, 1971","search_date":"1968-09-15","locations":[{"id":31603,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2592,"tag":"Pop Culture"},{"id":2591,"tag":"Superheroes"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6309,"title":"The people's opinion at the international convention of comic art in 1968","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/60","end_date":"12/31/68","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The people's opinion at the International Convention of Comic Art in 1968"," ","In the cover of thousands of comic books, Batman, Superman, and Capitan Marvel, are displayed in courageous brilliance.

Phil Seuling, president of the Society for Comic Art Research and Preservation, Inc., sponsored the convention. Seuling stated that comics had evolved from humble situations to more problematical and psychological problems. The political, economic, and social cultural history impacts comics from the way they are written, their price, and the people's opinion."," ","Comic book dealers, collectors, editors, and cartoonists showed up at the convention followed by approximately 500 teenage fans. Some fans that attended were the middle age sentimentalists that were brought up on Dagwood Bumstead, Katzenjammer Kids, and Moon Mullins. Other attendants like 21 year old Howard Rogofky who grossed 80,000 dollars by selling old comics during that times harsh economy. From 1965 to 1968 the United States had problems on implementing economic stabilization policies. One of the main reasons was that the Vietnam War was projecting a menacing shadow on economic policies, and unacceptable inflation.This fact explains why some of the attendants of the convention were just there to make money by selling old comic strips and comic books."," ","The true bibliophiles that can quote the chapters and verses of old comics that they love also attended the convention. Glenn Farley a 15 year old stated that he liked to read the old comics mainly because they expressed the frustration in life during those time periods. In the fifties and the beginning of the sixties, comics were all about the horrors of the cold war. Even during the World War II era some comics would show someone doing somthing bad and the hero would punish him. From the 1960s, the direction that comics were taking was the same direction that reflected the new ideas of the people. The 1968 presidential campaign became a conflict about the deadlocked Vietnam War, civil rights, and lack of law and order in the US. During the years, people`s ideas changed for the greater good and were open to alternate choices to deal with issues."," ","Comics are an art form that have history and have a development of style. Comic art mirrors society, this art is inspired by society the same way any other art form is. Some critics claim that comics not only reflect but encourage violence and hatred in society. These ideals are a direct reflection of the 1960s social and cultural issues in the United States. In 1968 the U.S was on the brink of a massive race war because of persistent discrimination in jobs, education and housing. In that time, the black press provide essential records of the struggles of a united people dealing with generations of loathing and discrimination. An opening made at the convention by Stan Lee, an editor and writer of Marvel comics, strongly disagreed with the critics who stated that comics encouraged violence."," ","In the 1960s, the Jungle War Stories comic was among the first introductions of the Vietnam War to apear anywhere in America. Jungle War Stories validated the U.S. presence in Southeast Asia, but it also illustrated the challenging obstacles to victory. The idealistic and angry young people of this time period were determined to transform society. the Vietnam War was protested, and other movements were encouraged to battle for civil rights, black power, and feminisim. It is clear that during this convention, people realized the political, economic, and social impact in the country that changed how comic books were made, leaving people open to new ideas."," "],"display_date":"1960 - 1968","search_date":"1964-07-01","locations":[{"id":33962,"lat":40.7416518725,"lng":-74.0773468609,"zoom":11,"place":"Hudson, New Jersey"}],"tags":[{"id":579,"tag":"New York City"},{"id":1507,"tag":"1960s"},{"id":1775,"tag":"Comics"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6312,"title":"Superman vs. Ali: Simply A Fictional Fight, or Something More?","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"2/1/78","end_date":"2/1/78","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Muhammad Ali was the first Muslim boxer to win a heavyweight title, and his fame earned him the opportunity to create a comic book plot for American readers. Ali chose to write a scenario in which he and Superman, who was unable to use his powers, boxed against each other as mortals. In fighting Superman, Ali is clearly reflecting the internal racial war that was going on during 1970’s America. He made the conscious decision to choose a superhero that was most associated with conservative American values such as equality, freedom and justice.","Siegel and Shuster had intentionally created Superman as a symbol of hope to the people during the time of the Great Depression, and gave him the alter ego of  “Clark Kent” in order to relate more with the people. As the gap between the American Dream and reality began to take a toll on the Americans in the 1930’s, Superman fought for justice and upheld the idea of the traditional American hero.","On the other hand, Muhammad Ali was a boxer, who was also known as being one of the biggest Muslim and African-American figures during the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. He spoke out on American hypocrisy towards other races, and criticized how Superman was meant to be the one to speak out for justice and American values, yet there were still oppressed minorities living in America. Ali’s comic book scenario clearly puts Superman as the superior white American male against himself, standing in place for the oppressed minorities who lack equal rights. In taking away Superman’s powers, Ali is literally leveling down the playing field, which shows how unequal the whites and blacks were in America. Superman’s “superpowers” would have been a representation for the social and economical power that whites had in America and the blacks were willing to fight for. Ali’s ending, in which Superman is knocked out in two rounds, creates the controversial alternative to American society as it features a world in which both races are equal, and minorities are able to defeat white Americans.","In conclusion, Ali was trying to send the message to the public about his opinions about race and inequality in America. He struck a chord in the American public by using one of the biggest Superheroes ever created.

Under President Jimmy Carter, many people felt that because their problems could not be solved, it was best to accept things the way they were. Carter’s foreign policies are still debated today. During his time, he unintentionally created tensions by endorsing the European Monetary System (precursor to the Euro), in hopes of building the three-way partnership of the United States, Western Europe, and Japan. His actions put pressure on the Europeans, and, despite their intentions to strengthen relationships, ironically ended up neglecting Western Europe itself.[1] In addition to problems with foreign policy, the economy was troubled, there was an energy crisis in progress, and Carter had lost the support of the Southern Baptist Church as well as other conservative Christians because he refused to answer their questions with a simple “yes” or “no” as they deemed fit.[2] By the end of his term, Carter and his reluctant populace were facing soaring oil prices, American hostages over seas, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. [3]","However, under such faithlessness in humanity, people found stray streaks of light. The comic book industry was bleeding into Hollywood, after the astounding popularity of the first Superman movie in 1978. It earned over 300 million dollars during its first theatrical run, received critical acclaim, and was nominated for three Academy Awards.[4] People young and old—grandfather to father to son—could all understand and relate to the simplistic stories of good versus evil, rather than the more realistic but elite and depressing problems of romantic comedies, war movies, and literary movies.[5] The movies simplified life and provided escapism, distracting frustrated Americans from the crumbling economy and other issues brought on by Carter. Superman was put on a pedestal, multiple critics making comparisons between the character and Jesus; ironically, Superman was a savior to the real American public as much as he was to the people of Metropolis.[6] Soon after the success of the movie, three more movies in the series went on to be made, not including later remakes and new additions to the franchise. Comic book movies not only brought smiles to faces of all ages, but helped the economy in ways the aforementioned movie types could not. Posters, toys, and the like could all be fashioned for comic book movies sold to children and collectors. The unlikely source of joy and money would go on to have a lasting legacy, comic book movies still being made today."," "," "," ","[1] Basosi, Duccio. \"Principle or Power?

Even though at this time he was just starting in the business, Plastino knew how to bargain with, and manipulate, those in higher positions, and how to bring elaborate visuals to a comic.","The time Al Plastino was asked to create panels for the popular Superman comic, he was also creating posters in the Pentagon’s art department. These posters were mostly pro-World War II; but Steinberg Studios needed him badly after Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster had lost the rights to the character in 1947.<sup>2</sup> Plastino was aware that the studio was desperate for his work, and so, he gave in to the requests and did a sample for the strip, but soon found out that another artist working on the comic, Wayne Boring, was making fifty-five dollars per page. He found it obscene that he was not offered the same rate, largely because he thought his quality of his work was equal, or superior to, Boring’s.<sup>3</sup>","Plastino used his other job at the Pentagon as leverage to negotiate his salary per page at Steinberg Studios. He eventually agreed to do the artwork for Superman for fifty dollars a page. Plastino revolutionized the 1950s Superman character and “brought out the human side of a modern myth.”<sup>4 </sup>The level of humanity in Plastino’s artwork of Superman had never been seen before, which made the popularity of the comic skyrocket.<sup>5</sup>","During the 1950’s, Al Plastino worked for DC Comics under Mortimer Weisinger, the company’s comic editor. Weisinger created a “cut-throat” industry<sup>6</sup>. In an interview with Silver Lantern Fanpage, Al Plastino described an instance in which Weisinger told him that another artist was willing to illustrate the Superman comics for twenty dollars per page. He told Weisinger to give the job to the artist:","They always tried to keep you below them. I don’t care what it was. ‘You’re below me.’ But I’d tell them, ‘I’m above you. I’m the artist. You’re an editor.’ I made that clear, in a nice way.<sup>7</sup>","Plastino knew how to manipulate the availability of his talent to figures who, naturally, held higher positions than his own. Although the editor had ultimate control of what was published, Plastino was aware of the great power of his art to narrow the audience’s viewpoint and focus their attention on what he wanted them to.<sup>8</sup> He made use of this talent to, ultimately, get what he wanted: his name on his own artwork.","Plastino was soon asked to take on a position in the artwork production of the daily Batman strip with artist Whitney Ellsworth. He and Ellsworth ended up working on the strip for eight years, replacing comic book artist Joe Giella. Giella had let on to Plastino that he had to sign the strip as “Bob Kane”, even though Kane did nothing in the way of illustrating the comic.<sup>9</sup> The stubborn man that he was, Plastino could not let his hard work be concealed as someone else’s work. Though Kane’s name was still on the first panel, Ellsworth and Plastino wrote theirs on the proofs of the strips, to ensure some credit to their work.","This also happened with another of Plastino’s characters, Supergirl. Supergirl “seemed to be a concerted effort to appeal to young girls; her stories were whimsical adventures that also featured Streaky the Supercat,”<sup>10</sup> the latter of which was also creation of Plastino’s. Supergirl was first understood “simply as a Superman for girls”<sup>11</sup> who was a less-interesting version of Wonder Woman.<sup>12</sup> Plastino would always ink his own name on the page; he didn’t wait for or trust the letterer to put his name down on his work.<sup>13</sup> This quality aided Plastino’s ability to be certain that he would be recognized for his own artwork.","When asked to describe comics in the 1950s, Dan DiDio, DC Entertainment Co-Publisher, said, “When you think of (comics) in the 1950s, only a handful of artists come to mind—and Al Plastino is one of them.”<sup>14</sup> Al Plastino revolutionized the comic strip through his ghost-like persona. He was behind-the-scenes, but wanted his name to be completely visible on the artwork that he around which he centered his whole life. Plastino was strong-willed and incredibly talented, though his most rewarding characteristic was his confidence in his own work."," "," "," "," ","Works Cited","<sup>1</sup> Age, Silver. \"Al Plastino Interview (Pt. 1).\" Al Plastino Interview (Pt. 1).

In a writing about this particular series, the two viewpoints were described as, “Green Lantern’s liberal responses to situations are in stark contrast to the counterculture ideologies that influence Green Arrow’s thinking”.[3]  Comics before the time of O’Neil, and arguably still to this day, had portrayed western minorities in lesser roles often characterized by their race with characters like Black Spider or Black Panther.  In an article analyzing racial issues involving comic books, O’Neil’s run on <em>Green Lantern/Green Arrow</em>, tackling the titular hero’s absence in the Black community, was hailed with, “Superhero comics represented every fantastic race possible, as a means of ignoring real ones”.[4]  This series in particular gave previously flat characters more dynamic, round qualities.","Finally, O’Neil helped shape mainstream superheroes into people who are able to learn from their misdeeds instead of infallible beings as they had often been.  While pairing Green Lantern with the former “Batman with a Bow”, Green Arrow, O’Neil elected to create new personality and status traits for the heroes in order to make them more flawed and deep characters.  In a 2007 interview, O’Neil said, “Well, Oliver Queen [Green Arrow] had never had much character… but we were evolving into more characterization, and in this particular case I needed someone to represent the non-establishment point of view… there was not very much established about him, apart from the loss of fortune, which had been my story”.[5]  Green Arrow’s leftist views fueled by his loss of fortune lead to later O’Neil characters growing, like the Question’s search for inner peace or Batman’s struggles with limitations and drug abuse in 1993’s <em>Batman: Venom</em>.","In brief, Denny O’Neil’s writing was pivotal in crafting the Bronze Age as it matured with the audience, was full of relevant social messages, and allowed Superheroes to be people capable of error rather than perfect vessels for fighting crime.  O’Neil’s works helped pave the way for diversity in the stories told and the societal value of comic books after the 1960s."],"display_date":"April 1970 - April 1985","search_date":"1977-10-15","locations":[{"id":36051,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2602,"tag":"Comic Books"},{"id":2596,"tag":"Bronze Age"},{"id":2618,"tag":"Denny O'Neil"},{"id":2619,"tag":"Green Lantern"},{"id":2620,"tag":"Green Arrow"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6324,"title":"Astro City vs. The Real World","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/95","end_date":"3/29/99","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The comic, Astor City, connects with and is shaped by events in US history.

Therefore without a single lead character the Astro City comic can change up its storylines and characters; this allows Astro City and its characters to age with the real world. In an interview with Astro City creator, Kurt Busiek, Busiek talks about how he is reintroducing the Astro City comic by continuing the story line in the first issue of Astro City published in 1995. During the talk he mentions how the first issue was made seventeen years ago, so the continuation of the storyline will show all the characters seventeen years older than what they were before.[1]","Without a lead hero to use within the comic, Astro City is able to split the time utilized in the comic for each hero in the particular issue, as well as put time towards the development and growth of the city and its civilians.[2] During the 1990's the comic book industry was in a downfall. As Bradford Wright put it \"comic books are losing their audience not because  they have failed to keep up with changes in American culture but because Americans culture has finally caught up with them.\" People were beginning to get tired of the usual superhero comics, so Astro City brought in a new look into comics.[3] The Astro City universe places the city situated in America, with real life American cities.

In the Astro City world, JFK is elected president, the moon missions take place, and there is also the Challenger space shuttle disaster, although in the comic, one of the heroes saves it from exploding.[4] In Busiek's work with Astro City, he likes to touch upon the negative effects of living with people that have superpowers. He shows how ordinary person, like someone from the real world, would experience in a city full of superheroes and villains. Many comics already do this, but in Astro City, Busiek focuses on the psychological consequences as well.[5]","The fictional world that holds Astro City connects with our own world. The Astro City comic shares our history, with slight variations, as well as the characters and city aging with the comic itself. As we the reader grow, so does the characters, comic, and city within the Astro City issues."," ","[1] Jeffery Renaud, Busiek's Triumphant Return To Astro City, comicbookresources.com,  http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=45472.","[2] Oliver Sava, Kurt Busiek's Superhero Masterwork Continues With Astro City #1, avclub.com, http://www.avclub.com/article/kurt-busieks-superhero-masterwork-continues-with-i-98722","[3] Bradford Wright, Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture In America, 282-285.","[4] Stephen Burt, The Superheroes of Your Dreams: Twenty Years of Kurt Busiek and Brent Anderson's Astro City, slate.com, http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=45472","[5] Kurt Busiek, encyclopedia.com, http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3451300016/busiek-kurt.html"],"display_date":"January 1, 1995 - March 29, 1999","search_date":"1997-02-13","locations":[{"id":42267,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2622,"tag":"Kurt Busiek"},{"id":2621,"tag":"Astro City"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6325,"title":"Marvel Comics and Roy Thomas’ Time of Horror","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/80","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["For Marvel Comics, the 1970’s brought on the revival of the horror genre with Roy Thomas working under Stan Lee and later serving as Lee’s immediate successor as Marvel’s editor-in-chief. Thomas is well known for writing X-Men and Avengers for Marvel Comics in the early 1960’s, but he also contributed greatly to the horror stories that flourished a decade later.[1] Marvel and DC comics sales were very close during the period, continuously fighting for the top spot in the market.","In the beginning of the decade, DC Comics was having success with their anthology series <em>House of Mystery</em> and <em>House of Secrets</em>. Marvel had a good hold on the horror market in the 1950’s, so it was only natural for the company to return to the genre and compete with DC by releasing <em>Tower of Shadows </em>and <em>Chamber of Darkness. </em>Marvel put out numerous books and stories during this time such as <em>Tomb of Dracula</em>, <em>Son of Satan, The Valley of the Worm, </em>and <em>The Living Mummy,</em> essentially flooding the market. Consequently, DC had to match it.[2]","Thomas worked with and advised Stan Lee extensively to create several other horror stories. Marvel’s large spread over the market allowed them to have stories with similar characters such as Dracula and Morbius, both vampires, and stories concerning a Werewolf and also a Man-Wolf. Stan Lee also found inspiration from other famous monsters. He created the Hulk with Frankenstein’s monster in mind. Yet, when he reexamined the Hulk he found it to be a good representation of what the golem, a Jewish legend, was.  The golem was first introduced in comics in <em>Strange Tales, </em>but only lasted a few issues. Thomas later reincarnated the myth of the golem however in <em>Hulk #134</em> and he stated that the Hulk was a “modern version of the Jewish golem saga.”[3]","The immense popularity of horror comics did not last extremely long though. Another kind of horror occurred in 1973 with a nationwide paper shortage that plagued all business that relied on the resource. This caused a decline in the amount of books that were put out by both comic book companies. The shortage resulted in the United Paperworkers International Union appealing to the government to let pulp and paper prices be regulated by market forces and not government control.[4] The feminist movement in the early 70’s caused both Marvel and DC to shift their focus a bit away from horror. In 1972, Marvel released three comics with female main characters, <em>Shanna the She-Devil, Night Nurse, </em>and <em>The Cat. </em>Several other issues across the nation affected the material released by comic book companies. Many stories increasingly covered topics such as the Vietnam War and racism.[5] It is therefore evident then that the companies covered any and all topics that would let them grab hold of the market."," ","[1] Lawrence, John Shelton. \"The Stan Lee Universe.\" The Journal of American Culture 36, no. 1 (03, 2013), 64.","[2] \"Comic Book Artist Magazine #13 - Roy Thomas Interview - TwoMorrows Publishing.\" Comic Book Artist Magazine #13 - Roy Thomas Interview - TwoMorrows Publishing.","[3] Weiner, Robert G. \"Marvel Comics and the Golem Legend.\" Shofar 29, no. 2 (Winter, 2011).","[4] Wilcke, Gerd. \"Paper Shortage Plagues Business.\" New York Times (1923-Current File), Jan 06, 1974.","[5] Bradford W.

Goodman purchased comic book stories from the Funnies, Inc. which included superheroes such as the Human Torch and the Sub-Mariner.[1] Kevin Garcia a free-lance writer for Marvel Comics, describes in his interview his journey through the 1930s in the comic book business. In his interview, he describes the character of Namor “The Submariner” in enough detail that events in the U.S. can relate to that time period. In the 1930s, events in American politics, economics, and social culture, had an influence on the rise and development of comics, their characters, and writers.","The hunt for communists in the U.S. government began in the 1930s and continued on until the 1960s. This changed the stakes of politics and the development of the United States’ social policies. Historians argued that the anticommunist attack was triggered by the rise of unionism under the Congress of Industrial Organizations. This was also a reaction against the development of pro-labor, anti-racist, and feminist consumer movements.[2] In the 1930s the United States government believed that communism was a threat and immoral. This information relates to Kevin Garcia’s interview because he believed that Namor fought evil and rarely saw defeat.[3]","Given the right learning tools, pre-school children are able to demonstrate the extent of their learning. Comic strips have been used in many ways to enhance knowledge and education. Also, comic books and their use as learning stimuli show their historical context as well as their potential for future practice. Research shows that pre-school children respond in a positive manner to comic strips because they allow the learners to make sense of different topics through the retelling of stories, allowing a deeper understanding and a higher level of learning.[4] Kevin Garcia was a high school teacher of American literature. Since comics began to strongly rise in the 1930s, this research relates to Garcia’s comment that comics are an excellent learning tool and are part of American literature, which is why he used them in his classes.[5]","Militarization altered nearly every feature of American life from the late 1930s and the following centuries. Militarization steered the economy in the direction of a strong war production. This happened both during the actual hostilities of the World Wars and a lot longer during the cold war when hostilities threatened but were not acted upon. The nation paid unthinking attention to national security at the expense of other issues. This even had an impact on shaping social and cultural affairs, so that everything from education to the rights of women was debated in terms of the language of military struggle.[6] This document does not relate directly with Garcia’s interview but more importantly, it provides background knowledge of the struggling America that he endured during the 1930s.","In the United States, employment fell approximately 25 percent and output fell about 30 percent during 1929 and 1933, marking the beginning of the Great Depression.[7] The Great Depression began soon after the stock market crashed in October 1929. By 1933, nearly 13 to 15 million Americans were unemployed and approximately half the country’s banks failed.[8] Many comic book writers were in financial difficulties during the early 1930s and saw an opportunity in the comic book business to lift their families out of the Depression. The distance between the American dream and reality seemed particularly large at that time.[9] These facts relate to Kevin Garcia because he was a free-lance writer for Marvel Comics trying to make a living during that time.[10] Writers did not create superheroes only to entertain and to make a living, but to bring hope to the American people. Instead, the real heroes in the Great Depression of America turned out to be the American people themselves.","[1] Wright, Bradford W. 2001. <em>Comic Book Nation: The Transformation of Youth Culture in America. </em>Baltimore: T","[2] Storrs, Landon. \"LEFT-FEMINISM, THE CONSUMER MOVEMENT, AND RED SCARE POLITICS IN THE UNITED STATES, 1935-1960.\"<em>Journal of Women's History</em> 18, no. 3 (Fall, 2006): 40-67,148. http://ezproxy.rollins.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/203248794?accountid=13584.","[3] Ortiz, Ildefonso. \"Local Writer Chronicles Marvel Superhero.\" <em>McClatchy - Tribune Business News,</em> Aug 23, 2010. http://ezproxy.rollins.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/746394557?accountid=13584.","[4] Sharpe, Justin and Yasamin O.

The interview mentioned a number of superhero comic figures that he created, one of them being The Question. Albeit following the trend of fighting super villains, the people who The Question fought against were much like real people: reporters and mobsters. Furthermore, apart from the realistic perspective of his comic stories, he comes into depth when talking about the  “struggle of the mind from being corrupted and being ruled by irrational premises.” He therefore states that human beings are in control of everything they do and how they react to their surroundings, including the spreading fear of communism at the time. One of the most significant events at the time was the Vietnam War, where Americans feared the spreading belief of communism.","The Vietnam War began due to the President Truman’s belief of how Vietnam was turning into a communist state and was losing its sense of “deep-rooted nationalism”. This led to the fear of communism, as well as an increase in the amount of anti-communist propaganda displayed throughout the country. Nevertheless, forms anti-communist propaganda weren’t only prominent in advertisements and speeches, but also within comics. For example, Stan Lee’s Iron Man created his superhero armor when the Communists kept him hostage, only to come to the realization that the only way he could stay alive was to wear the iron chest plate he created along with it. The general public would feel sympathy for this fictional character even though it is clearly unrealistic, as well as feel hatred towards these communist groups.","In contrast, Steve Ditko’s The Question was used to represent his views on society and who the public should truly be fighting against: the media. The Question only ever fought against reporters and mobsters, instead of including racial groups and stereotypes that other comics focused on. This would therefore relate to other comics where the enemy is fought against, such as Lee’s Iron Man as stated previously, since it creates more unnecessary hatred and irrational feelings towards the enemies in reality. Ditko also mentions “a mind that refuses to accept or defend the truth, by that act, permits lies to exist…” and that whatever we choose to believe is what our future relies on. To him, evil would only exist if we believe it to be real.","To conclude, Ditko created a superhero that didn’t necessarily fight for solely the government’s perspective of justice like the other superheroes, but rather more of what he saw as being the brainwash and use of propaganda to make people think that what they do is right when it may not be. The Question is a clear representation of how he believes that the media and ‘realistic’ types of crime is who the people should be fighting against, not just fighting against who others think we should be fighting against and why. It was a waste to use up our resources on unnecessary wars that blew up due to fear."],"display_date":"October 1968","search_date":"1968-10-16","locations":[{"id":31603,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2632,"tag":"the question"},{"id":2631,"tag":"steve ditko"},{"id":1246,"tag":"Propaganda"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6329,"title":"The Great Depression Finds Its Way to the Comics","course_id":139,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/29","end_date":"1/1/39","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One of the lowest points in American history, The Great Depression stemmed from uneven prosperity in the 1920s paired with the nation producing more than it could consume and the small foreign market for American goods.[1] While American people suffered, hard work became a necessity for most and a skill children were quick to learn. Comics like Little Orphan Annie gave the people hope, as well as raised interest in comics, opening the door for later tales of less orthodox genres.","As a boy growing up in the Great Depression, Carmine Infantino, comic book legend and co-creator of such heroes as the Flash and Green Lantern, was no stranger to hard work. When he was no older than six, he already worked as a shoe shiner to help his family make ends meet. He dreamed of growing up to become an architect—a talent and passion visible in the well-designed and elaborate buildings in his comics—but the inability to afford the schooling prompted him to focus on his drawing instead, giving way to the industry he is now associated with. The influence of the Depression itself was part of Infantino’s inspiration to begin with. He grew up drawing the faces of cartoon characters depicting the times, such as the aforementioned Orphan Annie, a character known for her spunk and optimism during hard times.[2]","Infantino went to school in Manhattan, despite the fact that he lived in Brooklyn, solely because he had a burning passion to draw and Brooklyn offered few opportunities. The Depression worked against him as much as it influenced him. His parents hesitated to give him money to go to this school because they feared that all artists were starving and poor—sensations they knew well and dreaded their child having to go through. Eventually they relented. Infantino went on to meet the man who gave him his first major opportunity to learn his trade: Harry Chesler. He gave Infantino an opportunity he could not refuse: Chesler would pay him a dollar a day simply to come to his shop and learn.","Infantino eventually ended up at Quality Publishing, a new break that arose from his first one-in-a-million opportunity. It was here that his job became to work on the backgrounds of the comics, circling back to his past dreams of becoming an architect. While the Depression forced him down a path that may not have been his first choice, he discovered a new passion, and continued to explore his old one through a new medium."," ","[1] Sreenivasan, Jyotsna. <em>Poverty and the Government in America: A Historical Encyclopedia</em>.

Creator Gardner Fox and artist Harry Lampert built the story of Jay Garrick, known as “Flash.” In the first edition of <em>Flash Comics</em>, readers are introduced to Garrick as a college student studying to become a scientist. During one of Jay’s science experiments, he unintentionally inhales hazardous fumes that render him unconscious. After awakening, Garrick discovers that the gases had remarkably enabled him to function at superhuman speed. With his gift, Flash defends his fictional home of Keystone City while allotting time to keep up with his studies. Flash’s pursuit of education after acquiring superhuman speed is an example of how structured conduct in American culture following The Great Depression and into World War II was being implemented to it’s new generation.","Flash differs from his predecessors in that he is a less combative superhero than Superman or Captain America. Flash, who wore his father’s World War I helmet, exemplifies the rectitude that was being urged upon children of the early 1940’s and continued into the 1950’s. As <em>Comic Book Nation</em> notes, society during the Golden Age of comics became fixated on the instilment of morally just ideology in youth culture.[1] Comics, having become a hugely popular medium for youth to gain information, also began attracting a lot of attention as to whether or not their criteria was beneficial for kids. Gardner’s focus during the creation of <em>Flash Comics</em> was not rooted in forming a character mighty enough to defend America against its greatest villains, like many of Flash’s super-peers had.[2] Rather, Flash was created to allow readers an escape from the belligerent culture surrounding World War II. Because Flash was created at a time when comic criteria was highly speculated, Gardner’s vision for Flash was one that offered an escape from that antagonistic ideology.","In a 1972 interview with Gardner Fox, the creator of Flash recollects what had directed him toward writing comics, in particular Flash. In the interview with John Benson and Phil Seuling, Gardner states that, “<em>The Gods of Mars</em> and <em>The Warlord of Mars</em> opened up a complete new world for me”, continuing to say,  ”That was my goal for the original <em>Flash Comics</em>.”[3]  Perhaps more than any other comic book writer of his time, Fox’s mission was to create a hero whose job wasn’t solely to destroy the enemy by any means necessary. Instead, Fox wished to create a hero that was viewed as a human with superpowers rather than a superhero pretending to be human.","However, as the attention surrounding World War II grew, it became inevitable for from a revenue standpoint for Flash to join in on the propaganda. As Gardner states, “As writers, it was our job to adapt to the world around us.”[4] In the months following Flash’s debut, Gardner premiered a group of superheroes known as the Justice Society of America whose issues ventured far outside of the Keystone City. The Justice Society, in which Flash was an honorary member, quickly became part of the War and took the name the Justice Battalion after becoming a branch of the United States Armed Forces.[5] Much like Marvel’s Captain America, the Justice Battalion approached head on issues surrounding WWII like Nazi Fascism, which at the time, was a commonality for comics.[6] Chapter Two of <em>Comic Book Nation</em> addresses, Golden Age comic book superheroes often provide their own political input by taking action in war efforts on behalf of America.[7] Gardner accomplishes the inclusion of the world around him in his early Flash comics through the actions of the Justice Society of America. Readers began depending on the actions of their favorite heroes such as The Justice Society, Captain America, and Superman to determine how they might like to see the war handled. Whether or not they truly played a role in the outcome of World War II, it is evident that the true outcomes did not differ greatly from those that were predicted in graphic novels at the time.","Gardner Fox’s creation of Flash provides the comic world with a hero centered on the mirroring strong morality rather than one that reflects the abrasive arrogance that much of America culture during the 1940s represented. Jay Garrick’s Flash is one who tried admirably to branch away from the hostile nature attached to Golden Age comics, but ultimately became engulfed by it."],"display_date":"January 1, 1940 - December 2, 1945","search_date":"1942-12-17","locations":[{"id":27491,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2634,"tag":"Keystone City"},{"id":2609,"tag":"gardner fox"}],"course":{"name":"Creating the Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":139,"school_id":5}},{"id":6380,"title":"Escape to Freedom","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1840-01-01","end_date":"1853-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sometime in the year 1840, William Green decided that he had enough of being a slave. “White people seem to act as if God made us to be their servants and it is not right for them to keep us in slavery,” he wrote. “I decided I spent enough time in slavery as I was willing to,” he wrote. William had never been whipped but his new master, Dr. Jenkins, just used the lash on him for leaving the plantation without permission. William fought back, making it the only time that he was ever whipped. “If you whip me again,” he told Dr. Jenkins, “I will never work for you again.” Jenkins tried one more time to lash William, he caught the whip in midair and beat Dr. Jenkins. With that, William became a fugitive slave and ran and hid and hid and ran. ","Slaves were used to harsh treatment from their masters. They were often whipped and made to do very hard work. Slaves were treated like animals and were bought and sold at auctions like commodities. Slaves were whipped if they were overweight or did not grow fast enough (Johnson, 46-78). Slaves like William and others were whipped for leaving the grounds to visit family members. They suffered with the separation of family and loved ones. Slaves lived in fear of being sold all of the time (Johnson, 5-19). Young William was visiting his father on a nearby plantation and when he returned his days as a slave would soon end. ","Many slaves, like William, lived in fear and in terror all of the time. With the passage of The Fugitive Slave Act, many slaves that escaped were returned to their masters. Many returned to even harsher treatment upon their return (Hartman, 19-20). Other slaves that did not escape lived with the fear of being sold and that their immediate family would be broken up. The fear of disappointment and the terror of the lash was a daily feeling (Hartman, 18). William, his father and his brothers all worked on different plantations. When William ran he knew that he could be caught and returned to Dr. Jenkins. William ran anyway and feared the prospect of getting caught but always hoping that his eventual freedom would happen. William happened to be one of the lucky ones. With the help of his cousins, uncles and other slaves, William managed to escape through Philadelphia then to New York as a fugitive slave. William was tracked by authorities but had help in avoiding capture. People like Dr. Osgood and Dr. Riggles helped him avoid capture (Green, 23).","William Green was one of the fortunate slaves who ran and even got to enjoy his life as a free man. Others were not so lucky. William made his way to Hartford, Connecticut and then settled at Springfield, Massachusetts. There he married and had four children and lived a life of freedom and happiness. "],"display_date":"1840 - 1853","search_date":"1846-12-31","locations":[{"id":52769,"lat":39.0457549,"lng":-76.6412712,"zoom":8,"place":"Maryland"},{"id":52770,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"Philadelphia"},{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127837,"lng":-74.0059413,"zoom":8,"place":"New York City"},{"id":52772,"lat":42.315222,"lng":-72.5014715,"zoom":8,"place":"Hartford"},{"id":52773,"lat":42.1014831,"lng":-72.589811,"zoom":8,"place":"Springfield"}],"tags":[{"id":126,"tag":"fugitive slave"},{"id":2734,"tag":"William Green"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6421,"title":"The Civil War: Remembering the Dead","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-05-30","end_date":"1872-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The graves of all of the soldiers in the different cemeteries were strewn with flowers in Brooklyn.

Remembering was the order of the day (<em>Memphis Daily Appeal</em>, 1).","            In David Blight’s book “Race and Reunion” the history of Decoration Day is detailed. In the <em>Memphis Daily Appeal</em>, Decoration Day events of 1872 from different parts of the country were detailed. This information is significant for it shows how the nation healed during the aftermath of the Civil War. Decoration Day, which was later called Memorial Day, was a way for the nation to heal. Both the North and the South found a way to healing the scars of death by honoring and remembering their dead. Over six hundred and twenty thousand soldiers died as a result of the Civil War (Blight, 64). How to remember the slaughter of all the participants became the legacy of the war.","            In May 1868, General John Logan, Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, called on all northern soldiers to decorate the graves of their dead comrades. Twenty-seven states participated in this May 30<sup>th</sup> ritual of placing flowers on the graves and making speeches. The next year, some three hundred and fifty six cities, both in the North and the South, participated in Decoration Day activities (Blight, 71). In the South, Confederate Memorial Day was celebrated on different dates at first. April 26<sup>th</sup>, the date of General Joseph Johnson’s surrender to General William Sherman, was used by many of the southern states (Blight, 77). Some southern states such as North Carolina and South Carolina used May 10<sup>th</sup>, which was the birthday of Stonewall Jackson. Virginia used June 3<sup>rd</sup> in honor of Jefferson Davis’ birthday (Blight, 77 – 78). By 1872, both the North and the South celebrated together with May 30<sup>th</sup> as the official day for Decoration Day as the holiday helped socially heal and bring together everyone. Black veterans marched and placed flowers alongside white veterans of the Civil War (Blight, 78 – 81). Today, Memorial Day observes all who died in all wars but the focus now is on World War I, World War II, Korean and Vietnam veterans. In 1872, Civil War dead was the only focus of the May 30<sup>th</sup> remembrances."],"display_date":"May 30, 1872","search_date":"1872-05-30","locations":[{"id":52830,"lat":39.768403,"lng":-86.158068,"zoom":8,"place":"Indianapolis"},{"id":52829,"lat":38.6270025,"lng":-90.1994042,"zoom":8,"place":"St. Louis"},{"id":52828,"lat":40.4172871,"lng":-82.907123,"zoom":8,"place":"Ohio"},{"id":52827,"lat":43.0389025,"lng":-87.9064736,"zoom":8,"place":"Milwaukee"},{"id":52826,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington D.C."},{"id":52825,"lat":40.7127837,"lng":-74.0059413,"zoom":8,"place":"New York City, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":2803,"tag":"Decoration Day"},{"id":2802,"tag":"Memorial Day"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6457,"title":"New World Order In Action: Multilateralism Returns","course_id":153,"status":"P","start_date":"11/29/90","end_date":"11/29/90","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["At precisely 3:25 p.m. on Thursday, November 29, 1990, the United Nations Security Council was called to order in the UN Headquarters in New York City. This meeting held special significance because all fifteen nations of the Security Council were represented by their foreign ministers, rather than UN ambassadors. The reason for such a prestigious attendance was Resolution 678 (1990). This resolution gave the United States led coalition the authority to invade Kuwait and repulse the Iraqi army on January 17, 1991. The council president and U.S. Secretary of State James Baker gave a speech at the conclusion of the meeting, reaffirming the council’s choice to approve the resolution and demonstrating the extent to which the U.S. foreign policy had adopted multilateralism.","            In his speech, Baker emphasized the group contribution to this effort, “We have taken political, economic and military measures…we have worked out a coordinated international effort involving over fifty states…” One of the major reasons the U.S. came to rely more heavily on multilateralism during the 1990s was that it was becoming more apparent that force alone was not the most effective method of achieving U.S. goals abroad. Historian Ekaterina Stepanova enumerates other potent instruments of foreign policy that the US would employ, “economic sanctions, international legal mechanisms, political and diplomatic levers.” These tactics, many of which were used on Iraq prior to the start of the Persian Gulf War, are most effective when used in coordination with multiple nations. A further reason for the increased multilateralism was the growing globalization of the economies of the world. The famed Israeli diplomat, Abba Eban, recognized this growing trend and how it would affect global politics, “The world is integrating and fragmenting at the same time.” Eban was commenting on how the more entwined the nations of the world became, the more complex and divisive the world and its problems would likewise become. The most likely avenue of success to solve such convoluted issues would be for nations to work in concert with one another.","Baker also acknowledged how the recent geopolitical changes, most significantly the ending of the Cold War, made it possible for this resolution to exist, “the result is a new fact: a newly effective United Nations Security Council, free of the constraints of the cold war.” The Cold War and its mentality dominated the previous four decades. At the conflict’s conclusion, these perceptions began to fall away, allowing for nations to take a fresh look at the world. Historian Richard E. Feinberg related, “Now the industrial countries will be able to perceive developing nations more objectively and better appreciate their uniqueness and social systems.” In this case, the U.S., Russia and other nations of the Security Council were able to see the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, not as another showdown between the forces of communism and the forces of democracy, but simply as a breach of international law, which necessitated a united, international response."],"display_date":"November 29, 1990","search_date":"1990-11-29","locations":[{"id":52854,"lat":40.7496161,"lng":-73.9666718,"zoom":15,"place":"United Nations Headquarters, New York, N"}],"tags":[{"id":2846,"tag":"Persian Gulf War, UN"},{"id":1449883008,"tag":null}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}},{"id":6464,"title":"Protestors Impede Police Arrests at Stonewall Inn","course_id":153,"status":"P","start_date":"6/28/69","end_date":"6/28/69","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Tensions heightened between the New York City Police Department (NYCPD) and large numbers of gay, transgender, and other sexual minorities during the hot summer of 1969. Raids on gay bars, such as the Stonewall Inn, became frequent, due to laws against serving alcohol to gay people. In the early hours of June 28, the NYCPD conducted a raid on the Stonewall Inn, arresting several cross-dressing people as well as gay men and women.","The New York <em>Daily News</em> published a photograph that illustrates the outburst of anger throughout the crowd, as dozens of gay men in particular refused to stand aside for the police. This image also ties together the growing sense of outrage and willingness to do something about it, as previously the gay community was fighting quietly for their rights.","Savannah Dooley, a journalist for the LBGT magazine <em>The Advocate</em>, records that violence escalated inside the bar, with police beating one lesbian woman over the head with a club for resisting arrest. A gathering crowd outside the bar heard her cries, as well as other sounds of violence, and grew increasingly agitated. They began throwing empty beer bottles and attempted to overturn police wagons, eventually forcing the policemen inside the bar to retreat. Some participants even pried open the front door of the bar with a ripped up parking meter.","The raid on the Stonewall Inn was a touchstone for the gay civil rights movement, as noted by Rick Bragg, a reporter for the <em>New York Times</em>, looking back on the raid and subsequent riots from 1994. The raid began a series of riots that put the gay rights movement into the public eye. The influential activist group the Gay Liberation Front formed directly after the riots, reinforcing the righteous anger expressed during the raid and keeping the gay rights movement in the news. The anger felt by the demonstrators in the photo reverberated through the years after Stonewall, leading to an increased focus on gay rights and, eventually, a greater level of civil liberties for all members of the LBGT community. As Sherry Wolf, author of Sexuality and Socialism, noted: “The riots alone would not be remembered today for transforming gay politics if they had not been followed by organizations that transformed the raw outrage into an ongoing social force.”","The newspaper photo demonstrates that sense of rage reaching its limit, and would eventually be funneled into creating organizations such as the GLF. Other protestors watch in the background, signaling that the night’s events would spiral into a much larger experience, eventually becoming a benchmark in the history of the gay rights movement."],"display_date":"June 28, 1969","search_date":"1969-06-28","locations":[{"id":52861,"lat":40.7335719,"lng":-74.0027418,"zoom":7,"place":"Greenwich Village, New York, NY, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":2676,"tag":"Stonewall"},{"id":1596,"tag":"Riots"},{"id":2857,"tag":"LBGT"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}},{"id":6476,"title":"Vietnam Veteran, Ron Kovic, recalls lack of care in V.A. hospital.","course_id":153,"status":"P","start_date":"3/6/68","end_date":"3/6/68","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["After a Vietnamese rifle severed his spinal cord, Ron Kovic bounced around Vietnam field hospitals and eventually landed in a Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital in New York. Kovic found himself being treated in unbearable conditions by nurses and doctors who were often being overworked and unsupported. Kovic laid in his own filth at times while hospital staff could not make it to him to clean up his area or change his bedpan. Not only was the hospital run down and grossly understaffed but the nurses and doctors often had horrible attitudes towards the war and the veterans. Nurses even told Kovic how “nobody gives a crap about the war in Vietnam” while rats run around the filthy floors scavenging food. Meanwhile, the government failed to recognize severe problems in their VA hospitals.","            Throughout the 1960s and 1970s thousands of Vietnam veterans were coming home wounded from the war. Whether they came home with a bullet wound or missing a limb, they often spent time in VA hospitals across the nation. These hospitals often were kept in poor conditions mainly because of the lack of nurses and money that the government was spending on the war. Wounded veteran Kovic recalled that, \"It never makes any sense to us how the government can keep asking for money for weapons and leave us lying in our own filth.” The government prioritized their spending more on the war effort and less on the veterans and their treatment after returning home.","            The conditions in these hospitals and treatment of patients were often made worse because of the nursing shortage that was occurring at the time. As Kara Dixon has noted, army nurses during World War Two often numbered around forty or fifty thousand. During the Vietnam War this number reached an all time low of less than five thousand army nurses. This shortage caused many issues in the dark days of the war in Vietnam when thousands of soldiers arrived home wounded and in need of assistance.","            Since the lack of Army nurses was growing during the Vietnam War this forced the hiring of many civilian nurses and doctors to work in VA hospitals. This often led to a lack of personal care from the nurses and an understaffing of many of the hospitals. It was not uncommon for civilian nurses to oppose the war and they would let veterans know about it often. Kovic remembers vividly the day when a hospital nurse came to him and said “You can take your Vietnam and shove it up your ass.\" A comment like this showed the overall attitude of some of the nurses and the poor conditions that many of these veterans would have to return home to after serving their country."," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"March 6, 1968","search_date":"1968-03-06","locations":[{"id":21194,"lat":40.8370495,"lng":-73.8654295,"zoom":8,"place":"Bronx, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":292,"tag":"Vietnam"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":2873,"tag":"Veteran"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}},{"id":6514,"title":"Lincoln Addresses Political Corruption in Philadelphia, PA","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-17","end_date":"1864-08-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Summer of 1864 in Washington and Philadelphia, Abraham Lincoln can be seen doing one of the things that he did best; playing domestic politics.  When it came to political maneuvering and deal making, there were few to rival his adroit handling of the political landscape.  For some, seeing Lincoln as a working politician reduces the lofty pedestal we have placed him on, but political maneuvering was a key component of Lincoln's success in Washington.  Sidney Blumenthal of Newsweek rightly noted, \"But lifting Lincoln above the fray doesn’t remove him from politics. While the political Lincoln may be difficult for us to acknowledge at a time when politics and partisan commitments are widely denigrated, Lincoln’s presidency demonstrates that partisanship and political ruthlessness can be used to advance the highest ideals.\"  In Philadelphia in 1864 that meant keeping Republicans in Congress.  As a case in point, Lincoln's involvement in the events surrounding  the 1865 U.S. House of Representatives election in Pennsylvania’s 4th district provides a perfect example."," ","On June 17th 1864 the New York Tribune printed an article claiming that Postmaster-General Blair had directed the Postmaster of Philadelphia, Cornelius A. Walborn, to instruct his employees not to vote for William D. “Pig Iron” Kelley (R) in the upcoming Congressional election for the 4th district of Pennsylvania.  The next day, Postmaster Walborn denied the allegations in the Tribune and Lincoln sent him a telegram requesting that he come to Washington to see the President.  On June 19th Judge Kelley writes Lincoln and explains that he believes the Tribune article to be correct and that furthermore, he can provide witnesses and would be happy to confront Walborn with Lincoln at the White House.  On June 20th Lincoln met with Postmaster Walborn and discussed the accusation made against him. During this interview, Lincoln clearly states that Walborn is to cease any interference in the upcoming election. "," ","Over one month later, on July 28th, Lincoln sent a telegram to John W. Forney requesting that he and Morten McMichael come to see him in Washington.  While the reason for the meeting can not be ascertained from the telegram itself, further investigation reveals a possible motive. John W. Forney, a Republican, was the current Secretary of the U.S. Senate and former Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Morten McMichael was a successful Philadelphia newspaper editor and publisher, and future Republican mayor of Philadelphia.  By examining future correspondence between Lincoln and these two men, we are able to infer what they may have discussed. "," ","On August 3rd, six days after Lincoln's telegram to Forney, and four/five days after their meeting, Forney writes Lincoln from Philadelphia. In his letter, Forney alerts the president that postal workers in Philadelphia are being pressured into voting for someone they do not like, and it is not Judge Kelley, the Republican candidate. He urges the president to intervene in order to prevent political corruption from dictating the results of the upcoming election.  It can be inferred from that letter that Forney was sent to Philadelphia to investigate whether or not Walborn had ceased his earlier attempts to inappropriately influence voters. In addition to Forney’s letter, and arriving two days prior, Lincoln received a letter from Judge Kelley explaining that Walborn was still agitating against Kelley’s re-election to Congress."," ","Two days later on August 5th, Lincoln sends a message to Morten McMichael in which he asks him to convey the president's concerns to Postmaster Walborn and to remind Walborn that he promised the president that he was not interfering in the upcoming election.  Finally, four days later on August 9th, Lincoln receives from Walborn an assurance that he is faithfully upholding his promise to the president, even including a copy of the notice that has been hung in the Postmaster's office and in post offices under his control which explains that postal workers are free to vote for whomever they see fit.  This message to Lincoln from Walborn appears to settle the issue and we may infer that Lincoln was able to get Walborn back in line. "," ","In the coming election, Kelley is re-elected and he remained in office until 1890."],"display_date":"June 17, 1864 - August 9, 1864","search_date":"1864-07-13","locations":[{"id":52780,"lat":39.9550145,"lng":-75.1629427,"zoom":7,"place":"Philadelphia, PA"},{"id":52826,"lat":38.898623,"lng":-77.036535,"zoom":13,"place":"Washington D.C."},{"id":52909,"lat":40.7155044,"lng":-74.0066837,"zoom":8,"place":"New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":2969,"tag":"Lincoln Politics 1864"},{"id":2970,"tag":"Phil., PA Politics 1864"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6525,"title":"Abraham Lincoln vs. New York World Newspaper","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-05-18","end_date":"1864-05-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the course of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln was responsible for shutting down more than 300 newspapers (1).

In another telegram sent on May 18th, 1864, it is discovered that a forged document of some kind was printed in the newspaper (2). This document was a fake proclamation by Lincoln to add 400,00 troops to the Northern army (2). The Department of State quickly released a statement claiming the document was false, and Lincoln ordered an immediate shut down of the newspaper (2). It was later discovered that a man named Joseph Howard, a known prankster, was behind the forged document (2)."," ","In the telegrams sent on May 18th, 1864, it is clear that the newspaper printed a forged document that contained both Lincoln and his Secretary of War's signatures (2). An actual forged document could have raised some legal questions in regards to forgery on part of the newspaper, and most would agree that legal action should be taken in the event of forged documents. However, it was not always a forged document that caused Lincoln to shut down newspapers or detain editors without hearings. Newspapers like the New York World often heavily disagreed with Lincoln's policies and the war in general. Lincoln also suspended the writ of habeus corpus, even though Chief Justice Roger Tanney ruled this unconstitutional, citing that only Congress had the power to do so (3). Lincoln’s suppression of the New York World newspaper and other media outlets caused some controversy regarding First Amendment rights during the war, and has even sparked some modern controversy in the eye of public memory.

The Tampax company, using J. Walter Thompson & Co. advertising company, introduced its tampon to the public with a print ad in a widely read magazine on October 15, 1937. The advertisement was aimed at active women in the 13—45 age bracket. The ad had a distinctly medical slant to give credence to the product so that women would feel comfortable knowing that it was medically sound.  The ad used phrasing such as “the medical tampon used by physicians,” “perfected by a doctor,” and “recommended by gynecologists.”","The advertisement also emphasized “such comfort and freedom that they [women] are unaware of its presence.”  The ad stressed “with Tampax you wear no belts, no pins, no pads.” This coincided with the attitude that was at last becoming the norm for women—independence. Not only was it freeing, but a woman could now place her attention on her new-found independence in social circles by telling us, that it is “[p]ractical even during dancing, sport activities, taking a bath” and having “such freedom and comfort that [women] are <em>unaware of its presence!</em>”","Throughout history various methods of managing monthly blood flow have been used. For instance, in the Roman Empire cloth bandages were used by civilized members of society while “their savage sisters in Africa and Australia used bandages made of grass or vegetable fiber.” In ancient Japan women vaginally inserted layered paper held in place with a bandage.  “The commercial tampon as we know it has been shaped and re-shaped by a myriad of invisible forces—like genuine concern for women’s wellness, certainly, but also sexism, panic, feminism, capitalism, and secrecy.” Up until 1925, American women wore a diaper-like garment made of flannel, which they washed and reused. They were bulky and uncomfortable. In 1896, a sanitary napkin was manufactured by Johnson and Johnson but was withdrawn from the market because advertising this type of personal product was not seen as socially acceptable because of the terse morality of the day. There was a lot of puritanical discomfort with the concept of women touching themselves in any way in their genital area. “People thought that tampon use was inappropriate because it might break the hymen . . . and might be . . . pleasurable and might be a way for girls to experience orgasmic pleasure.”","Historically, tampons had been documented in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They were used for purposes other than menstrual management. In 1776 a French doctor describes tampons which were “tightly rolled, vinegar-soaked linen that was used to stem the flow of hemorrhage and leucorrhea.”  In the late nineteenth century Dr. Paul F. Munde, an accomplished gynecologist, described eight distinct uses for the tampon; number eight was “the absorption of vaginal and uterine discharges.\"","It was in World War I that French nurses discovered that the bandages they used to stop the bleeding of wounded soldiers could be used by menstruating women. The material was more absorbent than the cloth diapers that were used at that time. Slowly, women’s personal products came out of the closet.  Attitudes began to change as women flooded into the work force and became increasingly independent.  Advertisers picked up on this and Tampax went on to become “one of the great game-changers in twentieth century periods.”"],"display_date":"October 15, 1937","search_date":"1937-10-15","locations":[{"id":52909,"lat":40.7127837,"lng":-74.0059413,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":3078,"tag":"tampon"},{"id":3079,"tag":"tampons"},{"id":3080,"tag":"Tampax"},{"id":3081,"tag":"Tampax tampons"},{"id":3082,"tag":"period"},{"id":3083,"tag":"women's periods"},{"id":3084,"tag":"menstruation"},{"id":1849,"tag":"Advertisement"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":162,"school_id":43}},{"id":6613,"title":"Her American Dream: Shirley Chisholm for President","course_id":163,"status":"P","start_date":"12/24/71","end_date":"12/24/71","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the night of December 24, 1971, New York City mayor John V. Lindsay invited the congresswoman from Brooklyn, Shirley Chisholm, to his mansion. Progressive politicians across the country worried about the split in voters if the three potential candidates continued their campaigns for president. Lindsay took it upon himself to convince Chisholm to drop out of the race in order to not draw the black vote away from himself, or from South Dakota Senator, George McGovern. However, the congresswoman remained intent on her goal to shine a spotlight on the corruption and foot dragging of white, male politicians. She fired back, “If you’re so worried about cutting into the progressive vote, why don’t you and McGovern get together - and one of you decide to back out?” Chisholm saw herself as a representative of the American Dream, a black woman making a run for the most powerful position in the country.","Shirley Chisholm became the first black female congresswoman in 1968. After winning her congressional seat, Chisholm stated, “I will fight until I can’t fight anymore. I don’t mind the challenge.” As a congresswoman, she remained outspoken. Her maiden speech to Congress was against spending in Vietnam, and in it she argued that war funding should be redirected to attack hunger and poverty. Chisholm saw fit to hire a largely female staff in order to provide more opportunities for advancement for women in politics. She also sat as an honorary President of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws. Chisholm stood out as a symbol for the black, working class district that voted for her because she never lost touch with her constituency. She argued that the major problem with Congress was that politicians feared sacrificing their political careers in order to stand up for the people they represented. Her independence and reputation as a spitfire left her without many allies in government, so she passed little legislation. However, as historian Julie Gallagher notes, Chisholm chose to fight what she saw as a stagnant system from the inside out.","Chisholm was a symbol of political success for many across the country. She eventually chose to run for president to break the mold. She ran in order to show that an African American woman could make a serious attempt at taking the highest office in the country. The political climate created by social movements of the 1960s and 1970s primed Chisholm’s candidacy, along with her ability to identify with those around her. While she received the endorsement of the Black Panther Party, most black leadership and women’s organizations offered little more than verbal encouragement to her campaign. As a powerful figure to minority groups, multiple interest groups tried to own her and her candidacy in order to bring national attention to their cause. However, Chisholm resisted the ownership of interest groups. She continued in her campaign as an independent exposing the problems with status quo politics. This independence contributed to her defeat by Senator George McGovern for the 1972 Democratic nomination."],"display_date":"December 24, 1971","search_date":"1971-12-24","locations":[{"id":52987,"lat":40.776058,"lng":-73.9430817,"zoom":11,"place":"Gracie Mansion, New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":2261,"tag":"women in politics"},{"id":1561,"tag":"1972 Election"},{"id":1519,"tag":"Shirley Chisholm"},{"id":2021,"tag":"African American history"}],"course":{"name":"History of U.S. Presidential Elections","school":"Wayne State University","course_id":163,"school_id":92}},{"id":6622,"title":"The Evolution of Hospital Beds","course_id":165,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/21","end_date":"12/31/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The evolution of the hospital bed has changed drastically since it the concept was first thought of in the early nineteen hundreds.  They became important when patients were needing procedures done and had to stay in the hospital for a significant amount of time.  Nurses were a major influence on changes that were made to hospital beds in the beginning of medicine due to the fact that they were the ones who were at the patients bed side providing close care to the patients, thus discovering how a hospital bed could be most useful when providing the highest quality of patient care during this time period (U. 1963).","The Textbook of Surgical Nursing, which was written in 1921, is a good way to understand how hospital beds were first assembled and what the purpose was to provide better patient care.  The first hospital beds used, if they can still be called that with the hospital beds that we in medicine know today, they were essential just tables with no padding, sheets, or pillows (U. 1963).","All of these simple things we know to be standards in hospital care today.  Although this textbook was written for education purposes in the United States, it is recognized in this textbook that other countries around the world use different standards for hospital beds used in medical care (U. 1963).  It is thought that all hospital beds are like the ones found here in the United States of America but as The Textbook of Surgical Nursing points out this is not the case."],"display_date":"1921 - 1963","search_date":"1942-07-02","locations":[{"id":52994,"lat":47.7626174,"lng":-120.1909114,"zoom":7,"place":"Ellensberg, WA"},{"id":52909,"lat":44.1158828,"lng":-78.032887,"zoom":21,"place":"New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":3167,"tag":"hospital bed"},{"id":3147,"tag":"Bed"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":165,"school_id":94}},{"id":6752,"title":"Dr. Josephine Baker: Baby Savior of Hell's Kitchen","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/02","end_date":"6/1/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Manhattan neighborhood of Hell’s Kitchen was truly living up to its name in the summer of 1902. The oppressive heat and ripe stench gripped at Dr. Sara Josephine Baker as she climbed floor after floor of the crowded tenements, knocking on doors in the neighborhood in search of sick babies as part of her job with the New York City Department of Health. Dr. Baker was faced with all measures of poverty and squalor- cockroaches skittering across the floors, dead flies floating in milk bottles, and “dying baby after dying baby.” At the time, as many as 1500 babies died every week during that summer, and it was Dr. Baker’s job to record and report these statistics. According to her memoirs, Dr. Baker recounted that mothers felt helpless against the epidemics of the day: “[The mothers] were just horribly fatalistic about it while it was going on. Babies always died in summer and there was no point in trying to do anything about it.”","Dr. Baker later collected her recommendations for new mothers based on her years of fieldwork and research into her 1920 book, Healthy Babies. This handbook for mothers does not offer cures for diseases, but instead offers suggestions on how to keep a baby well. In the preface of the book, Dr. Baker makes it clear that “methods of keeping babies well are simple and easy,” and emphasizes many times over that any mother with common sense can provide a clean and safe environment for her child. In clear and concise language, Dr. Baker instructs mothers on what temperature to keep the nursery (66 to 68 degrees in the day), and dictates if babies must have toys, they should be washable. Dr. Baker wrote this book based on the assumption that a mother could positively impact her baby’s health rather than leaving it to chance, and also promotes the idea of “wellness” over simply “not being sick.” The existence of such a book reflects the time it was written. Between her sweltering summer in Hell’s Kitchen and the year this book was published, infant health in New York City improved by leaps and bounds, and much of this can be attributed to Dr. Baker herself.","The years of fieldwork amongst the poorest of New York City’s families inspired Dr. Baker as she rose through the ranks of the Department of Health, where she eventually held the position of Commissioner of Health. In 1908, she was appointed director of the newly formed Bureau of Child Hygiene, the first agency of its kind in the United States, and immediately began efforts to coordinate the programs all of the child hygiene agencies in the city. Dr. Baker’s programs exemplified public health at its best, streamlining and connecting existing organizations to work together towards the common goal of preventing child mortality and improving conditions of child hygiene across the board. Under her guidance, every reported new mother was visited by a public health nurse, who instructed the mother on proper care and feeding practices and gave her informational pamphlets. Milk stations, which provided the city’s mothers with quality milk for their babies at low prices or for free, partnered with Dr. Baker’s bureau and developed into child health stations. These stations not only offered nutritious food for children, but offered education on child care, and later provided vaccinations. By the time Dr. Baker retired in 1923, New York City had the lowest infant mortality rate in the country. Dr. Sara Josephine Baker’s impact on infant health in New York City, and public health as a whole, cannot be overstated."],"display_date":"June 1, 1902 - June 1, 1920","search_date":"1911-06-01","locations":[{"id":53100,"lat":40.7830603,"lng":-73.9712488,"zoom":13,"place":"Manhattan, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3450,"tag":"josephine baker"},{"id":3449,"tag":"infant health"},{"id":579,"tag":"New York City"},{"id":1122,"tag":"Public Health"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}},{"id":6759,"title":"Emily Blackwell becomes the third woman to earn a medical degree in the United States!","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-01","end_date":"1893-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Inspired by her older sister, Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell (the first woman to earn a medical degree in the United States), Dr. Emily Blackwell studied medicine. Like her sister, she did not have an easy journey. Dr. Blackwell’s sister warned her from the beginning, “a blank wall of social and professional antagonism faces the woman physician that forms a situation of painful loneliness, leaving her without support, respect or professional counsel.” She was rejected from eleven medical schools, due to complaints from male students, but continued to carry on.","            Medicine at this time, in 1854, was going through a transition. The onset of industrialization brought about important alterations in the organization of work and family life, which created a change to the role of women, and made more middle-class women comfortable with studying medicine. Before this time, there was a specific role for women that limited them, they were to stay at home and care for the house and children. The advances in medical science have begun to call traditional therapeutics into question, and older concepts of professionalism are being challenged. Women brought another element to medicine, humanity.","            Emily saved money for her education through her salary as a teacher, and persisted on for the cause of women in medicine, and for this she was willing to struggle. Prior, Dr. Emily Blackwell was studying, and teaching, music. “I soon felt the want of a more engrossing pursuit than the study of music, German, and metaphysics. The suggestion of studying medicine was first presented to me by a lady friend who was ill and said to me, “if I could be treated by a lady doctor, my worst suffering would have been spared me.” Dr. Blackwell went on to write to physicians she knew through her family, and in various parts in the country, about the possibilities of a woman becoming a physician. Most of her responses concluded with, “the idea is a great one, but also impossible.” Using this as inspiration, she started her journey. After spending a year at Rush Medical College her studies ended, the college bowed to pressure from the state medical society and rescinded her admission. 1852, she spent the summer in New York, gaining practical experience at her sister’s side among poor immigrant women. She went on to attend Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where she became the second woman to earn a medical degree after graduating in 1854. At the time of her graduation there were 1,206 students, with her being the only woman.","In 1857 the Blackwell sisters and established the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children. By 1874 the infirmary served over 7,000 patients annually. In 1868, the Blackwell sisters established the Women's Medical College in New York City. Emily became professor of obstetrics and, in 1869, became dean of the college. In 1876 it became a three-year institution, and in 1893 it became a four-year college, ahead of much of the profession. By 1899 the college had trained 364 women doctors. Dr. Emily Blackwell’s determination to not give up on pursuing a profession in medicine inspired many women to follow in her footsteps.

Typically docile, well-mannered, and pious, she shouted obscenities, overcome with rage displayed in forceful expressions of perversions. Dr. Alphonso Rockwell could do little to comfort the woman and spent most of the night there. The evening was interrupted when William Miller, a kind-hearted and elderly “electrician,” arrived at the door with a single, ordinary induction coil. Amusedly, Rockwell watched the uneducated man administer a dose of electricity, hereby witnessing unforeseen positive results. ","In <em>Rambling recollections: an autobiography</em>, Rockwell detailed his experience treating a woman with brain inflammation and impotence in remedying the increasingly common condition. Historical and sociological research published in<em> Pushbutton Psychiatry</em> explained its growing presence as the consequence of evolving American culture. In the years following the Civil War, new liberties complicated life and affected the psyche. Nerve sensitivities were exhausted by new demands of politics, religion, education, and philosophical thought. Women were deemed particularly susceptible, ill-equipped to handle such great mental activity. In 1868, medicine provided no relief for these mental afflictions, but Rockwell’s patient provided him undeniable proof of the need for alternative treatment.","Research into Miller’s method proved risky. Electrotherapeutics were mentioned only in hushed voices, considered little more than quackery. The stigma stemmed from its cultivation by ignorant laymen, based solely on experience rather than pathology or electrophysiology. Its early application was crude, a current forced into the body using a battery or induction coil and wire—without knowledge of various electric currents or their effects on diseases. The media further influenced the stigma with advertisements for illegitimate at-home devices, rendering physicians powerless to distinguish electrotherapeutics as medical science. Entering this field could quickly tarnish a doctor’s reputation. ","However, the meeting with Miller gripped him. Despite professional hazards, Rockwell retired his general practitioner title and began an apprenticeship under him. He began his own practice and recorded thousands of cases with his silent partner, Dr. George Beard. He experimented on charity cases directed from Beard’s clinic to develop theories and standard applications. After only two years, they accumulated enough research to publish several articles, which piqued substantial curiosity in the medical community. In 1871, they published <em>A practical treatise on the medical and surgical uses of electricity, including localized and general electrization</em>. This lengthy piece explained what lay-practitioners could not: electrization was a stimulating tonic that immediately disrupted ailments and, after long-term exposure, improved disposition and strengthened the brain and muscles’ capacity for labor. This revelation was invaluable in remedying the overly-taxed population. "," ","Rockwell could not have known his visit to a hysterical patient would be a catalyst for the scientific acceptance of a quack treatment. He provided strong evidence that electrotherapeutics could increase the ability to tackle the demands of modernizing civilization. Its merit was validated by prestigious individuals seeking its benefits and widespread introduction of electrotherapeutic devices in institutions. Though methodology hardly resembles its beginning, the practice continues to be used in the modern day, despite the persistent stigma and controversy that accompany it. "],"display_date":"1868 - 1871","search_date":"1869-12-31","locations":[{"id":53110,"lat":40.8115504,"lng":-73.9464769,"zoom":8,"place":"Harlem"},{"id":8915,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":8,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3472,"tag":"alternative medicine"},{"id":3489,"tag":"Electrotherapeutics"},{"id":3490,"tag":"Electricity"},{"id":3491,"tag":"Shock therapy"},{"id":3492,"tag":"Quack medicine"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}},{"id":6767,"title":"Icones Anatomicae: Reviving a Passion in Science and Medicine 400 Years in the Making","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/34","end_date":"12/31/34","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the year 1543, Andreus Vesalius published the <em>De Humani Corporis Fabricae</em> and revolutionized the medical landscape. The work was a masterpiece. It combined the fields of art and anatomy and cut to the core of human anatomical understanding. In order to most accurately depict the anatomy of the human body, Vesalius employed several artists and had them attend anatomical dissections and demonstrations. Their beautiful drawings were then transferred to woodblocks for printing, and here is where our story begins. The original woodblocks were lost for nearly 400 years until in 1932 Dr. Samuel Lambert, President of the New York Academy of Medicine, heard a colleague make mention of an anatomy professor at Basel who wrote of the survival of several original blocks at the University of Munich Library. An ecstatic Dr. Lambert then set into motion a series of events that would culminate in the 1934 publication of <em>Icones Anatomicae</em>.","<em>Icones Anatomicae</em> is a masterpiece in itself. It is an anthology consisting of the <em>De Humani Corporis Fabricae, </em>the<em> Tabulae Anatomicae Sex, </em>several personal letters, and a few of Vesalius’ previously unpublished works.  The publication was received with much acclaim. The influence of Andreus Vesalius and his impact on the field of medicine were already well understood in the early twentieth century, but not many knew why. Several physicians, historians, and artists decided that along with the publication of <em>Icones Anatomicae,</em> an explanation of the significance of Vesalius and his work was necessary. J.B. Saunders and Charles O’Malley held nothing back in their praise of Vesalius in their 1950 book, <em>The Illustrations from the Works of Andreas Vesalius of Brussels.</em> They explain that his work signaled “the beginning of modern observational science and research,” essentially calling Vesalius the father of not just anatomy, but of <em>all of modern science</em>. Saunders and O’Malley go on to compare Vesalius to the likes of Hippocrates, Galen, Harvey, and Lister. Then, in 1952, John F. Fulton published <em>Three Vesalian Essays to accompany the Icones Anatomicae of 1934</em>, hoping to further illustrate why Vesalius was so important and why the publication of <em>Icones Anatomicae</em> was such a momentous occasion. Samuel Lambert commissioned the essays in 1932 hoping to give modern context to the significance of <em>Icones Anatomicae </em>and the impact of Vesalius’ work. ","Before Vesalius, science, and specifically anatomy and medicine, lectures were taught from purely textual classic sources, such as Galen. Vesalius was the first to emphasize the importance of visual aids in scientific texts. Vesalius’ contributions to the fields of anatomy, medicine, and art have undeniable influence. Vesalius is just as notable, important, and influential as other renaissance figures. <em>Icones Anatomicae </em>and the essays, books, and articles published to accompany it attempt to outline just how much of an impact Vesalius had on modern science and medicine. Vesalius was able to revive a collective passion in medicine after a millennia and a half of stagnation. He imbued the pursuit of knowledge with a certain art.

The film dramatized the aftermath of a nuclear confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union. The movie took place in Kansas City, Missouri and included cities such as Lawrence, Kansas. <em>The Day After</em> explored the effects of nuclear war from the perspective of ordinary Americans. The story focuses on several sets of characters: most notably Russell Oakes (played by Jason Robards), a doctor and professor at the University of Kansas, the Dahlbergs, a farming family from Harrisonville, Missouri and Billy McCoy (played by William Allen Young), an Air Force reservist stationed at Whiteman Air Base. The film became infamous at the time for scenes of violence and the graphic portrayal of characters perishing from radiation sickness. The movie ends with the ominous warning that “the catastrophic events you have just witnessed, are in all likelihood less severe than the destruction that would actually occur in the event of a full nuclear strike against the United States…” <em>The Day After</em> attracted 100 million viewers, and remains the highest rated television movie in U.S. history.","The controversy surrounding the movie’s release caused an uproar among the American population. Americans criticized U.S. nuclear policy because of what they had seen in the film. ABC and the White House received hundreds of calls from anxious viewers, many of whom supported the movie’s message. Anti-nuclear activists rallied behind movements such as “Let Lawrence Live” and 800-NUCLEAR. Those in favor of nuclear deterrence, however, worried that the emotional fall-out of the movie and controversy surrounding it would negate any critical analysis of nuclear weapons. Director Nicholas Meyer stood firmly on the side of the anti-nuclear activists, denouncing ABC’s attempts to tone down the movie’s political nature. According to historian Deron Overpeck, Meyer wanted to “clobber sixty-million people over the head” with his criticisms of nuclear weapons.","The role <em>The Day After</em> played in changing U.S. nuclear policy is debatable. When the movie premiered in 1983, U.S. relations with the Soviet Union were at their worst levels in twenty years. President Ronald Reagan viewed it days before its premier on ABC. While the movie left Reagan shaken and disheartened, he continued to defend nuclear deterrence as a means to pressure the Soviet Union to the negotiating table. Despite this, <em>The Day After</em> spurred public conversation about nuclear war to reach levels unseen since the Cuban Missile Crisis twenty-one years earlier.

Broady in New York City's General Sessions Court. Broady was a private investigator and attorney who pleaded guilty to “three charges of eleven-count of indictment charged with conspiracy and making false representations in order to obtain information from telephone companies”. Judge Mitchell D. Schweitzer sentenced Broady to a six-month suspended sentence on Feb 25th. Regarding what a suspended sentence entailed, it meant that the judge decided to delay the defendant’s prison sentence after he was been found guilty. The judge granted Broady a period of probation, rather than immediately having the defendant serve his sentence. As long as Broady does not break the law again and fulfills the conditions in his probation, his prison sentence would be lifted. Judge Schweitzer noted that the defendant was already serving a “two-four year term for illegal wiretapping - a term that he began serving [in January], so he considered the idea of giving Broady another sentence to serve no purpose”. The sentence that the judge is referring to occurred back in 1955, when Broady was convicted for his involvement in a secret wiretapping business in an apartment located on 360 E. 55th Street, New York City. This organization was linked to 100,000 of the city's telephones. Broady’s collaborators were Shannon B. Warren, an electrical technician; and Walter Asmann and Carl R. Ruh, two members of the New York telephone company. These men placed taps on multiple “business and private phones, and sold the information” to clients. All of the men who involved were detained during a police raid in 1955.  ","As a consequence of this operation’s discovery, it exposed to NYC authorities how easy it was for third parties to illicitly tap into the city’s extensive telephone network. During the 1950s, the crime of eavesdropping in the state of New York existed in a gray area. While the American federal government considered illegal wiretapping as an uncondonable crime, the New York state’s government was far more lenient towards the practice, as its own independent legistation allowed the practice to operate with and without court approval. This meant that there were significant disparities between the federal and state wiretapping statutes. With this knowledge in mind, Broady argued in his 1956 trial that “all state efforts to penalize wiretapping and conduct associated with wiretapping were unconstitutional”. With this argument, Broady attempted to try to avoid being punished for his criminal activity via a legal loophole. This pressured the legal authorities to bring the eavesdroppers to trial as soon as possible, as they were aware of this issue in New York’s wiretapping laws. The original court case in the 50's resulted with Broady being convicted as the operation's brainchild. As for his accomplices, they were acquitted of any charges because they agreed to testify against him. Due to the outcome of this case, the federal government decided to update New York's legal code on wiretapping. By 1957, the state of New York made the practice of unwarranted wiretapping to be officially illegal. Any illegally intercepted evidence was outlawed from being submitted in New York courts. The state’s legal definition of eavesdropping was updated to include bugging on microphones and dictaphones.  "],"display_date":"January 14, 1945 - February 26,

In 1986, DC Comics announced Dennis O’Neil as the writer for the revitalization of the investigative reporter and vigilante hero, The Question.  Originally created by Steve Ditko for Charlton Comics in 1967, The Question, aka Vic Sage, represented a move away from the wholesome, all-powerful superhero and toward a grittier, more human hero.  O’Neil described The Question as an emblem of “human perfectibility,” as much more realistic and flawed than the superheroes of the late 1950s and 1960s.  The Question was to be a vigilante antihero, combatting growing crime and corruption in the nation’s inner cities.  Because of “direct-market distribution” (Wright 277), the comic book industry no longer had to follow the Comics Code Authority in order to sell their characters, so <em>The Question</em> and other comics were able to show the darker and more violent side of American cities.  Distrust in government following the Vietnam War and the perception of rapidly growing crime in inner cities in 1980s America informed the updating of DC’s antihero detective The Question.","            The dishonesty and ineffectiveness of the local government in the revamped <em>The Question</em> comic books reflected the views about government in America following the Vietnam War.  Richard Young asserts that “the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal encouraged enormous public distrust in official state institutions” (566) and that comics in the 1980s “often endorsed an uncompromising anti?establishment ideology that opposed all government, big or small” (563).  People felt as though the war was orchestrated by selfish and inept politicians who cared more about reinforcing an outdated ideology than about the actual citizens.  Vic Sage operated in Hub City, which O’Neil describes as a “cesspool” of crime and corruption.  The mayor, Wesley Fermin, was an inept leader being influenced by Reverend Doctor Jeremiah Hatch, who used the city’s resources for his own personal benefit.  Fermin and Hatch represented government officials who failed in their duty to serve the people, lying to and stealing from city dwellers whenever it was deemed necessary.  The Question’s resistance to this narrative of government corruption gave comic book readers the ability to express their anger and frustration toward their leaders.  DC’s newly revived character reflected the public’s lack of trust in government, not only to use power honestly, but also to protect them from violent crime in the inner cities.","            The growing fear of crime in urban areas during the 1980s led to the introduction of vigilante antiheroes in comic books, which include <em>The Question</em>.  Decades of white flight to the suburbs and the moving of American industry overseas left many poor people of color out of work.  Unable to find well paying jobs, some people turned to crime in order to make money.  The distribution of crack cocaine contributed to a massive growth in the crime rate and overwhelmed law enforcement agencies.  White Americans lived in terror that criminals from the city would travel to their quiet streets and so began a crusade against inner city lawlessness.  Tyler Scully and Kenneth Moorman argue that “A new fear gripped the nation, one that was quite foreign to generations past: a fear of crime, particularly violent, street crime” (635).  Already unhappy with the government after years of fruitless war, the public turned to vigilantes to make themselves feel safer.  The comic book industry created characters such as The Question in response to the popularity of real-life vigilante heroes.  Inspired by urban detectives from the early 1900s, Vic Sage did for the people of Hub City what Fermin and Hatch could not.  He operated outside of the law and worked to clean up the crime-ridden streets of Hub City.  Dennis O’Neil’s reimagining of <em>The Question </em>demonstrated the public’s anxiety about inner city crime and support for vigilante antiheroes.","            The revitalization of <em>The Question</em> by Dennis O’Neil in 1986 reflected the anti-government feelings of the public during the decade.  The failure of the Vietnam War and the rapidly growing fear of inner cities caused many people lose trust in their leaders.  Vigilantes, both real and imagined, captured the attention of many Americans.  DC’s revival of <em>The Question</em> and development of Hub City addressed the concerns of comic book readers during the 1980s."],"display_date":"December 1, 1986 - December 31,

the excitement of a new baseball season approaching during the spring of 1871, several changes to the league became newsworthy. In an article of the <em>New York Times</em> titled, “The Baseball Occurrences of March,” an interesting conversation took place on the advancement of the sport.  For the first time, a convention of delegates from each of the professional clubs in the country convened on March 17, 1871 in New York, to “make arrangements in which the disputes over the selection of umpires may be avoided.” Post-Civil War baseball, still in its infancy, took the country by surprise with its soaring popularity. In dire need of regulations and professional officiation, the ball teams came together to remedy problems with the officiation for what would become America’s pastime within a generation.","The league grew to a point where official rules and regulations became a necessity as high monetary stakes and betting become popular throughout the healing Union.  Benjamin Rader, the author of <em>Baseball: A history of America’s Game</em> stated, “American baseball players tended to exploit every area within the game for which there was no explicit rule or penalties levied for violations.” Frequently there were problems with the officiating of games. In the early days of baseball, teams chose the umpire for contest, but with “a growing premium placed on winning” this unofficial process became a frequently disputed topic due to biased calls. For instance, in 1882, Richard Higham a National League umpire was, “expelled from the game after the league judged him guilty of collusion with gamblers” according to MLB official reports. In another case, one pitcher threw fifty balls to a hitter to discourage him from hitting. Obviously, a hindrance to the game, the league implemented umpires to call strikes on hitters who refused to swing at “good balls” as well as distinguish the difference between a ball and a strike.  These rules, authorized in 1858 by the National Association of Baseball (NABBP), changed the game, but also gave the power to the umpire to rule a previously relaxed officiation of the game. By 1879, according to MLB official information, umpires were “given the authority to impose fines for illegal acts.”","At the beginning, baseball captured the attention of folks from the northeast all the way to the far west. Teams sprouted up in cities and evolved into a commercial league. The incentive to field the “top nine” created a game of competition. With the addition of betting, beer, and eventually hotdogs and popcorn, high stakes baseball needed proper officiation. By the turn of the century, no longer were teams choosing umpires for the contests, rather, it became the league’s responsibility. The official umpiring association today is called the World Umpiring Association and is the bargaining agent for Major League Umpires."," "],"display_date":"March 1, 1871","search_date":"1871-03-01","locations":[{"id":52825,"lat":40.752999449846,"lng":-73.777068841493,"zoom":9,"place":"New York City, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":235,"tag":"Sports"},{"id":1902,"tag":"recreation"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6884,"title":"The Legend and Lesbian Visibility Movement created by Dyke TV","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"6/1/93","end_date":"1/31/03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["“Now is the perfect time to join Dyke TV’s membership roster and join hundreds of lesbians around the country who are making Dyke TV happen”.2 The original Dyke TV subscription letter from 1994 was sent out by the station’s creators: Ana Maria Simo, Linda Chapman and Mary Patierno. These three women fought against the mass media in order to portray real-life lesbians on television, instead of the stereotyped version of lumberjack women who lusted after white married women. Through Dyke TV, they were able to do segments on various aspects of lesbian life, such as: Lesbian Health, Workplace, Street Squad’s “Dyke on the Street”, and I Was a Lesbian Child, where adult women would narrate their childhood photos to the audience. As these segments made their way into the homes of thousands of Americans across the country, they played a massive role in opening the virgin eyes of some to the idea that it was acceptable to be a lesbian. Dyke TV reminded some that they had the right to not only be tolerated, but to be accepted, respected and loved, no matter their sexuality.  ","Dyke TV played an integral part in the lesbian visibility movement. “The political moment of identity politics is over. Now it is time for people to come together”.1 The main purpose of creating Dyke TV was not to create an institution, but a single political movement that lesbians and other individuals could get behind who had been previously left out of alternative movements. Though the lesbians remained in their positions fighting for the rights of others, they also demanded their own political liberation, sexual liberation and liberation in all forms for themselves.  ","While Dyke TV ended airing its shows in 2003, it had lived up to its goal and motto, “to incite, provoke and organize”.2 Dyke TV assisted in the organization and operation of multiple protest marches about the lack of lesbian rights in America. They marched in New York City, Washington D.C., London, Germany, San Francisco, and Seattle. Because of Dyke TV, many lesbians who felt that they did not belong to or in a movement finally had a voice that was heard by the public and gained support by other movements, eventually leading the way to the creation of the LGBTQ+ political movement and group that lives today.  "],"display_date":"June 1993 - January 1903","search_date":"1948-04-01","locations":[{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":8,"place":"New York City"}],"tags":[{"id":3287,"tag":"Lesbian"},{"id":3691,"tag":"Dyke TV"},{"id":3692,"tag":"LGBTQ+"},{"id":3693,"tag":"Lesbian Visibility"},{"id":3694,"tag":"Lesbian Movement"},{"id":3695,"tag":"New York Marches"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":186,"school_id":69}},{"id":6888,"title":"A Shell Shocked Woman","course_id":190,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/17","end_date":"12/31/17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 3rd, 1917, Mrs. De Saulles, a wife and mother in New York City, murdered her husband, shooting him dead after he threatened to take their son away. In a surprising turn of events, however, Mrs. De Saulle’s defense team claimed that she suffered from shell shock, a psychological condition associated with soldiers who had experienced bombing in the Great War. The <em>New York Times</em> reported, “(Her defense team)...will argue that the announcement that she was not to have her son anymore was the equivalent of explosion of a shell in her presence and that she suffered from the same lapse of memory which has been produced frequently in soldiers.” The <em>New York Times</em> asked the doctor who diagnosed her if he considered Mrs. De Saulles to be mentally sane, to which he replied, “I do not.” He argued that the diagnosis of shell shock rendered her insane and not responsible for her actions. These words had a concrete impact on the court: the jury declared her innocent. She later went on to gain custody of her son and live a complete life as a mother.","Shell shock was a new disorder that emerged during World War I, a confusing mental disease that left both soldiers and doctors in a state of turmoil. No one knew the causes or the boundaries of this powerful and harmful illness. Symptoms included tremors, loss of sight and hearing, and memory loss. Social stigmas surrounded shell shock, including ideas of cowardice, femininity, and hysteria. Doctors often accused men of faking their symptoms, not understanding how serious or critical this mental illness was.  For the first year of the war, medical and miliatary authorities did not take shell shock seriously.","Mrs. De Saulles’s case shows the gradual, widespread acceptance of this disease. Claiming shell shock, a mental disease that many believed did not exist, cleared her of her husband’s murder. It took several years for this mental disease to gain recognition and to be taken seriously. In the earlier stages of the war, authorities criticized soldiers for claiming shell shock, but now even a non-soldier asserted this disease with success. Not just any individual, but a woman. Her claim of shell shock was successful: she won her court case, as the jury believed in shell shock as a genuine mental condition. This court case of Mrs. De Saulles, accused of murder, showed powerful strides in acceptance of mental health and the gradual defeat of the stigma surrounding shell shock."],"display_date":"August 1, 1917 - December 31, 1917","search_date":"1917-10-16","locations":[{"id":8915,"lat":40.702799328925,"lng":-73.90271488317,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":91,"tag":"Murder"},{"id":3700,"tag":"Shell Shock"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"SUNY New Paltz","course_id":190,"school_id":102}},{"id":6892,"title":"Ethel Rosenberg: A Story","course_id":186,"status":"P","start_date":"8/11/50","end_date":"6/19/53","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["“I decline to answer on the grounds that this might tend to incriminate me,”[1] would be repeated nearly twenty-three times by Ethel Rosenberg on that uncomfortable, eighty-eight-degree day in the Southern District Federal Court in New York on August 11, 1950. She was put on the stand by the prosecution because she and her husband, Julius, were charged with espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union. The trial lasted a month. The Rosenbergs refused an offer of life imprisonment if they pled guilty. As a result, they were executed by electric chair in 1953. It was during the height of McCarthyism that the guilt of Ethel and her husband would come into question as they had been widely believed to have been framed.[2] It is understandable that the guilt of a couple like the Rosenburgs, an all-American family with two children and acted like a regular American family by all accounts, would have been called into question during the Second Red Scare in the 1950s and 1960s because no one in America would want to think that during a time of intense fear and paranoia like the Cold War that an all-around all American couple would go against the nation they were citizens of in order to support the Soviet Union and follow the beliefs of the, at the time, communist Russia because all that did was make everyone extra paranoid about secret communists being everywhere secretly watching what the American people.","According to the FBI’s Vault on Ethel Rosenburg, during the trial, her attorney would ask the jurors in his opening statement, “to not condemn her merely because David Greenglass was a confessed conspirator. He stated that she had protested her innocence from the beginning and that she was dragged into the case by the machinations of the Greenglasses, who wished to lighten their burdens.”[3] Mr. Greenglass, in his testimony against Ethel and Julius, would state, “Ethel told Ruth [wife of David Greenglass] that David was working on the atom bomb project at Los Alamos, and they wanted him to give information concerning the bomb. Ruth told the Rosenbergs that she didn’t think it was a good idea and declined to convey their requests to David. Ethel and Julius then told Ruth that she should at least tell David about it and see if he would help. Julius pointed out that Russia was an ally and deserved the information, and that Russia was not getting all the information that was due her.”[3] Whether or not Ethel Rosenburg was actively participating in acts of espionage for the Soviet Union concerning the atom bomb is difficult to prove as she was not at all cooperative with the FBI during the investigation or the courts during trial."],"display_date":"August 11, 1950 - June 19, 1953","search_date":"1952-01-14","locations":[{"id":52771,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":2,"place":"New York City"},{"id":53217,"lat":35.8800364,"lng":-106.3031138,"zoom":2,"place":"Los Alamos New Mexico"}],"tags":[{"id":3705,"tag":"The Cold War"},{"id":3704,"tag":"Ethel Rosenberg"},{"id":1205,"tag":"Women's History"},{"id":3703,"tag":"Cold War America"},{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"}],"course":{"name":"American Women's History","school":"Schreiner University","course_id":186,"school_id":69}}]}
