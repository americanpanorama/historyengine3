The three candidates for President, Democrat James Buchanan, Republican John Fremont and the Whig/ American Millard Fillmore were thus reticent of the fact that they would need to make decisive statement about slavery in order to capture votes.  Fremont was decidedly anti slavery, vowing to quell its expansion if elected. Fillmore took a strong stance in support of slavery in an attempt to win southern votes, declaring that if Fremont won, he would not submit to his rule, and the South should not either.  Buchanan took a middle ground, sympathizing with southerners and stating that slavery was an issue for the individual states to decide upon which garnered him southern support.  &lt;br /&gt;All three parties used print as a way to endorse their candidates.  Tickets for both the Democratic and Whig/ American Parties, specifically informed constituents the candidates to vote for in their specific districts when voting day, November 4, came.  The broadsides backing Buchanan and Fillmore are not surprisingly from southern districts while one would be hard pressed to find broadsides for Fremont in the South.  Simply put, Fremont and the Republicans did not have any semblance of southern support in the 1850s.  The Republican Party would not be able to attract many southerners to their ticket until the twentieth century.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, James Buchanan defeated Fremont and Fillmore.  Although, Fillmore succeeded in attracting southern votes, like the majority of New Orleans' residents, Buchanan had more mass appeal.  The defeat of Fremont was seen as a victory in the dispute for control of Kansas by pro slavery advocates, but this victory turned out to be short lived. Buchanan, the fifteenth president and the only bachelor to ever hold the position, is commonly viewed as one of the worst presidents in the history of the nation.  Buchanan proved to be ineffective at repairing the then growing split between the North and the South; this split eventually led to the secession of southern states and the war that later ensued."],"display_date":"November 4, 1856","search_date":"1856-11-04","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":54,"title":"Republicans Run their First Presidential Candidate\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-11-04","end_date":"1856-11-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Republican Party was formed as an anti-slavery party and in the presidential election of 1856, John Fremont became the party's first candidate for president.  Ironically, Fremont was the only candidate in the presidential election from the South, yet he was also the only one who spoke out against slavery.  Fremont campaigned to wipe out what he felt to be the two biggest sins plaguing the country: polygamy and slavery.  Fremont was an explorer of the western frontier and proved to be effective at promoting the idea of Manifest Destiny.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The political climate of the era remained particularly tense due to conflict in Kansas and Missouri over slavery.  This anti-slavery stance did not help him gain popularity with the majority of southerners.  In addition, Fremont, if elected, wanted to admit Kansas into the Union as a free state, which enraged southerners even more.  Southerners were further provoked by speeches given by Fremont supporters that declared if Fremont won the election he would subjugate the South to freedom (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 8, pg. 3).'  Needless to say, Fremont did not win over southerners with his abolitionist rhetoric and this eventually led to his defeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fremont was successful in winning eleven states, but ultimately lost the election to the Democratic candidate James Buchanan.  Ultimately, with such an ardent stance against slavery, Fremont proved highly unsuccessful in winning southern votes.  The winner of the election, James Buchanan was a southern sympathizer, although from Pennsylvania, and thus was able to garner the support of the South.  The South rejoiced when Fremont fell to Buchanan, but their pleasure with the outcome soon waned as Buchanan proved himself to be an inadequate president."],"display_date":"November 4, 1856","search_date":"1856-11-04","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":70,"title":"James Buchanan Addresses the Senate\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-09-12","end_date":"1856-09-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In September of 1856, during the race for the presidency, James Buchanan addressed the Senate on the subject of slavery.

This sort of position simultaneously endeared Buchanan to Southerners who did not want northern interference' in their jurisdictions and to northern abolitionists by saying slavery should be abolished in the nation's capital.

This new bill declared Kansas a slave state and was passed by a vote of thirty three to twelve.

This bill would have been viewed as a huge victory for the South in the debate over slavery.  Southerners felt that Northerners attacked them because of slavery; the implementation of slavery in the territory of Kansas would have validated their belief in the institution.

Manifest destiny is the idea that it was God's will that the United States expand throughout the whole of the continent (though not by force) to spread liberty and democracy.  O'Sullivan's second use of the term, in the <em>New York Morning News</em> on February 27, 1845, was extremely influential.  With this use, he discussed what he believed was the right of the United States instead of the British to claim Oregon Country.  With the expansion of American territory inevitably came the disagreements as to whether or not expansion should include the institution of slavery, and where: after early 1846, Democrats enthusiastically adopted the phrase for their use.  The idea of manifest destiny was also used in many instances to justify displacement of the American Indians throughout the continent.The use of the term manifest destiny in propaganda and publications promoting westward expansion had long-term, lasting effects on the United States.  Manifest destiny was a major rationale behind the Mexican War of 1846-1848, after which Americans gained Alta California and Nuevo Mexico.  New industrial empires sprung up in the West, especially with the gold rush in the newly acquired California in 1849.  Once the U.S. had control of Oregon Country from the British, it was found to be as rich and fertile as imagined.  After the Civil War, the philosophy of manifest destiny helped to promote the westward movement of the population after the emancipation of slaves.  In some situations, manifest destiny is even discussed today, for some Canadians believe that the United States may still have the somewhat hidden goal of annexing Canadian land."],"display_date":"February 27, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-27","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":106,"title":"11th President James K.

President John Quincy Adams had the auspicious task of keeping both sides happy in a desperate attempt to avoid any kind of armed conflict.  The first of what would become many troubling incidents for both parties occurred on January 21st, 1827.  Friar Joaquin Aremas was a Catholic from Spain who had migrated to Mexico to convince the Mexican government to realign with its mother country, Spain.  While Friar Aremas could be seen as some meaningless radical (and most historians do), at the time this was seen in the eyes of many as a dangerous sign.  President Adams realized the urgency and quickly sent out a message that was disseminated to the nation at large via the newspapers.  In it, he claimed that No change had taken place in the amicable relations of the Mexicans with those of North America'.  Officer Vera Cruz echoed the President's sentiments claiming that the affairs of Mexico were prosperous'.  Friar Aremas was cast back into obscurity; Mexico never seriously considered his plan, but the thought of Mexico backed by a powerful European country had the potential to upset the entire global balance.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event was significant for it proved the inevitability of a war with Mexico.  Both sides were too deeply involved with one another's affairs.  As long as colonists lived so near the border, and as long as instigators like Aremas were around, problems would soon follow.  Relations became so bad that in late November Mier y Teran was sent by the Mexican government to leave Mexico City for the sole purpose to scout and assess the present danger of the border.  Teran reached San Antonio on March 1, 1828 traveling to San Felipe on April 27th and Nacogdoches on June 3rd.  His worrisome results added fuel to a fire that was lit by a Catholic friar in mid-January 1827.  Could American settlers try to take their territory like so many Indian tribes?

The bill was sent to the Whole House Committee where it would spend a great deal of time being debated and edited but never passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bill was important because it showed the increasing resistance to free blacks in the United States.  The free black was of little use to many Americans North and South because they could not be seen as reliable or hard working as the slave or they might harbinger delusions' of equality.  Irish and German immigrants saw that since blacks no longer constituted free labor they were now competing with these inferiors' for jobs in unskilled labor, which could be seen, in the eyes of the immigrants, as a hindrance to their well being.  The problem was most people did not know exactly what do with them, and where they fit on the social hierarchy but it was certainly not equal to any white man.  Gradual emancipation was becoming a topic of merit, but could they really survive in the land that oppressed them for so long.  To several people, blacks could be free just not here.  Many were so moved they had already serviced a ship, the brig Doris with Captain Matthews for Virginian free blacks willing to embrace this opportunity'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this was not a majority opinion.  Some believed that slavery was serving a good, eradicating their natural savagery' and that a trip to Africa would be unsuitable for these newly civilized' blacks. Therefore, this petition was not completely supported by any one area.  Fear would not really play a role until after Nat Turner's rebellion and free blacks were seen as a catalyst towards revolt.  The main impetus was maintaining social superiority but the plan failed because of wealthy slave owners' hostility in the South to any discussion on the topic.  Though not speaking for the entire South, they were a substantial part of the higher social ladder, and therefore a force to be reckoned with.  Congress feared the backlash from irate plantation owners, infringing on property rights' struck severe Constitutional problems for some Congressmen.

Their interest was not in helping the poor farmer in deep amounts of debt with a national plan, their interest was in making sure what they loaned was returned to them as quickly as possible.  Though they had elections to worry about, this bill was a demonstration of making an effort towards relieving bankruptcy and yet one they knew would turn out unsuccessful.  Also Senators had the luxury of a six-year term while House representatives had to worry about re-election every two years.  Therefore, it should come as no surprise that it was the Senate that brought this bill to an end.  Bankruptcy would become an issue prevalent throughout the nineteenth century. Debate sparked about the question of whether the penitentiary system was the most practical solution to solve debt problems since they could not earn money behind bars.

The paper compared this new development much to the progress or rapid improvement' being made in the field of science.  This paper was to be in the spirit of the foreign theological journals and review' of Europe.  Most of the articles would be taken from places like Great Britain and other Protestant areas of Europe.  This was seen as an extensive and liberal plan suited to all Orthodox sects of the Protestant church'.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one hand, there are many positives from this movement.  It shows an emphasis on religion in the daily lives of American citizens.  This magazine movement was during the latter stages of the Second Great Awakening, where new denominations like Methodists and Baptists were springing up.  This magazine could be seen as a counter to these new religions and events by the Protestants to instill their time tested methods.  It gave ministers (as the Telegraph said) knowledge and zeal' in which to preach.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movement also demonstrates the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant nature still present throughout America.  Catholicism was never talked about in these magazines; Catholics from Ireland were faced with severe persecution from their new American brethren when they emigrated.  These hostilities were deeply engrained with the political culture of the time.  The Masons were a secret society of many elites and politicians whose closed meetings and rituals angered many.  The Anti-Masons started as a movement against the secrecy and supposed superiority of the Masons but also boasted a strong anti-Catholic rhetoric as well.  These playing on people's fears of otherness' started in New England where many of these immigrants first arrived but eventually spread into places farther South.  Therefore, one can see the paradoxical nature of religion in America during this time period.  This religious magazine stands for all the good and all the bad that the role of religion played in American's lives during the nineteenth century."],"display_date":"September 6, 1827","search_date":"1827-09-06","locations":[{"id":1272,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":252,"title":"John C.

The ten regiment bill called for increased funding to raise and outfit an additional ten regiments to fight Santa Anna's troops in the Mexican American War.  Congress intended this funding to last until the end of the war or for five years, whichever came sooner.  This demonstrates the relative numerical weakness of the American forces in comparison to the Mexican forces.  Although fewer US soldiers existed than Mexican soldiers, the American's possessed superior training, supplies, and leadership, as evidenced by the victory at Buena Vista.&lt;br /&gt;Although Congress eventually passed the measure, Calhoun received an inordinate amount of criticism for his allegedly unpatriotic actions.  Many critics mark this unfortunate event as the start of the decline of Calhoun's bid for the presidency.  Calhoun misread American public opinion at this time and on this subject, and chose to speak in opposition to a bill his highly patriotic constituency supported.  He neglected to take into account the high levels of patriotism present throughout the country in regard to the Mexican American War.  Although the North and the South disagreed on many issues related to race and slavery during this time period, their patriotic views in support of the War converged.

The First one expired indifferently in 1811, and the Second Bank was chartered five years later, in 1816. This new edition was meant to be an independent bank, a specie paying bank, a stead and cautious, not a speculative bank. But, it had an inauspicious start, with a case sent before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1819. This case, <em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em>, upheld the legality of the Second Bank of the United States. The Bank would quickly gain allies and enemies, and the Bank War was underway. The National Republicans sided with it and convinced the Bank's president, Nicholas Biddle, to ask Congress for its immediate re-charter, even though it would not expire for another four years. The bill passed both houses of Congress and came to President Andrew Jackson's desk. He had despised it from the outset, questioning its constitutionality. But, vetoing the bill would damage his attempt at re-election. On July 10, 1832, Jackson threw caution to the wind and vetoed the bill, sending it back to Congress with his suggestions. Even though a Bank may be convenient for the government, Jackson made his decision because some of the powers and privileges possessed by the existing Bank are unauthorized by the Constitution, subversive of the rights of the States, and dangerous to the liberties of the people. But, by this decision, had he sacrificed his personal ease, and, as his enemies think, put in jeopardy his re-election. Many people did disagree with Jackson's decision. Congress had debated the issue for much of the year. Daniel Webster argued that a continuance of the Bank was very necessary to the country. However, the greater side of the argument seemed to be the President's. He felt it was his duty to the American people to uphold the Constitution, as he saw it, so that's what he did.

They debated a new tariff. This act would be a close relation to the Tariff of 1828, which was benevolently called the Tariff of Abominations. The new bill was a protectionist tariff, attempting to protect local producers from foreign competitors by setting the tariff on imported goods, or using some other method to reduce importation. But, it would not protect those domestic producers evenly. It benefited the textile industries in the North by forcing people to buy more domestic products. At the same time, it hindered southern cotton farmers, because the English textile industry couldn't buy as much cotton.With the debate raging, several southerners were wary of the coming effects. One wrote that the passage of this act could lead to resistance and the dissolution of this glorious Union. At the time, this seemed like a drastic opinion, but it proved somewhat prophetically. On July 14, 1832, Andrew Jackson approved the bill that had passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The duties were to go in effect on March 3, 1833. The debate did not end with the passage of the tariff. The southern states, as expected, were upset; and South Carolina in particular would take a harsh line against the government, hinting at their initiation of a later secession from the Union. South Carolina set off the Nullification Crisis by declaring the tariff null and void in the winter of 1832. Most states did not agree with South Carolina's drastic action, but the issue of states' rights was laid on the table for the first time.

Jackson easily succeeded, becoming the first president to hail from a state other than Virginia or Massachusetts. This distinction can help symbolize the expansion of the United States during his eight years in office. Originally, the Democrats had not anticipated Jackson's running for a second term, but it became necessary because of the growing feud between Secretary of State Martin Van Buren and Vice-President John C. Calhoun. Despite some objections, Van Buren would take over as Jackson's running mate on the presidential ticket. The campaign was defined by the Bank War, the question of the Second Bank of the United States. This issue dominated the election so much that one newspaper wrote, The people of this country are at last invoked to decide whether they will have for President, Andrew Jackson, or the Bank of the United States. But, there were some other intriguing aspects to the election. It was both the first to have its candidates elected through party conventions and the first to include a legitimate third party, the Anti-Masons. William Wirt ran for that party, whose influence resided mostly in New York and Ohio. The other main party, in opposition with the Democrats, was the National Republicans, who ran two candidates, Kentucky Senator Henry Clay and Virginia Governor John Floyd. However, the election would be forever connected to the Second Bank of the United States. The incumbent Jackson believed the bank was unconstitutional and had failed to create a united currency. Earlier in 1832, he had actually vetoed the bill for re-chartering the Bank. The National Republicans hoped this issue would steal the election, with Jackson's harsh line taking away from his popularity. However, the President won handily, 219 electoral votes to 49 for Clay, 11 for Floyd, and 7 for Wirt. Van Buren would follow Jackson to the presidency four years later, but he would have to deal with Jackson's bank stance, which caused the economic Panic of 1837."],"display_date":"November 2, 1832","search_date":"1832-11-02","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":331,"title":"Jefferson Davis on Indian Removal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-04-14","end_date":"1856-04-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Secretary of War Jefferson Davis wrote to Governor James S.

Traditionally, representatives received and tabled antislavery prayers, or buried them in committee; the gag rule, however, prevented even this formality from taking place.  This was not a spontaneous development, but a response to repeated petitions from John Quincy Adams and others to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C.  The argument adopted by Southerners was that the existence of slavery was enshrined in the Constitution, and that there could be no legitimate way to entertain petitions for abolition.  Furthermore, to eliminate slavery in the capital would establish a spot, within the slaveholding States, which would be a city of refuge for runaway slaves,' according to the Globe.  By passing such a law you introduce the enemy into the very bosom of these two States [Maryland and Virginia], and afford him every opportunity to produce a servile insurrection... When slavery ceases to exist, under the laws of Virginia and Maryland, then, and not till then, ought it to be abolished in the District of Columbia.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Northern representatives were furious at the Southerners' attempt to force the passage of this overtly sectional legislation.  They would not accept that anti-slavery petitions were unconstitutional.'  The gag rule was undoubtedly a radical idea.  That the Southerners would advocate such an extreme measure to preserve slavery demonstrates the explosiveness of the slavery issue over a decade before the Civil War.  Southern Whigs promoted the measure aggressively and without compromise so as to make Southern Democrats feel less comfortable about their New York-born presidential candidate, Martin Van Buren.  This tactic led to more emphatic declarations of loyalty to slavery on both sides.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gag rule passed, in large part, because Van Buren put forward a toned-down version of the legislation that was acceptable to more representatives.  His support of the gag rule was politically expedient, as it helped bolster his popularity in the South.  But the controversy helped to further polarize the pro- and anti-slavery camps.  At the same time southern Whigs were attempting to show that Van Buren's lukewarm support for the gag rule constituted a betrayal of slavery, northern Whigs condemned the Little Magician for supporting the measure at all.  This internal contradiction was of lesser importance in 1836, since the Whigs planned to nominate several different candidates for the presidency.

The state banks, facing little regulation, freely loaned paper money to virtually anyone who asked for it.  A flurry of land speculation and inflation followed.  To curtail these alarming trends, Jackson issued the Species Circular on July 11, 1836.  The executive order meant that federal land could no longer be bought with paper money, but only with gold or silver.  In Jackson's view, this hard' money was the only currency that could be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issued by Secretary of Treasury Levi Woodbury, the Circular to Receivers of Public Money, and to the Deposite Banks' was meant to eliminate the frauds, speculations, and monopolies' that were fueled by an excess of easy credit from state banks.  The circular predicted that such transactions would have an evil influence' on the public interest and the national currency, and sought to contain the problem by ordering all deposit banks to refuse bank credits and paper money as payment for public lands beginning the 15th of August, 1836.  Since it was speculation that Jackson sought to end, purchases of less than 320 acres would be payable with bank notes up until December 15 if the purchaser could demonstrate that he intended to settle the land.  However, everyone would have to pay with specie following that date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the limitations imposed by the circular took effect, land speculation abruptly slowed.  After December 15, settlers were not even allowed to pay with good' paper money.  An Arkansas native explained in the Louisville Daily Journal that this measure, far from aiding the average settler, caused great harm; people in essence had to use their notes to buy specie at a premium from the banks, and in turn use the gold or silver to buy land.  When land sales dropped off, it meant state governments, especially in the West, lost income.  At the same time, higher interest rates in England were beginning to lower the price of cotton.

As such, his victory in the 1836 election was by no means inevitable; he was widely considered a compromising Yankee who could not be trusted to respect states' rights or slavery.  Southern whites already felt greatly threatened by the perceived expansion of Abolitionism in the North, as evidenced by their efforts to pass the first gag rule' on anti-slavery measures.  Mississippi's Woodville Republican asked, If Abolition continues to advance with giant strides, what will it do with a Northern President when the Southern vote is unwanted?

South Carolinians held a special grudge, thanks to his strong nationalistic stance during the Nullification Crisis of 1832.  Thus in some places, it hurt Van Buren to be considered the legacy of Andrew Jackson.  His status as a Northerner, of course, dampened his popularity throughout the South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the election was close, Van Buren carried seven Southern states: Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Missouri.  Whig candidates William Henry Harrison and Hugh White carried Kentucky, Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee and Georgia White took the latter two states while Independent Willie Person Mangum took South Carolina.  In stark contrast to the election of 1832, in which Jackson won 79% of the slaveholding states' Electoral votes, Van Buren came away with a mere 53%.  Of the popular vote, he earned an unconvincing 50.9%.  The Whig strategy to prevent a Van Buren majority by running three different candidates with strong regional appeal very nearly succeeded.

He was quoted by the Mobile Commercial Record as saying: The General Government, to which the great trust is confided, of preserving inviolate the relations created among the States by the constitution, is especially bound to avoid, in its own action, any thing that may disturb them.  I would, therefore, call the special attention of Congress to the subject, and respectfully suggest the propriety of passing such a law as will prohibit, under severe penalties, the circulation in the southern States, through the mail, of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection.'  This idea was almost universally supported by Southern legislators, but John C. Calhoun and a few others remained dubious.  Even though Calhoun was a staunch advocate of slavery, it looked like an infringement upon states rights for the federal government to decide which publications the post office would be allowed to transmit.  Calhoun's position, while seeming rather paradoxical on the surface, was actually quite logical: if Congress claimed the power to restrict antislavery mailings in 1836, what would stop it from censoring proslavery mailings a few years down the road?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heated debate over the bill took place in June of 1836.  After failing to pass on the third reading, a June 27 issue of the Mobile Commercial Record attacked Southern Whigs as being responsible for its defeat.  The vote would have been 24 in favor and 20 against, as opposed to the 25 to 19 vote that killed the bill.  This bill then, which has been deemed so essential to the tranquility if not to the very safety, of the South, was lost partly in consequence of the Whig opposition from the slave holding section; Whatever then of agitation or of panic, or of mischief may arise from this defeat, let those 5 Whig Senators from the slave holding States share the responsibility.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fear of Southerners was very real.  In the first half of the 1830s, hundreds of thousands of anti-slavery publications descended from the North, which both terrified and infuriated Southerners.  When South Carolina-born abolitionist Angelina Grimk? published her Appeal to the Christian Women of the South, the pamphlet was burned in Charleston and its author forbidden from visiting her native city ever again. Southern efforts to restrict the circulation of such materials, therefore, made sense.  Still, Senators Webster, Clay, Calhoun and other influential senators were not ready to stomach such censorship.  States' rights, used so often to defend slavery, in this case worked against it."],"display_date":"June 8, 1836","search_date":"1836-06-08","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":536,"title":"Congress passes the Surplus Revenue Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-06-23","end_date":"1836-06-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["With the expansion of the United States in the 1830s came an inevitable influx of money from purchases of public land.  According to a Treasury Department report issued on February 1, 1836, the surplus amounted to about 30,000,000.  In 1833 Congress had passed a bill to distribute the surplus among the states, with the support of Andrew Jackson.  But in 1836 the fate of the surplus became a point of contention between Democrats and Whigs.  Jackson began to assert that its distribution would be unconstitutional.  Meanwhile, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster strongly supported distributing the surplus, and succeeded in passing legislation to that end in the Senate.  The House, however, would not pass the bill in its current form, citing constitutional bounds.  Whigs, of course, clamored for the measure in order to support internal improvements.  Edward B. Dudley made it a major campaign issue in his run for governor in North Carolina.  Finally, the proposed legislation was modified to diffuse the surplus in the form of deposits to be repaid by the states. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On June 23, 1836 the measure passed as part of the Act to regulate the deposites of the public money.'  The handling of the surplus was addressed in Section 13, which read: And be it further enacted, That the money which shall be in the Treasury of the U. States; reserving the sum of five millions of dollars, shall be deposited with the several States, in proportion to their respective representation in the Senate and the House of Representatives.'  The state governments would vote to accept the deposits, and within a year of their receipt, state banks would have to redeem the notes in specie.  Section 14 provided for the transfer to take place in four installments throughout 1836.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The requirement that the U.S. government be repaid in specie proved problematic.  After states accepted their share of the surplus, often using it to fund internal improvements, they found they did not have the hard' money to back up inflated bank notes.  Much of the wealth generated by land sales in the West was artificial, and by the end of 1836 it was clear that the states would be unable to repay the federal government in specie.  This would lead them to suspend specie payments, precipitating the Panic of 1837."],"display_date":"June 23, 1836","search_date":"1836-06-23","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":568,"title":"Indians and Kansas-Nebraska\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-02-15","end_date":"1854-02-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Capitol Hill, Sen.

The parties spent much of their energy courting the South.

Van Buren, running on a platform which tried to appeal to southern interests had many active supporters in the South, including former President Andrew Jackson.  The South, however, would not back him strongly during the campaign and election, despite his denunciation of abolition and his declaration of friendship with the South.'  Many voters associated Van Buren with the nationwide economic troubles of the Panic of 1837 and the devotion of the people to Van Buren's predecessor Andrew Jackson had waned over time. &lt;br /&gt;While the election campaign did involve discussion of various issues, sectional and otherwise, it was marked especially by widespread personal attacks and appeals to emotion.  Robert Gunderson, describing the campaign, wrote that generated as it was by hard times and political hatreds, the great commotion of 1840 was not subject to rational or intellectual restraints.'  Van Buren's Whig opponents in the newspapers characterized the Democratic Party as undemocratic and uninterested in the concerns of the common man.  One paper described the Democrats as the deluded followers, the paid vassals and the Praetorian bands of power.'  On the other side ranged the unbought and unterrified friends and advocates of civil freedom.'  Whig partisans also made as much as possible of Van Buren's supposed distance from the people he governed.  The fact that Harrison was a soldier, and had been defending women and children from the Indians while Van Buren had been making money for himself in politics was also emphasized by the Whigs.  Harrison was the honest and brave soldier, the common man's president who lived in a log cabin, the image of a purer republicanism going back to the Revolution.  The southern Whigs, who had initially voted for Henry Clay at the national convention, were happy with Harrison, a Virginia native and southern ally.'

Their letter to Congress was very condescending to the blacks who they were trying to help.  They noted that despite the fact that in Africa they had had access to large tracts of land, fertile soil, and other rich natural resources, they had made no progress in the refinements of civilization'.  They hoped that by re-colonizing them in Africa, they would be able to convert more people on that continent from their gross and abject superstitions' to Christianity.  Other groups had similar ideas.  The American Society for the Return of Negroes to Africa was founded in Richmond in 1817, with a stated mission that was nearly the same. ","Congress examined the proposal thoroughly.  They decided that any proposed colony would have to be far away from American soil to have the intended effect of separating free blacks from the enslaved blacks, and from the free whites, with whom they can never be equal.  The point of this separation was to diffuse any conflicts that might erupt should the free blacks get frustrated with the injustice and turn to violence.  So if the land must be far away, where would it be, and how would the government obtain it?  Great Britain already had a colony for free blacks in Sierra Leone.  The Congress discussed sending free American blacks to that colony, as well as creating a new colony just for American freedmen.  A new colony would require a rather large monetary contribution from the United States government for the land on which to build the colony, and food until they were able to establish their own farms, as well as military protection for a long time before they could set up their own stable government.

ACS members tended to be Southerners and although they claimed to have the interest of free blacks in mind, declaring, we must go to them in the true spirit of benevolence, and not give over until they arouse themselves and be men,' they were actually largely motivated by self-interest. The members of the Society feared that increasing population of free blacks would organize revolts an destabilize the United States and members who were northerners were concerned that free blacks in the North would be willing to work for less money and would thus lower the wages of white workers. Additionally, in promoting the removal of blacks from the United States and their colonization in Liberia, the ACS was angling for the beginning of what they hoped would become an American empire in Africa. At their 1853 meeting, their address asserted, the interior [of Africa] has never been penetrated in any manner calculated to throw open its treasures or reveal its wonders to the gaze of the world; colonization has planted a footstep on the western coast, and opened a gateway through which the vast recesses of the interior may be reached and revealed.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the American Colonization Society professed to be interested the welfare of blacks, it was essentially an organization based on racism the end of slavery did not change its ideological outlook. Typical of its time period, despite being anti-slavery, the ACS still believed that blacks were inherently inferior to whites and did not advocate social or political equality of the races. Its mission and goal place their own racist views and self-interest before those of blacks. Even though many blacks were reluctant to leave the United States and those who left for Liberia were often unhappy, the ACS published propaganda to counter those views and attract recruits.

He received much criticism and praise for his confrontation of abolition.  Whig politics at the time were very two-sided, having to span the boundary between free states and slave states.  His speech to congress in February of 1839 gave his views on abolitionists and their pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;He identified three classes of people opposed to slavery.  The first, and most harmless according to Clay, was the class opposed to slavery by sentiment or philanthropy.  This class, he asserted, disliked the institution but would not upset the union or their own lives for the cause of abolition.  The second class he named the abolitionists.  This group he felt believed that the right of petition had been violated by congress and were more adamant to their cause, yet no more wanted to cause disunion to the nation.  The third and most dangerous class was the ultra-abolitionists.  &lt;br /&gt;Clay said, with them [ultra-abolitionists] the rights of property are nothing, the deficiency of the powers of the General Government is nothing; the acknowledgment and incontestable powers of the States are nothing; civil war, a dissolution of the Union, and the overthrow of a Government in which are concentrated the fondest hopes of the civilized world, are nothing.'&lt;br /&gt;Also in his speech, Clay addresses a concern on British emancipation of the West Indies.  He says this is unfair as the planters in the West Indies are not represented in British Parliament.  Clay drew a parallel between the ultra-abolitionists and the British parliament as that neither are anywhere near the world they seek to govern and change.&lt;br /&gt;An important clarification made by Clay over the policies of democrats and Whigs was that neither party were abolitionists.  He contests the necessity of abolition in Washington D.C.  &lt;br /&gt;Clay ended with predictions for the future of slavery.  He predicted that slavery would endure for at least 50-100 years, and after that within 150-200 years few vestiges of the black race will remain among our posterity.'

In some cases, US explorers tried to live alongside Native-Americans who called the West their home, but hostility from both peoples often caused conflict.  Americans embraced the mindset that not only was it acceptable, but it was even their duty to organize and civilize the Indian tribes, whom they viewed as not, in fact, an independent people, nor ought they to be so considered' (Calhoun).  On January 15, 1820, Secretary of War J. C. Calhoun wrote to Speaker of the House Clay of the progress' that had been made thus far in this endeavor.  &lt;br /&gt;The widely held view of the Indians as savages' was distorted by embellished tales about their violent acts, such as an account of murders in The Clarion and Tennessee Gazette.  In this specific article, the editor actually points out the exaggerated, incorrect information previously reported regarding members of the Seminole tribe who killed and injured some Tennessee men.  The updated account corrects the previously barbarous portrayal of the Indians, but nevertheless these facts, describing how a jailor shot the Indian through the body;loaded his pistol a second time and shot him through the head,' coincide with the harsh attitude of Americans toward the Indian tribes.    &lt;br /&gt;In theory, the migration of Native-Americans west of the Mississippi River was voluntary, but leaders of tribes were usually pressured or forced into signing treaties with the United States government.  Popular thought was that it was, in Calhoun's words, impossible, with their [Native-Americans'] customs, that they should exist as independent communities in the midst of civilized society;and our opinion, not theirs, ought to prevail;in measures intended for their civilization and happiness.'  Congress made appropriations of ten thousand dollars annually to aid in advancing Indian societies in the US.  An additional emphasis of the efforts to conform the Native-Americans was establishing schools, and Calhoun mentioned the Cherokee as a relatively civilized people because they had already launched two successful schools.  Congress' message was that the Indian tribes must be brought gradually under our authority and laws, or they will insensibly waste away in vice and misery (Calhoun);' due to Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal policy of the 1830s, virtually all were controlled by the Americans, and eventually more than 100,000 Native-Americans migrated to the West."],"display_date":"January 15, 1820","search_date":"1820-01-15","locations":[{"id":1272,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1197,"title":"Charles Pinckney and George Tucker Speak Against the Missouri Compromise\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-02-14","end_date":"1820-02-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["South Carolina Governor and member of the House of Representatives, Charles Pinckney had been one of the youngest delegates of the Constitutional Convention in 1789.  Pinckney remained a controversial political figure, due in part to his support of slavery.  In 1820, he reacted to the attempts of some Northern congressmen to ban slavery from the Missouri Compromise.  An example of the Northern position was demonstrated by Senator Harrison Gray Otis of Massachusetts.  He tended to focus on the wording of the Constitution and literal interpretations of the provisions for establishment of new states.  Otis claimed it should not be debatable because, the earliest exercise of your authority over the domain ceded to the US was manifested in a solemn protest against the introduction of slavery into it (Raleigh).'  Many other Northerners took a softer line on the issue, hoping to compromise and restrict slavery incompletely. &lt;br /&gt;Virginian George Tucker spoke before the House of Representatives on February 25, and his stance on slavery in Missouri aligned with Pinckney's.  Tucker claimed that to restrict slavery would lead to skewed proportions of blacks and whites in the population, pushing whites to abandon territories and human labor to decline in value.  In the interest of preserving the Union, Tucker said that the government cannot possibly restrict slavery, and the North was confusing political and moral rules to justify calling slavery evil.  &lt;br /&gt;In a defense of the sectional interests of the nation he claimed to be embodied in the Constitution, Pinckney argued in return that the federal government could not take away the Southern way of life nor their valuable property.  He went as far to say that slaves could be happier continuing to live an existence they were used to.

Representatives from all over the nation had an opinion on the Missouri issue. &lt;br /&gt;In February, 1819, Representative Tallmadge introduced an amendment providing for a gradual end to slavery in Missouri, but this was quickly rejected.

Liberally interpreting his ambiguous instructions, Jackson led his troops deep into areas of Florida under Spanish control, capturing two Spanish forts. Because Florida held the potential of becoming a new slave state, southern congressmen eagerly backed Jackson's plans.  In addition to securing greater protection for American settlements, the mission helped to expose the vulnerability of Spanish rule in Florida. Monroe and his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, used that vulnerability to pressure Spain into selling Florida to the United States, and after ratification of the Adams-Onis treaty outlining the conditions of the purchase and drawing territorial boundaries for the remaining Spanish holdings in North America, the U.S. government purchased Florida in February of 1821 for five million U.S. dollars, all of which was paid directly to U.S. citizens with claims against the Spanish government.

Though runaway slaves viewed Florida as a place to find freedom, slave traders considered Florida an ideal place of business.  Although in 1808 the U.S. passed laws prohibiting the importation of African slaves, because Florida was still under Spanish rule and in combination with its abundance of coastline, slave traders brought African slaves into Florida and then smuggled them into Georgia to be sold to plantation owners.  The Florida slave trade continued even after the United States took control of Florida from the Spanish in 1821.

His presidency encompassed what came to be called the Era of Good Feelings.'  The largest political crisis Monroe faced while in office came toward the end of his first term, when the question of slavery shrouding the entrance of Missouri to the Union threatened to disrupt the legislative balance between North and South. Congress was able to keep the peace by negotiating a compromise in which Massachusetts allowed its northernmost counties to apply for admission to the Union as the new free state of Maine, while Missouri was to be admitted as a slaveholding state. The compromise also called for the prohibition of slavery in the western territories of the Louisiana Purchase above the 36/30' line.  In his second inaugural address, domestic concerns pertained mostly to westward expansion and race relations amongst whites and Native-Americans; however, he made no mention of the expansion of slavery or his opinion on the issue.  His presidency encompassed what came to be called the Era of Good Feelings.' ","One of his lasting achievements was the Monroe Doctrine, which became a major tenet of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere.   As evidenced in his second inaugural address, domestic concerns of expansion overlapped with concerns of foreign interference upon that expansion, which directly influenced Monroe's administration in developing what became popularly referred to as the Monroe Doctrine, sent to congress in December of 1823.  With the words and advice of John Quincy Adams, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, the doctrine aimed to warn European powers against seeking further colonization in North America, the bulk of which rhetoric was directed toward Russia's growing interest in acquiring California from the dissolving Spanish colonial land holdings. The message contained, in the first place, a clause directed against Russia: The American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers. Against intervention there was even a stronger protest: With the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it; we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power, in any other light than as a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. The international news of the doctrine caused an immediate rise in the funds of the States in European markets and all projects of European intervention were at once abandoned.  In 1824 Russia made a treaty agreeing to claim no territory south of 54 degrees 40', and not to disturb or restrain citizens of the United States in any part of the Pacific Ocean.'

Beginning with the Battle of Contreras on August 19 and the Battle of Churubusco on August 20, the Americans suffered losses of less than a hundred men while the Mexicans had a five to one casualty count.  In these two decisive battles, the Americans captured several generals, took nearly eight hundred prisoners and a large quantity of ammunition and artillery, shattering the Mexican Army of the North.  These defeats laid an open road to Mexico City for Scott, who was within three miles of the city.  Communications relied on letters from correspondents and returning troops, and it was not uncommon for news to break weeks after the battles.  The correspondent wrote from Tacubaya on August 26 that about the 15th inst.

The battle of Contreras had thus begun. The correspondent went on to cover the details of that day and the great difficulties that Generals Smith and Riley undertook into the early morning of the 20th.  General Shield's command later caused the Mexican soldiers to fly in every direction... and [making] most excellent time in a race across the fields.  After the battle had ceased, they took stock of their spoils, and in the fort there were captured 22 pieces of artillery, mostly large size, a great number of pack mules... upwards of 1,500 prisoners, and of the enemy's dead, over 700 lay on the fields.  The Battle of Churubusco was the Mexican's fallback position, after their defeat at Contreras, where they regrouped.  The enemy was more than three times our number, besides his advantage of artillery and position, added to this he was stimulated by the fact that it was the last effort of resistance he could make...[but] after the contest had lasted about two hours, our troops had got into such position as to close with them at the point of bayonet, which decided the affair in our favor."],"display_date":"September 17, 1847","search_date":"1847-09-17","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1759,"title":"Washington Learns that the Armistice Called Between America and Mexico Fails\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-09-06","end_date":"1847-09-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of the 20th, a white flag came out from the city, and on the morning of August 21st, the two enemies called upon an armistice for peace negotiations.

Nicholas Trist, an able, firm, and truly patriotic man' was the chief representative of the American government during the peace negotiations, and was later known for his work on the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, to formally conclude a pact of peace with the defeated Mexico.  Alcorta, the Minister of War of the United States of Mexico wrote that with a view to avoid the further shedding of blood between the two great republic of this continent; the President ; accepts the proposition to enter into armistice.'  After some further communications, the Union printed the authentic copy of the draft that Mr. Trist had (with full authority from President Polk) negotiated.

The sixteen knights, clad in armor and flashing colors, paraded the streets of Baltimore before the event. Long lines of fancy barouches followed the men and their steeds. A brass band heralded the knights as they passed the judges' stand. Each knight had a preliminary ride, but then the contest began. At stake were a gold watch with chain and a pair of Smith & Wesson's improved revolvers, but the Knight of Hereford rode to win the honor of crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty.","Sir Hereford clipped eight of nine rings during his first three runs, but the riding was particularly strong in this tournament. In the fourth tiebreaking round, the three rings were a mere inch and a quarter wide. As he prepared for his run, Hereford tried to act cavalierly: a knight's demeanor reflected on himself, his county, and his state. The trumpets [blew] out a challenge, the drummer [gave] a scientific trill, and the Chief Marshall called out in a booming voice, Charge Sir Knight The heralds echoed, and Sir Hereford thundered down the 90 yard track. In full gallop, he poised his lance. He neatly clipped the first two rings, but just missed the third. The crowd cheered as the trumpets blared triumphantly. A pair of pages escorted the Knight past the judges. The ladies in the stand waved their handkerchiefs. It was not enough to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, but the joust was still a success for any knight who conducted himself with gallant bearing, majestic mien, and superior horsemanship.","After the Civil War, Maryland's image had deteriorated in the eyes of many southerners, who accused Marylanders of being submissionists to northern oppression. The joust became popular in southern Maryland because many Marylanders wanted to redeem their identity as southerners. In the 1890s, the journalist Hanson Hiss claimed that jousting may be ... the only remaining relic of that romantic and picturesque age which has furnished the bards of centuries with themes. Marylanders linked this romantic image of jousting with their image of the Old South, and through jousting, they renewed their southern identity. Many Maryland knights chose names like the Knight of the Lost Cause, the Knight of the Sunny South, and the Knight in Grey to show their sympathy for the plight of the southern states. Jousts strengthened ties to the South in other ways as well: this joust in Baltimore was used to raise money for yellow fever sufferers in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1878","search_date":"1878-09-05","locations":[{"id":6035,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE GEORGES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2062,"title":"The Washington Globe, addressing different views","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-10","end_date":"1837-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One article had the headline, ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN D.C., the other article, CASH FOR 400 NEGROES, the year was 1837. On January 10, 1837, the issues of slavery and abolition were weighing heavy on the minds of many Americans. The House of Representatives had accepted petitions and memorials on January 9. One of those was from Representative Adams of Massachusetts. His petition was signed by one hundred and fifty women, wives, and daughters. The women, his immediate constituents, were praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. The petition was objected to by Representative Glascock. Adams was shocked by the objection; he did not expect any hostility to his petition. It was written in respectful terms, by women, mothers, and daughters. Congress had been decided previously that petitions of this kind would be received but disposed of afterwards. Adams felt that Glascock's objection violated the decision of the House as well as his constituent's freedom of speech. Adams argued that his petition was from persons of the greatest respectability and should be treated with dignity. The two men continued to debate the issue of petitions but ultimately, this was an issue of slavery, one man trying to keep an abolition petition from being recognized and another fighting for the right to petition.

Edward Pessen writes about this distinction in How Different from Each Other Were the Antebellum North and South? He describes the different regions as two distinctive civilizations, the basic similarities within each of which transcended its internal differences.

He spoke to unite the country and reflect the significance of freedom.  Independence Day was newly designated since the county had only recently gained independence from Great Britain.  Francis Scott Key was aware of the magnitude of this celebration.  He started his speech by stating, The spectacle of a happy people, rejoicing in the thankfulness before God and the world for the blessing of civil liberty, is no vain pageant.  Key went on to speak of the duty of those assembled.  He called it a high and holy duty, stating We have opened the records of time, and read that bright page that proclaimed to the world the solemn purpose of the fathers of our country, and the sacred pledge they gave us for its fulfillment.  The pledge has been redeemed, the purpose is accomplished, and we are here, in the rich possession of what valor has won, and wisdom has preserved for us.  Key addressed the crowd with the hope of reminding citizens, in a time of turmoil, of the purpose and sacrifices of the fathers of our country.  The possession was won and the wisdom preserved, now it is the duty of the citizens to carry on the honor and mission of a free land, he stated. ","Key told of a fear that many Americans at that time derived from a clash between state's power and the power of the national government.  He urged everyone to take hope and courage from the past.  He was able to proclaim with pride, This is my own, my native land.  He ended his oration with the question, Is our country less loved, as it becomes more worthy of our love?    Francis Scott Key used profound and powerful words on the Fourth of July, 1831, to remind the country what the founding fathers fought so hard to obtain, freedom.  ","The oration given by Francis Scott Key was an optimistic attempt to rally citizens on the glorious celebration of the nation's birth.  However, the country was already divided over the issue of slavery.  Key was unaware of the events that would unfold in the remainder of 1831. Nat Turner's infamous rebellion was initially planned for the same day, July 4 1831, but was delayed.  In this same year, William Lloyd Garrison's newspaper, <em>The Liberator,</em> would begin contributing to polarization.  Key described the country as deserving love.  However, at this time the nation was divided.  Donald, Baker, and Holt describe the development of Southernism.  In their book, <em>The Civil War and Reconstruction</em>, they quote Alexander Stephens as saying, The South is my home- my fatherland.  Southerners held their region in the highest esteem and gave it their loyalty first and foremost.  This division, that Key struggled to overcome in his 1831 speech pointed towards the Civil War.

Therefore, this trip to Washington was a thrill for him. After registering at the Gadsby's Hotel in Washington, Rawlins journeyed down to the capital.  He entered the Rotunda, immediately drawn to four large hanging pictures.  The subjects included, The Declaration of Independence, The Surrender of Cornwallis (1781), The Resignation of Washington (1783), and the Surrender of Burgoyne (1772).  These were so powerful that Rawlins reflected in his journal, They bear such internal evidence of truth that the beholder is almost constrained to forget everything else in looking at them.  A bronze statute of Jefferson, seems to cause a thrill of admiration.  Next he ventured into the Senate.  Again the details of the splendid room stuck his attention.

The Declaration was kept in a mahogany case in the State Department.  Already, some of the signatures were almost illegible due to fading.  The parchment bore evidence of being rolled up tightly.  Viewing documents of such significance sent a chill through Mr. Rawlins body. After viewing these historic documents he ventured to the John Quincy Adams' house, there he presented a letter from Mr. Cranch.  It was shocking how old Adams looked, his head almost entirely bald.  The little hair he did possess was silvery in color.  Afraid of staying too long, Rawlins quickly left.  He continued his day with a visit to the residence of Henry Clay, again to deliver a letter.  This visit delighted Rawlins, as Clay was dignified yet cordial.  His smile was peculiarly placid. Clay was tall and slender, with thin grey hair, small eyes, and a wide mouth, making him appear to possess a constant smile.  As if visiting Adams and Clay was not enough for one day, Rawlins also met with John Calhoun in the Senate.  He ended this day of activity with an evening of feasting at Judge Cranch's.

Henry Clay was John Quincy Adam's Secretary of State during his tenure as President.  As President, Adams envisioned a strong central government.  This only worsened tensions with the South.

Ann was his pride and joy, and of all his children she was his greatest comfort. She was frank, gay, and warm hearted. Ann married a very rich man and lived on a plantation adjourning Clay's.

He was the founder of the Whig Party, in opposition of Andrew Jackson. Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hofstra describe Clay in their book, New Histories of the Old Dominion, Virginia Reconsidered, as a man who brought to the political stage the very qualities women did on the domestic one- moral virtue, love of harmony, and the willingness to compromise. They go on to say that women were endeared to him. Perhaps this affection, passion, and love of harmony are in part a reaction the great loss of his dear Ann.

He had always desired to see the city. The city was the object of greatest curiosity, fascinating the Bishop with its rich history. He stood in awe before a portrait of George Washington. The Declaration of Independence proved to be a most impressive scene, the picture fills every American heart with American feelings and memory carries him back to the time when in solemn conclave this noble band proclaimed to the world 'Liberty or Death. One could look at the Declaration for a long time and see new beauty in it each moment. Bishop Whipple was swept away in the beauty of the capital. ","However, some sights in Washington caused the New York native to grow frustrated with the current political situation. The House of Representatives particularly disturbed him. The charm of honor is lost, and these men having high sounding titles are not only men in form, but less than men in mind in many cases. Never have I seen as large a body of men who were called great men who came as far short from deserving the title. Such a lack of dignity, such a lack of courtesy, of politeness, of common decency can seldom be seen in a body of men who are law makers. He continued to rant that the law makers were actually the law breakers. Bishop Whipple was so disgusted with the Congress that he described them as beasts. Despite the beauty of the Capital, he left discouraged. There are very few men of fine talent in the House and when you leave the House and see the noble, calm, and kind faces exhibited in Trumbull's picture of the first Congress you feel sad at the difference. Despite his shame with the House, he was proud of the Senate and spoke of the joy he felt upon seeing John Q. Adams. As opposed to the beasts of the House, he described the Senators as men with mind and character. He was happy and proud to see such men ruling over the country. ","Bishop is extreme in his hate for the House and love for the Senate. He was obviously very interested in the politics of the polarized and divided country. In the introduction to his diary, Whipple calls himself a rational abolitionist. In 1844, the Abolitionist's movement was very strong in the North. This made the divide between North and South even more pronounced. Stanley Harrold writes in his book, <em>The Abolitionists and the South, 1831-1861</em>, about the growing white and black abolitionist's movement during this time. Garrisonians were fighting for the freedom of enslaved blacks across the South. Bishop was originally from the North and agreed with the Garrisonians. He was one of the many men joining forces with the movement that would continue to escalade during the Civil War."],"display_date":"April 30, 1844","search_date":"1844-04-30","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2070,"title":"The Wonderful Invention\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-05-01","end_date":"1844-05-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On his first and only visit to Washington, Bishop Whipple saw many new and exciting things. He marveled at the beauty of the city and was inspired by the men who fought to establish both the great nation. However, on the afternoon of May 1, 1844, another new and exciting sight fascinated Whipple. The wonder of wonders was Professor Morse's electrical telegraph. Through the electrical telegraph, information was transmitted with almost the rapidity of thought. Railroad cars left with information of a nomination, for example, at the same time as the telegraph. However, the news transported via the telegraph was received one hour and a half before the cars arrived. The machine was simple and plain. Professor Morse had been working on it for 12 years. He gave Bishop Whipple a specimen of the writing as well as an explanation of the work. He was also able to hold communication with the man at the other end of the route. Bishop Whipple said he would never again doubt the extent of man's inventive powers. Wonderful, it is just wonderful He wrote of his time in Washington, There is much to please the eye, much novel and curious to investigate, and while I live I shall ever remember with pleasure my visit to Washington.","The invention of the telegraph, which so amazed Bishop Whipple, was a development that transformed the nation from in the 1800s. According to Tomas Nonnenmacher, writing in <em>The Journal of Economic History</em>, the telegraph industry began as a single monopoly patent and grew into a national monopoly. Nonnenmacher pointed out the significance of the telegraph in the development of technology: prior to the telegraph people relied on the Pony Express, homing pigeons, and the railroads. The invention spurred growth in many markets across the country, reducing information costs between firms and making news quickly transmittable over long distances.

Brown knew he needed to convey to the statesmen gathered that the division of Florida territory into east and west partitions, and the prolonging of the territorial phase therein, was both inadmissible and undemocratic. Brown, speaking for the Committee on the Territories, implored the House to strike down Bill H.R. No. 431. He began by appealing to the American ideal of self-government, a tactic that should carried some weight in front of a Congress who still vividly remembered the American Revolution. By 1844, the territorial-government phase in Florida had dragged on for 23 years. As such, its citizens had no formal political rights in Washington outside of a single delegate. Self-government was the maxim of America...that high privilege, the right of all men; Florida could no longer be denied participation while being subject to the supreme and despotic rule of those in Washington. Brown sounded much like Thomas Paine that day, and everyone in the room could relate to his words.","Brown then moved to describe the people of Florida as freedmen whose bosoms...heave with all the same impulses of liberty which mark the character of their fellow citizens. To such a population, the 23 years of absolute dependence had been degrading and injurious. The substance of his argument then became clear: Florida's entrance into the Union would serve mutual interests by relieving the federal government of the responsibility, expense, and trouble of maintaining the territory, while Florida would finally obtain formal political rights. In addition, the expedited admission of Florida would coincide with that of Iowa, maintaining the equilibrium of free and slave states. Brown concluded by again asking Congress to throw out Bill No. 431.","A.V. Brown's speech highlighted several divisive issues. The idea of a separate East and West Florida divided Floridians throughout the territorial phase. Not only was there physical and psychological separation between the two areas due to Florida's vast size, but divisionists argued that the cost of running a single state would be too high. They argued to delay the state-forming process, let the population increase, and then divide into two smaller territories. Unionists argued for Home rule, autonomy, and the benefits, such as education grants, that statehood would bring. David Levy Yulee, the most influential figure in Florida's antebellum history, backed the unionists and advocated for a United Florida. He served from 1841 to 1845 as the territorial delegate to Congress, leading Florida to statehood, and was subsequently elected as the first Jewish senator in U.S. history.","The entrance of Florida as a slave state, to balance the Union, was the substantive crux of the positions of Brown and Levy. Slave labor was essential to Florida's economic development; planters had poured in from the lower South after Spanish cession through the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1821 to establish cotton plantations in middle and western Florida, around Tallahassee. Just as with Maine, Missouri, and other territories admitted during the period, politicians sought to maintain a tenuous balance of power. Admission of Florida became more attractive as the application for statehood of a free territory, Iowa, appeared on the horizon and came up in 1846. Less than a year after Brown's speech, on March 3, 1845, Florida became the twenty seventh state of the Union."],"display_date":"June 17, 1844","search_date":"1844-06-17","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2740,"title":"Transportation Takes Over\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1878-07-14","end_date":"1878-07-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" It was the middle of October in Alexandria. The fair had just finished last weekend, and the town was beginning to quiet down again except for the hubbub over the railroad steamer. Mr. John W. Thompson was the one who had brought news of this to the town including a long freight and passenger list. On this list, all kinds of people were added as passengers for the next trip. Mr. Thompson and everyone in the town were so excited about the revenue the passengers would bring into their town, but they were also interested in the export of their own crops they would soon be able to sell the city."," n the case of a list like this, Mr. Thompson not only was responsible for taking care of keeping track of everything, but he also was responsible for notifying the whole town of the list of passengers and freight he had. So, that day, he went to post the list in a local store and many gathered around to see what the commotion was about. Even though it was just one trip, it did not only signify travel but also the growing importance of industry and transportation to the economy of the United States, especially when the shippers began to establish stops on the railroad in major cities and urban areas to try to get more money for their goods."," In the South, especially during the Reconstruction time frame, railroads became a huge advance towards the industrialization of the country. Railroads were important because it not only provided a way to connect everyone in different areas, but also allowed for a more widespread distribution of the crops and resources people were growing or using. For the United States, the railroad was a major part in the development of the economy and the lines grew quite rapidly. Historian David Herbert Donald mentions in his work the importance of this growth for the farmers and everyone in general for transportation and the movement of goods, but especially how important this was in the steel industry.

President Jackson was a strong opponent of Indian tribes. On May 28, 1830, President Jackson signed into law the Indian Removal Act. Congress passed the treaty in order to relocate the Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands in the west. Although, the act did not order the removal of the Indians, it did allow the president to negotiate land by exchanging treaties with tribes living within the boundaries of the states. ","President Jackson's first annual message to Congress in December gave him great pleasure to announce to Congress that the Removal Act was approaching to a happy consummation. He reported that two important tribes had accepted the provisions made for their removal at the last session of Congress and believed that the two tribe's examples would induce the remaining tribes to seek the same obvious advantages. President Jackson was supportive of a speedy removal and he felt it was important not only to the United States but to the Indians themselves. According to Jackson, moving the Indians would separate them from immediate contact with settlements of whites, free them from the power of the States, enable them to pursue happiness in their own way, and would stop their slow extinction. ","President Jackson told Congress that he felt the act was fair because a fair exchange of land was being granted and because the General Government proposed to pay the whole expense of the red man's removal and settlement... In his closing statements, President Jackson hoped that all good citizens, especially those that felt the Indians were being oppressed by the subjection to the laws of the States, would unite, help influence and enforce a speedy removal for the better of both the red men and white Americans. The Removal Act would benefit white settlement and allow the country's citizens to inhabit up and down the eastern coast. This included certain southern states such as Georgia and Florida, which was recently acquired from the Spanish. Most white Americans supported the Removal Act, especially southerners who were eager to expand southward. Expansion south would be good for the country and the future of the country's economy with the later introduction of cotton production in the south. Yet, there was still significant opposition to the act. Some of the people that opposed the act were Christian missionaries. Even though there was opposition to Jackson's view of the Removal Act, those who were opposed were not able to stop Jackson and the nation from removing the Indians as fast as possible.

The late Townsend caused uproar in the county with his proposal being that all of his slaves were liberated upon his death, about 50 in total, and each deserved sections of land and other forms of property. Townsend also mandated that if any lawful objection arose, the slaves belonged to his nephew, Jeremiah Townsend, who was supposed to accept them for hire for one cent per year.

"," In his book, Without Consent or Contract, Robert William Fogel discussed the movement of many Christian thinkers to denounce the filthy sin of slavery.

Groesbeck of Ohio took the floor to argue in support of the recent capture of filibusterer, General William Walker. The speech served as a rebuttal to objections raised by Representative Keitt of South Carolina and Representative Stephens of Georgia.","Representatives Keitt and Stephens argued that the seizure of Walker and his company from Nicaragua was illegal. For these two Congressmen, the United States had violated jurisdiction zones established by the “law of 1818” during Walker’s seizure. In defense of the US forces that captured Walker, Representative Groesbeck focused his speech on the theme that “the sea is no sanctuary for crime.” He stated that since Walker and his company were American citizens, “the duty of this Government [was] to keep the peace with all other nations; and to break up combinations of its own citizens who have actually started upon expeditions to violate the peace of other nations.” This being said, Representative Groesbeck saw nothing wrong with the actions the US government took to apprehend Walker and his company: “He [the commander of the US Navy] had the right to cross the line of the marine league from our shore; he had the right to pursue this expedition, which was being <em>carried on</em> across the Gulf; and he had the right, with the consent of Nicaragua, to enter within her jurisdiction.” Simply put, General Walker and his company were rightfully and legally seized and detained by the US government.","William Walker was a man of many skills. Despite his medical education and experience in journalism, he is best remembered as a filibusterer. Walker’s first filibuster occurred in 1853 in Sonora, Mexico. The success of this filibuster prompted Walker to pursue Nicaragua a few years later.","The US Department of State acknowledges that filibustering-the militaristic actions of private citizens in a foreign land-was common in the years between the Mexican War and Civil War. Like Walker, most filibusterers were southern men hoping that the acquisition of new territory in Central America would ensure the expansion and survival of slavery. For this reason, as historian James McPherson wrote, “While much of the northern press condemned Walker as a pirate, southern newspapers praised him as engaged in a ‘noble cause.’” These conflicting perceptions of Walker’s actions created fierce tension in Washington.","When Walker and his company returned to Nicaragua in 1857, the US reacted. Historian Amy Greenberg wrote on this matter, “In May 1857 Walker surrendered to the commander of the United States navy after falling to the combined pressure of a Central American army, Great Britain, and threatened American shipping interest.” As evident in Rep. Groesbeck’s speech, there was a lot of controversy concerning Walker’s seizure. This contention between southerners and northerners in regards to the US actions was, in the end, pointless.

On Sunday August 6, Clark claimed she went over to Thomas's home to retrieve an axe, which had been loaned to him. When she reached his house and explained why she had come, Thomas allegedly grabbed Clark and drew her to him. Clark, however, was able to escape and ran home to tell her mother. Thomas was arrested the following day. As night approached on Tuesday, the crowd outside the jail grew larger. Several hundred had gathered by 10 o'clock. The mob began to demand that Thomas be handed over. The mayor pleaded with the crowd to let Thomas undergo trial yelling If the man is not convicted I will lead you in person to hang him. The crowd was insatiable, however, and replied Give us the nigger He won't be here tomorrow The crowd rushed the jail and upon finding Johnson dragged him outside. Johnson tried to escape, but the crowd shot him, dragged him to the corner of King and Fairfax Street, stripped him of his clothes, and hanged him. The mob proceeded to fire shots into his body. After confirming that he was dead, the throng of people dispersed. The response to the lynching was mixed, and many speculated about why it occurred. Some argued that a protest Monday night by many African Americans, arguing that Thomas should not be lynched, may have contributed to the events that following Tuesday. What is clear, however, is that the actions of Tuesday, August 8, 1899 were not unusual."," The lynching of African Americans had become commonplace in the late nineteenth century. Before the Civil war white men were generally the victims of lynching. In the postbellum period, however, lynching and race were strongly related. In the South and border states 85 percent of victims were black. There are several possible explanations. William Brundage argues that southern institutions failed to provide adequate controls to stifle mob violence. Weak educational, religious, and civic institutions, poverty and ineffective law enforcement agencies failed to instill sufficient respect for the rule of law or human dignity. Furthermore, lynching provided a socially accepted channel for aggression in the South."," Although it was an accepted practice, lynching did face opposition from its beginnings. By the time Thomas was lynched in 1893, a number of whites had emerged who were concerned about its implications for the state. Despite these concerns, blacks had very few avenues to address violence towards them. The opposition that was led by blacks tended to be uncoordinated and lacked any concrete program for reform. For rural blacks the only available recourse was usually spontaneous and disorganized protests. More militant methods risked severe sanctions. Lynching continued well into the 20th century: African American Michael Donald was lynched in Mobile Alabama in 1981.

The structure of society was changing around them, and many had trouble with the rising stature of blacks in society, even when it came to matters of national security. Raleigh Green, in a June 10, 1898 editorial, expressed his particular aggravation that white southern men were expected to salute African American officers. While Green recognized that all blacks were free, he continued to accept a central principle of slavery: blacks are inferior to whites. Green explained that respect for black officers was causing a great deal of unnecessary discussion with Spain. Green argued that any black officer who expected a southern white solder to salute him would be consistently disappointed. To solve this foolishness, Green explained that any black soldier who did not want to fight in the Spanish American war should go home. Green bluntly stated that black soldiers were vestigial to the American military; the American military did not need their services. He concluded his editorial by saying of qualified black soldiers, however we are glad to be able to express it as an opinion that such colored men here in the south are few and far between.","Racial tension in America was so strong it played a role in the Spanish-American war. When the Maine was sunk in 1898, President William McKinley was forced to move the nation into war. Some blacks saw this as an opportunity to advance their social position. Booker T. Washington proclaimed himself willing to take responsibility for recruiting soldiers who would gladly fight on behalf of the United States. Not all blacks saw war as a positive force. Some argued that the war was only arming the very people that abused African Americans. Others considered it ironic that blacks were fighting for the freedom of Cubans when blacks endured obstacles to their own freedom at home. Furthermore, some worried that the Spanish American war would serve as a distraction from these injustices. ","Although, Green told those blacks who didn't want to fight to go home, this was not a viable option. As Edward Ayers explains, any soldier who had been enlisted in the military long before 1898 had no choice but to fight in Cuba. Although many of these troops were courageous soldiers, they received little recognition. One sergeant explained it mattered not if we were soldiers of the United States, we were 'niggers' as they call us and they treated us with contempt. Many white citizens and newspapers made it clear that any black soldier stationed in their area would be expected to stay in their place. Blacks, however, were also clear that they demanded equality. In the end, however, Ayers concludes that the experience of the Spanish-American war, far from helping race relations in America, accelerated their decline.

To create greater distance between the two, the Virginia state government decided to segregate railroad cars based on race. In 1900, the state of Virginia passed a law that mandated all railroad companies to furnish separate coaches for the transportation of white and blacks passengers. The law required that there be no difference in the quality, conveniences, and accommodations in the cars. The law further stated that passengers who refused to occupy their assigned car could be removed from the train. The law was met with great approval in many places including Alexandria, Virginia, and, in general, faced very little opposition. In Alexandria, whether the law would pass was not an issue. According to The Washington Post, Senator Mushbach and Delegate Bendheim, of this city (Alexandria), have not expressed themselves upon the subject but there is little doubt that both will vote for the measure when it comes up. Race segregation was a welcome institution in a region still nursing its wounds after the Civil War. ","The segregation of railroads was part of the development of the Jim Crow South. The railroad car law in 1900 was the first official law mandating segregation on trains. For thirty years after the Civil War, blacks and whites rode in the same railroad cars. Segregation, however, was not unprecedented. Charles Wynes explained that whites would force blacks to sit in the smoking car or a special car, although he conceded this behavior was erratic. The cause for such laws is unclear. It is clear that the laws were not a result of demanded segregation by whites. Instead, the laws were a result of the underlying racial bigotry that existed. The establishment of Virginia's first law encouraged the implementation of more. In 1904 railroad segregation laws were further tightened. Blacks had to bear the indignity of exclusion. They were often surrounded by curtains to keep the feeling of their presence minimal and were forced to give up a seat to a desiring white person. Blacks had little recourse and could only try futilely to get the laws repealed."],"display_date":"December 11, 1891","search_date":"1891-12-11","locations":[{"id":14385,"lat":38.8682751435,"lng":-77.0932794538,"zoom":11,"place":"Alexandria City, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3339,"title":"Mob Carries out Death Sentence\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1892-03-19","end_date":"1892-03-19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the small village of Haymarket, about 38 miles north of Alexandria, two white men, Lee Heflin and Joseph Dye, were lynched on March 19, 1892. The two men had been recently convicted of murder and sentenced to death. At 12 A.M. on March 19, a mob gathered outside the jail and demanded that the prisoners be handed over. The prisoners were taken away before the mob could reach them. The pair was not safe for long, however, and was soon overtaken by the mob. The frightened Dye confessed to the murder of which he had been accused. He and Hefflin were hanged on the edge of a piece of woods, 100 yards from the road. The crowd then fired a volley of bullets into their bodies. ","Some felt that the lynching of Dye and Heflin was a cruel and wretched act. After the court found the two guilty, they had already been sentenced to death. Enough, however, worried that the two might escape capital punishment and so formed the mob that decided to take matters into their own hands. Others felt that Heflin and Dye's inevitable deaths should have been left to the legal system. The Washington Post remarked, mob law...is a dangerous thing to encourage. There is too much of it already throughout the country, and it spreads like a contagion so long as public sentiment tacitly approves it. ","The lynching of whites like Lee Heflin and Joseph Dye was much less common than the lynching of blacks. Whites were normally lynched only if they committed sensational violent crimes. In fact, nearly two-thirds of all whites lynched in Virginia were accused of murder. Blacks, however, were lynched for more minor offenses. In 1852, Frederick Douglass said, There are seventy-two crimes in the State of Virginia which, if committed by a black man (no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punishment of death; while only two of the same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment. In part, because of the practice of lynching, the disparity to which Douglass points had not changed significantly even in more than forty years, despite the Civil War. Even while they were being lynched, whites received more respect than blacks. For example, lynch mobs seldom tortured or mutilated their white victims. Furthermore, although the corpses of Heflin and Dye were shot, Brundage explains that this was not the norm. Post-bellum Southerners saw violence as an unavoidable and necessary way of life. Even those who opposed mob violence believed that the criminals needed to be punished more quickly and harshly than the legal system permitted. In short, southerners had lost faith in their court system. After the turn of the century, lynching whites became even more unusual.

Politicians stood on either side of the debate, effectively representing their constituents in the matter.  John Henderson, a Congressman from Mississippi, gave a speech to Congress on February 20, 1845, in which he outlined all of the reasons why the Union should annex Texas.  As Congress waited for his speech, Henderson prepared to explain why the addition of Texas would be in the best interest of the country, as well as his constituents. The motives Henderson gave Congress in support of his opinion were very diplomatic in nature, and effectively called on the language of the Constitution.  The underlying reasons, however, represent his attention to Mississippi in his decisions.  Frederick Merk outlined these reasons in his article A Safety Valve Thesis and Texan Annexation, which was published in <em>The Mississippi Valley Historical Review</em>.  Merk said that northern abolitionists, such as Benjamin Lundy, maintained that the entire process of migration, defiance of Mexican law, and revolution, had been a southern conspiracy to extend the area of slavery.  This extremist view shows the contrast between the North and South in relation to the annexation of Texas.  As Merk stated, Henderson wished to obtain more land for his constituents, as well as have complete control of the Mississippi Valley.     Henderson wanted to represent his constituents well, which meant that he should help them achieve more land to expand and develop into farms and plantations.  There was plenty of land in Texas, and the people from Mississippi were very eager to exploit it for personal profit, which so happened to involve the spread of slavery west of Louisiana.  The debate over the annexation of Texas showed the sharp division between the southern slave holders and the northern abolitionists."],"display_date":"February 20, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-20","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3547,"title":"Albert Brown Defends the Homestead Bill\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1852-04-28","end_date":"1852-04-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Before Congress ratified it, the Homestead Bill was a hotly contested piece of legislation. The Homestead Act eventually gave approximately 160 acres of undeveloped land in the west to any man of twenty one years, on the condition that he must build a house of 12 x 14 feet and live on the property for five years.  This would not be a problem for people to fulfill who are coming looking for a life on the frontier.  Albert G. Brown, when he gave this speech on April 28, 1852, was a Senator from the state of Mississippi.  He was a democrat, and believed that the frontier should be settled.  As the Homestead Bill came to the forefront of the Congressional debate, he felt it was his duty as a Mississippian and a Senator to stand up for what he thought would benefit his constituents, the South, and the country as a whole.  People were afraid that this would bring in an influx of foreign immigrants, but he put that opinion down, and turned it around to seem as a beneficial piece of legislation for the North, which immigrants already overpopulate.  Brown though that the Homestead Bill would eventually spread out the immigration from foreign countries, and alleviate the immigration problems in the North.  "," Brown was representing his constituency through supporting the Homestead Bill, because his people of Mississippi would be some of the first to take advantage of free, fertile land in the west.  Fred Shannon studied this bill, which was not ratified until 1862, and marked a contrast between what Brown claimed, and what the rest of the South believed would happen if the legislation passed.  Shannon states that southerners are those persons who are supposed to have been the most bitter against the homestead legislation.  The rest of the South took the opposite view on the merits of increased immigration into the South, and needless to say, theywere not very cordial. The South, in the 1850s, was a place of white social dominance and plantation slavery. The white dominance spanned across race lines and continued to affect the relations with different nationalities.  The stubbornness of the South to realize the massive amount of land that was at their disposal led to the reluctancy of the lawmakers to ratify the bill."],"display_date":"April 28, 1852","search_date":"1852-04-28","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3552,"title":"Support for Jackson \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-01-01","end_date":"1819-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In March of 1818, Jackson invaded Florida, brought down Fort Negro, and seized parts of Florida, which was under Spanish control. Jackson's actions caused international repercussions. Spain protested the invasion, which led to the halt of negotiations to buy Spanish Florida. The invasion, also, led Britain to protest the execution of two of its subjects who had never entered the United State territory, and led Congress to hold hearings to discuss the irregularities of the Ambrister and Arbuthnot trials and to decide what to do about Jackson's actions. ","Representative Cobb of Georgia introduced resolutions condemning Jackson's actions in the House in 1819. Shortly after, Representative Tallmadge gave a speech, as well, on the Seminole War, where he showed his support for Jackson's actions and his opposition for the resolutions. Other representatives such as Henry Clay showed opposition for Jackson while others supported Jackson's actions such as Representative Holmes. Both Homles and Clay along with many other representatives delivered their speeches on the issue at hand. After every representative, who wanted to speak, spoke, Jackson ended up being victorious once again, but instead of being victorious on Florida soil, he was now victorious in the House of Representatives. ","Jackson was too popular for the resolutions to pass and some of the representatives knew this fact. Some opponents who knew about Jackson's popularity did not want to give in to the assumption of Jackson's popularity. Yet, the Representatives' outcomes were in accordance with the public's opinion. If it were up to the citizens to deliver speeches, there is a good chance that Jackson would have gained support for his actions since the majority of public opinion claimed Jackson was a hero.   ","Although, the speeches did not take place in Florida, these speeches are critical part of the history of the Seminole War, which was a local problem through out Florida. News of the debate on the resolutions and the outcome in the House of Representatives were in newspapers all over the United States letting everyone know, even the settlers in Florida, what they would anticipate. In addition, the fact that the resolutions failed to pass was important to history because it meant that tensions between the Seminoles and white settlers would only increase. Shortly after, the Indians began to retaliate and attack white settlers in Florida and Georgia. ","If the resolutions would have gained more support and passed, it was possible that the continuation of the Seminole Wars might not have occurred or would have occurred at a different time changing history, as we know it. Although, Jackson was victorious and the resolutions did not pass, debate on the Seminole War was not over. A couple years later, Congress would resume its discussion on if the war with the Seminoles in Florida would be worth the trouble.

Magnus L. Robinson, editor of the Weekly Leader noted with chivalry that in Lannon's Opera House every orchestra chair was filled with the fair sex--never have there been before such an array of Afro-American ladies at a public meeting, giving grace and beauty to an occasion which is sacred to every true Afro-American. The evening began with a prayer and the singing of the Star Spangled Banner. Letters of regret from those who could not come were read. That of Hugh McCulloch, Secretary of the Treasury under Lincoln, reviewed the history of race relations and the attempts to end slavery in the United States. One of his interesting statements was that voting rights for immigrants should be limited, but voting rights for blacks should not. ","The principal speaker of the evening was James M. Townsend of Indiana. He provided a very direct assessment of the state of race relations in his time: But is it not strange, that now, 28 years after Emancipation --after the Amendments to the Constitution--after settling as we thought forever the question of our citizenship, in this country we helped to make and save, that insult is added to injury by the traitorous men who sought to destroy this government, banding themselves together for the avowed purpose of disfranchising, ostracizing, and by some means or other, getting rid of 8,000,000 of the most loyal, patriotic, and inoffensive people on this continent, simply because of their color. He declared his interest in political and civil equality and in a freedom that comes with an equal chance before the law and in business. He recognized that what he sought would be obtained only if African Americans did most of the work of gaining their civil rights themselves, and he argued that blacks should insist on being treated with appropriate dignity. It was all right with him if young African American women spit in the eye of white men who insulted them. ","As Townsend recognized, his fight for freedom and equality was not in harmony with the intentions of the white society of the time. The rights of black men and women, to vote and travel freely, for example, were being increasingly curtailed. Whites began to rely on segregation laws to restrict blacks. Competing with blacks for farm laborers and other resources aggravated many whites. Despite the overwhelming odds, blacks continued to assert their rights. Nonetheless, African Americans would have to endure decades of abuse before they saw any change in treatment.

On Sunday August 6, Clark claimed she went over to Thomas's home to retrieve an axe, which had been loaned to him. When she reached his house and explained why she had come, Thomas allegedly grabbed Clark and drew her to him. Clark, however, was able to escape and ran home to tell her mother. Thomas was arrested the following day. As night approached on Tuesday, the crowd outside the jail grew larger. Several hundred had gathered by 10 o'clock. The mob began to demand that Thomas be handed over. The mayor pleaded with the crowd to let Thomas undergo trial yelling If the man is not convicted I will lead you in person to hang him. The crowd was insatiable, however, and replied Give us the nigger He won't be here tomorrow The crowd rushed the jail and upon finding Johnson dragged him outside. Johnson tried to escape, but the crowd shot him, dragged him to the corner of King and Fairfax Street, stripped him of his clothes, and hanged him. The mob proceeded to fire shots into his body. After confirming that he was dead, the throng of people dispersed. The response to the lynching was mixed, and many speculated about why it occurred. Some argued that a protest Monday night by many African Americans, arguing that Thomas should not be lynched, may have contributed to the events that following Tuesday. What is clear, however, is that the actions of Tuesday, August 8, 1899 were not unusual.","The lynching of African Americans had become commonplace in the late nineteenth century. Before the Civil war white men were generally the victims of lynching. In the postbellum period, however, lynching and race were strongly related. In the South and border states 85 percent of victims were black. There are several possible explanations. William Brundage argues that southern institutions failed to provide adequate controls to stifle mob violence. Weak educational, religious, and civic institutions, poverty and ineffective law enforcement agencies failed to instill sufficient respect for the rule of law or human dignity. Furthermore, lynching provided a socially accepted channel for aggression in the South.","Although it was an accepted practice, lynching did face opposition from its beginnings. By the time Thomas was lynched in 1893, a number of whites had emerged who were concerned about its implications for the state. Despite these concerns, blacks had very few avenues to address violence towards them. The opposition that was led by blacks tended to be uncoordinated and lacked any concrete program for reform. For rural blacks the only available recourse was usually spontaneous and disorganized protests. More militant methods risked severe sanctions. Lynching continued well into the 20th century: African American Michael Donald was lynched in Mobile Alabama in 1981.

The years leading up to the affair were full of bargains, compromises, and violent encounters that transcended both racial and societal lines. On January 7, 1847, many newspapers distributed articles focusing on the ongoing war with Mexico. The dispute increased social and political unrest back east, and the decision of whether or not to allow slavery in the new lands previously occupied by Mexicans was at or near the top of the agenda. In an attempt to bolster and create a harmonious atmosphere in the nation's capital, the news publication The National Era ran an article proclaiming the importance of order and abstinence from violence in the District at such a perilous time. The most threatening concern expressed in the article was the importance of keeping the city running smoothly and peacefully, despite widespread domestic turmoil. The citizens of Washington felt this was vital because visiting foreign diplomats saw Washington as a picture or representation of the nation as a whole. Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the city in order to secure positive foreign relations. After all, if anarchy existed in the city of Washington, then visiting foreign diplomats would be less inclined to trade or do business and would also leave with a poor impression of Americans and republican liberty in general. The gradual emergence of a world economy built upon trading was fundamental to the existence of both the North and South. This futuristic ideal economy requires, at the very least, peaceful conditions back in Washington so as to promote the kind of city-on-a-hill atmosphere that will attract foreign support. Richmond for example, saw an increase in urban population and a rise of new professions such as prostitution - which could yield a livable economic income at the time. After further examination, Joshua Rothman pointed out that resources were scarce and consequently, prostitutes constantly assaulted one another in public. If upon arrival foreign ambassadors or diplomats were greeted with a scene similar to the picture Rothman paints of Richmond, then their view of Washington would no doubt be negative, and therefore detrimental to the reputation, accountability, and future existence of the nation as a whole."],"display_date":"January 7, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-07","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3700,"title":"Twelve Years a Slave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-02","end_date":"1853-01-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The memoirs of Solomon Northup vividly portrayed the descent of a former New York freedman into the harsh system of slavery faced by many African Americans living in the antebellum South. Few people probably recalled January 4, 1853, as a significant day in the history of the United States. However, on this day a very important meeting was being held in the small town of Marksville, Louisiana, and the fate of one man was changed forever. For this day marked the release of Solomon Northup from years of involuntary servitude after being deceived and forced into slavery against his will while visiting the city of Washington.Solomon was not the first slave, nor the last, to be set free from the chains of slavery. What makes his story stand out, however, is that he was not born a slave; he had worked various jobs throughout his lifetime, always looking to better the lives of his family. It was this desire to provide a better life for his family that led him to take a job offer that would forever change his life. While working in Saratoga Springs, New York, Solomon met two white men named Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton who offered Northup a job providing musical entertainment for the circus. They said the circus was currently located in Washington, D.C., but would be traveling back North; Solomon agreed to take the trip.  Although free blacks traveling through areas where slavery was legal could acquire papers as proof of freedom, documentation was not always a guarantee of safety.  In Washington, Solomon was captured at a bar, presumably drugged, and woke up a few days later, ill from his poisoning, alone in the darkness of a basement in chains.  He had been robbed of his documents, money, and ultimately his freedom. Slave traders used a variety of tactics to illegally enslave freedmen, whether by force or physical violence, or, as in Solomon's case, by tricking, drugging, and other deceitful means.  At the threat of death, Solomon was silenced and shipped to Louisiana where he spent twelve years doing hard labor. In the novel Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson, he reiterates this harsh reality by stating that, none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known, so they were sold with new ones. Although Mr. Northup sought to bring his captors to trial, they were never prosecuted and he mysteriously disappeared. To this day, Solomon's burial site has not been identified and it is still not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured, or died of natural causes. Walter Johnson best describes Northup's experience: despite the fact that he was able to achieve his restitution of freedom, he met the same end as many African Americans from that time; unexplainable, undocumented, and seemingly unnoticed disappearance."],"display_date":"January 2, 1853 - January 4, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3701,"title":"Gold deposits within Washington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-03-05","end_date":"1859-03-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gold What could be more illustrious to read about during the mid nineteenth century than gold? On March 9, 1859, the Farmer's Cabinet published an article briefly summarizing one man's visit to the sub-treasury gold reserve in Washington, D.C. In a seemingly obvious attempt to bolster national comfort and ease economic pessimist, the lure of gold and more importantly a surplus of gold available in the sub-treasury gave the reader the feeling that though times seemed bleak, there was enough gold in this town to support half the world for life. The Panic of 1857 was a sudden downturn in the economy caused by, among other things, the decision of British investors to remove funds from U.S. banks for fear of economic instability. Beginning in 1848, the California Gold Rush ushered in millions of dollars in gold to many different treasury deposits such as the one located in the city of Washington. Many news outlets following the Panic chose to run stories such as this one to bring about a feeling of national economic security that would ease investors.The author described the sight of a piece of golden cheese worth nearly a quarter of a million U.S. dollars. As the Gold Rush progressed and the rich got richer, local banks and gold dealers issued banknotes in exchange for gold, private mints created private gold coins, and gold was sent by California banks to U.S. national banks in exchange for national paper currency to be used in the thriving California financial system.   Herbert Brayer even went as far as to say that overnight California became the Mecca of America, shipping assets and wealth domestically as well as across the globe. The ramifications of the discovery of gold in California were incredible: towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives were sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.The brightest light shed from the account is that which is seen at the Sub-Treasury in Washington where the author describes the everything-proof bunker, which is filled on all sides with Solid Bars of gold and silver.

These special prospectuses gave readers a direct insight into the minds of the editors by outlining their principles and beliefs. The National Era was a weekly abolitionist newspaper and the editor of the paper, Mr. Bailey, was interested in publishing literary ideas as well as developments and changes taking place during this period of history.Many of these prophecies did indeed come true as illustrated by one of Mr. Bailey's arguments, which essentially stated that federal legislation ought to be amended so as to place a limit on the President's time in office. The ratifications of the twenty-second amendment ratified on February 27, 1951, provided that, No person shall be elected to the office of President of the United States more than twice. Therefore, Bailey's prediction proved to be valid, despite being a hundred years overdue. In a way, many of Bailey's predictions proved to be more valid than the speculations from Edward Bellamy's famous work Looking backward: 2000-1887. For example, Bellamy predicts cheaper costs for education in the years to come for public schools, when in fact tuition rates and student debts have been gradually increasing over time. Though many of the penny press' so called prospectuses did shed some insight on the future to come, they also had an ambivalent side with predictions so vague that they easily could have some aspects of truth. On the other hand, Bailey's assertions of the changing nature of society proved to be more believable and valid than Bellamy's work."],"display_date":"December 13, 1849","search_date":"1849-12-13","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3704,"title":"The Changing Nature of the Institution of Slavery\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-03-12","end_date":"1857-03-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the Supreme Court case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press. In an article published on March 12, 1857, The National Era ran an explanatory article breaking down the case and illustrating its ramifications.The article pointed out that, with the Dred Scott ruling, an African American could never become a citizen of the United States. More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable. If he or she were the victim of the ever-increasing practice of kidnapping free blacks and selling them back into slavery as with Solomon Northup, a freeborn person of color, then that person would have no means to pursue any kind of defense in their name. Though it was certainly not the only account of its kind, Northup's story began in New York where he was lured with tales of lucrative labor opportunities to Washington, D.C. There, he was drugged, threatened with death if he told anyone the truth about his true identity, and put on a boat bound for New Orleans where he would work as a slave for almost twelve years. Upon reviewing Northup's memoirs, Walter Johnson concluded Northup's account centered on a single question: who can be trusted? The author of the article would obviously agree with Johnson's assessment of Northup's dilemma: in a world where one man can own another man and have this action protected by the rights of property, who can be trusted?"],"display_date":"March 12, 1857","search_date":"1857-03-12","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3705,"title":"Washington Journalists\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-01-01","end_date":"1855-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["With political and social temperatures running high in the winter of 1855, many journalists turned to debates concerning the acquisition of new lands, but this time outside of the modern day contiguous United States. Many rumors circulated about secret deals with foreign countries in exchange for economic and Republican support. One particular rumor published in an article from the Farmer's Cabinet concerned the possibility of a United States acquisition of all Nicaraguan lands in exchange for help establishing a firm and stable government. The authors pre-disposition against the British was quite apparent as the author went so far as to blame them for creating a treaty with Nicaragua to debunk the United States' plans for expansion into Latin America. This geopolitical chess game is not an unfamiliar scene in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There were many occasions when it was rumored that Washington had already worked out plans with a foreign nation only to discover later that such a possibility could never exist. Only a few weeks after this article was published, the Panama Railway opened, becoming the first railway to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The influence of articles like the one from the Farmer's Cabinet helped to keep Washington in check. Furthermore, without discussion of the possibilities of expanding the national boundaries, it would be nearly impossible for a democratic government to get enough sources of information to make a clear and rational decision on the proper course of action. One cannot ignore the fact that at this time there was no guarantee of journalistic integrity.

He expressed his disgust for the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and its architect, Nicholas Trist. This letter comes near the end of Webster's career, and the letter revealed that fatigue from a long career in politics had begun to set in. Though he was clearly disgusted over imperialist actions taken by the United States in the West, which upset the delicate balance between free and slave states, his will and conviction appeared to be weakening.Merely six days later, the Senate ratified the treaty and America gained five hundred twenty-five thousand square miles of territory at a net cost of just under twenty million U.S. dollars. Daniel Webster had every right to be skeptical of the suspicious circumstances that surrounded the acquisition of the formerly Mexican lands. Trist negotiated the treaty without President Polk's prior consent, but Polk later agreed to the treaty and sent it to Congress to be ratified. Finally, in May of 1848, Mexican officials agreed to the terms, and the war was officially over. Richard Winders, a historian and former Curator for the Alamo, even went as far as to make the point that the United States' War with Mexico doomed the two great parties of the era by forcing their associates to take sides on the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories and indirectly on the future of the institution of slavery itself. In hindsight, Webster's fear of instability stemming from the new lands was correct, but at the time, the majority of Congress disagreed and Webster settled for peace, despite his unwavering certainty that it would be short lived.

This person was no established politician providing aid for victims of the Irish Potato Famine; instead, he was a small five-year-old boy named Joseph Klemm. When Joseph's mother read him one disturbing account from Ireland, his first instinct was to run and get his moneybox. After returning with it, Joseph informed his mom that he was going to carry his money to the man in charge of collecting donations to send to damaged families in Ireland so that his money could be used to feed and clothe the little boys in Ireland. The story of little Joseph is priceless, despite its obvious intention of boosting public awareness and aid to the devastated country. The boy took all of his savings, one hundred and three cents, and gave it all away with the best intentions. The author described in detail Joseph's sparkling eyes, claiming that they showed the workings of a truly generous heart. The author of the article felt that this story was an important account to convey to the public, declaring that such acts deserve to be noticed and commended. He also observed another little boy being entertained by the same story, read by his father just like little Joseph, the boy asked if he too could give his money away to help those in foreign lands.Though relief aid was vital and absolutely necessary for reconstructing the Irish economy, there were numerous disadvantageous circumstances that arose, even with massive amounts of foreign funds pouring in. L. P. Curtis' incumbered wealth illustrates some of these problems. Curtis states that both landlords and tenants depended on an elaborate and secretive system of short and long-term goals. Furthermore, in the post famine period, after the rural economy had become completely monetized, virtually every tenant farmer owed money to someone at one time or another. Despite these shortcomings, it was still acceptable to feel the way Joseph and the other little boy did during such a crisis. After all, it was benevolent acts like these that built up America's character in the eyes of nations worldwide.

The sixteen knights, clad in armor and flashing colors, paraded the streets of Baltimore before the event. Long lines of fancy barouches followed the men and their steeds. A brass band heralded the knights as they passed the judges' stand. Each knight had a preliminary ride, but then the contest began. At stake were a gold watch with chain and a pair of Smith & Wesson's improved revolvers, but the Knight of Hereford rode to win the honor of crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty.","Sir Hereford clipped eight of nine rings during his first three runs, but the riding was particularly strong in this tournament. In the fourth tiebreaking round, the three rings were a mere inch and a quarter wide. As he prepared for his run, Hereford tried to act cavalierly: a knight's demeanor reflected on himself, his county, and his state. The trumpets [blew] out a challenge, the drummer [gave] a scientific trill, and the Chief Marshall called out in a booming voice, Charge Sir Knight The heralds echoed, and Sir Hereford thundered down the 90 yard track. In full gallop, he poised his lance. He neatly clipped the first two rings, but just missed the third. The crowd cheered as the trumpets blared triumphantly. A pair of pages escorted the Knight past the judges. The ladies in the stand waved their handkerchiefs. It was not enough to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, but the joust was still a success for any knight who conducted himself with gallant bearing, majestic mien, and superior horsemanship.","After the Civil War, Maryland's image had deteriorated in the eyes of many southerners, who accused Marylanders of being submissionists to northern oppression. The joust became popular in southern Maryland because many Marylanders wanted to redeem their identity as southerners. In the 1890s, the journalist Hanson Hiss claimed that jousting may be ... the only remaining relic of that romantic and picturesque age which has furnished the bards of centuries with themes. Marylanders linked this romantic image of jousting with their image of the Old South, and through jousting, they renewed their southern identity. Many Maryland knights chose names like the Knight of the Lost Cause, the Knight of the Sunny South, and the Knight in Grey to show their sympathy for the plight of the southern states. Jousts strengthened ties to the South in other ways as well: this joust in Baltimore was used to raise money for yellow fever sufferers in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1878","search_date":"1878-09-05","locations":[{"id":6035,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE GEORGES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":4028,"title":"The Runaway Daniel\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-02","end_date":"1856-05-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Friday, May 2, 1856, an ad was put out in the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> from a subscriber living near Upper Marlboro', Prince George's county (Md), offered a 100 reward for the return of a \"run away.\" On the \"4th of April, Negro boy Daniel\" ran away from his master to, the master believed, Washington City. Daniel's master, J. Berry, understood that \"he is hired in Washington City by his free relatives, or he may be at some of the fisheries.\" An extremely detailed description of Daniel followed stating that he was \"about 16 years of age, 5 feet high, very bright mulatto, slender made and delicate features, high cheek bones, long bushy hair, and light eyes.\" Such a description, his master thought, would ensure that he would \"get him again.\" ","Federal law and the United States Constitution required the return of runaway slaves. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was hardly enforced and northerners did not help in retrieving runaways. Because of this the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 made any official who did not detain a slave accountable to a fine, and officials had a duty to arrest suspected runaways. This law hit a blow to abolitionists, who protested it. Berry's decision to solicit the help of the readers of the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> could indicate northern resentment of the new Fugitive Slave Law. Berry could not trust that his slave would be returned by federal law alone and hoped to receive greater aid in his slave's capture.","Runaway slaves reduced productivity, cost their masters money (in rewards as well as other fees such as detaining the slave), and took away their masters' time. Offering 100 dollars as well as repeatedly posting the ad for six days (May 2-7) shows just how valuable this young slave was to Berry. Interestingly, the price for the capture of Daniel was only 100 dollars if caught out of state but would drop to 50 dollars in the District of Columbia and further to 25 dollars if caught in the master's county.

Bond wrote regularly about her faith and how the \"Lord [will] direct our ways and grant we may follow them.\" Although a Maryland native, Bond moved to Louisiana in 1861 because of her husband Howard Bond's service in the Confederate Army. His departure invoked many of the religious passages in her diary as she used religion as a comfort and a way to calm her fears. Bond often prayed to God in that she \"may not be entirely cut off from [her] husband,\" and that \"the cruel enemy may be driven from our soil.\" Her prayers to \"put a stop shortly to this miserable war\" were her comfort, and God, she believed, would answer those prayers.  Religious belief was how Bond coped, and she held her beliefs close. Even through illness, which was common throughout her diary, Bond remained religious.  Sickness fell to Bond and almost all around her but she \"believe[d] [she was] perfectly resigned to God's Will...as though He will spare [her]...but if it is God's wish to take [her], He knows best.\" ","The effects of the Second Great Awakening could still be seen 30 years later. As Samuel S. Hill states in the <em>Encyclopedia of Religion,</em> \"Evangelicalism crossed the lines of time...because it so easily expressed the protest and hopes of ordinary people.\" Protestant religion was an especially important factor in antebellum culture and religion was, as historian Randall Miller states, \"at the center of the American Civil War experience.\" ","The Protestant Baptist religion was very popular among white women like Bond. Evangelicals believed that the Bible was their guide and their actions must follow the Bible. In Bond's case, she strongly believed in the teachings of the Bible and believed that her prayers would be answered. According to Miller, \"Americans believed God was on the side of those who were right with Him,\" and Bond believed he was with her.  In order to live a good life, Protestants like Bond tried their best to follow the teachings of their savior. Prayer was her salvation from the horrors of war and illness, and she believed God would reward her in the afterlife. On August 34, 1863, Bond prayed, \"Oh, I do pray the good Lord will grant me this prayer-that I once more may visit the place of my nativity.\" She arrived home, in Maryland on January 2, 1866 and died shortly after.

This crisis was the passage of the Nullification Ordinances by the South Carolina State Assembly in November of 1832.  The unity and survival of the nation depended upon President Andrew Jackson's response.  On December 10, 1832, President Jackson presented his response to the Congress, arguing that the justification for state nullification of federal laws was misguided, unconstitutional, and treasonous to the country.   Jackson began his proclamation by outlining the reasons and reservations that led South Carolina to pass the ordinance; their major concerns were the tariffs of May 29, 1828 and June 14, 1832.  South Carolina believed these measures were unfair and didn't fall within the constitutional power of Congress to raise revenue; they proclaimed the laws null and void and threatened succession.  In his address, Jackson showed that the doctrine of nullification was \"incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.\"   First, he posited that South Carolina's objections based on stated powers and fairness were misguided and incorrect because the Constitution gave Congress the \"discretionary power\" to raise revenue by taxation.  Next, Jackson argued the Constitution joined the states into a single nation, and \"in becoming parts of a nation...they surrender many of their essential parts of sovereignty.\"  Thus, secession was wholly unconstitutional because it is an affront to national authority.  Finally, Jackson warned the people of South Carolina, who he believed were tricked into nullification by political and social leaders, that any action of \"disunion, by force, is treason.\"  He made an emotional appeal for these people to see the error of their position.  His address ends with a hope that the nation will survive and be reconciled by reasonableness and harmony, but also an assurance that it will be reconciled by force, if necessary.  ","    President's Jackson's speech came at a crucial time during his presidency; he had just been elected to a second term, but already his popular and political support was flagging.  But, according to historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Jackson's handling of the nullification crisis and his resolve to ensure the survival of the union, both evident in the December speech, gained him temporary \"popular acclaim,\" making him the \"country's hero.\"  Jackson, a shrewd political, turned his new popularity into a political weapon to further the other policies of his administration, most notably his continued war against the Bank of the United States.  Jackson's speech and eventual handling of the nullification crisis were viewed, by the majority of the nation, as the actions of a strong leader dedicated to the nation and its survival; he used this renewed trust to further the political goals of his presidency.

To Mrs. Virginia Clay, wife of Senator Clement Clay of Alabama, the fifty-five year old Houston was a \"Senatorial Hercules\" and a \"roughish old hero\".  In her book, <em>A Belle of the 50's</em>, Mrs. Clay explains Houston's whittling habit saying that \"a seemingly inexhaustible supply of soft wood was always kept in his desk [in the Senate] and out of it he whittled stars and hearts and other fanciful shapes.\"  One day, she received an envelope while she watched in the gallery of the Senate and \"within a tiny, shiny, freshly whittled wooden heart, on which the roguish old hero had inscribed, 'Lady I send thee my heart Sam Houston'\" (99).  She further mentioned his youthful nature as she explained that \"nothing amused him more than to reduce to a confused silence those who surrounded him, by suddenly addressing them in all sorts of unknown words\" in a number of Indian dialects (100).

","Numerous reasons explain why Sam Houston would wear a serape as Marion Wisehart in <em>Sam Houston: American Giant</em> wrote, \"Senator Houston wore a bright Mexican serape to protect his back and chest from drafts\" (497).  Or perhaps with the time he spent near Mexico, Senator Houston became more comfortable in that clothing style.  Regardless, the same man that Mrs. Clay describes seems very different than the General who led an army of Texans to victory at San Jacinto.  Sam Houston acted as statesman, politician, and soldier.  He fought in the War of 1812, governed Tennessee and later Texas as Governor of two different states, became elected twice as the President of the Republic of Texas, and worked as a Senator for Texas fighting against succession (though a slaveowner himself).  Wisehart describes another aspect of Houston as \"he could talk extemporaneously for two or three hours and hold his audience in thrall.  After sleeping all night on the cold, damp ground, he could sit on a log and write powerful appeals to stimulate patriotic ardor or eloquent petitions in his own defense\" (vii).  As explained in <em>The Autobiography of Sam Houston,</em> \"It is of such violent contrasts that an epic figure is made\" (xv).  The diversity in the behavior of Sam Houston can not be separated.  Sam Houston the whittler is the same man as President Sam Houston.

Dillard, the Charlottesville philanthropist affiliated with the efforts to fund and improve black education in America, Dr. Carter G. Woodson wrote of a recent loss of staff on the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History due to the efforts of Anson Phelps Stokes, Thomas Jesse Jones and others.  Considered by Woodson as the \"promoters of the Negro Encyclopedia,\" Stokes and Jones, among others played the role of conspirators against the Association's production of the \"Encyclopedia Africana\" in Woodson's depiction.  Dr. Woodson claimed that these men, \"devoted to Negro control,\" were responsible for stealing his former employee and recruiting him to destroy the efforts of the Association.  Woodson wrote, \"they hope to divide the Negroes in their attitude toward what we are doing.\"  With this letter, he hoped to gauge Dillard's stance on the issue and push him to choose a group to support.","            The first battle in this outright publishing war actually occurred a few years earlier, when the April 27, 1931 Phelps Stokes Fund meeting spawned the \"Encyclopedia of the Negro\" project.  The announcement of this Stokes-Jones supported encyclopedia hit Woodson hard, who had been working on his own encyclopedia of the same subject matter for a decade by that time.  It also spurred Woodson to engage in public battles with these two men and their associates in interviews and through correspondence, like the letter he sent to Dr. Dillard.  After having already announced the work of the Association to compile and publish an \"Encyclopedia Africana\" in 1921, Woodson believed that Stokes and Jones aimed to publish a story of the Negro \"as the white man wants and is willing to pay for.\"  For Woodson, the duplication of a work that his organization had already compiled extensive data for proved that the \"promoters of the Negro Encyclopedia\" acted as enemies of blacks in America and not friends.  He addressed this idea in earlier correspondence with the council overseeing the \"Encyclopedia of the Negro.\"  In a 1932 letter, he asked the promoters of the encyclopedia either to furnish his association with a small sum of money to finish their own work or to use their funds to fix other problems facing the black American.  Woodson also suggested the appointment of an officer from the Stokes-Jones council to review the efforts of both sides and assess the inventory and progress of each project.  The Stokes-Jones camp declined to adapt either suggestion to the activities of their fund and the battle waged on throughout the years.","            Carter G. Woodson believed that the education of blacks needed changes to reverse the effects of a black inferiority complex.  Woodson wanted an organic education for blacks that came out of their history and experiences, and not from outside influences.  This desire for truth and authority in retelling the story of the black American to the world guided Woodson's scholarly endeavors.  This same desire pushed him to question the motives of Stokes and Jones, as well as their associates.  Believing education steeped in the black experience and the \"true\" history of the race to be crucial to the development of the black American, Woodson could not reconcile the white leadership of the Stokes-Jones project with their supposed aims of providing blacks with a document for their race.  According to Woodson, \"Negroes must be led to solve their own problems and thus carve out their own future,\" and if the promoters of the Encyclopedia of the Negro declined to aid this plan, then they proved themselves as negative influences on the movement to improve black education.  Carter G. Woodson wanted to help blacks help themselves by providing them with their own history and achievements to share with the world.  The \"Encyclopedia Africana\" represented an outlet to provide that scientific and historical information for people, and to Woodson, other efforts towards creating a similar work that ignored his aims lacked authority and validity.","Citatio"],"display_date":"April 27, 1931 - December 23, 1936","search_date":"1934-02-23","locations":[{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":61,"tag":"encyclopedia"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Race and Politics of Reconciliation","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":19,"school_id":1}},{"id":4464,"title":"Edward Everett Extolls Civilizing Liberia\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-18","end_date":"1853-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"Y","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["At the thirty-sixth annual meeting of the American Colonization Society (ACS), the main concern for US Secretary of State Edward Everett was whether it was possible to maintain a civilization in Africa and whether or not the ACS was successful in attempting it.  In his speech, Everett discussed the reasons for the ACS, such as stopping the slave trade, and discusses their inspirations which include the spread of Christianity and American ideals.","Historian Irving H. Bartlett regarded Everett as \"conventional among Americans outside of the South\" in his views on slavery.  He knew that slavery was an \"unfortunate institution,\" but that it was protected by the Constitution.  This made Everett a relatively neutral party in assessing the accomplishments of the ACS.  Everett showed that the ACS had succeeded in its original goal which was to stop the slave trade.  He said that many other civilizations had attempted to stop the trade, but the ACS had actually done it by giving slaves that were on captured slave ships a place to settle and possibly assist them in finding their original homes. ","He later talked about the many reasons civilizing Africa had been a failure and why the ACS would correct this failure with their plans.  Everett believed that the white man could not civilize Africa because disease and cultural and environmental differences in Africa would not allow it. He went on to say that with all of the natural endowments of Africa, it had to be civilized because it was a waste of such a fertile continent. The argument of many of the critics of the ACS was that Africans were too inferior to Europeans to be civilized.  Everett said that this was not entirely true, and cited the example of the Egyptians and of many intelligent Africans who had been given appropriate education. Everett argued that if the lower classes of white men were compared with the African race then the superiority of whites may not be so apparent.  He compared the accomplishments in Liberia by the colony set up by the ACS to that of the first colonies in America such as Jamestown and Plymouth.  In Liberia they had already established a Constitution of organized republican government, courts, schools, communication to the interior, agriculture, and most importantly churches.  These accomplishments outstripped those by the first colonies of America in their first twenty-five years.","One of the main arguments by Everett was that Christianity guided the Africans into civilization and by the African Americans teaching the natives Christianity all will be civilized.  He said that the \"blessings of the Christians\" can be shown to Africa through the newly established colonies.  He thought that the influence of \"pure, unselfish, Christian love\" was the only influence that could never fail and that this alone civilized the world. Everett liked the idea of the spread of the Christian and American ideals to Africa more than the civilization of the Native Africans."],"display_date":"January 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-18","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4465,"title":"Smilin&#39; Schuyler Rails Against The Laws of Kansas\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-06-21","end_date":"1856-06-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1850, the Midwest remained largely undeveloped and in the eyes of many New Englanders it seemed a very profitable proposition.

However, in the months following the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, the proposal reasserted itself as the federal government and its responsibilities expanded enormously.  As a result, in the second session of the 30th Congress on March 3, 1849, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed the \"Act to establish the Home Department, and to provide for the Treasury Department an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.\"  Amongst the numerous duties allocated to the Secretary of the Interior, such as the supervision of the General Land Office, the distribution of the decennial national census, and the organization of U.S. metal mines, the act notably assigned \"the supervisory and appellate powers now exercised by the Secretary of the War Department, in relation to all the acts of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\" to the new Secretary of the Interior as well.","Judging by appearances, the Department of the Interior as outlined in the 1849 act seemed like more of a depository of offices from other executive departments with which they had little to do anymore, as the first Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing noted in his 1849 report.  Nevertheless, the act highlighted an important transition in the U.S. federal government's attitude towards Indians, most of whom had been removed to west of the Mississippi River a decade prior if not earlier.  In fact, prior to this statute the Commissioner of Indian Affairs operated under the supervisory powers of the Secretary of War, clearly indicating the combative attitude that was presumed necessary when interacting with any Indian tribe.  However, by 1849 the \"Indian problem\" that had struck fear in so many Americans' hearts during the thirty years earlier now appeared relatively innocuous; indeed, as prominent American Indian historian Wilcomb E. Washburn observed, with the immense tracts of land that Mexico surrendered in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo \"the duties performed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs were bound to increase\" but they were to be \"more oriented to peaceful pursuits than to warlike ones.\"  The preceding rationale - which was originally espoused by Treasury Secretary Robert J. Walker in 1848 - effectively encouraged white Americans to turn their eyes toward 'civilizing' the Indian by introducing an agriculturally-based lifestyle which would eventually aid white expansion onto Indian grounds across the Southwest and the Plain States.  Thus, as white America continued its march westward under the guise of Manifest Destiny, the American Indian began to be perceived as less of a military threat and more of land resource to be manipulated."],"display_date":"March 3, 1849","search_date":"1849-03-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4632,"title":"Sumner-Brooks Affair","course_id":23,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-22","end_date":"1856-05-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner sat as his desk in the nearly empty Chamber of the United States Senate on May 22, 1856. He had recently given a speech called “The Crime Against Kansas” on abolishing slavery in the United States. The speech described atrocities occurring in Kansas at the time. There pro-slavery border ruffians from Missouri crossed into Kansas and attacked anti-slavery settlers. Senator Sumner specifically mentioned Senator Andrew Butler, of South Carolina in the speech because of his involvement with the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Butler’s nephew, Congressman Preston Brooks, who had taken the speech particularly personally, entered the Senate Chamber. He proceeded to attack Senator Sumner with a walking stick. Brooks, who was accompanied at the time by Congressman Laurence Keitt of South Carolina and Congressman Henry Edmundson of Virginia, assaulted Sumner “with a considerable amount of violence.\" Sumner was struck with “numerous blows on and about the head with a walking stick which cut his head.\" Brooks hit Sumner so hard with the cane that part of the cane shattered. When other senators attempted to intervene and assist Senator Sumner, they were blocked by Congressman Keitt, who was wielding a pistol and shouting.","The attack was brutal, and Senator Sumner did not make another public appearance after the attack until November 5, 1856. Sumner did not return to the Senate for three years, but was repeatedly reelected by the Massachusetts General Court. Despite the extreme violence involved in the attack, an investigation by the United States Congress determined that Brooks did not intend to kill Sumner, but simply aimed to “punish him.\"","The 1856 attack shed light on the amount of passion in the debate about slavery n the United States during the 1850s. It was common for physical altercations to occur on the frontier in the Kansas area between anti-slavery and pro-slavery settlers, but a physical exchange in the Senate Chamber did not happen often. The fact that such a violent attack was not regarded as much more than retribution for something said in a speech by Senator Sumner exemplified how the conflict between pro-slavery and anti-slavery partisans was increasingly escalating into violence during the 1850s. Northerners and Southerners obviously reacted to the incident differently. Many Southerners viewed Brooks’s ations as manly and honorable because he was standing up not just for his family, but also his state, section, and slavery. However, in the North physicality and violence were increasingly at odds with ideals of manhood among the middle classes, and many northerners to viewed the caning of Sumner by Brooks as a barbaric assault, not just on Sumner himself, but on the fabric of American democracy. Speeches given at the time were taken personally, especially when the speeches invoked the names of relatives.

By the 1850s there was a full out war of words in both chambers of Congress as each side was becoming increasingly uncompromising in their cause. These tensions had been creeping across the country at an extremely fast rate throughout the nineteenth century, and by 1856 violence over the issue was something that occurred more often. The peak of these violent acts began in 1855, as proslavery and antislavery forces violently confronted one another in the newly formed territory of Kansas.","This Border War, called Bleeding Kansas by many living at the time, conveys the desperation of both sides; many Northerners wished to keep slavery from spreading, and many Southerners hoped slavery would continue for years. Violent outbreaks in the Kansas territory made it clear to everyone that the issue of slavery was not one that would be decided by a piece of paper signed by men in Washington D.C. People in the North saw the violence committed by these anti-abolitionists as vile and disgusting, while those in the South saw this as their last, viable option. The halls of Congress soon became another front in this war as politicians took up the argument of their counterparts. Charles Sumner, Senator from Massachusetts, had always proved his abilities as an orator and leader. He chose to use his talents to convey the sheer atrocity being committed by slaveholding Southerners. On May 19 and again on the 20<sup>th</sup>, Sumner stood in front of his fellow Senators and made his case against the Kansas-Nebraska Act. He began with soaring rhetoric criticizing the bill on a legal level; however, matters soon turned personal. As he stood in the front of the dozens of other Senators, Charles Sumner openly mocked the main authors of the bill, Senator Stephen A. Douglas and Representative Andrew Butler of South Carolina. Using the same skills that made him a revered abolitionist in Massachusetts, Sumner embarrassed these two men. Sumner talked about how Douglas was a “noisome, squat, and nameless animal” and that he was “not a proper model for an American senator.” These words drew cheers and chuckles from Northerners, while Southerners looked at Sumner as though he had just spat in their faces. Sumner continued, and became even more personal when he began to talk about Butler. He accused Butler of having “a mistress, who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight – I mean, the harlot, Slavery.” Northerners went wild, as did the Southerners, for obvious different reasons. Sumner continued to batter the elder statesman as he mocked his speech and physical mannerisms, which had been greatly affected by a stroke Butler had suffered from. By the time the session that day had ended, Sumner’s speech had roused support from many of his fellow Northerners and complete resentment from many others. News traveled fast about this speech, but no one thought it would take the turn it did.","Two days following the attack, Charles Sumner was busy doing paperwork in an almost empty Senate Chamber. Unbeknownst to him, Rep. Butler’s nephew, Representative Preston Brooks entered the chamber. He approached Sumner, along with Laurence Keitt and Henry A. Edmundson. Sumner stopped writing and gave his attention to the three men before him. Sumner measured up the men in front of him, and before he had the chance to say anything, Preston Brooks began. He politely informed Sumner that he had read his speech two times, and that it was “a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine.” Sumner, realizing the severity of the situation stood up to speak with Brooks. As Sumner began to rise out of his chair, Brooks lifted his thick gutta-percha cane with a gold head. He raised the cane and brought it down with such a force that Sumner was immediately knocked to the floor. Blood splattered everywhere, and Brooks continued to beat the unarmed Senator. Sumner attempted to find shelter under the desk, but Brooks, in such a rage, was able to rip the bolted desk out of the floor. He continued to assault the Senator, who by this time had been blinded by his own blood and was near unconsciousness. Slowly and painfully, Sumner made his way up the aisle in the chamber, with Brooks following him the whole way, beating him the whole way, until breaking his cane over Sumner’s head. As Sumner lay unconscious, other Senators ran over to help him, and Butler, as casually as he had entered the building, left."],"display_date":"May 19, 1856 - May 22, 1856","search_date":"1856-05-20","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":193,"tag":"Abolitionism"},{"id":200,"tag":"Bleeding Kansas"},{"id":201,"tag":"Brooks-Sumner Fight"},{"id":244,"tag":"Violence"}],"course":{"name":"The Abolitionists and American Society","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":23,"school_id":11}},{"id":4689,"title":"Subcommittee formed to better manage aliens.","course_id":26,"status":"P","start_date":"5/24/81","end_date":"5/24/81","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The fourth wave of immigration to the United States, created by the Immigration Act of 1965, was due to the economic situations of émigrés.

When the Allies learned of the Nazi art plunder, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program was established to locate and return as many works as possible to their original locations. Nicknamed the “Monuments Men,” the group consisted of approximately 350 men and women who were museum directors, curators, and art historians who volunteered for service in the U.S. Army to attempt to protect the works of art stolen by the Nazis. Joined by passionate curators and directors at the prominent European museums such as Rose Valland, curator of the Louvre museum, the Monuments Men were able to obtain confidential traces to the locations of the Nazis’ hiding places. Art treasures were recovered from mines, trains, and other storage sites where they were waiting to be transported to Germany and destined for residency in the Fuhrermuseum. Rescuing millions of prominent works by Old Masters such as De Vinci, Cezanne, Manet, Raphael, Vermeer, and many more, the Monuments Men restored the cultural heritage of Europe back to the hands of its own people."],"display_date":"June 23, 1943 - June 8, 1946","search_date":"1944-12-14","locations":[{"id":25291,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":290,"tag":"Crime"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":289,"tag":"Art/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":26,"school_id":3}},{"id":4702,"title":"<strong>Ronald Reagan Signals a Change in US Policy Toward Central America</strong>","course_id":26,"status":"P","start_date":"11/16/80","end_date":"11/16/80","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Only days after Ronald Reagan’s 1980 presidential victory, an article in the <em>New York Times </em>explored how his conservative politics would change the nature of the conflicts in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Alan Riding wrote “Reagan Impact Felt in Central America” as a broad overview of the actions and reactions that happened in the region due to anticipated changes in United States policy. This reporter had credibility on the subject of U.S.-Central American relations because it was his journalistic specialty from 1970-1989.","Alan Riding reported in the article that the Guatemalans greatly anticipated Reagan coming to power “The conservative Government and private sector in Guatemala, which had been strongly critical of President Carter’s human rights campaign, were delighted by his defeat and seemed hopeful of resumed American military assistance to help combat leftist guerrillas.”","The historical context leading up to this involved official policy from the previous administration.","In 1977 President Jimmy Carter ordered a human rights report on the actions of the Guatemalan military. What the study found was later confirmed by the United Nations Commission for Historical Clarification. The Guatemalan military was responsible for 93% of the human rights violations committed during the war, the guerrillas for 3%. The Guatemalan government reacted to these negative findings by refusing United States military aid.","Reagan immediately voiced his support for funding Guatemala once again in his first presidential news conference. He stated: “You can [not] turn away from some country because here and there they do not totally agree with our concept of human rights.”  Public opinion at the time about United States involvement in Central American Civil Wars is hard to gauge. While some, like former Peace Corp volunteer John Elder actively participated in the process of bringing Guatemalan refugees to the United States, most Americans remained inactive. The United States Military’s involvement was mostly logistical, so the violence did not have a direct effect on American citizens. Our aid to Guatemala did not cause the same public out rage that Vietnam did because few Americans died. The reinstatement of funding was a political success from Reagan’s point of view and by 1983, most of the Guatemalan countryside was subdued. This episode correctly previewed the situation in Central America and the changes that Ronald Reagan's administration would bring to US policy for that region."," "],"display_date":"November 16, 1980","search_date":"1980-11-16","locations":[{"id":40259,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":39105,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":293,"tag":"Ronald Reagan"},{"id":294,"tag":"Containment"},{"id":295,"tag":"International Relations"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":26,"school_id":3}},{"id":4794,"title":"Charles Hudson Speaks Against the Annexation of Texas","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-20","end_date":"1845-12-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the fierce debate over the annexation of Texas, Charles Hudson, took the floor of the House of Representatives in hopes of preventing the admission of Texas to the Union.  A Whig member of the House of Representatives, representing Massachusetts, as well as a Universalist minister, Hudson emphasized the selfish motives of the Southern advocates for annexation.","The admission of Texas to the Union would have been to the South’s advantage, as many Texas citizens were southerner’s who had migrated there with their slaves, and would therefore result in another slave state, as discussed by scholar, Jesse Macy.  This would have then given the South greater representation in Congress.  As a citizen of Massachusetts, Hudson opposed the annexation of Texas because Northern states would have been overruled by the South in Congress.  Hudson’s opposition was further cemented through his political affiliation as a Whig, as the Whig Party was a party dominated by the North, and therefore opposed to the annexation of Texas and expansion of slavery.  Further, Massachusetts was specifically against annexation as it was a hotbed of resistance to the annexation, led by Whigs as discussed by scholar Kinley J. Brauer.  Whigs were also apprehensive about the possibility of war with Mexico.","The South was not keen to point out how advantageous the annexation of Texas would be to the furtherance of their interests and the continuity of slavery, but rather attempted to persuade the North that the annexation of Texas would work to preserve the Union and expand Northern industry.  Hudson addressed this as he discussed the argument made by Southern Congressmen that “the commercial advantages to be derived from a connexion [sic] with Texas would be immensely great.”  Hudson quickly saw through the possible advantages of acquiring Texas for the North, as he points out that “the very annexationists, those new-born friends of Northern manufacturers, have been constantly in the habit of assailing manufacturers.”","Besides these attempts to persuade the North that annexing Texas was in its best interest, Hudson stated that the House of Representatives received little information on why they should annex Texas.  Congress only received threats that it was important to annex Texas, because if not the South may secede as they had more to gain through affiliation with Texas than with the North.  This can be observed, according to Hudson in Mr. C. J. Ingersoll’s opening of the debate on the admission of Texas as he stated “that he should offer no argument in favor of the measure, till he should hear it assailed!”  Further, Hudson pointed out that during meetings regarding the annexation of Texas throughout the South, “annexation or dissolution were the only alternatives presented.”","Hudson quickly dismissed these arguments as he argued that the annexation of Texas “is a device, got up by Messrs. Upshur and Calhoun, to place slavery on a more permanent foundation, and to give the South a balance [of] power.”  Texas would be annexed in “an attempt, in one part of the Union, to build itself up at the expense of another.”  He wanted to argue that the annexation of Texas could also have possibly led to war, and a great accumulation of debt, and would not have provided any of the advantages that the Southerners discussed.  In essence, the annexation of Texas would tear the Union apart, as “the admission of Texas into the Union would sow the seeds of discontent and alienation and do more to jeorpard[ize] the peace and endanger the perpetuity of the Union.”","Regardless of the problems Texas potentially caused the Union, Congressmen such as Hudson were succumbed to defeat, as Texas was annexed to the Union in 1845."],"display_date":"January 20, 1845 - December 29, 1845","search_date":"1845-07-10","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":34,"tag":"Crime/Violence, Economy, Law, Slavery, Urban Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4976,"title":"Calhoun Foreshadows Two Nations","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-02-06","end_date":"1832-02-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 6, 1837, John C.

Hoping to restore hope to the public, Roosevelt assured them that Congress was taking the necessary steps to fix the economic situation.","In the early 1900’s, the United States entered the “Great Depression.” With the stock market crash, the majority of people lost jobs, along with their homes. Soup kitchens had more business than ever before. People had to change their lifestyles just so that they could survive. Roosevelt came up with numerous programs to help the country’s economic situation.

He explained that he knew everything was not yet perfect, but soon everything would turn around and begin to get better.

Or at least one of his 12 original Constitutional amendments had been resuscitated. With near unanimity (Senate: 99-0; House: 414-3) Congress showed its support for the Twenty-Seventh Amendment on May 20,1992. The Amendment prohibits adjustments to Congressional salaries from taking effect before an election intercedes. Yet the vote was largely meaningless, as earlier in the month Michigan had become the thirty-eighth state to ratify the proposal – thus giving it the three-quarters proportion needed to amend the Constitution. Six states originally ratified the proposal between 1789 and 1791; Ohio became the seventh in 1873. Only one other state (Wyoming, in 1978) would endorse it before a legislative aide in Texas named Gregory Watson stumbled across the amendment in 1982 and initiated a campaign for its revival. By 1988, a total of 25 states had ratified Madison's motion.","But had the 203 years between its proposal and ultimate adoption rendered the earliest states' approval invalid? No, according to Don Wilson, Archivist of the United States, who certified the Amendment's validity six days prior to the vote in Congress. (It has become practice recently for proposals to contain a sunset clause – typically seven years – but this was not the case with Madison's amendments.) And thus it became law. Although why – after having lain dormant for two centuries – should this proposal suddenly take on such importance?","There is a theory as to how “structural” amendments such as the Twenty-Seventh arise. An event triggers widespread awareness of a problem with how government works. In response, a coalition forms that amends the Constitution to resolve the problem. In 1989, Congress implemented pay raises that saw Senate salaries increase 14 percent – and House salaries go up 40 percent – by 1991. Over this same time frame, public confidence in Congress fell significantly. There was little public appetite for Congressional pay increases in the face of growing perceptions of arrogance and allegations of corruption against some members of Congress. It is no surprise then that the elections of 1990 and 1992 revealed strong anti-incumbent sentiments amongst the electorate. Combined with Watson's drive, this led 15 states (including the linchpin, Michigan) to endorse the resolution between 1989 and 1992, as a means of restoring some legitimacy to the governing institutions in the public’s eye. It is also why when Congress backed the resolution on May 20 – given it had no legal impact – the vote was seen as largely political.","The Twenty-Seventh Amendment has been described as amendment by “stealth,” given the lengthy delay between proposal and ratification. Nevertheless, it is an example of the tradition of using the constitution to correct a structural problem of government, one even the Founding Fathers recognized as an issue. “James Madison saw something wrong with members of Congress increasing their own salaries, unchecked by their constituencies...

In her diary, Caroline documented her day-to-day life and travels, as well as her dreams, passions, and concerns.   After the Panic of 1837 left her father bankrupt, Caroline set out to do what she could to aid her family’s troubled situation.  As a young woman of only twenty years, Caroline began teaching at Miss English’s school in Georgetown, D.C.  On her second day at the school, a young slave girl named Christie came up and asked her for a lesson. ","After thirty minutes or so of reading and history lessons, Christie admitted she feared she would never be free.  Caroline replied “The whites must be servants of God Christie—and you are very happy now.”  The conversation continued for some time as Christie and Caroline discussed God’s plan and the reasons why blacks could not all be free at once, “… it is because few of you are wise enough, and good enough to be trusted with liberty.”  Caroline cited various biblical passages referencing the important, and sometimes trying, relationship between servant and master.  She concluded her entry with ruminations over her homesickness, as well as her hope that God would unveil her fate and intended duty in the world. ","It may seem odd that Caroline, who was deeply grounded in her religious faith as a Unitarian, spoke out against the abolition of slavery.  This anti-abolitionist attitude, however, prevailed in the early 1840s throughout most of the North.  In Caroline’s hometown of Boston, only seven years prior to this entry’s inscription, William Lloyd Garrison, the editor of the abolitionist newspaper <em>The Liberator </em>was dragged through the streets and almost hung by an anti-abolitionist mob until he was rescued by local law enforcement.  To many, slavery was an institution that seemed remote and irrelevant in day-to-day life.  Abolitionists also posed a direct challenge to the local elites in cities nationwide, challenging the status quo and threatening to empower not only the enslaved, but free blacks and women as well. It was also a system which had stimulated the growth of northern business, the very industry that Caroline’s father worked in as a merchant in Boston.  Caroline’s attitudes toward abolitionism were no doubt shaped by the prevailing attitudes of the time as well as her upbringing as a wealthy merchant’s daughter in New England. "],"display_date":"September 11, 1842","search_date":"1842-09-11","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":193,"tag":"Abolitionism"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5072,"title":"The Single Inaugural Address of President Zachary Taylor","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-12-04","end_date":"1849-12-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["President Zachary Taylor's only inaugural address of the year 1849 is, at first glance, a rather typical political address from a rather typical president. He is one president in the long line of ex-military men to join politics. Like many, he was not especially interested in politics and more coerced into it. Taylor and his address are an important because he is one of the presidents in the run-up to the events prior to the Civil War.","Taylor received the Whig nomination for president and defeated the Democratic candidate Lewis Cass and the Free Soil candidate, Martin van Buren. He is also the last southern President until Lyndon Johnson.","Taylor's inaugural address of 1849 is a very typical political speech. He emphasizes a strong and effective military and naval presence. Being an ex-military man himself, he was also a strong nationalist. He also talks about the strong relationship the United States has with other nations and how he believes in strengthening and maintaining those friendships, especially towards France, with whom they had had a minor altercation. Taylor says he has “scrupulously avoided any interference in the wars and contentions which have recently distracted Europe.” This was demonstrated in the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty signed by the United States and Great Britain.","President Taylor believed in a strong government banking system and wanted to express that the federal government should encourage agriculture, commerce and manufacturing.","Taylor's short term was dominated by the issue of slavery. Although a southern war hero who owned slaves, Taylor felt he needed to take a moderate issue on slavery. Although, he did not mince his words when talking about hanging anyone who broke the law. However, slavery does not appear as an issue in his address. The only way it comes up is when he mentions that people have been buying American-made boats in Brazil and using them for the slave trade. The idea behind The Compromise of 1850 was formulated during Taylor's time in office, yet he died while it was being debated.","Taylor was not a very effective president himself and most of the men he appointed were not very competent and effective either.

Interestingly, Whigs on the whole favored protective tariffs, which arguably interfere with the free market and supply-demand processes.","In the <em>Review</em>, the role of government was also discussed; building upon the Hamiltonian nationalist tradition, the Whigs largely argued against nullification. Daniel Webster’s performance in his debates with Robert Y. Hayne was applauded by the journal. One writer commented, “Mr. Webster might regard this achievement as the chief honor of his life.” Indeed, the Whigs drew upon nationalism for other topics of debate, not just nullification.","The rise and fall of the American Whig Party is a story which has been thoroughly documented and analyzed; its split over the issue of slavery is of particular interest to historians.

As such, especially in Washington DC, there has always been a battle between local identity and the identity of a nation. This was evidenced especially by Arthur Singleton, who ended up traveling across the United States and wrote predominantly about the growing identity of the new country. In his 1816 letter to his brother he captured his feelings about America, exclaiming “How enobling to be the feelings of an American president, to stand upon Capitol-Hill, and to cast his thoughts northward, and southward, and westward, over our vast and free continent, and to reflect that he is the chosen monarch of all he surveys, and whose right there is none to dispute.” His thoughts convey a sense of awe towards American national identity and seek to glorify its various institutions of law and governance.","Singleton uses a fairly constant and glorifying tone to describe America by stating so much as simple facts in a grandiose way. He writes that “The Federal City is nearly equidistant from the northern and southern extremities of the confederacy, from the cold Saint Croix, to the warm Sabine... yet is there but one vast expanse, one peopled tract, over which delegated parental domination extends.” He expresses physical facts in such a way and at such a time that he shows that he, at least, looks up to the state and sees it as something glorious and magnificent. Further, he showcases not only a form of nationalism, but a distinct one. Singleton writes disapprovingly about two times when George Washington met Congress – first, “it is said, he went on foot, in a plain domestic suit” and “the second year, he went in a costly foreign velvet dress.” The implication is that there is prominent European influence on America or that American culture is changing as a result of its rising prosperity. Further, the simplest explanation for Singleton’s discontent with Washington adopting European customs is the idea that America is somehow superior or “freer” than other states, which is supported throughout the text via the heavy use of simile.","This heavy emphasis on nationalism was not confined to Washington DC, however. Bart Bonikowsky explains that “Partisan conflict abated considerably in the [early] ... 19th century, giving way once again to a shared “national feeling”. As would be the case time and again throughout American history, the population was united by military conflict. The War of 1812 brought Americans together military service, [and] created animosities toward the British that matched those that had existed against the French.” Thus, the War of 1812 may have been one cause of the immense love for his country that Singleton writes about. This seems to make sense, especially given the fact that he wrote his letter just one year after the war of 1812 ended – the right time at which not only to capture the feeling of animosity towards the British during the war that persisted but to capture feelings of pride for America as a strong force.  As such, nationalism was strong in the years following the war and contributed to a self-image of greatness."],"display_date":"January 17, 1800 - September 15, 1816","search_date":"1808-05-17","locations":[{"id":15677,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":787,"tag":"Urban Life"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5105,"title":"Sexism in Washington DC in the Early 1800’s","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"1800-02-05","end_date":"1816-10-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sexism has always been a significant problem throughout America’s history, and while much of it has been directly targeting women, it permeates through language used by Americans. This is shown by Arthur Singleton’s letter from Washington DC in 1816, where he makes the comment that “I bless myself, that this country is not subject to Gynæcocracy; that, by our Salique law, no woman is eligible to our presidency.” This functions as an assertment of the “traditional” belief that women are not eligible to have the same rights, dignities, and so on as men.","Yet Singleton’s defense of his statement sounds more like providing excuses rather than a justification for his belief, and he provides said excuses in a number of ways. First, he looks to the Bible – which says that “the women should look to the man for counsel,” and to a few historical examples which may not be enough to prove or disprove his point – he just says that there have been few great queens, but he never directly denies that there have been great queens in the past. Further, the majority of his attempted justifications for his statement involve masked assertions – such as the idea that “legislation... is too weighty for the sensitive fibres of the female mind.” or that “woman should rule, not indeed in civil jurisdiction, which would unsphere her, but in her vast natural province.” As such, Singleton conveys the social beliefs of the time, which rest upon not fact but prejudice.","Yet these beliefs were not limited to Washington DC; they existed throughout society, and to a great magnitude. As Kathryn S. Hahn explains, not only were women seen as incompetent, they were seen as foreign, saying “Women were used to hiding aspects of their lives that made them uniquely feminine. They hid such things as pregnancy, because it was different from men, and men were the norm in society. If they did not hide the differences they were... considered insane.” This passage gives the effect of such prejudice as carried out by society especially during the 1800’s – that the idea that femininity was foreign and associated with incompetence in “male roles” was apparent throughout society. As such, women were constantly discriminated against both directly and indirectly, with horrible consequences resulting from society’s mindset."],"display_date":"February 5, 1800 - October 5, 1816","search_date":"1808-06-06","locations":[{"id":15677,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":787,"tag":"Urban Life"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":788,"tag":"Sexism"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5109,"title":"French women's impression of American race relations","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"11/11/18","end_date":"5/1/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Comtesse Madeleine de Bryas and her sister Jacqueline were born, raised and cultured in Paris.  During 1918, the two sisters were in the United States for six months to raise funds for the “American Committee for Devastated France”  by giving speeches. While they travelled shore to shore by train they liked America and the American people they met.  They had wonderful comments about American society and especially about American women.  In their book they gave their impressions of America by comparing American culture and fashion to French. Of course, they had positive impressions of America and especially the hospitality and generosity of the American people.  The sisters traveled across America from New York to St. Louis to San Francisco and the Puget Sound before their return east to Washington, D.C.","One of the observations the two French sisters had was in Washington, D.C. They both came across an American soldier who came up to them and introduced himself to them.  He asked them where they were from, and they said they were French from Paris.  The soldier had the most respectful manner towards them.  The two sisters had the same manners towards the American soldier.  While they were getting to know the young soldier they became extremely interested in the “negro” question.  They knew that life was hard for them, especially for African American women. The soldier admitted that some of the laws America had must not be fair to the French, but that was how things were here.  The sisters understood that, but they still felt bad about it.","By World War I, the military forces had a source of black pride.  Black educators, clergymen, and after a while the press referred to them as Negro heroes of America’s past wars. After the Civil War, the U.S Army kept four Negro regiments.  These units integrated veterans of the civil war and the frontier Indian fighting regiments.  Retired sergeants became appreciated traditional leaders in their communities. This history set a foundation for the African American support and connection in America’s future wars.  In 1917, the United States went to World War I under the slogan “Make the World Safe for Democracy.” In a week after the U.S went to war, the War Department stopped accepting black volunteers because colored army quotas were filled.  No black men were allowed in the Marines, Coast Guard or Air Force.  They were only allowed in the Navy and then only as mess men.  More than 2,000,000 blacks registered for the war and only thirty one percent were accepted to twenty six percent of the white men.  African Americans then comprised ten percent of the population.  World War I was to represent a change in African American history.

The debate over the chemical’s risks and therapeutic possibilities led to Senate subcommittee hearings on its use. Acid, as LSD is commonly called, had been sensationalized by mass media publications and, although in its early years it had been extensively and responsibly studied by medical professionals, the effects of such a powerful chemical remained unclear. Psychologist Timothy Leary was one of the most prominent advocates of LSD, arguing that his medical research of LSD had shown tremendous therapeutic possibilities. However, many Americans remained suspicious of the chemical’s powerful nature. Chairman Thomas Dodd, a conservative Democrat from Connecticut, called for quick measures to stamp out the rapid spread of LSD among America’s youth generation.","In order to gain a better understanding of LSD’s implications, Senator Dodd convened subcommittee hearings on recreational drug use among America’s youth. Leary was one of many expert witnesses called to testify. In his testimony, he asserted that “the challenge of the psychedelic chemicals is not just how to control them, but how to use them,” emphasizing the need for further investigation of LSD rather than complete prohibition. Leary also claimed that LSD and many other psychedelic drugs were not dangerous if used wisely and with precautions.","However, his opinion endured aggressive questioning by Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who criticized Leary’s testimony as “general hyperbole.” Additionally, the subcommittee chairman cited an earlier testimony by another doctor who argued that LSD encouraged homicidal tendencies and destructive behavior. Leary continued his attempts to placate the committee and remove LSD’s negative associations. When Kennedy asked if LSD usage was “extremely dangerous,” Leary replied, “Sir, the motor car is dangerous if used improperly… Human stupidity and ignorance is the only danger human beings face in this world.” Leary’s testimony urged for some type of licensing that would require LSD users to be highly trained, much like a pilot’s license, so that responsible adults could use LSD “for serious purposes, such as spiritual growth, pursuit of knowledge, or their own personal development.” He also noted that without such licensing, Americans faced “another era of prohibition” that would create a new group of college-educated white-collar criminals. In a later autobiographical work, Leary would claim that Kennedy’s bullying presence was merely an attempt “to gain respectability points by lynching me!”","Leary was one of many experts who testified at the 1966 subcommittee hearings, which showed both ardent support and uncompromising opposition to LSD. Its testimonies marked the conflict between medical professionals, intellectuals, and government officials who struggled to agree on LSD’s meaning as well its regulation. The hearings also embodied the highly politicized atmosphere of the 1960s, which had conservative politicians utilizing acid as a scapegoat and to suppress radicalism among America’s younger generations. Just several months after the subcommittee hearings, LSD was banned in California. By October 1968, possession of LSD was banned federally in the United States with the passage of the Staggers-Dodd Bill, marking a tremendous step towards the “War On Drugs” campaign that would arise in the 1970s."],"display_date":"May 1966","search_date":"1966-05-16","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1007,"tag":"Drug Culture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5260,"title":"Kennedy Hears from a Worried Soviet Premier","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"10/26/62","end_date":"10/27/62","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Between 6:00 and 9:00 PM on the night of Friday October 26, 1962, the tenth day of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the members of President John F.

Everett Koop, charged with writing a detailed report on AIDS for the American people, described the development of AIDS in the US, “AIDS entered the consciousness of the public health service very quietly, very gradually, and with no fanfare at all.”  Even Surgeon General Koop found himself cut off from the deliberations for the first five years of the epidemic. President Reagan’s advisors shielded and isolated the president from the AIDS epidemic.  These individuals kept AIDS at the bottom of the presidential agenda because they felt there was nothing the government could do. However, Roger Higgs argues that the AIDS epidemic brought “greater openness” in public discourse in due time.","Negative stigmatism made it difficult for Koop to approach presidential advisors even after it was proven that it could be transmitted outside of homosexual acts.  The initial term for the epidemic was Gay-Related Immune Deficiency or GRID, in reference to the largest initial group of individuals to experience the disease.  Research proved that it was also transmissible through blood transfusion and heterosexual sex and the name was changed to Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS in 1982.  Despite the lingering social stigma, Koop remembered that the “the first public health priority…stop further transmission.”","The Reagan administration dealt with the crisis in a lackadaisical fashion and restricted Surgeon General Koop from obtaining information. Because of this public health measures for the prevention of AIDS took developed slower than they should have, even as research on the disease was progressing at an astounding rate.  Koop stated “we learned as much about the virus of AIDS in six years as we had learned about the polio virus in the previous 40 years.”  Development of the technology to detect and screen the blood for AIDS contamination was pivotal in the prevention of transmission.","The stigmas surrounding AIDS created ethical concerns for the dissemination of information to the general public.  Koop recalled that advisors to the president were very upset with certain terminology in the report, specifically “penis, vagina, rectum and condom.”  The AIDS epidemic exposed this language, making it mainstream and allowed for easier open and serious discussions about safe sex.  Koop was right when he stated, “at last with that report, the people of the country knew what was myth and what was reality about the AIDS epidemic.”  The American public was in the dark entirely too long, mostly due to the negative stigmas that surrounded AIDS in relation to homosexuality.  Koop fought to balance the need to share information and to please the Reagan administration and mainstream America."],"display_date":"1984 - 1988","search_date":"1986-07-02","locations":[{"id":40259,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":16,"tag":"Science/Technology"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5278,"title":"<strong>George H.W.

The news magazine, <em>The Nation</em>, wrote an article covering the details that led up to the scandal and it's aftermath. The Teapot Dome scandal took center stage in the United States with some very influential key players. U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Albert B. Fall and Edward L. Doheny, an oil millionaire, were charged with conspiracy and bribery.","On November 22, 1923, the former Secretary of the Interior, Albert B. Fall, and the proprietor of government oil leases, Edward L. Doheny, faced a jury on charges of conspiracy to defraud the government. The 1923 case brought before the D.C. court was the criminal aspect of the case. The civil portion of the case had been brought before a District of Columbia court three years earlier. The United States government had filed the civil case to terminate the leases held by Doheny. The government had won the suit in both lower courts, however, the case had been appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Many of the facts in this criminal case had been established in the civil case, which had been investigated by Senator J. Walsh. On the 22<sup>nd</sup> of November 1923, the jury had to consider a variety of evidence and decide if there was any connection between Albert B. Fall and Edward L. Doheny, and whether there was any illegal action between the two defendants.","On November 30, 1921, Edward L. Doheny arrived in Washington holding a black bag filled with a $100,000.00 in cash, given to him by his father. According to records, the bag was give to Secretary of the Interior, who, at the time, was Albert B. Fall, who controlled the naval oil reserves. In the exchange, according to Doheny's father, a note from Fall for receipt of the money was provided.","Rumors began two years after the exchange. Amazingly, Fall's run-down ranch began changing and ten years of unpaid taxes were suddenly paid. Fall insisted he borrowed the money from a friend, who denied the accusations. Later, Doheny addmitted that he was the money source. Before Doheny and Fall exchanged the little black bag, they shared a hotel several months prior. At this meeting, they discussed a possible project involving the construction of storage tanks in Hawaii. Doheny, through his Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company, were given contracts for the construction of the tanks that would hold 1,500,000 barrels of navy oil. Doheny would be paid for this with oil. Oil that was royalties to the Navy from drillers on the oil reserves of the mountain known as Teapot Dome. Unfortunately, the Navy was not receiving enough in royalties to pay Doheny. So, on December 11, 1922, a contract was awarded to Doheny, giving him drilling rights to 32,000 acre Elks Hill naval oil reserves.","The Teapot Dome scandal was a major corruption case during Warren Harding's administration. In 1921 Warren Harding ordered oil reserves controlled by the navy, transferred to the Department of the Interior. At that time, Albert B. Fall was the Secretary of the Interior, and had awarded the no-bid contract to Edward L. Doheny. Surprisingly, this was not against the law, however, the money and receiving of gifts was. The United States Senate investigation found the Fall had received compensation of approximately $400,000.00 over the past few years from Doheny and another oil millionaire, Harry Sinclair. Ultimately, on June 30, 1924, Fall was convicted of conspiracy and accepting bribes, he was sentenced to one year in prison and a $100,000.000 fine. Doheny was convicted for giving a bribe. Fall, Sinclair, and Doheny were all convicted of trying to defraud the government.

drafted the <em>Keating-Owen Child Labor Act of 1916</em> as a means to regulate youth labor.  This Act was named for its sponsors, Democratic Representatives Edward Keating and Robert Latham Owen.  The Act prohibited the shipment or delivery for shipment for interstate or foreign sale of any goods or services that were produced by laborers under the age of 14 in a factory, shop or cannery and under the age of 16 in a mine.  Also, child laborers under 16 years old could only work from 6am to 7pm and not for more than eight hours a day and not more than six days a week.","The Act specified that the U.S. Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor would convene a board to publish from time to time uniform rules and regulations to comply with this Act.  To enforce this Act, the Secretary of Labor would assign inspectors to perform inspections of workplaces that produce goods for commerce.  These inspectors would have the authority to make unannounced visits and would be given full access to the facility in question.   Anyone found in violation of this Act or who makes false statements or produces false evidence would be subject to fine and/or imprisonment.","By the early 1900s, census figures estimated that nearly two million children were employed in manufacturing, agriculture, mines, and stores and on city streets.  Most of these workers were under age 14.  They were typically the sons and daughters of poor immigrants helping to support their families.  Children working in factories, mines, mills and on farms were usually subjected to harsh working conditions.  They worked for twelve or more hours a day, and usually seven days a week.  Injuries and illnesses were very common.  Playtime and school were nonexistent for these youngsters.","The issue of child labor had become a concern to many Progressive reformers.  A group of reformers founded the National Labor Committee in 1904.  Their goal was to collect evidence to document the conditions faced by these young workers.  They hired investigators, such as Lewis Hine, to gather this information.","Hine interviewed and photographed countless young child laborers around the country.  He often had to hide his camera and even sneak into the work places to get his shots.  His photographs were very compelling.  The photographic evidence as well as his interviews brought much attention to the overwhelming facts of this very real problem.  Hine’s photographs and interviews were used to enlighten Congress to the fact that legislation needed to be introduced to ban the unsafe child labor practices.","Congress had hoped the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act could achieve their objective to rid the industrial market of immoral child labor practices.  This was not to be.  The Supreme Court ruled in Hammer vs. Dagenhart that the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act was unconstitutional in 1918.  They found that Congress could not regulate interstate commerce above the states’ right to regulate local trade as stated in the 10th amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  This was a big blow to Congress, the Progressive reformers and Lewis Hine.  They all had worked very hard to bring an end to an appalling American reality.","They would all have to wait to finally see real regulation of child labor practices in the U.S. until the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.  This Act successfully survived through Supreme Court challenges and even led to the reversal of Hammer vs. Dagenhart in 1941.  The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is still law today."],"display_date":"September 1, 1916","search_date":"1916-09-01","locations":[{"id":17283,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of

Great War in Europe had already lasted much longer than anticipated by the early months of 1917. Despite a long-standing precedent of neutrality in the face of foreign conflict, the United States steeled itself for the possibility of war. On February 26, 1917, the <em>New York Times</em> ran an article entitled \"Suffragist Pledge Aid to the Nation\" covering the National American Woman Suffrage Association’s pledge to aid in the war effort if the U.S. became involved in the conflict overseas. The Suffrage Association had met the day before in Washington, D.C. and had drafted a letter to President Woodrow Wilson promising the services of two million suffragists.","The <em>New York Times</em> cited the contents of the letter, which expressed the suffragists’ belief that \"the settlement of international difficulties by bloodshed is unworthy of the twentieth century\" [1]. However, despite their opposition to the war, the suffragists would remain loyal to the U.S. government and fulfill their civic duty to support the soldiers and the war effort. In anticipation that the U.S. might enter the war, the Suffrage Association planned to form a committee of representatives from each suffragist organization to ready them for war work, such as collecting rations and medical supplies. Additionally, the <em>Times</em> reported that a new bureau would coordinate the placement of women in the positions left empty by men shipped out to fight.","The suffragists’ letter to President Wilson made clear that they had \"no intention of laying aside [their] constructive, forward work\" to obtain voting rights for the female citizens of the United States [1]. At the same time the suffragists were pledging their loyalty to the nation, they were also planning a demonstration at the White House the following Sunday. According to the <em>Times</em> article, women from all over the country would rally together in support of a constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote. At the same meeting that produced the letter to President Wilson, the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage raised $12,500 in support of the demonstration outside of his offices. Later the same week, the Woman’s Party and the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage would be merged following another convention in Washington, D.C.","The <em>New York Times</em> article highlights some of the paradoxes of the time period in which it was published. Women were told to be prepared to fill men’s positions on the home front while the men were fighting overseas, and yet were not accorded the same rights as those men. They were encouraged to be loyal to the U.S. government, but had no say in choosing that government. During this time period, women were expected to be patriotic and functional, but not political or radical. Opponents to women’s suffrage frequently made comparisons between the suffragist movement and socialism, implying that the two were irretrievably intertwined. However, during World War One, suffragists rationed food, volunteered for the Red Cross, and worked in factories that produced munitions [2]. Their continued loyalty and patriotism deflated arguments that voting rights for women opened the doorway for radical socialist pacifism.","Ironically, suffragist actions to support the war effort fulfilled the female Red Cross volunteer ideal presented in pro-war propaganda. Organizations such as the National American Woman’s Suffrage Association featured in the <em>New York Times</em> article tried to prove women’s \"fitness for suffrage and equal citizenship rights by loyally supporting the government’s military preparedness and war policies\" [3]. Through the patriotic efforts of suffragists during World War I, American citizens came to accept that women were entitled to equal voting rights. Their ability to step in and keep the country functioning while a large portion of the male population fought valiantly overseas proved that suffragists were loyal to the United States of America and sought to be further enabled to participate in the country’s government."," ","[1] \"Suffragists Pledge Aid to the Nation.

As a result, they were captivated by its spread.  Each individual country hoped it would be spared and that distance from the initial outbreak would suffice as protection.  Americans watched as the disease originated in India and quickly spread to Egypt.  From there, the disease alarmingly spread to the Mediterranean, beginning European infection with Italy and eventually France. By September, 1865 newspapers viewed the disease’s spread to England to be inevitable.  This left the Atlantic as the United States’ only defense.  However, distance only prolonged American’s fears. It did not protect cities such as Washington D.C. from cholera’s inevitable arrival.  As the Daily National Republican stated, “We feel sure, however, that if the cholera comes this way, no quarantine, no dententions, no fumigation, no lines of demarcations will keep it out.”  The one bastion of American hope remained very similar to that experienced in previous outbreaks.  The reports dispersing from Cairo claimed cholera only affected “those who live in close, confined quarters” with “no drainage” and most importantly “general bad living”.  Those who drank, were prone to excess, and morally depraved were viewed as the only ones susceptible.","With these signs abroad Americans personified cholera as a malign evil and sought preemptive preparation as the cure to this disease.  In a poem from 1831 republished in an edition of the Daily National Republican, the disease was named a “pale white horse” spreading misery and death throughout the land.  Strategies included cleaning of both physical and moral garbage.  The main sources of information in 1865 were reports coming from afflicted nations and Europe.  United States papers took these claims as truth and reprinted them for their readers.  Overall, 1865 marked a tenuous time for Washington D.C. residents and other Americans as they were forced to watch cholera spread without halt, inevitably heading towards their shores."],"display_date":"September 1985","search_date":"1985-09-15","locations":[{"id":40259,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":1316,"tag":"washington d.c."},{"id":1315,"tag":"cholera"}],"course":{"name":"Nineteenth Century Urban Epidemics","school":"Furman University","course_id":82,"school_id":4}},{"id":5483,"title":"Professor Morse's Electric Telegraph - A review of the operation of the technology as well as the impact it had on the control and difusion of information.","course_id":85,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-08-01","end_date":"1842-08-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Alfred Vail waited for the message to arrive on the wire. His superior, Mr. Morse, had prepared the paper, and was about to send the message from the Supreme Court in Washington D.C.","The demonstration that was about to be undertaken was one that would introduce to America the ability to send a message via the new electrical telegraph. In August 1842, the <em>Tribune</em> described the operation of the telegraph and subsequent transmission of information via the electrical currents that made the communication possible.","The <em>Tribune </em>proposed that a person in Washington that wished to communicate to a second individual located in New York could do so in nearly an instant. The telegraph machine would utilize a signaling alphabet, called Morse Code, to send a series dots and dashes that could be converted to a message made up of Roman Letters. The receiving machine would then write the incoming message with a stylus, in dots and dashes; onto paper that was strapped to the cylinder on the machine. This was made possible by electrical cables that connected the sending and receiving machines and allowed them to exchange bursts of electric current that were controlled by electrified magnets on each machine.","Before the telegraph, there would be a distinct lag in the time between when an event would occur in one city and would be reported in the newspaper in another. During this era it was possible that days would go by in certain towns and cities where the local newspaper would report the following; “No news, No News and None is expected”? The telegraph now provided the potential of making news and other information available at an instant in all corners of the country. Harold Adams Innis, a communications theorist, pointed out that the telegraph removed a specific bias in the control and diffusion of the news. The most important information was always likely to be available in large urban centers but then was simply repeated or re-distributed to the cities and towns that dotted the periphery of these central areas. This fact was very important at the time as the core political authorities at the time were empowered by the fact that controlling information distribution at the center allowed them to completely monopolize the information that was diffused to the small towns and rural areas beyond the geographic centers. Once political control was exercised over the central news sources in the urban areas, the ability to change, twist, spin or misrepresent information further empowered the politicians and monopolies of the press.","The advent of the telegraph, and the ability to transmit a message at nearly 300,000 miles per second turned this experimental machine into much more than just a mysterious object filled with electricity. The telegraph had officially leveled the playing field and marked a turning point for the control over information. This loss of control at the political urban center allowed the regional daily press to escape and become independent. No more was it possible for the state capital or other political center to dominate the news. Now it would be possible to transmit a newspaper message or a portion of a presidential speech in minutes to everyone, enabling more local analysis of information that reflected the thoughts and ideologies of local inhabitants.","The <em>Tribune </em>also clearly posited other fears that many had in relation to the telegraph technology at this time. If the government did not seize the opportunity to control and manage the Telegraph, private industry would use it to bring competition, or even an end, to the Post Office and Pony Express. What was not realized at the time is that the power had already shifted and the birth of “Electric Media” had changed the playing field."],"display_date":"August 1842","search_date":"1842-08-16","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1365,"tag":"Telecommunication"},{"id":1362,"tag":"Telegraph"},{"id":1363,"tag":"Diffusion of Information"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":85,"school_id":43}},{"id":5495,"title":"Abraham Lincoln’s view on James K.

By 1957, just a teenager’s birth away from the end of the world’s largest and grandest war, the Suez Crisis prompted a reaction against communism.","Eisenhower explained how “Russia’s rulers have long sought to dominate the Middle East.” This was true with the Czars and it was true with the Bolsheviks. The Czars’ conflicts happened at around the same time as the Puritan witch hunts in the New World. This tale was described in Arthur Miller’s <em>The Crucible</em>, a play which mirrored the Communist witch hunts during the McCarthy-led Red Scare. Just like in Salem centuries before, American aggrandizers executed baseless attacks to further their own power, leaving the victims helpless and, more often than not, dead.","As Eisenhower discussed power politics between the United States and the Soviet Union, so too did Americans play games of political chicken with each other. During the televised Army-McCarthy hearings, the Wisconsin senator used bullying tactics, reckless dishonesty, and a willingness to do and say anything in order to grow in power. His tastelessness knew no bounds, so much so that at one point an individual asked McCarthy, “Have you no decency, sir?”","Eisenhower also discussed the religious significance of the region around the Suez Canal. As Eisenhower mentioned the word “Christianity,” no doubt millions of dollars’ worth of money were being printed and minted with the words “In God We Trust”. This recent addition, along with the new inclusion of “Under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance, was only a way to fight back against the “godlessness” of the Soviet Union.","The world changed during Eisenhower’s reign. Never before had a single weapon been able to wipe a city off the map. Never before had American women been given so much freedom only to have it taken away once the boys returned from war. Never before had peaceful demonstrations – bus boycotts, of all things – rocked the concepts of segregation and American racism to their very cores.","In his speech Eisenhower mentioned “the subjugation of Hungary by naked armed force”, yet he did not mention the Little Rock Nine – the group of students that had to be led into an integrated school by the 101<sup>st</sup> Airborne.

They were described as lacking “a modern social system, a flourishing economic life, and a democratic political structure” and were thus “vulnerable to communistic exploitation”. But more important than the containment of Communism was the control of oil – not for the United States directly, but for the European components of NATO. One can surmise that should Europe lose Arabian oil, the Marshall Plan would crumble and, bit by bit, country by country, the democratic western powers would turn to the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact for help.

His defiance against the Selective Services included his position as a minister in the Muslim religion, which he believe gave him the exemption from war as a clergyman and claiming himself as a victim of racial discrimination within his own country. While both of these reasons were dismissed in court, Ali had already made up his mind that whether he was legally justified or not he would not serve in the army. The author, Tom Wicker, dismisses Ali as one man who does not pose a problem to the approval or disapproval of the draft let alone the entire war. In reality the fact that one famous man gained national attention for his opposition to the Vietnam draft only zoomed in on a problem that was plaguing the nation, particularly its younger generation. However, Wicker does point out a valid concern and question for the American people and its government and that is if one man feels this way then what would happen if hundreds of thousands of other young people decide to not only disagree with the draft but refuse to be drafted themselves? If that many male dissenters decided to refrain from joining the army what would happen to a country entrenched in democratic ideals rolled in the belief of rights and freedom? As Wicker indicates it is one thing when the American government attempts to imprison one dissenter but what about hundreds of thousands? To do something of such extremity, would put the United States at a hypocritical angle and turn them into the very Communist they so very much opposed. And while Wicker does not believe the famous boxer was trying to spark an uprise, it is obvious that Muhammad Ali as a young Black man, was the embodiment of whom was against the draft and why they were against it.","While Ali was no college student, a large portion of the Vietnam dissenters consisted of college students and young people, who unlike their parents in WWII who believed in the defeat of the Nazis for the greater good of the U.S., saw the Vietnam War as gruesome and an atrocious assault that involved the sacrifice of their lives and freedom including the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese peasants. How could these young people not feel threatened at this point by their own government when the average age of soldiers being sent to Vietnam was 19? So as the war dragged on and more people lost their lives, Americans began losing patience with a war they felt would forever drag on and a government who were showing no sign of stopping. As the war raged on so did the radicalism of the anti-war, anti-draft Vietnam movement. Students began their protests in college campuses and soon enough various campuses across the nation were hosts key events such as the March 24, 1965 “T-Day” where the University of Michigan hosted lectures and seminars opposing the war in Vietnam with more than 3,000 people in attendance. Young people were turning their college campuses into a type of college government because they understood that the outcome or even lengthening of this war would effect their futures directly and graduation dates meant a direct ticket to Vietnam. After the national “T-Day” came the Antiwar March to Washington D.C. on April 15th of the same year. While the 25,000 protestors consisted of professors, clergy, and peace organizations it was the college students and young people who dominated the scene. This movement was more than today's stereotype of hippies in communes; these were protestors who came from middle class suburbs, with parents who were professionals. They were resisters who viewed the war with a morality derived from earlier movements and understood the professional and political moves they made were never to be made thoughtlessly. In other words they used their education and where they derived said education to their advantage.","Among these students and young people were Black organizations and peoples as part of the anti-draft and anti-war movement, however their reasoning was completely different than that of their fellow White protestors. When Muhammad Ali resisted the draft, African-Americans paid close attention to just how the government would handle a famous Black celebrity during a time where racial tension was still an unfortunate factor in the U.S. When Ali boldly exclaimed “No Viet Cong ever called me a nigger,” these words demonstrated the emotions and anger many Black men felt towards the American government. Why fight for a country that still treated them as second class citizens? As the boxing authorities stripped him of his titles further anger towards what Blacks believed to be a racist motive became fuel for the war opposition. Ali became motivation for many Black Americans who were not already involved in the movement to do something not only about the war but the racism and discrimination that plagued them. One of the more startling effects of discrimination during Vietnam were the disproportionate percentages of just whom was being sent off to war and what positions they were being put in. For Americans with higher education levels they had a better chance of receiving office jobs compared to the 80 percent of ground troops which consisted of lower class or minority peoples meaning African Americans would get the short end of the stick. More Black troops were being sent into more dangerous areas than their White counterparts taking their opposition of the war to a different level. This level consisted with Black males fighting for their gender roles as a minority in a world ruled by Whites while dealing with the Selective Services forcing their own people to fight and stand up for a country that would never stand up for them.","A vast majority (including the protestors of that time) believe this specific movement to be part of the reason for the end of the war. This theory has been a particularly controversial one and while the Vietnam War resistance was not the first, it did make a significant impact according to Stephen Kohn who credits the protestors with collapsing the Selective Service's draft system. It is also believed that while the resistance and the war raged on together, many war decisions were taken into account thanks to the peace movement. For example the antiwar movement played a role in the decision to not bomb North Vietnam during the Johnson administration. The movement might have also played an unseen role on the attitudes of protestors and how policymakers reacted to those attitudes with the Kuwait War in the 90's. There was conflict over how the U.S. should handle aggression towards the people of Kuwait and during the Kuwait antiwar movement, many old slogans from the Vietnam War were resurrected such as “Make Love, Not War.”20 Between the antiwar and anti-draft movement, thousands of men who burned their draft cards and the public dissent of one famous Black man the closing of the Vietnam War was possibly brought closer. They might have also all been a part of an indirect influence for future generations that protest America's wars and inevitably teach the American government that it is far better to have the approval of their people than to win the war under opposition."],"display_date":1967,"search_date":"1967-07-02","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":1478,"tag":"Draft"},{"id":1554,"tag":"Vietnam War"},{"id":1555,"tag":"Anti Draft"},{"id":1556,"tag":"Anti War"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5601,"title":"The “Me” Generation: How Shirley Chisholm, Harvey Milk and the Weathermen Fought Against the 1970's Fantasy of Perfection","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The 1970's became fertile ground for public outrage and violence against the American establishment due to national economic stress, assassinations of public figures, the Vietnam War, and other political scandals. By the 70's it seemed to a significant amount of Americans, that what the government wanted to portray and what they were realistically taking care of were two very different truths. What the U.S. wanted American society to consist of were upper middle class or rich white individuals (preferably male) with conservative, Judeo-Christian beliefs. That these people would pray and worship a God that often times were one and the same as the American government. The ideology of the American mentality included not just a warped view of a uniquely American religious stance, but a stance where all Americans should be the same and think the alike. Where there was no poverty, no back talking or disagreeing with the government and everybody was heterosexual with one wife and their 2.5 children living in suburbia. And if in fact, “those” types of people did exist Americans should do everything in their power to either push them aside or make them disappear completely. The American government did not want or feel that they needed blacks with opinions let alone a black woman making her way through Congress. America only saw the “sin” in the power that the gay community and its leaders held in California. And when America was tired of minorities of all kinds, it was looking towards a vibrant, educated white youth to carry the torch, what they got instead were empowered white kids enraged by a government unwilling to pull out of Vietnam. While America was working hard towards a “Me” generation where the majority's problems did not matter and a fantasy of “what ifs” was put in its place, there were several, gutsy individuals and groups desperately trying to break that mold.","In 1972, Shirley Chisholm, the ultimate physical symbol fighting against the ideals of a “Me” generation, became the first African-American woman running as part of a major-party candidacy for the Democratic ticket and nomination of President of the United States. In the 1970's, America was overflowing with an ignorance towards racial divides although physical, up close and sometimes violent proof stated the opposite that things in fact were not alright. Her running came during a time where racial tension was high and what was considered an equal and fair opportunity for all held different feelings and definitions for both blacks and whites. The backdrop of her run was politically marked by examples of attempted equality like the Voting Rights Act which created an effort to integrate race relations in the South and outlaw voting discrimination against African-Americans and the Civil Rights Act which outlawed major discrimination against minorities. But what the United States wanted to project and achieve was not the social reality of what seemed to be a very bleak existence of blacks dealing with unemployment rates three times higher than whites and black anger increasing with the establishment of black militant organizations such as the Black Panther Party. Her very physical being, went against what made the American government and a dominating white society comfortable. She was a woman and she was black, to put both of those “concepts” together was a whole complex and intense conundrum for the American people to deal with. On the one hand she explains how entering into Congress for the first time, the white Congressmen had never had a black woman enter into their political platform and she was automatically shunned. On the other, even among black groups and the black community she was shun due to black men being intimidated and threatened by the fact that she was a woman. To bring that together and give her an intelligent mind and voice to state what was wrong with American society and give her a national platform on which to speak, broke the mold of a society with a “it's all about me” mentality to realize there was great unjust among blacks and sometimes equal discrimination against women. So what she needed black Americans to do, especially black women, in such a time of confusion and hardships was to go against the grain as she had done and use their power to fight not physically or violently but to use what many whites dreaded...their vote. She brought to the forefront what was not being said in Congress, that over 50% of the nation's budget (her estimate was 75%) was being used on a foreign, immoral war yet the true war raged on domestically with a nation divided amongst itself.","Unlike Shirley Chisholm, who was a more obvious example for minority groups that made white people uncomfortable, was the less obvious Harvey Milk. At first glance he is who the American government and society wanted to continue to uplift. He was a financially comfortable, white male, a veteran from the U.S. navy, running his own business in a middle class neighborhood. However his ideals and sexuality both directly and indirectly did not line up with what society was supposed to be like. Harvey Milk was a gay man which in and of itself went against the traditional Judeo-Christian idealism of America. To make matters worse, he was also the first openly gay politician in San Francisco which also went against what American society. What society wanted and expected was if a person was indeed gay, he or she should keep it themselves because to be gay in the 1970's was taboo and illegal. In the backdrop of the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York which set off the modern, openly gay liberation movement, Harvey Milk would become a main leader in San Francisco's newly gay political community. But America did not want to deal with gay people they in fact wanted to get rid of them with political bills such as Proposition 6, which was a state wide gesture that allowed the firing of any teacher in public schools who was gay and any other public school faculty that was pro-gay. Milk fought against such openly discriminative political documents but wanted to make it clear that while he fought for gays, lesbians and transgendered/transsexual peoples, his political fight was for all peoples who were considered minorities and were underrepresented in San Francisco. He said what so many Americans at the time were afraid to speak of which was the realization that gays walked among them and no, they did not have signs written on their foreheads to let others know of their whereabouts, so the American people needed to learn to have respect and tolerance for all no matter who they came across. Milk's perfect example of the political and religious agenda set against gay Americans came in an interview where he said that he understood who he was up against but that the “white, wealthy, non-gay establishment would have to deal with him; that is truly an incredible and powerful position to be in.” Harvey Milk and his political position would not allow an ignorant mentality to continue to place its hold over the minds of the American people but wanted instead to change what Americans felt so uncomfortable with concerning gays in the first place. Although he was assassinated in 1978 by another San Francisco city supervisor, Dan White, his ideals would leave a permanent mark in California, especially in the San Francisco area. This mark would go on to change the political ideals, when a decade after Milk's assassination, a poll would show that San Francisco's gay community felt that they had a “moderate amount” or “a lot” of influence over local government compared to only 48% of the straight respondents who believed the same sentiment. And only two years prior to that poll, a gay San Francisco columnist wrote, “Politicians can be destroyed by the gay vote. As long as we keep our vote, they're going to kiss our ass for a long time.”","Probably the most confusing to the American government and public was the formation of the Weather Underground also known as the Weathermen. They were a part of the anti-draft and anti-war movement of the late 60's to mid 70's with extremist views that believed in “bringing the war home” by bombing banks and government buildings. Their ultimate goal was to overtake and overthrow the U.S. government due to their refusal to pull out of the Vietnam War and their abuse towards blacks. What made them so confusing to the American public was because of what they stood for due to who they were. They were not black like Shirley Chisholm nor were they gay (for the most part, not including their sexual experimentation with the same sex during orgies) like Harvey Milk, trying to organize a type of LGBT rights organization. These were mainly upper middle class college students with rich parents (some of those parents were even local politicians) who basically had the world at their feet and if they wanted to live a comfortable lifestyle, they could very well do so. There only real issue was being drafted into the Vietnam War but even if that happened with the connections and the money there parents had they were more than likely to gain “cushy” jobs that did not require front line action. Unlike their poorer, black, Hispanic, and Asian counterparts who constituted more than 80% of American ground troops. So what was there problem? They had everything they wanted and they were everything that the U.S. wanted to portray their young people as. The U.S. did not want to deal with underprivileged, ethnic youths, but who they wanted ended up being the kind of people that constituted the Weathermen. As President Nixon continued to ignore the peoples cry that the conflict in Vietnam was immoral and unjust, the Weathermen, once a non-violent group who took after the teachings of peaceful demonstrations from Martin Luther King Jr. were now taking after the Black Panther Party, sharing in their anger and setting up recruitment just like them and even supporting them by endorsing them to the mass public. Their point was not to do the complete opposite of what was expected of these young white kids just for the sake of rebelling but because this white ideology was destroying the nation. They were going to side with the black community and they refused to allow their privileges as whites to add to the problem in America anymore. It was hard for Americans to understand the terrorist actions of other Americans bombing their own buildings but the message behind these attacks were not just for the sake of blowing up a building it was to get people in the U.S. to realize that this was not just a foreign war that did not effect them unless they were drafted, but that if they refused to stop the war then indeed it did effect them because they were part of the problem. And the problem was very much real no matter how much Americans wanted to ignore it with companies such as Dow Chemical, for example, using technological and chemical warfare like napalm, used to kill innocent and impoverished Vietnamese. Or the U.S. government breaking and entering into one of the leaders of the Black Panthers home, Fred Hampton, and assassinating him in his bed while he slept. These were kids who were angry with what their white government was doing both to its own people and internationally; kids who were willing to recruit white youth to join in, taking down what many would say as their “own” people (other whites). The Weathermen were trying to put the issue of what was going on in the faces of Americans first by peaceful marches and when the problem only escalated domestically and internationally, they felt they had no choice but to show them a tiny part of the violence occurring in Vietnam by turning to domestic terrorism. The acts they committed were only a physical embodiment of their ideals which as one of the faces of the Weathermen, Bernardine Dohrn stated, “I believe that there will come a day when white people will have to make uncomfortable decisions and learn to side with the Vietnamese and Black people.”","The United States in the 1970's has been argued to be a “Me” generation and while it did strive hard to get there and in many ways and areas of the country it was, there was a much stronger argument for all of the things that went wrong. As the nation continued on a one noted idea of what it wanted to be and portray to what they believed to be a corrupt world, the American people were becoming excessively bothered by a communism induced paranoia the country held. Since that was its main focus everything and everyone else fell by the wayside. What the people needed was stronger leadership and a sense of an empathetic community so that all might understand each other and gain an equal political foothold. So people with a voice, whether they had extreme views like the Weathermen or more subdued ways to fight like Shirley Chisholm and Harvey Milk rose to power not because they were trying to divide or disrupt the country as many thought (including the government) but to stop the advancement of a country that had let its people down and were allowing them to believe, on top of all the problems they had, that they were a perfect society at the center of a very inferior world."," "],"display_date":1970,"search_date":"1970-07-02","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":34924,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"}],"tags":[{"id":546,"tag":"Homosexuality"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":1556,"tag":"Anti War"},{"id":1554,"tag":"Vietnam War"},{"id":1557,"tag":"Terrorism"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5603,"title":"The 1970s Through Film","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/79","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The 1970’s were a tumultuous time in American history. Movements regarding the war in Vietnam, civil rights, and gay rights escalated as the United States entrenched itself in economic crises and political divisions. As these movements gained momentum, the political system as well as the prevailing social notions of the time attempted to quash any semblance of progressive thinking until the end of the decade. Three documentaries about the time - <em>The Weather Underground, Chisholm ’72,</em> and <em>The Times of Harvey Milk </em>- focus on the major political voices of the 1970s and how they were confronted, spurned, or ignored. By analyzing these three works, it can be deduced that the 70s were a period of social and political growth and examination in the youth and minority populations that the older generation of society was attempting to supplant with traditional Cold War values.","By 1970, the war in Vietnam had escalated and Nixon’s campaign of “Vietnamization” had begun. Under Nixon, the Vietnam War saw an increase in strategic bombings of supposed communist strongholds and the “incursion” into Cambodia with 25,000 U.S. and South Vietnamese troops. This increased activity in Indochina prompted a growth in the anti-war movement, which had already gained considerable momentum. Students for a Democratic Society - the major student body anti-war organization during the Vietnam War - was already at 300,000 members and growing. Privileged college students began to rebel over war crimes committed by the government under their pretext of protecting the world from communism.","The 2002 film <em>The Weather Underground</em> focused on the exploits of the Weathermen, a domestic insurgent agency formed in the summer of 1969. They were the militant arm of the SDS and sought to overthrow the United States government on account of the civilian casualties in Vietnam. With the slogan “Bring the War Home,” the thirty-odd Weathermen wanted to instill fear in the government that was controlled by, what they perceived, as old, corrupt politicians from an irrelevant, bygone generation. Nixon responded to this radical minority with reciprocal contempt. After the Greenwich Townhouse Explosion in May 1970, the Weathermen went underground and started a strategic bombing campaign, all the while being pursued by the FBI. After the war ended and many Weathermen came out of hiding, few went to prison on the account of the FBI’s illegal actions to track them down in the first place. Simultaneously, vice president Spiro Agnew denounced the anti-war protesters as “traitors, thieves and perverts.” It seemed the administration’s decision to marginalize the movement had adverse effects as the Weathermen’s coordinated bombings of government buildings skyrocketed until the end of the war in ’75. These practices, coupled with the release of the Pentagon Papers in ‘71, sewed seeds of distrust and frustration with how the government was conducting business not only in Vietnam, but also within the system itself. The prevailing Cold War policy of containment propagated in the 1950s and 1960s had permeated society as well as foreign policy. It was finally met with resistance in the 1970s to the dismay of Washington, and thus they made every attempt to stamp it out.","Like the Weathermen, the campaigning of Shirley Chisholm in the 1972 election was an indicator of a changing sociopolitical climate, but unlike the Weathermen, forces within the movement itself halted its momentum. The 2004 film <em>Chisholm ’72: Unbought & Unbossed</em> illustrated exactly how the Democratic Party was operating during the 1972 election and how massive and divided the party –and society - was against such a unified political platform as the Republicans’. Chisholm herself ran for the rights of women and African Americans but also for a withdrawal from Vietnam and the resolution of the busing integration controversy. However, her gender mixed with the color of her skin greatly hampered her support base as the male-dominated Black Panther party was reluctant to back her, as well as the feminist movement, which generally marginalized the voices of black women. By the time of the democratic nomination, all of Chisholm’s supporters in Congress like Ron Dellums ended up supporting George McGovern of South Dakota for the nomination. The 70s were showing signs of progressive, liberal attitudes, but were being hampered all the way by the established government. Nixon simply appealed to those sick of the costly New Deal social programs and won a landslide victory with 61 percent of the popular vote. It seems like all would be lost in terms of progressive ideals in the 1970s, but as the decade wore on and Nixon was impeached and resigned, people began to think that the established order could be openly challenged without severe repercussions.","Enter Harvey Milk: district 5 Supervisor of San Francisco in 1978. In the documentary <em>The Times of Harvey Milk</em>, Milk’s exploits and contributions to the San Francisco gay community are revealed, along with the events that precipitated his assassination, and the subsequent outrage over the verdict of his killer. Reflecting the desperation of fellow supervisor Dan White who murdered both Milk and San Francisco mayor George Moscone, the established sociopolitical system of the United States by 1978 was buckling under the increasing momentum of liberal views and progressive ideals. Milk was one of many activists who were fighting tooth and nail for moral, social, and political equality. One of the major planks of the Democratic Party in the 1976 election was advocating of equal rights groups. President Carter publicly endorsed gay rights, which would have been impossible even earlier that decade. However, Milk and other activists’ primary opponent during this transitional period were evangelical fundamentalists who were still clinging to the old Cold War system of control. Milk’s crowning moment as Supervisor was his opposing of California Proposition 6, or the Briggs Initiative, which would ban gays and lesbians from working in public schools. Milk was able to rally public support against the bill and even get open support from prominent politicians like Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. The main indicator for the closing of the decade, however, is Milk’s assassination itself. For a gay man to be put into a position of such power within the city of San Francisco, the people had to have been open to radical changes in infrastructure. Unfortunately, the last years of a dying system seem to be the most chaotic. In this case, Christian fundamentalism had a major resurgence, as people were fearful of the state of the established order. It was this resurgence that opposed Harvey Milk and went leniently on his killer Dan White, but the subsequent widespread outrage over the court verdict showed that they were becoming a shrinking minority.","Was the 70s characterized by repression and disengagement? Some would argue that it is, but the strength in the progressive organizations paved the way for an unprecedented amount of liberal thinking so far seen in the Cold War. The documentaries <em>The Weather Underground</em>, <em>Chisholm ’72</em>, and <em>The Times of Harvey Milk</em>, showed a decade in transition, a transition hampered heavily by a system of political and societal control refined over thirty years of Cold War conflict. If that system had not been so heavily entrenched in the minds of America’s older citizens at that time, the 70s would have been a period of growth instead of repression and turmoil"],"display_date":"1970 - 1979","search_date":"1974-12-31","locations":[{"id":34924,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"},{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":34445,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":1554,"tag":"Vietnam War"},{"id":1560,"tag":"The 1970s"},{"id":1561,"tag":"1972 Election"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5624,"title":"Prohibition and the Whiskey Rebellion","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"1/16/20","end_date":"1/16/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 13, 1927, the <em>New York Times</em> published an article entitled “Wet and Dry Talk Heard in 1791: Arguments Used in the Whisky Rebellion Crisis Are Like Today’s,” which sought to highlight similarities between the 1790s Whiskey Rebellion and the events of Prohibition in the 1920s. Much like the events of the Whiskey Rebellion, the period of Prohibition caused citizens to actively protest the new law, disregard the authority of enforcement officers, and become concerned about the legitimacy of the newly enacted law. Prohibition was enacted on January 16, 1920, following the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America [1]. Prohibition defined the manufacturing, sale, and transportation of alcohol to be illegal. This significant change in national law came about at the beginning of the “Roaring Twenties,” further complicating the Americans’ already challenging lives. The government’s efforts to ban manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcohol nationwide caused an enormous number of Americans to take part in the illegal smuggling and transport of the product.","The Whiskey Rebellion came about in 1791 following a proposal made to Congress by Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton, in which he requested that whiskey be taxed by the United States government [2]. This law was proposed to help pay down the national debt, which the government owed to bondholders, as well as to decrease excess consumption of alcohol by Americans [3]. Whiskey in the 1790s, much like alcohol in general in the 1920s, was used as a means for relaxing and celebrating overcoming the difficulties of life. The taxation of whiskey caused opponents to question the intentions of the U.S. government, and oppose enforcement of the tax. Americans had recently fought the American Revolution, in part due to taxes imposed by Great Britain, and were now questioning why it was required that the tax on whiskey be honored[4]. As with Prohibition, concern of the new amendment’s legality led to great disregard of the authority of Congress in regions such as western Pennsylvania, where much of the whiskey was produced.","Enforcement of the tax was comparable to that of the enforcement of Prohibition.  Enforcement officers were deployed to help ensure that the tax was being honored, and that Americans were not refusing to pay.  The <em>New York Times</em> article from 1927 argued that the task of both the collectors of 1791 and the enforcement agents of 1920 were “equally dangerous and unprofitable” [5]. Both enforcement services were vastly disregard by citizens, and in some cases mistreated.  Despite the official title as “law enforcement” officers, Prohibition agents and other public officials often took part in the movement and use of alcohol during the course of prohibition, while tax collectors during the Whiskey Rebellion were sometimes tarred and feathered [6].","Both laws encouraged large numbers of Americans to disregard and violate them [7]. Publications produced during the time of Prohibition claimed that the popular response to Prohibition in the 1920s was similar to some Americans behavior in the 1790s, that the congressmen had “consulted dusty files” to support their theory [8]. The impact that the Eighteenth Amendment had on the United States can be seen as extremely devastating. As with many laws, supporters were faced with violators and resistance groups. Establishments such as “speakeasies” were underground drinking locations where citizens and even some public officials during the Prohibition Era would congregate to relax and enjoy alcoholic beverages.  The underground drinking establishments were being supplied by multiple illegal transporting groups, causing alcohol to be illegally imported across the border from neighboring countries such as Canada [9]. Public officials were often in attendance, presenting a degree of corruption in the law’s enforcement.","The tax on whiskey was eventually in repealed after 1800, following years of resistance by the American people.  Prohibition, following a similar route, was ultimately ended through the result of the 1933 ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment, which both repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and placed alcohol laws in the hands of the states [10]."," ","[1] “Prohibition in the United States,” <em>1920-30.com </em>http://www.1920-30.com/prohibition/ (accessed 24 Oct. 2012)","[2] “Insurrection in Western Pennsylvania: The Whiskey Rebellion,” <em>Papers of the War Department</em> http://wardepartmentpapers.org/blog/?p=285 (accessed 24 Oct. 2012)","[3] <em>New York Times, </em>“Wet and Dry Talk Heard in 1791: Arguments Used in the “Whisky Rebellion Crisis Are Like Today’s,” 13 Feb. 1927, pg. 5","[4] “Insurrection in Western Pennsylvania: The Whiskey Rebellion”","[5] “Wet and Dry Talk Heard in 1791\"","[6] <em>Ibid</em>.","[7] <em>Ibid</em>.","[8] <em>Ibid</em>.","[9] “Prohibition in the United States”","[10] <em>Ibid</em>."],"display_date":"January 16, 1920","search_date":"1920-01-16","locations":[{"id":21755,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":1587,"tag":"Whiskey Rebellion"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":94,"school_id":43}},{"id":5625,"title":"The Wagner Act","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"7/5/35","end_date":"7/5/35","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Wagner Act had great impact on industrial relations as the first part of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The National Labor Relations Act was created out of the necessity and demand for new foundations of authority and new forms of participation in the political dimension and legalization of industrial life [1]. This statement supports the idea that people are the key to industry and they must be recognized and respected.  Industry must also have clear boundaries that control the behavior of employers and employees in an industrial environment. The National Labor Relations Act consists of three statues enacted by Congress at twelve year intervals: the Wagner Act of 1935 (officially titled the National Labor Relations Act), the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 (officially the Labor-Management Relations Act), and the Landrum-Griffin Act of 1959 (the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act). Since the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act were addendums to the Wagner Act it is correct to refer to the entire act as the \"National Labor Relations Act\" or the \"Labor Act.\" This analysis will focus on the Wagner Act [2].","Before the Wagner Act relations between workers and employers were combative and unsure. The \"Conspiracy Doctrine\" was created as a spurious attempt at making unions illegal by arguing that they created a hostile environment and harmed the rights of employers. Trade unions had more than 200,000 members at a time when hand crafted work was being replaced by better machines and unskilled laborers. Short lived organizations faded quickly like the Knights of Labor and National Union Labor. The American Federation of Labor had taken some critical steps in trying to create better relations but the brutality, strikes and many other tactics remained an ongoing issue.","The government began its process to change some of these issues by passing anti-trust laws such as the Sherman Anti-trust Act and the Clayton Act which contains the embodiment of the law of unlawful restraint and monopolies [3]. President Wilson created a tripartite War Labor Conference that had guiding principles of prohibiting strikes and lockouts and recognizing the rights of the workers to organize in trade unions and to bargain collectively. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took an even more innovative approach with the National Recovery Industrial Act which was designed to get people back to work during the Great Depression. Section 7 (a) was key  to the Wagner Act because it expressed the right of workers to join unions and collective bargain which relaxed the anti-trust laws.","The Wagner Act is organized into subsections entitled: Findings and Policy, National Labor Relations Board, Representatives and Elections, Rights of Employees, Prevention of Unfair Labor Practices and Investigative Powers. The subsection \"Finding and Policy\" clearly promotes commerce and the flow of commerce as in protecting commerce from any harm caused by poor labor relations or unfair labor practices. This section also identifies the need for quality bargaining and encourages the adjudication of friendly disputes. This section also defines terms such as commerce, labor organization, employee and so on [4].","The remaining subsections address the National Labor Relations Board and how it is set up including how many members, how long they serve on the board, salary, appointment and reappointment and hierarchy of the board. The sections and subsections also focus on things employers cannot do such as interfere, discriminating against, restraining, coercing employees or refuse to bargain collectively with employees.","Historian James McGregor Burns said,\" the Wagner Act was the most radical legislation passed during the New Deal, in the sense that it altered the nations politics by vesting massive economic power in organized labor\" [5]. The major polices of the Wagner Act are unfair labor practices, representation elections and related policies. The Wagner Act contains many broad passages but the heart of the message is for the rights of the employee.","The Slogan, \"Let Collective Bargaining Become an Instrument of industrial Peace,\" is a message that supports the idea that the Wagner Act is a revolutionary way of thinking that is not concerned with the legal status but the area of unfair labor practices. The functionality of the Wagner Act is to create conditions for bargaining and formalized agreement [6]. These labor relations have been as important to many in our history as emancipation was to the slave community because it addresses the exploitation of the worker. The labor legislation during the time of the New Deal was revolutionary and it opened doors for a better foundation for labor relations that became a turning point in industrial life as it set new standards for communication and expectations for industrial work. These expectations include (1) drastically limiting the power of the employer to oppose union membership by propaganda, intimidation or discrimination of union members; (2) established machinery for selection by employees of union leaders of their own choosing; (3) proclaimed collective bargaining the preferred road to industrial peace [7]."," ","[1] Philip Selznick<em>, </em><em>Law, Society, and Industrial Justice,</em> 1969, 137-140.","[2] Frank W.

Jefferson served two terms as President of the United States from 1801-1809. He will always be remembered as the principal author to the Declaration of Independence. On October 26, 1826, at the Columbian College in Washington D.C., Jefferson’s eulogy was delivered by a member of the senior class. John W. James writes, “He whom we mourn, was surpassing great; great in intellect; great in stores of knowledge; great in the highest offices a nation could bestow; great throughout his life.”  Jefferson’s political impact certainly resonated throughout the entire nation. He sparked the greatest expansion westward as he was responsible for the Louisiana Purchase. Jefferson, however, passed away on the day the country celebrated their independence.  James explained, “He whom, on the <em>Fourth of July, </em>no one could forget; who fondly hoped was then uniting in the rejoicings of his country, was indeed but hovering over the earth, ready to take his flight to an eternal rest.”","Jefferson, like many white male citizens, enjoyed the freedoms in the early periods of the nineteenth century. He did not live long enough to see his country torn apart by the issue of slavery. Unfortunately, as author James McPherson explains, “Jefferson’s empire for Liberty had become mostly an empire for slavery. Territorial acquisitions since the Revolution had added slave states of Louisiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, and Texas to the republic.” This became the great contradiction of the United States. A country engrained in democratic principles and equality did not preach and practice those principles. John O’Neal, member of <em>Junebug Productions, </em>examines, “The only social system that is more ubiquitous than racism is that which supports and gives definition to the system of male privilege that has come to be called ‘The Patriarchy.” Jefferson, a slave owner himself, contemplated his positioning on slavery. He opposed slavery yet owned slaves. Intentionally or unintentionally, Jefferson’s westward expansion and disposition towards slavery contributed to the racial atmosphere of the United States. As the founding fathers passed away, we remembered them as martyrs and often forgot the flaws of their character. Consequently, the same founding fathers that drafted the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution greatly contradicted the principles they had written in their attitudes towards slavery. Thomas Jefferson was no exception to this example and his impact, whether negative or positive, is forever lasting."],"display_date":"October 4, 1826","search_date":"1826-10-04","locations":[{"id":1272,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":506,"tag":"Thomas Jefferson"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":411,"tag":"Westward Expansion"},{"id":1585,"tag":"Louisiana Purchase"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5679,"title":"<strong>Top Dog at the White House</strong>","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"3/5/21","end_date":"3/5/21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though there were many presidential pets before him, Laddie Boy was the first celebrity White House pet.  Few people realize that Laddie Boy, President Warren G.

Presidential pets had to receive the same scrutiny as their distinguished masters.  Whether providing companionship or humanizing the President’s political image, Laddie Boy did his job well.   Laddie Boy was included in the everyday happenings in the White House during Harding’s 1921-1923 administration.","Laddie Boy came to the White House on March 5, 1921, the day after Harding took office, he was 7 months old.    He had been born on July 26, 1920 at Caswell Kennels in Toledo, Ohio.  President Harding told his staff to let him know when the dog arrived, so they did, even though there was a cabinet meeting going on.  President Harding was so happy to get Laddie Boy that he brought him right into the meeting.  After this, Laddie Boy went to most cabinet meetings where he had his very own hand-carved chair to sit on.  Laddie Boy was both photogenic and the perfect representation of Harding’s campaign slogan “Return to Normalcy.”  Harding loved dogs and he used Laddie Boy to demonstrate his connection to the average person.","Laddie Boy certainly knew how to steal the spotlight.  His popularity with reporters was so great they often quoted him in pretend interviews.  Laddie Boy accompanied Harding while he golfed, had his own birthday parties, greeted official delegates and once hosted the annual Easter egg roll.  Harding so loved Laddie Boy and the attention he received, that he commissioned one thousand bronze miniatures of Laddie Boy, which Harding gave to supporters. With all this attention, Laddie Boy was named the official presidential pet.  He was treated like a king and even had his own caregiver who gave the dog daily baths.","Laddie Boy was so beloved nationwide that the Newsboys’ Association asked every newspaper delivery boy in the country to donate one penny to a special fund to build a statue of Laddie Boy.  In all, nineteen thousand one hundred thirty-four pennies were collected and melted down.  Laddie Boy’s likeness, made from the copper in the pennies, still stands in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C."],"display_date":"March 5, 1921","search_date":"1921-03-05","locations":[{"id":21755,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5681,"title":"The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 and its Deinstitutionalizing Effect on Saint Elizabeth's Hospital","course_id":107,"status":"P","start_date":"10/31/63","end_date":"10/31/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Due to a growing need for mental health services, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was built by the United States Congress as a result of the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation Act of 1852. The Institution opened in Washington, DC in 1855 as the “Government Hospital for the Insane”. A prominent leader in the mental health field, Dorthea Dix, lobbied for the construction of the facility and founded the facility with the goal of providing the \"most humane care and enlightened curative treatment of the insane of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia.” Before this, many of the patients that could be considered “insane” were simply put in jail and were not receiving the care they needed. The name of the facility was later changed to Saint Elizabeth’s in 1916 because it temporarily provided medical care for wounded soldiers during the Civil War and those that were being treated were reluctant to tell people that they were being cared for at a mental institution. Instead they used the name of the colonial area the hospital was originally built on, Saint Elizabeth’s. Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was the first government-run mental institution in the country and was one of the largest mental institutions in the country. The hospital was a pioneer in mental health care at the time of its existence. At its prime in the 1940’s, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was home to over 7,000 patients.","Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital now operates with a small fraction of that number of patients, largely due to a certain historical event, the Community Mental Health Act of 1963. This Act, fully titled the “Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963,” promoted community-based health care and provided federal funding for such facilities. One of the main purposes of this act to was provide government assistance “in improving mental health through grants for construction of community mental health centers.” The government began to fund the construction of outpatient facilities in order to allow mental patients to live more normal lives. Prior to this, mental hospitals were what Erving Goffman would consider “total institutions,” meaning that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was a place in which all of the patients’ activities took place with a large group of others on a schedule, which shut the patients off from the rest of society. This act led to a considerable amount of deinstitutionalization all over the country. The total number of mentally ill patients that were institutionalized went from 650,000 in 1955 to less than 150,000 in 1983. The act, in conjunction with the quickly deteriorating living conditions at the hospital, meant that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was no exception.  With the passage of the Community Mental Health Act of 1963, more patients opted for outpatient care and the number of patients at the hospital steadily declined."],"display_date":"October 31, 1963","search_date":"1963-10-31","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":1655,"tag":"Space"},{"id":267,"tag":"Health"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Making the Modern Hospital","school":"Vanderbilt University","course_id":107,"school_id":60}},{"id":5682,"title":"St. Elizabeth's: From 'Asylum' to 'Hospital'","course_id":107,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/11","end_date":"12/31/16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1911, a committee comprised of six representatives appointed by the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Attorney General, the Commissioners of the District of The Board of Visitors of the Government, and the Secretary of the Interior were chosen to assess the needs of the Government Hospital for the Insane.  Within the report that was submitted to the Secretary of the Interior, there was an initiative to “eliminate the word ‘insane’” from the name of the institution—citing the reminder of the institution’s purpose as “extremely disagreeable.” Within five years, the official name change became a reality.","The committee failed, however, to specify to what name the hospital should be changed.  Through analysis of other accounts of the institution’s history, it can be determined that the origins of the name St. Elizabeths occurred during the Civil War, when Congress authorized use of the hospital for the care of the sick and wounded soldiers of the Union Army.  The wounded Union soldiers treated at the hospital during the war were reluctant to write to their families that they were being treated in the Government Hospital for the Insane and instead chose to refer to the hospital as St. Elizabeth’s, after the name of the land the hospital was built upon, in order to avoid the stigma of an insane asylum.","The soldiers in St. Elizabeth’s are an early example of reframing a place or word in order to circumvent cultural assumptions of mentally ill individuals and asylums.  Examples of this can be seen today in movements such as Spread the Word to End the Word, a movement to stop the use of the word “retarded” in everyday speech, in order to avoid stigmas that are associated with mentally disabled individuals and allow others to see them as functioning members of society.","As stated by Goffman, a byproduct of a total institution such as an asylum is the stigmatization of “inmates,” among other consequences such as loss of individual liberties. The Civil War soldiers being treated at the Government Hospital for the Insane for battle wounds were aware of the social stigmatization of asylums and were reluctant to admit to being treated there, regardless of the reason.  Although the understanding of mental illness was becoming more factual at that time, society’s perceptions of insane asylums were filled will incurable monsters—not just individuals with different needs than the rest of society, as people with disabilities are seen today.  The soldiers avoided using the hospital’s true name in order to keep their families from worrying that war had changed them from heroes fighting for the Union into people that needed to be isolated from society.","Though the reasoning behind the exact name change is unclear, by renaming the hospital St. Elizabeth’s—a neutral, assumption-free title—as opposed to the Government Hospital for the Insane, it helped to remove some of the stigma of an insane asylum.  By characterizing it as simply a hospital, Congress re-framed the place as one of healing and care for those affected mentally in the process of serving their country instead of as a total institution—framing not only the hospital itself, but mental illness in general, in a more positive light."," "],"display_date":"1911 -

The National Advisory Council on Indian Education created this report in 1976 in Washington, D.C. The president of the United States appointed this council in order to assist the 570 native groups affected by the regulations of the Indian educational system. The council comprised of Americans who observed and worked with the native groups. Observations of the council members “revealed that much remains to be done before adequate and equal educational opportunities can be achieved by the Indian people.” The annual report stated that for the Indian people, Indian Education “is a method of teaching that revives an appreciation for Indian heritage and generates a positive self-image so that one accepts and understands the environment and social conditions surrounding him.” This appreciation of Indian heritage and positive self-image was lost many years ago when the American government first intruded onto Indian territories. The council addressed this loss in the report to Congress by stating that the American Indians’ 200 years experience under an authoritarian paternal relationship with the Federal Government has “clearly demonstrated that paternalism is alien to liberty and freedom.”","The Third Annual Report to the Congress of the United States clearly showed how the government progressed and improved upon the Indian Educational System. Historian David Adams exposed that the government originally created the Indian Educational System to civilize the natives, because the natives were believed to be savages. The school system intended to provide the natives with an education that would habituate them to the customs and advantages of a civilized life. The government tried to manipulate the natives into becoming exactly like American citizens, regardless of their heritage, religion, traditions, or tribal affiliations. The government believed that since the native ways of life were different than the traditional American lifestyle, the natives must be less civilized than American citizens. The government most recently formed educational policies regarding Indian Education with goals to respect the wishes and the desires of natives so that the natives may design and manage their own educational programs according to the tribal level. The United States government has allowed the natives to incorporate their own values, beliefs, and culture into the natives’ educational system instead of strictly regulating every aspect of native life. In reality, there has never truly been an American Educational system prior to modern-day; the faux system was based on the standard methods and systems of the non-Indian society and a process by which the government has tried to teach the natives how to become like the white man."],"display_date":1976,"search_date":"1976-07-01","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5703,"title":"A Defensive Policy Unheeded","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/40","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Very infrequently do presidential policies go unnoticed around the world, and especially not so within the United States itself.  However, during the greater part of the Second World War, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s positions on racial issues in the workplace were heard and often times not upheld.  Black workers were barred from facilities producing wartime goods throughout the country.  Munitions, Jeeps, planes, tanks, and “Deuce and a Half,” tracked vehicles were being turned out left and right in the effort to equip the massive numbers of U.S. soldiers on the battlefield around the world.  Many in history have called these workers at home the “Second Front,” of World War Two, the people that made victory possible through mechanization.","In many instances black workers were barred from working in certain positions in industry, and in others, locked out of facilities altogether.  Roosevelt in his great forethought made it government policy to allow a man of any race, religion, or ethnicity to work wherever possible if they had the skill set required.  Even though Roosevelt set up these conditions, many large defense contractors turned a blind eye and proceeded as they had for years.  Dock workers were going on strike for fair wages and work conditions, black men were discharged from work and the result in many instances was the entire black workforce walking out during business hours.  Sadly, much of his buttressing on racial problems in the workplace did little in the way of governmental bodies.","Roosevelt saw the racial lockout and weakness of the unions to govern grossly upsetting, and went about contacting his staff to spread the practice of equality.  In a memorandum addressed to William S. Knudsen (Ford Motor Company, and GMC) and Sidney Hillman (head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America), Roosevelt expressed his opinion on the matter rather flatly.  “ [The] discrimination against Negro workers has been nation-wide…[they] are being turned from the gates of industry on specifications entirely unrelated to efficiency and productivity…this situation is a matter of grave national importance, and immediate steps must be taken to deal with it effectively.”  Roosevelt goes on to state that “Every available source of labor capable of production defense materials must be tapped in the present emergency.”  He saw the discrimination for what it is: an uneducated and backwards, racist sentiment left over from the previous century.  He urged unions and labor leaders like Knudsen and Hillman to take into account the huge numbers of skilled black workers to increase war-time productivity.","Of course, this did not guarantee success, nor did his Roosevelt’s words fall only on discerning ears.  Many times the policies of different workplaces caused racial tension and strikes throughout the country.  In Mobile, Alabama, one of the South’s biggest shipyards and transportation hubs, more than a few strikes crippled production.  For instance, the Mobile Pulley Works was halted in August of 1942 over racial discrimination.  Eighty percent of the workers of the Mobile Pulley Works were black laborers.  During August, several black workers were discharged from work for varying small incidents.  The main incident in question was that of the Financial Secretary of the local “colored” union was fired.  The unnamed Fin. Sec. was off work for three days following a death in his immediate family, and upon returning to work he was told that he must leave, and would not receive his job returned.  This ended up putting his family on the street within days of loosing said position.  The day he was fired, the story circulated throughout the Works and caused an uproar that ended up with all the black workers leaving work to strike at the gates.  In effect, the lack of workers caused much strife in the production of war materials.  The Mobile Pulley Works created pulleys, winches for Jeeps, gears for war machinery, but also produced a number of artillery pieces and artillery rounds themselves…so it is easily seen just how needed their business was during WW2.  In the end, the Work’s unions were able to settle with the business and put its men back to work for the war effort…of course, this strike would likely never had happened if Roosevelt’s policies were actually observed without question.","Many laws and policies have been challenged in the course of the United States’ existence.  From slavery, education, and work, all the way up to social issues and tearing down barriers with the outside world.  It is quite disconcerting to know that a man so responsible for this nation’s continued being was heard and not observed. Of course, such is the way of social, political, and racial advancement in the world today; we must take strides to make better the future for others."],"display_date":"1940 - 1945","search_date":"1942-12-31","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"},{"id":25291,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1684,"tag":"Unions"},{"id":1683,"tag":"Black Workers"},{"id":1682,"tag":"Roosevelt"},{"id":960,"tag":"Labor Unions"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":620,"tag":"Franklin D.

What many failed to realize was that the World Wide Web had been around for over twenty years, dating back to 1969. It was believed that when it first came to fruition that the early system was going to be used for informational purposes only. The initial targeted group of users was military workers. It was for them to be able to share information with each other through a series of computer databases. This would have helped them in regards to international information sparing with the other countries. Unfortunately, those who started to create this technology did not think of the long term effects of the product. They did take into account that there would be some complications.","There was a lot of pressure on the scientists responsible for creating such a breakthrough technology and having it work correctly. What many do not know is that they were met with immediate demands by the funders. The amount of responsibility the scientists had became a burden to them due to the amount of pressure that came with inventing a system where multiple users to have access at the same time. With such creations of the floppy disk and microprocessor being developed in 1971, it was critical that these scientist invented a new technology that would help change American society.  The world was changing around the time of this invention with  people were getting smarter and wanting more, and with the creation of the computer, people wanted more out of the technology. During the early years of the project the biggest problem was making sure that the all of the problems with the World Wide Web were fixed that were found early on.","By the end of 1979, the frame work was complete for the Internet, but they were unsure whether or not it should be accessible to the public due to some of the problems with the hard and software. By 1993, the problems with the system were fixed to a point where the funders wanted to make it access to people in a public domain. This was great news to the public ,who for years were ready to experience this system. The times were changing with new technology being invented and with new ways to talk to each other people were excited to hear that there was this invention called the “World Wide Web”. People wanted to be able to share their ideas with one another through a wireless server and this was the perfect material for it at the time. To be able to have a domain (a place where one could share their ideas on a topic or forum) made it that more important for people to have.","Looking back to where technology was twenty years ago and where technology is now really makes it obvious that the invention of the World Wide Web changed the landscape of American society. Twenty years ago, people would have to talk to each other via a telephone and through a computer or go to a library to do research. None of this would be possible if it was for CERN officially put The World Wide Web into public domain on April 30, 1993. The World Wide Web was the beginning of a new age of technology. Without the creation of the World Wide Web we as a society would not have the access we needed to be able to share some of the great ideas that people have had over the years."],"display_date":"April 30, 1993","search_date":"1993-04-30","locations":[{"id":41498,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":1747,"tag":"Wolrd Wide Web"},{"id":1746,"tag":"Washington, D.C."}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":108,"school_id":43}},{"id":5743,"title":"U.S Postal Service vs. Railway Managers","course_id":111,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-01-01","end_date":"1832-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" "," ","United States Post Office officials recognized the importance of railroad cars in 1832 and were extremely enthusiastic about this new way to transport mail. In 1864, the first postal car was constructed and operated in the United States and was first placed on the lines of the railroads connecting New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Once railway mail service had begun, the cars were equipped primarily to sort and distribute mail. At that time there was an increasing demand by the public for improved postal facilities.  The U.S postal service was increasingly becoming more demanding which meant that the post office’s so called \"Traveling Post offices\" were also becoming more rigorous, which hindered the travel of the public because of the high need for the railways. The importance of the traveling railway post office was stated in a testimony given before a U.S. Senate committee in April of 1873. The document stated that the government in the City of New York was forced to use three or four large warehouses to do the postal distribution instead of using the railways. The reasoning for the push to use warehouses rather than mail car service was because the USPS was not providing enough money to the railways to cover the costs of labor and it was making scheduling passenger cars difficult. However the U.S. Postal Service responded that the elimination of the railway transportation would end up turning the delivery of mail into a difficult project because no one would ever be able to deliver a sufficient amount mail and there would be a very high delay[BS1] . It then became evident that the postal car service was not only important, but the continuance of it would develop the railroad lines of communication between towns and businesses. Communication is a vital aspect in business interests of the country.","There was great controversy between the railroads and the U.S Post Office Department in respect to the performance of the postal car service. A letter was written to the lawyer of the railroad managers, Isaac Hinkley Esq., in regards to the Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, from David A. Wells, the postal service representative, gave a brief analysis of the controversy and nature of this particular issue. The letter explained that this was not a situation in which the public had taken much interest; in fact the case showed that the public did not care about how the mail was distributed unless it affected their mail deliveries  This case never got the attention of the public because there were no delays in mail service nor did delivery stop.","With the conclusion of the letter it was stated that the federal government was required by the constitution to make just compensation for private property of every description taken for public uses. Second they were making a statement that the postal car was not and will never be a freight car and the services performed by the workers were completely different and they were intended to be for two totally separate things. Third was that a postal car and the service that was required of it is as near as possible an express car. Forth, the compensation that was paid by the post office department was entirely inadequate. The people who were working for the postal service did not think that they were treated fairly nor did they feel that moving mail to a warehouse and having it distributed by a mail carrier was going to be sufficient.","The rebuttal to the letter came shortly after and was written by the railway managers. They were completely appalled that the postal service had absolutely no idea how much it actually costs to maintain additional non passenger cars along with maintenance on roads and railways that were owned by private companies. With all of the hard work that the railroad workers put in to maintain these things they also were not being compensated for the job that they were doing either. They felt that the government was not supporting the railway nor were they receiving funds for the day to day upkeep.","The railroad industry was meant to stimulate the economy and it did in fact have some success and it also created new links within the country. Just like the mail cars that were used it was also used to carry manufactured goods, raw materials and farming goods. They also helped other industries thrive so it goes without saying that over the past 200 years the railroad has created change equivalent to that over the past several millennia.  In April of 1971, the railway started to stop the delivery of mail on some railways and by 2004 all delivery has ceased completely. Just like other technologies related to communication, the railroad industry played a huge role in developing modern civilization by improving the speed at which information traveled across the nation."," "],"display_date":1832,"search_date":"1832-07-01","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1751,"tag":"Post Office"},{"id":1752,"tag":"Railway"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":111,"school_id":43}},{"id":5772,"title":"Senator Corwin Speaks Out Against the Wilmot Proviso","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-08-25","end_date":"1848-08-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 8, 1846, David Wilmot proposed an amendment on the floor of the Senate to ban slavery in all territories acquired from Mexico following the Mexican-American War. His proposal had a long and controversial life. During an attempt to pass the bill in 1848, Senator Thomas Corwin, a Whig from Ohio, stood up before the Senate and gave his arguments against the piece of legislation. Senator Corwin opposed slavery. At one point, he stated that if there were a country so hot “the white man is supposed not to be able to work, I would not allow you to take slaves there.” Yet he still strongly opposed the Wilmot Proviso. He argued that the amendment was unnecessary, because slavery already existed in some form in the new territories. The senator referred to land expansions in his argument, saying, “if at any time…you have acquired territory where Slavery existed in such form and consistency…it has been permitted to remain where by law it did exist.” Despite being staunchly antislavery, he paradoxically fought against this bill. Senator Corwin had another motive behind his protest of the bill. He saw that the Proviso was just causing another Sectional Crisis and dividing Congress. Corwin opposed it because he, like many at the time, feared that it would lead to southern secession. His speech was an attempt to prevent this eventuality from happening.","The Wilmot Proviso quickly became controversial in Congress, and in some cases, it was for reasons other than slavery. Historian James McPherson writes that there were some southerners who opposed it because they saw “the northern effort to exclude it [slavery] as an insult to southern honor.” The Wilmot Proviso, as this amendment came to be called, passed in the House on two separate occasions, and both times the Senate voted it down. The country was already divided by a series of Sectional Crises, and the introduction of the Wilmot Proviso only exacerbated the problem. Historian Eric Foner called it “the beginning of a path which led almost inevitably to sectional controversy and civil war.” Corwin claimed that there was no way the proviso could possibly lead to that eventuality, but his actions say otherwise. In March of 1861, he proposed an amendment known as the “Corwin Amendment” that would have made it illegal for Congress to amend the Constitution to restrict slavery. The Corwin Amendment was the senator’s attempt to placate the South and prevent them from seceding. He saw how polarizing the Wilmot Proviso was. Corwin opposed it not because he supported slavery, but because he wanted to keep the United States a whole nation. He debated in vain, and the Proviso continued to divide the North and the South."],"display_date":"August 25, 1848","search_date":"1848-08-25","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1801,"tag":"Wilmot Proviso"},{"id":1802,"tag":"Mexican War"},{"id":1803,"tag":"Sectional Crisis"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5800,"title":"<strong><em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> Advertises for Fugitive Slaves</strong>","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-04-20","end_date":"1816-04-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 20, 1816, the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em>, located in Washington D.C., published an article advertising fugitive slaves.  The article began by stating, “Fifty persons of color were brought into this city, in the ship <em>Lord Somers, </em>from London.”  The <em>Intelligencer</em> continued, “On examination, satisfactory evidence was produced, that forty-three were free, two the property of citizens of this city; and the description of the remaining five is now published­­- they are supposed to be fugitive slaves.”  The article provided detailed descriptions of the slaves and owners were expected to come forward with proof to claim their property.  For example, one description stated, “John Williams, says he was born in Savannah, state of Georgia.”  The description then continues, “ he was the property of Mr. Robert Boush in 1806; about 43 years of age; 5 feet 4 inches high.”  Slaves had high hopes of escaping from their owners’ barracks, but being able to successfully get away was usually impossible.","With the increasing numbers of slaves attempting to escape plantations on which they were held captive, southern states created fugitive slave laws.  According to historian William R. Leslie, the subject of fugitive slaves became a popular topic of discussion after the Pennsylvania Supreme Courts ruling in the <em>Commonwealth v. Holloway case </em>in 1816.  This case involved a fugitive slave giving birth to a child on Pennsylvania soil and the court ruling that the child was not subject to slavery.  This had many southerners irate and protests took place.   Later, the Pennsylvania Fugitive Slave Act of 1826 protected freed slaves and prevented the kidnapping of any black individual.","The federal government developed a fugitive slave act to help return escaped slaves to their owners.  Under this law, if a slave were to escape, the person whom was hired by the slave owner had the right to capture the fugitive and take him or her before any United States Judge or magistrate.  The Fugitive Slave Law of 1793 stated, “any person obstructing in any way such seizure or removal, or harboring or concealing any fugitive after notice, is liable to a penalty of $500.”  Northern states did not obey this law and developed their own laws to protect any person within their borders from being taken back to slavery.  The large number of loopholes in this law eventually resulted in a more stringent fugitive slave act.  According to historian James McPherson, the creation of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 gave the national government superior power over any other law during that time."],"display_date":"April 20, 1816","search_date":"1816-04-20","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1850,"tag":"Slave Laws"},{"id":1849,"tag":"Advertisement"},{"id":126,"tag":"fugitive slave"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5803,"title":"<strong>Congressman W.S.

Groesbeck of Ohio took the floor to argue in support of the recent capture of filibusterer, General William Walker. The speech served as a rebuttal to objections raised by Representative Keitt of South Carolina and Representative Stephens of Georgia.","Representatives Keitt and Stephens argued that the seizure of Walker and his company from Nicaragua was illegal. For these two Congressmen, the United States had violated jurisdiction zones established by the “law of 1818” during Walker’s seizure. In defense of the US forces that captured Walker, Representative Groesbeck focused his speech on the theme that “the sea is no sanctuary for crime.” He stated that since Walker and his company were American citizens, “the duty of this Government [was] to keep the peace with all other nations; and to break up combinations of its own citizens who have actually started upon expeditions to violate the peace of other nations.” This being said, Representative Groesbeck saw nothing wrong with the actions the US government took to apprehend Walker and his company: “He [the commander of the US Navy] had the right to cross the line of the marine league from our shore; he had the right to pursue this expedition, which was being <em>carried on</em> across the Gulf; and he had the right, with the consent of Nicaragua, to enter within her jurisdiction.” Simply put, General Walker and his company were rightfully and legally seized and detained by the US government.","William Walker was a man of many skills. Despite his medical education and experience in journalism, he is best remembered as a filibusterer. Walker’s first filibuster occurred in 1853 in Sonora, Mexico. The success of this filibuster prompted Walker to pursue Nicaragua a few years later.","The US Department of State acknowledges that filibustering-the militaristic actions of private citizens in a foreign land-was common in the years between the Mexican War and Civil War. Like Walker, most filibusterers were southern men hoping that the acquisition of new territory in Central America would ensure the expansion and survival of slavery. For this reason, as historian James McPherson wrote, “While much of the northern press condemned Walker as a pirate, southern newspapers praised him as engaged in a ‘noble cause.’” These conflicting perceptions of Walker’s actions created fierce tension in Washington.","When Walker and his company returned to Nicaragua in 1857, the US reacted. Historian Amy Greenberg wrote on this matter, “In May 1857 Walker surrendered to the commander of the United States navy after falling to the combined pressure of a Central American army, Great Britain, and threatened American shipping interest.” As evident in Rep. Groesbeck’s speech, there was a lot of controversy concerning Walker’s seizure. This contention between southerners and northerners in regards to the US actions was, in the end, pointless. In May 1858, a jury in New Orleans acquitted Walker of all charges for violating federal law."],"display_date":"January 11, 1858","search_date":"1858-01-11","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":1854,"tag":"Filibuster"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5829,"title":"<strong>Critiquing the Use of Tetraethyl Lead in Gasoline</strong>","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/24","end_date":"12/31/25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","In Washington D.C. in 1925, the day of the official conference decision regarding the use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline, Alice Hamilton, a leader in the field of toxicology and occupational diseases, issued an article discussing her rejection of the previous 1924 Bureau of Mines Report. The 1924 Bureau of Mines Report stated that tetraethyl lead was safe for gasoline. Hamilton argued that the report, which tested tetraethyl gasoline on animals, was incorrectly analyzed and poorly conditioned to determine the correlating safety for humans. She further refuted the report by offering four unanswered questions regarding tetraethyl lead gasoline and its interactions with humans. She called into question the potential damage of manufacturing ethyl fluid to factory employees. Within the last seventeen months seventeen men had died and one became insane as a result of manufacturing this compound. Next, Hamilton addresses potential damage to gas station workers and service employees who combine the ethyl-fluid with the gasoline and pump it into automobiles. Lastly, she questions the danger regarding the emission of ethyl gasoline to the public airspace by way of car exhaust. While Hamilton acknowledged some previous scientific research into the matter, she still argued that the results were insufficient as they did not focus on the correct areas of research and the potentially for environmentally damaging side-effects to affect humans. Hamilton concluded her article by urging the conference to discontinue use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline until further research could determine the safety of its unknown effects.","During her medical studies at the University of Michigan, Hamilton utilized her academic discipline of medical science towards social reform by looking at environmentalism through a health perspective. After she was appointed to the Illinois Commission on Occupational Diseases, Hamilton began delving into investigations on lead industries. Since lead and the chemical compounds associated with it are extremely dangerous and in high demand during the rapidly expanding automobile industry of the early 1900’s, Hamilton’s work is invaluable to help to situate ourselves in understanding lead’s environmental impacts. Furthermore, Hamilton was a powerful environmental advocate in an era when the term “environmental” had yet to be established as an ideology.

She created a precedent not only by representing her state in the Senate, but by being the first woman to deliver a speech on the Congress floor. “Miss Dixie”, as she was affectionately called, spoke against an anti-lynching bill. Southern women often talked about lynching, because they considered it a necessary prosecution to avoid rape; so it was not surprising that Senator Graves talked passionately about the subject. Lynching was a well-discussed subject during the New Deal Era of the 1930s, because the Great Depression and its repercussions had caused a new wave of lynching throughout the South. Congress had introduced various anti-lynching bills before and during the Progressive Era, but none could pass through the filibuster initiated by Southern Congressmen. By the 1930s, most mob violence and lynchings were directed against African Americans in the South; however, Senator Graves’s speech did not mention this. Instead, she argued that the frequency of lynching was declining and Southern states had the right to deal with it in their own way. She insisted that the lynching problem did not need governmental intervention and federal legislation, and states were “stamping out this disease”.","The speech became the subject of differing viewpoints and countless newspaper articles throughout the country. One such article from <em>The Birmingham News</em> praises Senator Graves and points out that “even Vice President Garner listened when [she] had her say about lynching”. The article even mentions that after the female senator was done with her speech, Republicans and Democrats from both sides of the isle stood up to shake her hand. Whether these events were true or not, many Southern newspapers like the <em>Tuscaloosa News</em> and the M<em>ontgomery Advisor</em> delivered similar articles acknowledging and praising Senator Graves. Northern newspapers, however, were not as kind. The newly appointed senator’s speech contained a number of erroneous facts, and to Northerners, she seemed to be defending the practice of lynching. Some Northern articles drew attention to her gender as a way of discrediting Miss Dixie Graves. One paper mocked her husband, Governor Graves, by saying that Mrs. Graves “can’t be a very good cook. Otherwise her husband, Bibb, would never have appointed her to the Senate”.","Dixie Graves followed in the footsteps of other women in Alabama and the South who were gaining more public roles since 1900. Historian Mary Martha Thomas writes, “although they were excluded from positions of political power, women compensated by activity in their various organizations”. Following the Progressive Era, women began moving from domestic life into public life; they established temperance societies, women’s suffrage clubs, and other organizations that were meant to bring attention to social issues. Through these organizations, women put pressure on the government to eliminate child labor, attack illiteracy, improve the school system, provide welfare for the sick and elderly, and allow women to vote. Although Miss Dixie’s speech to Congress represented women’s newly acquired confidence in public life, it was neither forward-looking in its subject matter, nor did it demonstrate any progress in the South's approval of racial equality."],"display_date":"August 20, 1937","search_date":"1937-08-20","locations":[{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2264,"tag":"senator graves"},{"id":2263,"tag":"governor Graves"},{"id":2262,"tag":"female senator"},{"id":2261,"tag":"women in politics"},{"id":1972,"tag":"1930s"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6112,"title":"An Underestimated Victory for Native Americans","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"7/8/70","end_date":"7/8/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","On July 8, 1970, President Nixon addresses the United States Congress regarding Native American rights in response to the ongoing efforts of the American Indian Movement.

The Native American occupancy of Alcatraz Island started in the fall of 1969 and was still demanding attention from the United States government at the time of Nixon’s letter. In a bold statement, Native Americans (who came from dozens of tribes from the United States and around the globe) from American Indian Movement decided to take over Alcatraz Island and reclaim it as Indian territory.

This takeover helped the AIM to gain momentum, but Paul Chaat Smith and Robert Allen Warrior, authors of the book “Like a Hurricane” argue that the American Indian Movement was successful due in large part the theatrical show that they believed members of the movement performed. They believed that leaders in the Alcatraz takeover like Richard Oakes, a college student of Native American descent from California, were taking on the Native American cause more for personal attention than to preserve their dying Native American culture.  Smith and Warrior also argued that the many leaders of the American Indian Movement were “too urban” and disconnected from true Native American culture since the movement started in the urban city of Minneapolis, Minnesota instead of a more rural setting where Native Americans still practiced their traditions and beliefs.. Whatever the motives of the various members of the movement, the takeover at Alcatraz lead to an awakening that swept the nation and brought Native American issues and injustices to light. The media became very interested and started running stories across the nation about the happenings on Alcatraz Island. The Native American occupancy of Alcatraz was important because it put an end to the silencing of Native American voices at the hands of other Americans.","President Nixon finally took notice of the AIM outcries for change by becoming one of the first modern American presidents to actually acknowledge that Native Americans had been unjustly treated by whites. Nixon boldly stated to Congress on July 8, 1970, “The first Americans--the Indians-are the most deprived and most isolated minority group in our nation. On virtually every scale of measurement--employment, income, education, health--the condition of the Indian people ranks at the bottom. This condition is the heritage of centuries of injustice. From the time of their first contact with European settlers, the American Indians have been oppressed and brutalized, deprived of their ancestral lands and denied the opportunity to control their own destiny. Even the Federal programs which are intended to meet their needs have frequently proven to be ineffective and demeaning.”","The president’s recognition of the Native American peoples was a huge sign that their efforts were finally paying off after centuries of trying to defend their people, their land, and their beliefs. Their efforts had gained the attention of the American president and Native Americans were hopeful that things would soon change for their people. In his Congressional address, Nixon proclaimed that Native Americans were have more freedoms and would be given better governmental assistance. Although Nixon made these presentations to Congress, Native Americans continue to fight for all that was taken from them so many years ago. America owes the American Indian so much and will be forever indebted to these native peoples."],"display_date":"July 8, 1970","search_date":"1970-07-08","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":537,"tag":"Native Americans"},{"id":2281,"tag":"President Nixon"},{"id":2282,"tag":"American Indian Movement"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6117,"title":"“Prohibition – A March to Stop Intoxication”","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"12/10/13","end_date":"12/11/13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In Washington, D.C. on the day of December 10, 1913 one of the largest prohibition demonstration took place within the city. There were 1,000 women from the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and 1,000 men from the Anti-Saloon League that marched silently to the capital.  The article states that the ranks were swelled by hundreds of people who joined the march singing “Onward, Christian Soldiers,” and “America” as they were marching. The marchers were met by Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas and Alabama Representative Richmond P. Hobson at the steps of the capital. The group of marchers then proceeded to present multiple petitions that would allow a constitutional amendment to be made so the making and selling of intoxicants in the United States would be prohibited.","After the presentations of the petitions speeches were made by the leaders of the two factions. Both factions seemed to receive warm responses from the two politicians meaning they had obtained their support. Later in the same day Senator Sheppard introduced the proposed constitutional amendment in the Senate. The article says, “the galleries were only half full, but his address in support of the amendment was punctuated with outbursts of applause which Vice President Marshall made no effort to stop.”  The Senator went on to conclude his proposal with these words, “Prohibition will embrace the whole United States within a comparatively short time. The movement is so strong throughout the nation that nothing in the world can prevent its ultimate complete success.” The article ends with saying that Senator Thompson and Owen joined the indorsement of the amendment proposal.","This newspaper article from the <em>New York Times</em> shows precisely what historians have suggested when they speak on how women supported the idea prohibition and this is a firsthand account of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union in action. The article also shows how organizations sought after the support of politicians in order to get the prohibition act into effect. This article fits perfectly with the beliefs of historian Peter Sasso and supports a number of his theses, but the main one being Sasso’s belief that the League was looking for political support. On page forty-seven of his journal Sasso talks about how one of the League leaders, Wayne Wheeler, believed that prohibition could only be accomplished through political advocacy. Gaining political support is one of the ways the League wanted to get prohibition into effect and it is clearly visible in the newspaper article.  Sasso also says how Wheeler sought to control the balance of power in key Congressional districts. This newspaper article shows perfectly how the League took steps to ensure political support to their idea.

The first question brought to the House by Mr. Quincy of Massachusetts, was to have the forthcoming meetings on stating the reasons and causes of having a war against Britain be held with “open doors.” The second motion brought to the House was from Mr. Randolph of Virginia, and asked ws whether or not the reading of messages from the President be held with “open doors.” The third and last question before the House was whether or not to reject the bill that would declare war with Britain. Each of these three questions were determined in the negative, and it became evident that the majority of Representatives felt it was necessary for such matters to remain secret for the time being, to remove the possibility of outside influence. Laban Wheaton from Massachusetts, one of the last Federalists to hold a position in Washington, sided the minority on these issues. Wheaton was skeptical about embarking on a war with Britain without carefully laying out the consequences. But was secrecy the real issue at hand?","The impending war with Britain brought various questions to the table. Arguably the most important was whether or not the United States should remain neutral in foreign affairs. The increasing naval surveillance by the British, as well as the non–compliance of the French and British regarding economic relations, represented reasons why the United States should intervene. John C. Calhoun drafted a bill that laid out how the United States should proceed with the war. Many Congressmen felt it was essential for the United States to intervene in order to establish its permanent place in the world as a powerful, revolutionary and prominent nation. However, some felt that if the United States were to engage in battle, it would go against what their predecessors had tried to establish – to remain neutral in foreign affairs. Laban Wheaton and many other Federalists felt the nation was still extremely unfit for such interaction and should proceed with extreme caution.","Throughout all of this debate, the concerns of political parties play an important role. Both sides--the Federalists and Republicans--were concerned with losing control of certain states depending on how the country acted on the war. For example, the Republicans were very concerned with losing the state of Massachusetts, so it was vital that they speak out against going to war. It became clear that the real problem the House was facing was not whether or not to hold the proceedings in secret, but how each party was going to keep their support in their respective states. It seemed that the House was more concerned with keeping the constituents happy, rather than keeping them informed, and more importantly, keeping them safe."," "," "],"display_date":"June 3, 1812","search_date":"1812-06-03","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":2395,"tag":"U.S. Government"},{"id":154,"tag":"War of 1812"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}},{"id":6204,"title":"Postal Road: Connecting a Young Nation","course_id":138,"status":"P","start_date":"1812-03-04","end_date":"1812-03-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1812 America was on the brink of war. The House of Representatives would congregate and hear various petitions and claims daily, but none more curious than those of March 4, 1812. Several petitions were submitted and claims were made in the hopes of installing new postal routes in different parts of the country. Requests for grants of land for certain individuals were also topics of discussion. Proposed postal routes would run through the Medford, Andover, Essex, and Londonderry turnpike roads. There were also other petitions being made to establish a new postal road in Randolph County Virginia and the authority to alter preexisting postal routes. Mr. Dawson proposed a route that would extend from Beverly to Staunton that would help benefit the community. Mr. Ornsby presented a claim by Daniel Boone that ten thousand acres lying in the Louisiana Territory be granted to him. All of these petitions were heard and approved by the House of Representatives on March 4, 1812. Some decisions were more unanimous than others. Judge Laban Morey Wheaton, who served in Congress from 1809-1817 didn’t vote in favor of the postal road claims. His lack of support for new postal roads in Massachusetts seems to be precarious, but upon further analysis the roads wouldn’t connect to the Norton area of Massachusetts where he resided, which may provide reasoning for his voting pattern. It’s also interesting to see that the House was able to function and conduct their normal business of governing, with particular attention to the extension of postal routes and establishing the communication infrastructure of the new nation on the eve of war. One would expect the discussions in The House of Representatives to revolve around the impending war with England that would later be declared in June of 1812.","The Gales and Seaton, “House Journal” dated on March 4, 1812 provides context as to what type of petitions were being submitted to the House of Representatives during that time period of the early nineteenth century. This particular day saw petitions involving the permission to establish land grants and postal routes.  Richard Bules book, “America on the Brink” offers insight as to why the establishing of postal routes was so important during this time period.  In the introduction of the book he touches on various elements of American life during the early 1800’s. In particular he talks about the influence of the urban newspaper. The newspaper was important for various reasons. One of those reasons being that it provides a link between rural and urban America in regards to news. That link later on proves to be crucial in helping stabilize the country during turbulent times. Another reason is that postal roads also help further intertwine parts of the rapidly growing country that were previously not connected. The connection of the various parts of the new country is vital in helping the growth and development process of a new country. As Blue reiterates throughout the book, the early part of nineteenth century America lacked stability and the establishment of postal roads help unite urban and rural areas, which otherwise would have been disconnected. Blues book help puts into context the flurry of petitions that were being submitted for the instillation of postal roads, which is highlighted in the Gales and Seaton, “House Journal.”"],"display_date":"March 4, 1812","search_date":"1812-03-04","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2420,"tag":"Postal Roads"},{"id":154,"tag":"War of 1812"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}},{"id":6205,"title":"Congress Votes to Reduce Military and Naval Establishments","course_id":138,"status":"P","start_date":"1810-04-17","end_date":"1810-04-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Things were tense when Congress convened on April 17, 1810. Foreign relations with Britain were strained, and the intransigent Federalist Party was making passing Republican legislation very difficult. On that day the Federalists succeeded in yet again undermining Republican authority in Congress by voting on whether or not to reduce Military and Naval establishments in a time when overseas affairs with the British were unsettled.","The first party system was comprised of the Federalist and the Republicans. The Federalists were those who wanted to trade with Britain at the expense of the French and wanted to commercialize the economy. The Republicans were interested in trading with France instead of Britain and were more compelled to act in a way that benefited the economic well being of their regions. These two parties' continual opposition of each other was eventually one of the reasons the Republicans declared war against Britain in 1812.  In the previous years the Federalist gentry had continually tried to subvert the federal government and had repeatedly attempted to sabotage Republican legislation in Congress. One example was the forced repeal of the embargo of 1807-1809, through which the United States had attempted to force European nations to recognize American’s neutrality by denying access to American commerce. Following the appeal of the embargo, the United States House of Representatives had passed a Non-Intercourse Act against Britain that took effect on May 20, 1809. This meant that the United States would not trade with Britain because the relationship between the two nations was rapidly deteriorating.","War seemed imminent as friction between Britain and the United States progressed, and the Federalists did nothing to relieve some of the pressure the federal government was feeling. One important measure against the Republicans was the passing of a bill on April 17, 1810. On that day the House was to vote on an unanswered question from April 16<sup>th</sup> regarding a resolution to reduce Military and Naval establishments. Mr. Quincy motioned that an amendment be made that the reduction happen only by repealing laws to disband Brigadier Generals, staff, and officers; the motion failed. Mr. Rhea then motioned that committees appointed by the President look at the resolutions. This motion also failed.","The House then voted on whether or not to reduce the size of the Military. The resolution passed by a vote of eighty-one to thirty-one. The question then turned to the reduction of the Navy. Mr. Hale motioned to insert after the word reduced “by selling such gunboats or crafts attached to it as may, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Navy, be unnecessary or incompetent to the service.”  This motion passed. The question of the reduction of the Navy also passed by a vote of sixty-five to forty-six. Following the votes on the question as two separate entities, the House then voted on the question regarding whether both the Military and Navy should be reduced. The resolution passed sixty to thirty-one.","Federalists like Laban Wheaton voted in the affirmative on this resolution for reducing the Army and the Navy. The resolution's success meant that Congress would vote on a bill to this effect. And these votes offer an example of the ways that Federalists in Congress subverted Republicans' attempts to show a strong military and naval presence in the face of a grow British threat. Historian Richard Buel has argued that Federalists sabotaged Republican legislation like the Embargo of 1807-1809 and the Non-Intercourse Act and that the sabotage of these acts heightened tensions with Britain and eventually pushed the Republicans to declare war in 1812."],"display_date":"April 17, 1810","search_date":"1810-04-17","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2395,"tag":"U.S. Government"},{"id":573,"tag":"Government Laws"},{"id":154,"tag":"War of 1812"},{"id":370,"tag":"Federalist"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}},{"id":6206,"title":"18 Days in June","course_id":138,"status":"P","start_date":"1812-06-01","end_date":"1812-06-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["President Madison was concerned in June 1812, and he asked for the help of Congress. Thirty-six years after declaring independence from Great Britain, the United States found itself on the brink of war again, and Congress debated how to handle the seizing of American vessels by the British navy.","On June 1<sup>st</sup>, the House of Representatives took up a request by President Madison to consider in a secret setting the confidential matter of British vessels on the open ocean. He accused the British Navy of violating the “peace of the ocean” and the rights of Americans. Then on June 2<sup>nd</sup>, the House was cleared of strangers and the June 1<sup>st</sup> letter from President Madison was read to the members.","On Thursday, June 4, 1812, the House of Representatives discussed a bill that would propel the United States into war with Great Britain. By a vote of seventy-nine to forty nine, the representatives voted to “declare war between Great Britain and her dependencies and the United States and her territories.” Representative Laban Wheaton of Massachusetts voted against declaring war. Wheaton, a Federalist, whose party favored Great Britain over France in world affairs, voted with most New Englanders and his party in this nay vote. On June 17<sup>th</sup>, The Senate narrowly passed the bill and on June 18<sup>th</sup>, Madison declared war on the British.","Historian Richard Buel has evaluated debate and preparations in Congress before the War of 1812. Buel noted that the Federalists, led by Virginian John Randolph, were partial to the British. They believed that the United States should be patient and wait for British concessions. “Go to war without money, without men, without a navy, would be treason,” said Randolph. But Republicans did not believe that the British concessions would be meaningful or lasting, and Republican president James Madison's letter to the House of Representatives led to the June 4<sup>th</sup> to declare war. A week later, the Senate voted to declare war, and President Madison then declared war on Britain. Ready or not, the United States would be taking on the most powerful sea power in the world. Not until the final declaration of war on June 18th did the American people know about these secret debates that took place in early June. These decisions would lead to Madison's evacuating the White House two years later."," "],"display_date":"June 1, 1812 - June 18, 1812","search_date":"1812-06-09","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":154,"tag":"War of 1812"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}},{"id":6207,"title":"Prelude to War: American Government After the Embargo","course_id":138,"status":"P","start_date":"1809-03-24","end_date":"1809-03-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gurdon S.

While this may have been the most significant event for Mumford, Laban Wheaton--a seasoned representative and Federalist from Massachusetts--knew there were matters of state to be addressed on that day. Two petitions were redirected to the Committee of Commerce and Manufacturers, and Wheaton listened as members of the House propose amendments to their actions on previous days. Virginia Federalist John Randolf then moved “to immediately disband” military units that had been authorized on April 12 in a bill entitled “An Act to Raise, for a Limited Time, an Additional Military Force”. Randolph also moved that \"the funds be redirected towards the pre-existing military in order to [arm] and [equip] the whole body of the militia of the United States.” Randolf also sought to appoint a committee to look into whether or not money taken from the Treasury had been used in the way the House had directed. Randolph's multipart motion was unanimously affirmed. Then many representatives began to fuss over the specificities of the motion, however the House was able to, again, agree on passing it.

The British had impressed over six thousand United States citizens, and in 1807, <em>HMS Leopard</em> had opened fire on <em>USS Chesapeake</em>, killing three men. Great Britain had not responded to either diplomatic negotiations or threats made by the United States. Declaring war was the next step for many United States politicians, though not all congressmen agreed on declaring war against Great Britain. Federalists and some Republicans had strong concerns about the effects of war on the new nation.","Virginian John Randolph had previously voiced Republican apprehensions about the implications of the impending war for the United States. Randolph worried that American citizens would not want to pay increased taxes and that New England merchants would not support a war that would make their ports vulnerable to the British. Randolph tried to convince other Southern Republicans of the possible dangers a war would cause.","Federalist Laban Wheaton had opposed war with Great Britain since his time in at the Massachusetts Statehouse. In 1808 Wheaton presented the Wheaton Resolves in response and opposition to the national Embargo Act. James Sullivan, a Democratic-Republican and Governor of Massachusetts, had seen the Federalist Campaign in Massachusetts as a betrayal of President Jefferson, and he had feared that opposing the national government would lead to anarchy. Sullivan tried to present the Embargo Act in a positive light, as a federal action the demonstrated of unity and independence for the nation. The Federalist Party had dominated the Statehouse, and Wheaton had gained recognition for authoring the resolves. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1808, Wheaton maintained his Federalist stance through his four terms. He joined with other Federalists and some Republicans in resisting the declaration of war in 1812.","When the Senate presented the act to the House, Federalists and other members who were opposed to war tried to delay the vote. Virginia Federalist Daniel Sheffey proposed to postpone the vote indefinitely. Along with seventy other House members, Massachusetts Federalist Laban Wheaton voted in favor of the motion, which was opposed by forty-six nays. The motion was raised again, and Wheaton voted in the affirmative. However, the nays outweighed the yeas with an eighty-five to forty-four vote. When John Randolph, a Republican from Virginia who opposed the declaration of war, moved to postpone the vote until the following Monday the nays still defeated the yeas. Randolph then proposed to postpone the vote until July, but again the motion failed.

Its early revival is recommended, in order that timely steps may be taken for arrangements such as the act contemplated … falls within my duty to recommend also, that, … every necessary provision may be made for a volunteer force of twenty thousand men, to be enlisted for a short period, and held in a state of organization and readiness for actual service, at the shortest warning…”","The House accepted the president’s recommendation. Both the president and the members of the House of Representatives were nervous about growing tensions between the United States and warring European countries.","By the winter of 1809-1810, ongoing wars between France and Britain were continuing to affect American trade. American efforts to solve the issue diplomatically had almost brought the United States and Great Britain to war. Congress met in December and January to seek ways to prevent a declaration of war. With tensions arising, renewing authorization of the armed forces prepared the United States in case the British, the French, or possibly the Spanish in western Florida decided to attack.","Many Federalists stated their opinions. Elisha Potter of Rhode Island stated that any military response would plummet the nation into a war it was not prepared for. Samuel Dana of Connecticut argued that issuing military commands would be a waste of “national character” and had no possibility of being enforced. From Massachusetts, Laban Wheaton objected to the whole notion of war unless the costs were counted due to his concern that war would lead the United States into a state of poverty and chaos like the one it had endured after the Revolutionary War.","The debate intensified when the Republicans had a chance to speak.

One such Republican, Nathaniel Macon, stated that war was the only way to receive justice from Britain.","At the end of the debate, the members of the House of Representatives decided to authorize the renewal of the militia. They also set up an act that would exclude all foreign ships from American ports and allow only American ships to travel in and out of their docks.

The microphone was first invented and introduced to the public in 1877 by Emile Berliner. Berliner immigrated to the United States when he was just nineteen years old but later became known as a great entrepreneur and inventor of products that would make their way into every home and industry in the U.S.","In September of 1926, a trade magazine called <em>Radio Broadcast</em> published an article which focused on the microphone and its origins. The broadcasting journal wanted to inform its readers about who invented the microphone and where exactly the technology came from, since at that time few in the industry knew much about the device that was being used across the world to broadcast sound. It was astonishing to readers that Emile Berliner had created the modern broadcasting microphone after just six weeks of experiments in his tiny one-bedroom apartment. The article digs up the history of the inventor as well as the invention, and describes the fascinating story of Berliner’s development of the microphone.","Emile Berliner had a passion for science and discovering secrets behind new technologies. He was astonishingly smart given his brief education.  He attended a Jewish school in Germany, but left school at the age of fourteen to help support his family. He later immigrated to the U.S. in 1870 and went to work in a small dry goods store in Washington, D.C. He first exhibited an interest in improving existing technology while working in the store.  He had heard of rumors about Alexander Bell’s telephone in the 1870s but the telephone had not been made public yet nor had Berliner ever seen one.  Berliner decided to experiment with building a device to transfer sound waves (the vibrations of air) along electrical wires. He started with a simple tin-can telephone and a soap box. He knocked the bottom out of the soap box and nailed sheet iron on instead, then placed a bar across the middle made of steel. With this, he created an iron diaphragm transmitter, similar to the telephone that Alexander Bell had invented. With this invention, he had to figure out a way to amplify the sound so that it would function as a true communications instrument and not just as a sound transformer. His initial design for what he called the microphone failed. He could not get the sound from fading as the waves traveled farther from the device. The solution to the problem was suggested by one of Berliner’s close friends during a conversation between the two men. Berliner’s friend, who worked at a telegraph station, explained to him that the harder he pressed down on the telegraph key, the stronger the current passing through the key became. This was the information that helped Berliner to understand why the waves were fading out so quickly. He needed to come up with a way to produce a stronger current. Using a toy drum to which he attached a steel button linked to a metal wire, Berliner built the first microphone. When contact was made between the diaphragm and the button, sound was transmitted and amplified in such a way that the waves did not fade like his earlier invention. The device functioned when the steel wire was hooked up to a battery and an induction coil. This was the process by which he developed the microphone.","Emile Berliner needed to patent the device in order to secure credit for his microphone invention. When he applied for the microphone patent on June 4, 1877, a fourteen-year conflict began over his patent. After the microphone was invented, it was discovered that in order to make a functional telephone, you needed a combination of Bell’s magneto receiver and Berliner’s microphone transmitter. The patent office did not know who to award the patent to because both inventions were so similar that they needed to investigate further. This caused great debate about who invented the microphone first. The Supreme Court finally recognized Emile Berliner for the invention of the microphone and granted him his patent on November 17, 1891.","With this success, Berliner landed a job as chief engineer at the Bell Telephone company. The company paid him $50,000 for his rights to the patent so that they could market it as their own. Berliner continued inventing and although he does not seem to have received much recognition for his initial invention due to Bell’s popularity, he played a vital role in the invention of both the microphone and the telephone.","Emile Berliner was an important inventor who had a tremendous impact on the broadcasting industry. At the time of the article’s publication in 1926, Berliner was still busy inventing and playing a role in the evolving science of acoustics. He went on to invent acoustic cells and acoustic tiles, which helped to perfect the acoustics in large buildings. His great invention of the microphone came to him by way of a few experiments and correcting some minor mistakes. Yet, his first major invention has had a major impact on society for over 120 years."],"display_date":"September 1, 1926","search_date":"1926-09-01","locations":[{"id":21755,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2511,"tag":"Inventor"},{"id":2510,"tag":"Microphone"},{"id":2522,"tag":"Emile Berliner"}],"course":{"name":"From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":133,"school_id":43}},{"id":6287,"title":"Nicaragua Applauds Commodore Pauling for Capturing William Walker","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-12-01","end_date":"1858-03-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 31,1858 the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua wrote to United States Naval officer Hiram Paulding concerning his role in the capture and removal of the American filibusterer William Walker from Nicaraguan soil. In the letter, the government of Nicaragua applauded Paulding for his actions and informed him that “the [Nicaraguan] minister plenipotentiary in Washington was expressly directed to make known to the government of the United States that Nicaragua approved with full satisfaction the capture on its own territory of those revolutionist [Walker and his men] by the naval forces under your [Pauling’s] orders.”","In the months after Paulding’s December 1857 seizure of Walker, the capture’s actions had been called into question. Upon being returned to the United States Walker, who had previously studied law, took his case to the press. As summarized by historian William O. Scroggs, Walker  “coolly discussed Paulding’s invasion of the territory of a friendly power and his insult to its flag.” He then began to make claims that “It was the duty of the American Government…to return his men to the place from which they had been forcibly removed, and to salute the flag of Nicaragua for the insult it had received.”","While obviously overplaying his concern for Nicaragua’s national honor, Walker’s argument and his cause found favor with many in the southern masses including several southern congressmen. In fact, according to historian James McPherson, Georgia representative “Alexander Stephens urged the court-martial of the commodore who had detained Walker [Paulding].” Stephens was not alone in his views. No less than “two dozen Southern senators and congressmen echoed this sentiment in an extraordinary congressional debate.” The future of Paulding’s military career seemed uncertain.","Nicaragua was not oblivious to these ongoing debates. In the March letter to Paulding, the Nicaraguans expressed the “deep pain” felt by their government upon hearing “that the partisans of filibusterism have endeavored to blacken your [Paulding’s] conduct.” It is perhaps in response to these pains that the letter was written. By ensuring that “the grateful voice of the [Nicaraguan] government, of the people of Nicaragua, and all Central Americans rendering thanks to Commodore Paulding” gained a hearing by the American Congress, Nicaragua hoped to help save the career of the Naval officer who a few months earlier had helped to save them.","William Walker’s filibustering escapades in Central America were not over. In his final attempt at Nicaragua the British Navy captured Walker and turned him over to Central American authorities who were far less tolerant of the filibuster’s conduct. In the words of McPherson, “on September 12, 1860, the grey-eyed man [Walker] met his destiny before a Honduran firing squad.”"],"display_date":"December 1857 - March 1858","search_date":"1858-01-29","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1854,"tag":"Filibuster"},{"id":1418,"tag":"Nicaragua"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"},{"id":2554,"tag":"Alexander Stephens"},{"id":2553,"tag":"Hiram Paulding"},{"id":2552,"tag":"William Walker"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6271,"title":"Greenbelt: Enthusiasm and Exclusion","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/35","end_date":"12/31/37","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Of all the federal government’s attempts to deal with the Great Depression, few were as ambitious as the creation of the Resettlement Administration. The Resettlement Administration, established in 1935, was originally designed to move farmers to more productive agricultural areas. Once farmers were moved off of poor landscapes, the agency sent in conservation experts to reclaim and improve the land. The Resettlement Administraion also oversaw the creation of model communities, designed to serve as examples of how people could live more harmoniously with the environment. The towns highlighted the necessity of green space and public transportation and emphasized the value of cooperative living. The Resettlement Administration worked with over 200 existing rural and suburban communities and actually designed three entirely new towns before the agency was dissolved.","Greenbelt, Maryland, was one of the three towns planned and established by the Resettlement Administration. Established in 1937, Greenbelt attracted unemployed and impoverished people who wanted to make a new life for themselves and were willing to be active civic participants. One citizen of Greenbelt in the early years said first inhabitants felt like pioneers working in uncharted territory. Their enthusiasm for the Greenbelt project showed itself in the creation of numerous cooperative organizations within the town. Within the first ten months, Greenbelt’s civic-minded inhabitants had founded twenty-nine clubs and organizations.","Despite this enthusiasm of the residents in the foundation of Greenbelt, there was a disappointing trend toward racial exclusion. The town originated as an exclusively white community. The only hint of diversity was the presence and acceptance of Jewish residents. The original plan for Greenbelt called for a segregated black section, the Rossville Rural Development. Officials quietly dropped the plan and later justified their decision by explaining that African Americans had their own low cost housing in Northeast Washington.","Racial inequity was a persistent problem in the New Deal, and the Resettlement Administration Programs were no different.The racial exclusiveness of Greenbelt was not unique.

On Sunday, September 9, 1928, <em>The Washington Herald </em>reported on Emile Berliner’s success as he contributed another innovation in the field of sound transmission. As described in the newspaper article<em>, </em>“based upon a lifetime of experience in the study of sound, he has invented the acoustic cement cell which… has the effect of clarifying and amplifying the tones of a speaker’s voice or the notes of a musical instrument.” In other words, Berliner was triumphant yet again, in advancing sound technology by developing the acoustic cement cell. The acoustic cement cell was a simple device which attached to the interior walls of a room. The cells were usually shaped like a square or rectangle, and they were made of cement, although the inside was hollow. When an ample amount of cells were hung in a single room, they would diminish the reverberations and echoes generated by speakers or musical instruments, especially those generated in a large hall. Although Berliner had experimented with sound production and transmission technologies for much of his life, his dedication to studying sound showed concrete results with development of the new building material. According to <em>The Washington Herald, </em>“Berliner’s newest invention was crowned with success in a trial in the auditorium of the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia.” Along with that, <em>The Washington Herald </em>announced “the Berliner acoustic cement wall cells have been tested with eminent success in the spacious board room of the magnificent District Building in Washington D.C.” This means that Berliner tested his product in well-established and highly respected institutions. Upon doing so, Berliner once again gained national recognition for revolutionizing sound in an inconceivable fashion.","Besides creating the acoustic cement cell, Berliner was responsible for producing other distinct designs in an age of industrialism. Berliner was influential in telephone technology. More specifically, Berliner “discovered that the device could act as a superior telephone receiver” (Encyclopedia Britannica). Despite Berliner’s concentration on sound evolution, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers notes, Berliner was responsible for building an “aircraft engine and helicopter.” It is clear, even with all his focus on sound throughout his life, Berliner was a true visionary who expanded other facets of technology. Berliner’s success is beyond remarkable, especially considering his educational background. The Library of Congress chronicles that “Berliner was a largely self-educated man.”  In spite of, his lack of formal education, Berliner still displayed a unique mindset as he supplied the world around him with intuitive inventions.","To this day, Berliner continues to receive recognition for his innovations. Berliner, although deceased, won a “Trustees Award in 1987 and a Technical Award in 2014” (News.Delaware.Gov). Although it has been over 100 years since his groundbreaking discoveries, Berliner is still acknowledged for his inventions. Additionally, many of Berliner’s designs are still currently used. The recording industry, along with the field of communications, is forever indebted to Berliner’s intellectual concepts. Still, his expertise, experimentation, discoveries, and devices have affected much more than those two areas of entertainment, without a doubt. Simple and plain, the world would not be what it is today without Emile Berliner’s hard work and ingenuity."],"display_date":"September 9, 1928","search_date":"1928-09-09","locations":[{"id":21755,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2522,"tag":"Emile Berliner"},{"id":2523,"tag":"acoustic cement cell"}],"course":{"name":"From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":133,"school_id":43}},{"id":6292,"title":"Women Working on the Homefront during WWII","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/43","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["When the men of America were called upon to serve their country during WWII, many job positions and duties on the Homefront were left unfulfilled.

Advertisers and propaganda agencies created fictional characters such as Rosie the Riveter to inspire women. Advertisements calling on women to support the war effort were widely published and distributed. All of these mechanisms encouraged women to enter the work force. Women answered the call.

a warm June day in the year 1966, 28 frustrated women went to Washington D.C. to attend the third National Conference of Commissions.[1]  The topic for this conference was the status of women in the United States.  While some believed that women became equal in America the moment that they gained the vote, others, these 28 women specifically, believed that the U.S. still had a long way to go to gain equality between the sexes.  Yet upon attending the conference they felt that not enough of the issues were being dealt with or even discussed.  Issues like that of equal opportunities for employment for both sexes.[2]  These 28 intelligent and educated women experienced first-hand the discrimination and limitations that came with being a woman in the job market during that time.[3]  Even though, governmental departments such as the Women’s Bureau may have been putting out reports of female contentment in the private sphere, or the home, these women said different.[4]  Soon after the conference these 28 women founded the National Organization for Women, an American Feminist Advocacy group.","These 28 women after leaving the conference threw their anger at the lack of progress for women into creating an activist feminist organization whose goal was to attempt to tip the scales in the favor of women everywhere in America.[5]  They wanted to challenge a system that would have much preferred women remain in their supposedly traditional roles in the home.[6]  Also to give a voice to the issues that women cared about and effected them directly, on a political and national scale.  With the help of Betty Friedman, the author of <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>, these women formed a feminist civil rights group.  Friedman also came up with the idea to name the group “NOW” or the National Organization for Women.[7]  Books like Friedman’s <em>Feminine Mystique </em>helped to create a consciousness in the United States which led to more discontentment with the status of women in the country.[8]  This consciousness along with many other factors contributed to the women’s movement in that time and eventually the creation of the National Organization for Women.","Later as NOW grew to include chapters all across the United States they felt the need to share their origin story.  So pamphlets were distributed, recounting the narrative of the founding of the organization to the newly formed chapters all over the country.  This most likely give the new chapters a sense of connection to the group on its national level.  Rather than just each individual chapter creating its own ideology and goals, NOW wanted all the chapters to understand the importance of the ideas that the organization was founded upon and the goal of helping women to gain their political voice."," ","[1]NOW Origins Pamphlet, in MSS 310 National Organization for Women National records,","Administrative 1966-1993, Special Collections, Augustana College, Rock Island IL.","[2]

Wilson sat at his desk trying to organize his thoughts. World War I continued on while he tried to fix the problems at home as well as overseas. On June 7, 1918, President Wilson typed up a letter and sent it to Carrie Chapman Catt who was a leading figure in the women’s suffrage movement. Wilson pictured the United States as the leader of the democratic world during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. However, it was hardly democratic itself. Women were not allowed to partake in politics, specifically in voting for their representatives. Many women had been trying to change this by adding a women’s suffrage amendment to the constitution since at least 1848 with little success.","President Wilson did very little with women’s suffrage at first. Many women even picketed the White House in 1917 in order for Wilson to take them seriously. The protest put many women into jail because violence broke out. His daughter, Jessie Woodrow Wilson Sayre, was also a prominent leader in the women’s suffrage movement. Around the time of the protests, Wilson had a sudden change of heart.  These various factors may have contributed to Wilson’s change in attitude towards the women’s movement.","Finally after much hard work, the leaders of women’s suffrage had gained a powerful ally in 1918. That ally would be none other than the President himself, Woodrow Wilson. In the letter, President Woodrow Wilson stated that he agreed with Catt on her views for, \"...democratic reconstruction of the world for which we are striving, and which we are determined to bring about at any cost, will not have been completely or adequately attained until women are admitted to the suffrage…” Carrie Chapman Catt had finally convinced a world leader about the importance of women’s suffrage.  It was now only a matter of time before her hope for women would become a reality with the eventual passage of the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment."," "],"display_date":"June 7, 1918","search_date":"1918-06-07","locations":[{"id":17283,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2645,"tag":"Woodrow Wilson"},{"id":2646,"tag":"Carrie Chapman Catt"},{"id":2647,"tag":"Women's Suffrage"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6360,"title":"<strong>David F.

President Woodrow Wilson famously insisted that, \"America was too proud to fight\" in the European conflict. During this time, President Wilson pursued a non-intervention policy and tried to help mediate peace for all sides. He realized that the German government, in particular, was not interested in ending the war. On May 7, 1915, a German U-boat sank the British ocean liner <em>RMS Lusitania </em>killing 128 Americans. President Wilson was forced to make a stand and told the Germans that unrestricted warfare on non-military targets would not be tolerated. The German government originally agreed with the demand but by January 1917 they had sunk an additional seven U.S merchant ships. Realizing that he was now out of options, President Wilson called for war. Congress complied and declared war on April 6, 1917.","Soon after America declared war, Secretary of Agriculture David F. Houston wrote a commentary encapsulating his thoughts about U.S preparedness for the conflict entitled <em>U.S War Readiness, 1917. </em>Houston's insights about America's preparation for war and its speedy development of civil and military production capabilities shows exactly what kind of man he was. An academic with a degree in political science from Harvard University, Houston had taught at the University of Texas where he eventually became dean of the facility. Afterwards, he had accepted a job as president of rival university Texas A & M. He then proceeded to become chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis before accepting a position in President Wilson's cabinet. Toward the end of the war he became Secretary of the Treasury. He eventually left politics and entered the business world as president of Bell Telephone financial subsidiary, Bell Telephone Securities. Afterwards, he served as director of AT&T, the Guaranty Trust Company, and the United States Steel Corporation.","When David F. Houston wrote <em>U.S War Readiness, 1917 </em>he wasn't trying to hide his emotional state regarding the conflict. He was a very patriotic man who believed - along with many Americans - that the time had come for the United States to enter the war. His writings highlighted the magnitude of such an undertaking. Even Houston could not comprehend the vast funds authorized by Congress to support the war machine. For example, he writes that Congress had authorized over $21 billion dollars toward war efforts. The money was allocated for military operations that included building machinery such as ships and airplanes, maintaining supplies for the troops, transportation needs, and adequate medicine and medical care for the wounded. Houston states that the budget for ship construction of $1.9 billion dollars was nearly double the former federal budget as a whole. On the topic, Houston said, \"The figures even for particular items are beyond comprehension.\" Houston goes on to write in great detail about the cost of all facets of military operations.","What may be more incredible than the financial and industrial output necessary to support the war effort were the programs that were developed to safeguard these operations. Houston mentions that only a few months earlier, the Council of Defense was formed. Some of the responsibilities of the committee included mobilizing forces, utilizing waterways and highways, increasing domestic production for military commitments, and being able to utilize the nation's resources immediately if warranted. Houston also draws special attention to seven agencies still in their infancy that he thinks would play \"peculiar importance\" in the war mobilization. These newly-formed agencies included a shipping board, and aviation, medical, transportation, munitions, and labor committees. Houston says that these governmental bodies were able to become truly effective when the United States entered war. Other agencies that were created to regulate wartime activities include the Food Administration, the Fuel Administration, the War Council, the War Trade Board, and the War Industries Board. It is clear that Houston considers the War Industries Board to be of the greatest importance. He explains that all purchases for the Allies have to be approved by the three-person committee. The War Industries Board analyzes all aspects of industrial operations and makes commodity purchases large enough to effect market values.","In his essay, David F. Houston shares his thoughts on how America mobilized its economic and industrial might after it entered World War One. His writing shows just how overwhelmed he was with America's massive production abilities and the programs that kept war preparation operations running efficiently. He understood that technology alone would not win the war. He stated, \"No machinery is of great value unless it is properly manned.\" He believed that Americans would rise to the challenge. He was right."],"display_date":1917,"search_date":"1917-07-02","locations":[{"id":17283,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2689,"tag":"David F Houston"},{"id":1859,"tag":"World War 1"},{"id":2692,"tag":"The Great War"},{"id":2693,"tag":"U.S War Readiness, 1917"},{"id":2694,"tag":"America's War Effort"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":140,"school_id":43}},{"id":6391,"title":"Understanding Slavery from Charles Ball By: Emily Curran","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-01","end_date":"1837-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Charles Ball was born in Calvert County, Maryland and was a slave for the biggest part of his life. His narrative starts with telling the reader about his early childhood life and the hardships of staying a family. He stresses to the reader that though many claimed the evils of slavery were getting easier during the times when laws protecting slaves started to come about, but it was in fact the other way around. The masters of the slaves came down harder and the separation from one’s family was more common. He tells the story of how he was taken from his mother and the whipping that she received just for holding him one last time. Ball also speaks to how his father was changed by his enslavement and how his father’s temperament became moodier the older he got. The next section of the narrative tells of his time in the navy yard as a hired out slave and how he met his first wife during that time. Ball shows the hardships that come from being married as slaves because of the fact one changed masters so frequently that staying together becomes impossible. Ball goes on to describe his time when he was sold to a slave trader from Georgia and having to walk all the way to his new plantation in South Carolina cuffed to 51 other slaves. Then, when he arrived he was sold to a cotton plantation where he describes the unfair treatment the slaves received. He compares his experiences from Maryland to that of Georgia and finds Georgia lacking. Ball found Georgia to treat their slaves as not even human beings where Maryland treated their slaves with a sense of pride. It was because of the cruelty that he discovered in Georgia that he decided to escape from slavery and walked back to Maryland to return to his wife and children there. Once there he hired himself out for wages and managed to escape the notice of the government for a long enough time to buy a farm. However, his wife died in 1816 and he remarried two years later. His new life was a very dangerous one and it was not long that he was once again recaptured and returned to slavery. While he was enslaved once again, his family was captured and sold into slavery also. He ends with his escape from slavery once again and his fleeing to Pennsylvania to avoid capture again and with the hopelessness of never seeing his family and children again (Ball).","            This narrative gave credence to two other authors who wrote about slavery by using many different examples of slaves, slave holders, and slave traders. One of those authors was Walter Johnson who wrote the novel Soul by Soul and in it he describes the issue of paternalism. Johnson states that “paternalism, then, was something slaveholders could buy in the slave market” (Johnson 111). For instance, when a slave was traded from master to master he or she would beg his or her old master to allow him or her to stay. It was this begging and this need to be with their old masters that gave way to the feelings of paternalism. Paternalism was a dangerous road for the slave trade to travel on because it enabled the trade to stay alive that much longer. It was this excuse of having feelings of paternalism that helped the slaveholders and the slave traders get the overall public to see the worth that slavery has, by degrading those that were enslaved they enabled the country to try and rationalize something that was irrational. Further, the narrative also shows how the slaveholders effected the process. Ball’s description of some of his holders and some of his tasks he did for these holders revealed how the relationship that the holder had with his slaves truly was an intricate one. For the slaveholders controlling these slaves and having these slaves was a point of pride. Ball describes instances where he said the slaves had to look good because it would have been seen as a very bad thing for the master to mistreat his slaves. "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1837","search_date":"1837-01-01","locations":[{"id":52795,"lat":32.1656221,"lng":-82.9000751,"zoom":8,"place":"Georgia"},{"id":52796,"lat":33.836081,"lng":-81.1637245,"zoom":8,"place":"South Carolina"},{"id":52797,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington D.C"},{"id":52798,"lat":38.4949503,"lng":-76.5025742,"zoom":8,"place":"Calvert County, MD"},{"id":52799,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"Philadelphia P.A"}],"tags":[{"id":386,"tag":"Paternalism"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":2736,"tag":"Separation"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6385,"title":"The Escape of William and Ellen Craft from Slavery in America to Freedom in England","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-12-01","end_date":"1852-01-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["William and Ellen Craft were both born in 1820s Georgia to, by the standards of that time, fairly sensitive masters. Neither was ever beaten by their masters, yet they still could feel the shackles of slavery. They met each other in 1846 by coincidence, and by 1848 were married. Their decision to escape slavery was heavily influenced by, besides their desire for and right to freedom, their desire to raise children out of the confines of slavery. Their escape was quick—eight days from their initial idea—however it was not easy and they ran into many obstacles along the way.","Their idea was based on the fact that Ellen’s quadroon skin made her passably white. So, they decided she was going to dress up as William's male master and chaperone him to Philadelphia, a free state. With nerves rumbling, they gathered costumes and props--Ellen decided to wear glasses and poultices around both her mouth and her arm so that she would neither be recognizable nor be asked to speak or write. Their masters issued them “holiday” papers for a short Christmas vacation. Along their journey, they encountered Ellen's family's friend and William's employer, but luckily were not caught. Many pro-slavery Southern Whites they met warned Ellen, code-named \"William Johnson,\" that her “slave” may escape when they get to the North. Blacks free and enslaved urged William to seek freedom when he got to Philadelphia.","If William and Ellen had good masters, why, then, did they want so badly to be free? Did they not have food, a job, a bed? This sentiment is what Saidiya Hartman says is the worst part of this institution. \"If the excess of enjoyment imputed to the enslaved displaced what we would think of as disturbing circumstances, it did so only by obscuring violence and comflating it with pleasure\" (Hartman 25). The institution's ideologies as a whole seeped within the community in the form of subconscious racial discrimination and subordination, allowing whites to alleviate their guilt in an instance where a slave seems to be treated more humane than usual. This natural inclination towards racism under the lens of paternalistic, goodly masters is seen throughout the Craft's interactions with the upper-middle to upper class white persons on the trains and steamers. When they were on a train in Richmond, an elite woman mistook William for her escaped \"Ned\" because she “never in my life saw two black pigs more alike” (Tweedie 62).  This incidence truly emphasizes the social atmosphere of the era. A majority of whites held skewed views of blacks and a lot of people were very proud and open about it. This woman was of a paternalistic view of blacks, that they were less intelligent and she knew what was best for them. This idea led her to change the will of her late husband, which had called for the emancipation of his slaves. She sold them because she thought it was “such a cruel thing to turn n****rs loose to shift for themselves, when there are so many good masters to take care of them” (Tweedie 64). A discussion, thus, took place amongst her, Ellen, and gentleman who was sitting by them, though it brought no change of mind to the woman. She reserved her paternalistic view of her slaveholding status."," Mysteriously, the couple came across much luck in their travel. At the port in Baltimore en route to free land in Philadelphia, a \"Yankee of the low order\" (Tweedie 68) claimed he could not let men with slaves pass without his approval, to prevent the emancipation of the slaves. With sheer luck, the conductor of the train recognized the couple and convinced the Yankee to let them board. While in Philadelphia, they met a man who was a member of the Society of Friends and who graciously hosted them for three weeks. During those three weeks, the freed William and Ellen learned the alphabet and how to spell and write their names.","It came to be, however, that they were not safe in the supposedly free land of the North for, in 1850, the Fugitive Slave Act was enacted and their masters sent out warrants for their re-enslavement. As quickly as they arrived in the North, they fled for Canada and then England. William remarks at the end of his narrative about how unfortunate it is that, in order to be free, he and Ellen had to flee a land that prides itself in freedom and equality for the land which that country fled from just a few centuries prior.","                                    \"In short, it is well known in England, if not all over the world,                                                                                        that the Americans, as a people, are notoriously mean and cruel                                                                                    towards all coloured persons, whether they are bond or free\" (Tweedie 111). "],"display_date":"December 1, 1848 - January 31, 1852","search_date":"1850-07-02","locations":[{"id":52774,"lat":32.8406946,"lng":-83.6324022,"zoom":8,"place":"Maçon, GA"},{"id":52775,"lat":32.0835407,"lng":-81.0998342,"zoom":8,"place":"Savannah, GA"},{"id":52776,"lat":32.7764749,"lng":-79.9310512,"zoom":8,"place":"Charleston, SC"},{"id":52777,"lat":37.5407246,"lng":-77.4360481,"zoom":8,"place":"Richmond, VA"},{"id":52778,"lat":39.2903848,"lng":-76.6121893,"zoom":8,"place":"Baltimore, MD"},{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"},{"id":52780,"lat":39.9525839,"lng":-75.1652215,"zoom":8,"place":"Philadelphia, PA"},{"id":52781,"lat":42.3600825,"lng":-71.0588801,"zoom":8,"place":"Boston, MA"},{"id":52782,"lat":43.661471,"lng":-70.2553259,"zoom":8,"place":"Portland, ME"},{"id":52783,"lat":45.2733153,"lng":-66.0633081,"zoom":8,"place":"St John, NB, Canada"},{"id":52784,"lat":44.9902861,"lng":-64.1310364,"zoom":8,"place":"Windsor, NS, Canada"},{"id":52785,"lat":44.6488625,"lng":-63.5753196,"zoom":8,"place":"Halifax, NS, Canada"},{"id":52786,"lat":53.4083714,"lng":-2.9915726,"zoom":8,"place":"Liverpool, UK"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":501,"tag":"Escaping slavery"},{"id":2306,"tag":"Slave narratives"},{"id":420,"tag":"Slaves"},{"id":2737,"tag":"Civil War era"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6421,"title":"The Civil War: Remembering the Dead","course_id":149,"status":"P","start_date":"1872-05-30","end_date":"1872-05-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            The graves of all of the soldiers in the different cemeteries were strewn with flowers in Brooklyn.

In the <em>Memphis Daily Appeal</em>, Decoration Day events of 1872 from different parts of the country were detailed. This information is significant for it shows how the nation healed during the aftermath of the Civil War. Decoration Day, which was later called Memorial Day, was a way for the nation to heal. Both the North and the South found a way to healing the scars of death by honoring and remembering their dead. Over six hundred and twenty thousand soldiers died as a result of the Civil War (Blight, 64). How to remember the slaughter of all the participants became the legacy of the war.","            In May 1868, General John Logan, Commander of the Grand Army of the Republic, called on all northern soldiers to decorate the graves of their dead comrades. Twenty-seven states participated in this May 30<sup>th</sup> ritual of placing flowers on the graves and making speeches. The next year, some three hundred and fifty six cities, both in the North and the South, participated in Decoration Day activities (Blight, 71). In the South, Confederate Memorial Day was celebrated on different dates at first. April 26<sup>th</sup>, the date of General Joseph Johnson’s surrender to General William Sherman, was used by many of the southern states (Blight, 77). Some southern states such as North Carolina and South Carolina used May 10<sup>th</sup>, which was the birthday of Stonewall Jackson. Virginia used June 3<sup>rd</sup> in honor of Jefferson Davis’ birthday (Blight, 77 – 78). By 1872, both the North and the South celebrated together with May 30<sup>th</sup> as the official day for Decoration Day as the holiday helped socially heal and bring together everyone. Black veterans marched and placed flowers alongside white veterans of the Civil War (Blight, 78 – 81).

In the early 1960s, throughout towns and cities in America, Jackie created a frenzy in the media with her impeccable style. Newspapers all over the country showcased her style as “The Jackie Kennedy Look.”  On October 17<sup>th</sup> 1960, <em>The Washington Post </em>documented Jackie’s new hairstyle as the “Modified Bouffant” which was a short voluminous hairstyle that many admired. Within days, other women copied Jackie’s new hairstyle as their own. Women and girls were recreating every little aspect of Jackie’s style, forming a complete “Jackie Look” throughout America. Jackie had her style featured in numerous newspapers such as the <em>Los Angeles Times, </em>which made reference to Jackie’s style as “glamorous” and “confident.” She was an icon to all women who perceived her as flawless and beautiful. She wore items such as her pillbox hat, pearls, monochromatic palettes and trench coats, which the media documented. This signature look that she created helped individuals follow her style more closely. Her designer Oleg Cassini wrote a book dedicated to the outfits she wore at major events during her husband’s presidency. Cassini captured the influence Jackie reflected onto women through her fashion. He even stated, “… the public adulation had built up to such an extent that in the eyes of most Americans, everything she did was perfect.” Her influence was so strong on the American people that it shaped many styles and revolutionized the fashion culture of the 1960s.","Besides Jackie Kennedys fashion, her aura was looked at in a positive manner. The word “icon” coined Jackie Kennedy as an individual. Icons came from high society, which the media created from their fascination with these individuals. Jackie became an icon through press coverage and media attention of which she became surrounded by. She turned the 1960’s fashion into being “youth led” and many younger girls aspired to be like the first lady. Fashion expert Valerie Steele even stated, “Everyone wants to look like Kate Moss. It's the way women felt about Jackie Kennedy in the early '60s.'' Overall, this fascination Americans had with her was truly remarkable.

Jackie first rode a horse when she was one year old.  Her mother, Janet Norton Lee was a \"skillful and daring horsewoman, who won many prizes throughout the East…”  Janet instilled her passion for horses to Jackie and she would pass it on to her daughter, Caroline.  Jackie retreated to her stable at Glen-Ora, in Upperville, Virginia, whenever she was feeling overwhelmed.  As a child, Jacqueline rode and competed to cope with the bad blood between her parents after their divorce.  Vicky Moon states in her book that one of Jackie’s family member recalled that, “I did not realize it at the time, but I now believe her obsession with horses stemmed from her desperately unhappy home life.”  Unfortunately her life did not improve greatly once she met Jack Kennedy.  She joked with her family about being with a man who was allergic to horses.  In later years, she would ride to cope the loss of three of her children.  She mainly went riding to get away from the responsibilities that awaited her at the White House.  Fred Glueckstein explained that “Her love of horses and riding became a refuge from the tensions and stress of the White House.”  Whenever she felt depressed, she relied on horseback riding to provide the peace and privacy."],"display_date":"January 1, 1940 - November 22, 1963","search_date":"1951-12-12","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":0,"place":"Washington, D.C."},{"id":52856,"lat":38.9929383,"lng":-77.8863787,"zoom":0,"place":"Upperville, VA"}],"tags":[{"id":1727,"tag":"JFK"},{"id":2850,"tag":"Equestrian"}],"course":{"name":"JFK: Famine to New Frontier","school":"Marist College","course_id":150,"school_id":77}},{"id":6461,"title":"President Kennedy's Relationship with Reporters","course_id":150,"status":"P","start_date":"1/27/62","end_date":"3/16/65","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["President John F. Kennedy accounted for the success of his press conferences to his friendly relationship with the press. His communication with them was different from any previous president and he gained admiration from many journalists throughout his career. His perspective on reporters was a give and take relationship. Coming from a reporter background, having worked for Hearst’s <em>Chicago Herald </em>in 1945, he understood the importance of a cordial relationship with the press. In an Interview with Jill Cowan and Priscilla Wear, women of the President’s staff, they pointed to Kennedy’s strong dislike of a certain woman reporter, Sarah McClendon. When asked by the interviewer if there were any personalities of the press corps from whom Kennedy didn’t welcome questions, Cowan answered, “Yes, Sarah McClendon he always hated”.  Cowan preceded by saying, “He was always very careful about answering as many questions from the right hand side of the room as the left because people kept very close figures on how he would answer them. You know, which side did he favor. And so he really had to act.... Even those he wanted to avoid, he couldn’t help it.”","A trailblazer for her time, McClendon transcended the patient reporter’s approach to Kennedy’s conferences. She went by the saying; reporters should speak the public’s mind. The voice of Sarah McClendon was not easy to ignore, and difficult to dismiss.  Her multiple attempts to catch the President’s eye were persistent and determined in getting information not only she wanted, but Americans too. During President John F. Kennedy’s January, 1962 press conference held in Washington DC, McClendon questioned the loyalty of two officials who had been tasked to reorganize the Office of Security in the State Department. She saw them as security risks, but had no substantial foundation of evidence to properly criticize the two officials. Writing for the Washington Post, the author of this article sided with Kennedy, believing the President should be forewarned of unwarranted questions, like McClendon’s, to prevent damaging the President’s reputation. Beyond the President, even fellow reporters were apparently irritated by McClendon .","Sarah McClendon could not stand to be overlooked. there were definitely some press Kennedy preffered over McClendon which was seen through his rude responses to her, but in order to appease to all sides he could not neglect her questions. He would often take calls froma all sections of the room however, when he heard McClendon's voice he reluctantly let her pose a question. Kennedy understood his image was on the line  and often times rebuked her unrefined inquiries. Kennedy used th epress to his advantage, and did not want someone like McClendon ruining his reputation. ","Kennedy had a special relationship with some members of the press and relied on them before and during his Presidency. However, Kennedy used his political stature as a way to manipulate the media. He remained in continuous contact with the press in order to promote and maintain a trustworthy image. His familiarity with the media ultimately helped in overcoming the Republican controlled press. Reporters like McClendon posed a threat to Kennedy by her aggressive questions, which Kennedy had no interest in, but that did not stop McClendon."," "," "," "],"display_date":"January 27, 1962 - March 16, 1965","search_date":"1963-08-22","locations":[{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":1727,"tag":"JFK"},{"id":2852,"tag":"Sarah McClendon"},{"id":2853,"tag":"Reporters"}],"course":{"name":"JFK: Famine to New Frontier","school":"Marist College","course_id":150,"school_id":77}},{"id":6472,"title":"Phyllis Schlafly Hosts Celebration to Revel in Death of ERA","course_id":153,"status":"P","start_date":"6/30/82","end_date":"6/30/82","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On June 30, 1982, the extension for the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) expired. In Lafayette Park, Washington, D.C., the members of the National Organization of Women (NOW), led by Eleanor Smeal, were in mourning. Just two miles away, at the Shoreham Hotel, the victors held their celebration. A ballroom filled with balloons and thousands of attendants sang patriotic songs in triumph. Phyllis Schlafly, the leader of the “STOP ERA” movement, hosted the “Over the Rainbow” Celebration, in which well over a thousand  men and women from around the country commemorated their victory over the ERA. The banquet hall at the hotel was set for a reception of almost 1,500 attendants.  The attendants exuded both patriotism for their country and strong Christian convictions. Schlafly delivered her speech, saying, “it is a great victory for women, for men, for families, for the combat-effectiveness of our armed forces, and for our nation that ERA will not go into the U.S. Constitution.” She and other speakers proceeded to discuss the future of their movement, which included promoting military spending to increase U.S. security, campaigning against a nuclear freeze, opposing the teaching of sex education, and ridding schools of all feminist influences from school texts. The celebration concluded with the singing of “God Bless America.”","Phyllis Schlafly and her fellow conservative opponents to the Equal Rights Amendment had been actively pursuing the death of the ERA since 1972, when the bill passed in Congress. Schlafly and other female opponents argued against the amendment, saying that the ERA was a fraud and actually took away their rights.  Schlafly asserted that the passage of the ERA would lead to the women losing “the most precious and important right of all” of having children and being supported while watching them grow and develop. Most importantly, she asserted that with the passage of the ERA, women would be forced into the military draft, which she believed would be disastrous. Schlafly said that the “women’s libbers” did not represent the majority of women in the U.S., and were undermining the American family by promoting “day-care centers for babies instead of homes…and abortions instead of families.” After ten years of opposing the ERA, Phyllis Schlafly and other conservative ERA opponents successfully killed the amendment in 1982. ","The death of the ERA was in large part due to a significant resistance from many conservative women. These women believed their rights and femininity were being taken from them by being granted equality based on sex.  Men also played a part in the battle for the ERA, both for and against, although the majority of the male population had a much more ambiguous stance on the issue than women, who had more clear views on their positon. In Kansas, one of the fifteen states who rejected the ratification of the amendment, thousands of citizens wrote to their representatives in opposition to the ERA.  According to Kristi Lowenthal, of the over 2,000 authors of these letters, ninety percent were women, illustrating the widespread opposition by women to the women’s rights movement and the ERA.  The death of the ERA illustrated a strong American resistance to change, even by the women it was aiming to free from oppression."],"display_date":"June 30, 1982","search_date":"1982-06-30","locations":[{"id":52868,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Wahington, D.C., USA"}],"tags":[{"id":2258,"tag":"women's movement"},{"id":2864,"tag":"Equal Rights Amendment"},{"id":2863,"tag":"Conservative Movement"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}},{"id":6475,"title":"The 1960s: A Revolution for the Intellectually Disabled","course_id":151,"status":"P","start_date":"2/5/63","end_date":"12/31/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Americans with intellectual disabilities were seldom given the respect and equal opportunities they deserved prior to the 1960s. Historians describe the sixties as a monumental decade in terms of technology, music, fashion, sexual revolution, and youth rebellion; but the Age of Aquarius also marked the beginning of a newfound recognition for Americans with mental disabilities. ","John F. Kennedy was the first president to make improving the lives of handicapped Americans a priority in his administration. He issued a message to Congress in 1963 addressing the dire need to aid and support Americans suffering from mental illness. He stated, “…as Americans, it is our duty to seek out the causes of mental illness, strengthen public awareness of intellectual disabilities and create programs and facilities to assist the mentally ill.” This message marked the beginning of a revolution for Americans with intellectual disabilities. ","Kennedy’s sister, Rosemary, who suffered from intellectual disabilities herself, influenced him during his presidency. Witnessing firsthand the heartbreaking tribulations of growing up mentally handicapped, President Kennedy, along with his other sister, Eunice, decided to set forth to improve the lives of the intellectually disabled forever.","A short eight months after President Kennedy’s special message to Congress, he signed the Community Mental Health Act. The CMHA provided funding for research centers and facilities in order to combat mental illness and improve the lives of those who suffer from it. Up until October of 1963, there had never been a law or act aiming to serve the mentally disabled; instead, families kept disabled children at home because society considered them a burden to society. To this day, the signing of this act signifies the official change in government perspective towards Americans living with intellectual handicaps. ","Although President Kennedy died less than a month after signing the CMHA, his legacy for helping the intellectually disabled carried on. Thanks to her brother’s public awareness, Eunice Kennedy founded the Special Olympics in 1968. The goal of the Special Olympics was to provide a day filled with events and sports clinics specifically for intellectually disabled children.  The Olympics proved to be so successful that, by 1970, the organization had spread internationally to France and Canada. At Eunice’s press conference in 1970, she reflected on how much support the organization gained in only two years and thanked Americans for their ongoing efforts to raise awareness for the mentally handicapped. ","Since John F. Kennedy’s presidency, the lives of Americans with mental disabilities have improved greatly.  Thanks to the Kennedy family, the intellectually handicapped are treated with extra care and compassion. Although some may argue that this was not the most important initiative of Kennedy’s presidency, his influence absolutely sparked a significant change in the way Americans view people who are disabled. "," "],"display_date":"February 5, 1963 - December 31, 1970","search_date":"1967-01-18","locations":[{"id":52870,"lat":41.8781136,"lng":-87.6297982,"zoom":8,"place":"Chicago, Il"},{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":2872,"tag":"Special Olympics"},{"id":2871,"tag":"Rosemary Kennedy"},{"id":2870,"tag":"Eunice Kennedy Shriver"},{"id":2869,"tag":"Mental Retardation"},{"id":2868,"tag":"Intellectual Disabilities"},{"id":2703,"tag":"John F.

Kennedy a Democratic Presidential candidate composed a personal letter to Eleanor Roosevelt. He wrote, “I note from the press that on last Sunday afternoon, December 7, on the ABC television program College News Conference, you stated…that Senator Kennedy’s ‘father has been spending oodles of money all over the country and probably paid representatives in every state by now.’” Kennedy wrote this letter to Roosevelt hoping she would retract her statement. On December 18, 1958 Roosevelt’s response to Kennedy included the pointed remark that, “building an organization is permissable [sic] but giving too lavishly may seem to indicate a desire to influence through money.” Roosevelt additionally responded to Kennedy’s letter that if the information turned out to be false, she would gladly state so but, “was told that your father said openly he would spend any money to make his son the first Catholic President of this country.” Kennedy, enraged that Roosevelt believed such a fabrication, wrote her a pointed response. According to Allida M. Black, “Kennedy knew that he needed as much party unity as he could muster to win a very close election…Eleanor Roosevelt’s support was crucial.” Kennedy wrote in more of a lecture style on December 29, that Roosevelt should not believe the allegation made against him. “I am aware…that there are good many people who fabricate rumors and engage in slander about any person in public life. But I have made it a point never to accept or repeat such a statements unless I have some concrete evidence of their truth.” In Kennedy’s letter to Roosevelt on January 22, 1959 he stated, “I do hope that we a have a chance to get together sometime in the future to discuss other matters.”  These matters included his Catholicism, and attitude towards McCarthyism.","After the convention in July 1960, when Kennedy won the nomination, Roosevelt gave her halfhearted endorsement to Kennedy. Gary Donaldson disclosed, “Stevenson, Truman, and Eleanor Roosevelt might have thrown their support to just about anyone to keep Nixon out of the White House…Without their support…Kennedy would have a difficult time winning in November.” The importance of Roosevelt publically supporting the Democratic presidential nominee was symbolic because she was arguable as the “Mother” of the Democrat Party in the White House.Roosevelt and Kennedy’s relationship started off argumentative, but progressed into a friendly association. Roosevelt aimed to ensure that her husband’s New Deal legacy continued the Democratic party. She did not trust Kennedy. She remained suspicious of his Catholicism, his lack of criticism of Senator Joseph McCarthy, and she disliked his father, Joseph Kennedy’s, financial meddling in the campaign.  At the time that Kennedy wrote the letter to Roosevelt, she supported the two-time presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson, as the leading Democratic figure. Roosevelt liked the main points that Kennedy made in his inauguration speech about challenging the nation. Roosevelt felt passionate about the Peace Corps, but scolded Kennedy for his impulsive actions. She did not appreciate how Kennedy dodged civil rights because it coexisted as “the domestic matter closest to her heart” and “angered her the most.” Roosevelt, “strongly supported Stevenson’s appointment to the ambassadorship of the United Nations.” Finally, according to Black, Kennedy asked, “her to chair his Presidential Commission on the Status of Women.” Roosevelt attempted to influence Kennedy opinion in a variety of ways, and stayed pro-active in many organizations throughout her last 20 months alive."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"December 11, 1958 - January 22, 1959","search_date":"1959-01-01","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":2469,"tag":"Eleanor Roosevelt"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":2703,"tag":"John F.

In 1991 they were invited to take part in what the <em>Los Angeles Times </em>termed “the biggest victory celebration since the end of WWII,” in Washington D.C. Despite opposition from some, the “overall mood was of jubilation” and the day was marked by a sense of “old-fashioned patriotism.”","            The conflict attracted significant levels of popular support which foreign interventions by the US had not achieved since the end of the Second World War; for the parade on June 9 1991, the U.S. Park Police estimated 800,000 people turned out in support. The parade represented a “display of the American military might” which had completed its action in the Persian Gulf in just one hundred hours. As Michael Cairo has highlighted, the First Gulf War represented a “decisive military campaign,” of which Americans could be proud.","            President George H.W. Bush shared in the celebratory spirit and highlighted the validity of US intervention on behalf of the Kuwaiti people. He spoke of the freedom which Kuwait could now enjoy because “’we dared risk our most precious asset, our sons and daughters.’” The Kuwaiti ambassador also expressed his gratitude for the American intervention, which had “ousted an Iraqi army from his homeland.” Those in attendance at the victory parade shared in this sense of moral justification as well as in the legal justification. As Majid Khadduri and Edmund Ghareeb have argued, by invading Kuwait, Iraq had violated the “United Nations’ law,” thus vindicating intervention by UN members.","            The majority of those in attendance on June 9<sup>th</sup> celebrated the quick and decisive conclusion of the campaign in the Persian Gulf; at just one hundred hours of engagement over a forty-three day period, it was a remarkably short conflict.

The Soviet Union (U.S.S.R) secretly placed missiles in Cuba in 1962 to support Fidel Castro’s administration against the United States. Castro and his rebels had overthrown the American-backed president and military dictator, Fulgencio Batista, in 1959.  After a failed invasion by Cuban exiles and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under the United States at Bay of Pigs in 1961, U.S.S.R. started to offer more military and economic support to Cuba. During the Cold War, U.S. and U.S.S.R. had many proxy conflicts in places like Berlin, Vietnam, and Korea, but the Missile Crisis was the first time nuclear weapons were involved and citizens of the U.S. were in serious danger. President John F. Kennedy of the U.S. and Nikita Khrushchev, the Prime Minister of U.S.S.R. wrote several letters over the thirteen days after the discovery of the missiles on October 16, 1962. Surprisingly, Khrushchev was willing to negotiate and make an agreement with Kennedy to promise no further invasions of Cuba and to remove the missiles in Cuba if the U.S. removes the missiles in Turkey and Italy.","The main reason for the agreement was to prevent a nuclear war. Both sides understood what was at risk, and both men acknowledged that war had to be prevented any way possible. If U.S.S.R. did not want a nuclear war, then why were the missiles placed in the first place? “…Solely for the purposes of defense, and we have sent them to Cuba at the request of the Cuban Government,” Khrushchev wrote in his letter to Kennedy on October 26, 1962. Khrushchev was writing the truth; Castro had asked for shipments of larger arms in the fall of 1961. According to Major Problems in American History Since 1945, written by Robert Griffith and Paula C. Baker, Khrushchev did not agree at first, but later did because it was vital to not lose Cuba to China or the U.S. As explained by Griffith and Baker, Cuba was U.S.S.R.’s “prime example” of how successful they were able to undermine capitalism through the liberation of less developed countries. Castro already began asking China for economic assistance. And most importantly Khrushchev knew that the U.S. was going to invade again because Cuba was to them as Hungary was to the U.S.S.R. Therefore, in order to keep Cuba in their camp, Khrushchev approved the delivery of the missiles on April 12. ","In the same letter Khrushchev also tried to clear up what he thought were President Kennedy’s and the U.S.’ misunderstanding about the missiles and in general, Communism. Even though Khrushchev criticized the U.S. policy and blamed it for invading Cuba in the first place, he still used this chance to explain the similarities between capitalism and Communism. “It is thus that we, Soviet people, and, together with US, other peoples as well, understand the questions of war and peace,” Khrushchev argued. Ernesto F. Betancourt, who worked for Castro during the Missile Crisis and was later a liaison with the Kennedy administration, argued in his paper, “Kennedy, Khrushchev, and Castro: A Participant's View of Cuban Missile Crisis,” that challenges imposed by Chairman Mao of China on Soviet leadership and ideology of Communism might have also affected his reason for agreement. Khrushchev could not risk starting a war with the U.S., when the U.S.S.R. was not on good terms with China, the second largest Communist country. ","Concluding his letter, Khrushchev called for a negotiation to cease the tension and ask for Kennedy’s agreement. It was clear that the missiles were placed in Cuba intentionally. Khrushchev wanted to use the missiles to make the U.S. back away from Cuba. Therefore, there was no need for any negotiation to occur between U.S. and U.S.S.R. However, Kennedy and the U.S. saw the missiles as an offense weapons and warned Khrushchev that the U.S. was ready to take action if nothing was done about the missiles. Thus, Khrushchev, who also wants to prevent a nuclear war, started to see the need to call for an agreement. It is possible that Khrushchev also used the missiles to trigger the U.S. to make an agreement to leave Cuba alone, but the agreement was made based on the common goal between the U.S. and U.S.S.R., which was to prevent a nuclear war in any way possible."],"display_date":"October 16, 1962 - October 28, 1962","search_date":"1962-10-22","locations":[{"id":52836,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":6,"place":"Washington DC"},{"id":52866,"lat":21.521757,"lng":-77.781167,"zoom":6,"place":"Cuba"},{"id":52877,"lat":61.52401,"lng":105.318756,"zoom":6,"place":"russia"}],"tags":[{"id":2862,"tag":"Cuban Missile Crisis"},{"id":1396,"tag":"Cuba"},{"id":2701,"tag":"Kennedy"},{"id":2861,"tag":"CIA"},{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":1727,"tag":"JFK"},{"id":2883,"tag":"Khrushchev"},{"id":2884,"tag":"Castro"},{"id":2885,"tag":"U.S.S.R."},{"id":2886,"tag":"Soviet"},{"id":2887,"tag":"Communist"}],"course":{"name":"JFK: Famine to New Frontier","school":"Marist College","course_id":151,"school_id":77}},{"id":6486,"title":"Carter Reacts to Sino-Vietinamese War","course_id":153,"status":"P","start_date":"1/29/79","end_date":"1/30/79","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["       On the afternoon of January 29 1979, the same day Chinese Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping arrived Washington D.C., President Jimmy Carter met with Deng and exchanged many important ideas about China-US relation.

However, Deng thought those were not enough. Deng believed that Vietnam was controlled by the Soviet Union, and he told President Carter he was considering a possible punitive strike against Vietnam. President Cater answered to Deng that “The United States had already joined the condemnation of Vietnam, but invasion of Vietnam was still a destabilizing action.” ","After the meeting with Deng, President Carter prepared and organized his words, and he gave an oral presentation to Deng on the next day about “why it would be a big mistake if China invades Vietnam.” However, it seemed that Deng did not take President Carter’s advice. The Sino-Vietnamese War began only ten days after Deng Xiaoping finished his trip to the United States. According to Dr. Kissinger’s book On China, President Carter was working on the human rights movement even before the election, so it was hard for him to support invasion at a country or support a government like the Khmer Rouge.

He is recognized as an innovator, communicator, and commander of the telegraph. Lincoln has been named writer of war, micromanager, and technophile. After analyzing a small collection of 10 telegrams dated from April 5, 1864 to February 15, 1865 one may question the argument for pardons granted by President Lincoln. This collection of telegrams illuminates a theme of pardons, stays, commutes, and suspensions of execution. The argument for pardons in this small collection of works was rooted in Lincoln’s use of his political authority and for political favor or gain, Lincoln’s desire to confirm or deny allegations against military personnel, and Lincoln’s belief in humanitarianism practice.","An interest of political favor or gain was the rationale behind a pardon in a telegram dated April 5, 1864. Governor Brough asked President Lincoln for the pardon of the soldiers of the 12th Ohio.(1) President Lincoln granted this request.(2) Governor Brough supported Lincoln’s Administration and war efforts. Brough was viewed as a man with strong ties to governors from the Midwest and President Lincoln valued this relationship. On furthering the argument of pardons for political favor Lincoln suspended executions of deserters on November 24, 1864.(3) This suspension of executions was seen as an act granted by Lincoln to gain political favor. Lincoln was the leader of the Republican Party, and he was a supporter of abolition. Even in times of war Lincoln attempted to unite the country by granting pardons to not only Union forces but Confederates as well.(4) On December 19, 1864, President Lincoln sent a telegram to Major General Wallace inquiring information about three Confederate troops.(5) Gaining political favor from the Union, as well as the Confederates, were of importance to Lincoln and therefore, he continued to grant pardons of interest. As the end of the Civil War was approaching, President Lincoln granted suspensions of execution in order to exercise his political authority and rights to grant clemency.(6) ","President Lincoln granted pardons on the basis of his desires to confirm or deny allegations of military personnel. On October 5, 1864, President Lincoln suspended the execution of Thomas K. Miller.(7) On January 20, 1865, President Lincoln suspended the death sentence of Thomas Samplugh.(8) This pattern of suspensions continued on February 12, 1865 when Lincoln commuted the death sentence of Lieutenant Samuel B. Davis.(9) Another instance of pardons occurred on February 15, 1865 when Lincoln suspended the execution of Luther T. Palmer and requested Palmer’s record for examination.(10) In each of these telegrams, President Lincoln granted suspensions and commutes to military personnel in order to confirm or deny allegations.","When pardons, stays, suspensions, and commutes were not being granted for political favor or further investigation, President Lincoln appeared to portray a humanitarian character. This act of humanitarianism was exhibited in four telegrams from June 28, 1864 to February 15, 1865. President Lincoln was aware of the number of lives lost during the war and therefore, he took his right to execute seriously, as not to increase the death toll. Amos Tenney was sentenced to death for desertion, yet President Lincoln suspended the execution to determine the severity of Tenney’s actions and make the executive decision as to whether or not another life lost was necessary.(11) The life of Thomas Samplugh was one of the many lives spared by President Lincoln.(12) Samplugh could have been another name on another grave, but Lincoln took his attention away from other war related matters to consider if death was the answer to Samplugh’s actions.(13) Hugh F. Riley(14) and Luther T. Palmer(15) were two more names among the many that President Lincoln chose to practice humanitarianism efforts by considering the severity of war, the role war plays on soldiers, and the value of each and every life whether that life be Union or Confederate.","The argument to pardon was not as simple as it seems and some of Lincoln’s reasons will continue to be unknown, but a thorough analysis of 10 telegrams provides insight and answers to the question at large—To Pardon? Why or why not? Lincoln chose to pardon name after name and his decision were based on various factors including Lincoln’s use of his political authority and for political favor or gain, Lincoln’s desire to confirm or deny allegations against military personnel, and Lincoln’s belief in humanitarianism practice."," ","(1) John Hay to John Brough, 5 April 1864, The Lincoln Telegram Project, The Henry E.

This telegram signified the start of the Lincolns' third summer at the Soldiers' Home, which would come to an end sometime in October and be their final summer at their family refuge, away from the chaos of life at the White House and of Civil War Washington, DC.","            In a letter Mary Todd Lincoln wrote to a friend asking her to visit the family in Washington, Mrs. Lincoln mentioned a desire for privacy and the ability of the Soldiers' Home to fulfill that need. She described the place as beautiful, one where they would be able to ride into the city every day and \"be as secluded as we please.\" In addition to the privacy, the Lincolns enjoyed receiving friends and guests. In another letter, Mrs. Lincoln wrote that it was “such a pleasure, especially, at such a charming place as this [the Soldiers' Home], to receive one's friends.” There are also accounts of President Lincoln finding relaxing moments and even transitioning seamlessly from work to rest in the comfort of the Soldiers' Home cottage. Lincoln's private secretary, John Hay, wrote in his diary: \"I went with [President Lincoln] to the Soldier's Home and he read Shakespeare to me . . . till my heavy eye-lids caught his considerate notice and he sent me to bed.\" Another account is found in Senator Orville Browning's diary: \" In the evening went out to Soldiers' Home . . . The President got home soon after we reached there. He asked me to sit down with him on the stone steps of the portico - then took from his pocket a map of Virginia . . . and gave me all the news he had from there.

While the political Lincoln may be difficult for us to acknowledge at a time when politics and partisan commitments are widely denigrated, Lincoln’s presidency demonstrates that partisanship and political ruthlessness can be used to advance the highest ideals.\"  In Philadelphia in 1864 that meant keeping Republicans in Congress.  As a case in point, Lincoln's involvement in the events surrounding  the 1865 U.S. House of Representatives election in Pennsylvania’s 4th district provides a perfect example."," ","On June 17th 1864 the New York Tribune printed an article claiming that Postmaster-General Blair had directed the Postmaster of Philadelphia, Cornelius A. Walborn, to instruct his employees not to vote for William D. “Pig Iron” Kelley (R) in the upcoming Congressional election for the 4th district of Pennsylvania.  The next day, Postmaster Walborn denied the allegations in the Tribune and Lincoln sent him a telegram requesting that he come to Washington to see the President.  On June 19th Judge Kelley writes Lincoln and explains that he believes the Tribune article to be correct and that furthermore, he can provide witnesses and would be happy to confront Walborn with Lincoln at the White House.  On June 20th Lincoln met with Postmaster Walborn and discussed the accusation made against him. During this interview, Lincoln clearly states that Walborn is to cease any interference in the upcoming election. "," ","Over one month later, on July 28th, Lincoln sent a telegram to John W. Forney requesting that he and Morten McMichael come to see him in Washington.  While the reason for the meeting can not be ascertained from the telegram itself, further investigation reveals a possible motive. John W. Forney, a Republican, was the current Secretary of the U.S. Senate and former Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives.  Morten McMichael was a successful Philadelphia newspaper editor and publisher, and future Republican mayor of Philadelphia.  By examining future correspondence between Lincoln and these two men, we are able to infer what they may have discussed. "," ","On August 3rd, six days after Lincoln's telegram to Forney, and four/five days after their meeting, Forney writes Lincoln from Philadelphia. In his letter, Forney alerts the president that postal workers in Philadelphia are being pressured into voting for someone they do not like, and it is not Judge Kelley, the Republican candidate. He urges the president to intervene in order to prevent political corruption from dictating the results of the upcoming election.  It can be inferred from that letter that Forney was sent to Philadelphia to investigate whether or not Walborn had ceased his earlier attempts to inappropriately influence voters. In addition to Forney’s letter, and arriving two days prior, Lincoln received a letter from Judge Kelley explaining that Walborn was still agitating against Kelley’s re-election to Congress."," ","Two days later on August 5th, Lincoln sends a message to Morten McMichael in which he asks him to convey the president's concerns to Postmaster Walborn and to remind Walborn that he promised the president that he was not interfering in the upcoming election.  Finally, four days later on August 9th, Lincoln receives from Walborn an assurance that he is faithfully upholding his promise to the president, even including a copy of the notice that has been hung in the Postmaster's office and in post offices under his control which explains that postal workers are free to vote for whomever they see fit.  This message to Lincoln from Walborn appears to settle the issue and we may infer that Lincoln was able to get Walborn back in line. "," ","In the coming election, Kelley is re-elected and he remained in office until 1890."],"display_date":"June 17, 1864 - August 9, 1864","search_date":"1864-07-13","locations":[{"id":52780,"lat":39.9550145,"lng":-75.1629427,"zoom":7,"place":"Philadelphia, PA"},{"id":52826,"lat":38.898623,"lng":-77.036535,"zoom":13,"place":"Washington D.C."},{"id":52909,"lat":40.7155044,"lng":-74.0066837,"zoom":8,"place":"New York, NY"}],"tags":[{"id":2969,"tag":"Lincoln Politics 1864"},{"id":2970,"tag":"Phil., PA Politics 1864"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6515,"title":"\"We haven't taken Washington, but we scared Abe Lincoln like hell.\" - Jubal Early, Confederate General","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-07-11","end_date":"1864-07-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["\"Cypher<em> War Department</em>","Washington City,","July 10---2.P.M. 1864 <br /> Lieut.

To distinguish between the professional and personal life of the president, especially one as iconic as Abraham Lincoln, can be difficult unless evidence such as the telegrams in the collection are left behind. Examining the personal telegrams of Lincoln is a great reminder that he was not only the most influential government official of his time, but he was also a devoted husband and father. "," ","According to the spreadsheet of the telegrams found here <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1unmkRu-VFr_CO-c_1WgRalnQS3RWpt7HI_hMH1ps0Cc/edit#gid=0\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1unmkRu-VFr_CO-c_1WgRalnQS3RWpt7HI_hMH1ps0Cc/edit#gid=0</a> , seven of the telegrams categorized as personal are addressed to either Mrs. Lincoln (Mary Todd) or Robert Lincoln, one of their four sons. Only one of those was addressed to Robert. As a young man who just graduated college and enlisted in the Union Army, frequent contact with his father would have been difficult. Of the six messages sent to Mrs. Lincoln, it is interesting that four of them mentioned their youngest son, Tad. "," ","Upon further investigation, one notes that in two of the four messages regarding Tad are to inform him of his pets’ well-being. As any young child, while Tad was away from the White House with his mother, he was worried about their condition. Although this collection does not include the messages from Mrs. Lincoln, one can assume one of two things: either Tad requested the knowledge of his animals or that Lincoln thought his youngest boy would enjoy the update. Either way, the messages to Mrs. Lincoln regarding the condition of the goats and pony reflect Lincoln’s character as a father. Young Tad was only eleven at the time these telegrams were sent; in today’s world, he would have been in sixth grade. Imagining that a sixth grader could comprehend the magnitude of the Civil War while it was actually happening makes the story that much more authentic. From these two messages left behind, the audience catches this iconic figure, who was caught up in the bloodiest war in American history, take a moment to update his youngest son of his beloved animals.

Although there is not much in each individual telegram, as one digs further into the topic, questions arise. What was the relationship between President Lincoln and his youngest son Tad? From the two that give insight on the nature of his pets, one can see that Lincoln cared a great deal for his son. He did not ignore his role as a father while executing the responsibilities of the executive office instead, he made sure to take time to bond with his youngest son."," ","Both Lincoln and his wife adored their boys, denied them nothing, and seldom disciplined them.

Robert, who then was six, remembered his mother's uncontrollable tears, the house draped in black, and the dark black circles around his father's eyes.

On the other side of the battle lines, the Union Army initially had trouble recruiting free black men after Lincoln's passage of the Emancipation Proclamation, but President Lincoln would never resort to allowing his men to illegally force African-Amercians, or anyone else for that matter, to join the Union Army against their will; however, even though the Union Army legally enlisted free black men in 1863, it's evident that illegal impressment into the Union Army occured. ","When President Lincoln got wind of news that Kentucky Major General George Thomas and his men were impressing African-Americans into his Union forces, he didn't hesitate to express his dissastication. On June 13, 1864, Lincoln sent a telegram to Thomas accusing his Kentucky Union forces of \"seizing negroes and carrying them off without their own consent and according to no rules whatever, except those of absolute violence.\" Lincoln probably wasn't surprised that such an act would be occuring in a border state like Kentucky. The people of Kentucky were often at odds over the issue of slavery and most Kentuckians were not opposed to the institution --even Major General George Thomas was born into a slave-owning family and wasn't particularly sympathetic to African-Americans. Slavery wouldn't be abolished in Kentucky until December 1865 and Kentucky Union forces probably resorted to impressing black soldiers when the enlistment of free black men weren't meeting their high demands. ","Regardless of the demand that Kentucky Union forces weren't meeting in their recruitment numbers, impressment would not be tolerated under Lincoln's command. Although African-American soldiers in the Union Army suffered from subpar treatment, conditions, and compensation compared to their white counterparts, President Lincoln was aware of these issues and fought to obtain equal pay for black soldiers and equal protection for black POWs who were often heavily mistreated by their Confederate captors. Consequently, it was during the same month that Lincoln scolded Major General George Thomas for impressing African-Americans that Congress granted equal pay for U.S. colored troops. As a leader that believed in projecting a good and just moral code upon his men, President Lincoln demanded in his telegram that Major General Thomas ensure \"making soldiers of negroes is done according to the rules you are acting upon, so that unneccessary provation and irritation be avoided.\" President Lincoln's direct correspondence over the matter of the impressment of black soldiers into the Union Army illustrates his compassion for African-Americans and his no tolerancy policy of impressment and unnecessary violence towards African-Americans."],"display_date":"June 13, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-13","locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":5,"place":"Washington D.C."},{"id":52914,"lat":38.2526647,"lng":-85.7584557,"zoom":5,"place":"Louisville, Kentucky"}],"tags":[{"id":2978,"tag":"Confederate"},{"id":2977,"tag":"Soldiers"},{"id":2976,"tag":"Telegram"},{"id":311,"tag":"Union"},{"id":1362,"tag":"Telegraph"},{"id":1677,"tag":"Black"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":701,"tag":"Lincoln"},{"id":2706,"tag":"Impressment"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6519,"title":"A Snapshot of Lincoln's Acts of Clemency In the Year of 1864","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-01-01","end_date":"1864-11-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the Civil War, Lincoln reviewed over 1600 cases of military justice. The largest single topic that can be found in Lincoln’s telegrams is the reviewing and answering of appeals of military court martial decisions, especially the pardoning of scheduled executions (The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln). Lincoln recognized the strategic potential of clemency during a time of war. He pardoned a considerable number of Union soldiers in a conscious effort to boost the morale of the Union’s fighting forces. Lincoln was also widely admired among Union troops because of the perception that he took a genuine interest in the their well-being. This perception was re-enforced with each pardon of a military offender (Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 1). ","This episode begins in early 1864 wherein Lincoln orders the War Department to commute the death sentence of deserters to confinement until the end of the war and to allow commanding generals to reinstate convicted deserts if it was thought that they would be of use to the service. Lincoln said,","<em>“They are the cases that you call by that long title cowardice in the face of the enemy, but I call them for short, my “leg cases.” But I put it to you, and I leave it for you, to decide for yourself: If Almighty God gives a man a cowardly pair of legs, how can he help their running away with him?\"</em>","(Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 1) ","Then on April 5th, 1864, Lincoln mitigated the sentences of groups of soldiers in a telegram in which, John Hay, on behalf of Lincoln, writes to Governor John Brough of Ohio, stating, “The President has ordered the pardoning of the soldiers of the 12th Ohio, in accordance with your request.” ","Favoring soldiers convicted of war crimes be put to hard labor, rather than they be executed, Lincoln had the sentence of Jesse Broadway commuted to three years hard labor in September of that year. According to John Hay, Lincoln states his rationale for clemency on these grounds,","<em>“I don’t believe it will make a man any better to shoot him, while if we keep him alive, we just may get some work out of him.\"</em>","As the year progressed, Lincoln continued to pardon soldiers and on November 3rd, 1864, Lincoln sent a telegram to the officer in command in Lexington Kentucky saying, “Suspend execution of Vance Mason until further order.” Earlier that day, Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin J. Spaulding had telegraphed Lincoln stating: “Vance Mason … on the charge of desertion is condemned to be shot on the sixth of this month. I pray you that you reprieve him or grant a respite until I can bring the matter before you in form. There are mitigatory circumstances about his case which I am sure will recommend him to your clemency.” Mason’s sentence was then suspended and he was given the option to return back into the army and serve out his enlistment term in the year of 1865. (Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, Volume 8) ","Lincoln would go on to offer more acts of clemency in the next, 1865.","Ruckman and Kincaid suspect Lincoln thrived on the hope that each request that he granted further educated a portion of the public as to the necessity of a clemency power in the justice system. Lincoln's extensive effort to provide numerous and explicit explanations for clemency decisions and his willingness to exercise the power upon the advice of individuals and mass public suggest that he may well deserve credit for having utilized one of the most unilateral and imperial of executive powers in the most democratic manner” (Ruckman and Kincaid 1999) Though Lincoln’s justifications for clemency are widely ranging, it can be ascertained from his words, his written word in telegrams, and through his actions, that adopting a policy of clemency in order to save the lives of Union soldiers whenever possible, was of great importance to Lincoln."],"display_date":"January 1, 1864 - November 3, 1864","search_date":"1864-06-02","locations":[{"id":52916,"lat":38.0405837,"lng":-84.5037164,"zoom":8,"place":"Lexington, KY"},{"id":52915,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"D.C."},{"id":52828,"lat":40.4172871,"lng":-82.907123,"zoom":8,"place":"Ohio"}],"tags":[{"id":2981,"tag":"Lincoln's telegrams"},{"id":2980,"tag":"1864"},{"id":2979,"tag":"lincoln's clemency"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6520,"title":"Union army receives heavy losses at Red River, Lincoln relieves Gen.

The target of the Union campaign was Shreveport, headquarters of a large Confederate force and capital of Confederate Louisicana. Union troops were commanded by Major General Nathaniel Banks, who was also a prominent Republican figure and a former speaker for the House of Representatives. However, despite Banks' political reputation, his battlefield tactices left much to be desired. Despite commanding a force of Union troops that heavily outnumbered the Confederates, the Union suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat. While the outcome of the Civil War appeared to be decided in favor of the union, this was the last decisive Confederate victory.","The failure of the Red River campaign was the last in which Banks had significant military command. Lincoln pushed to have Banks removed of his command and was eager to learn of his removal, sending a telegram on April 22, 1864 to General Mason Brayman in Louisiana that asked \"What day did General Corse part with Gen Banks?\". Shortly after being removed from his military duties, Banks was placed on leave in Washington D.C., where he proved to be an asset to Lincoln in the political arena, lobbying Congress to support the President's plans for reconstruction in Louisiana.","Even though Banks may have been over his head in terms of his military assignments, Lincoln did not hesistate to exercise his duties as Commander in Chief, and in some way, \"micromanage\" the assignments and leadership on the battlefields. The previous telegram illustrates how important this issue was to Lincoln, as he was eager in following up his interest in removing Banks from his command. The telegraph granted Lincoln powers that had never been used by a previous President. However, this instant form of communication and his authoratative style of managing his resources revolutionized the methods in which war is organized and executed by field generals and their commanders. "],"display_date":"April 9, 1864 - April 22, 1864","search_date":"1864-04-15","locations":[{"id":52917,"lat":32.0842949,"lng":-93.3792057,"zoom":8,"place":"Red River LA"},{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":2987,"tag":"Washington"},{"id":2986,"tag":"Louisiana"},{"id":2985,"tag":"Banks"},{"id":2984,"tag":"General"},{"id":2983,"tag":"Red Rivers"},{"id":2982,"tag":"Mansfield"},{"id":701,"tag":"Lincoln"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6527,"title":"Abraham Lincoln: The Limits to a Bleeding Heart","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-02-04","end_date":"1862-02-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Abraham Lincoln is sometimes viewed as a “bleeding heart” because he pardoned, commuted, or delayed sentencing for hundreds of soldiers sentenced to death for desertion or absenteeism. He soon earned a reputation among political leaders and military commanders for being “soft” on discipline by chronically interfering with military executions. Lincoln’s leniency did not go unnoticed or without criticism. The long list of political and military leaders who cautioned against or complained about Lincoln’s use of the military pardon included Butler, Sherman, Wells, Bates, Chase, and Stanton (1). Edward Bates, Lincoln’s first Attorney General, lamented that “why, if a man comes to [Lincoln] with a touching story his judgement is almost certain to be affected by it. Should the applicant be a woman…in 9 cases out of 10 her tears, if nothing else, are sure to prevail” (2). Lincoln was himself aware of his reputation as evident in his exchange with Congressman John Alley of Massachusetts that “you know my weakness it to be, if possible, too easily moved by appeals for mercy” (3).","Bleeding heart Lincoln was not necessarily quixotic in his use of the pardon. This shows up in his orders to suspend decisions on executions.  He often suspended executions until further notice. Many times he followed up an ordered suspension with a commutation or pardon. On first blush it appears that suspensions served to simply give Lincoln more time to make a more informed decision. When deciding a particular case, he states that “I must put this by until I can settle in my mind whether this soldier can better serve the country dead than living” (4).However, he seems to have employed suspensions as a stall tactic from which he had no intention of ever following up. For instance, Lincoln used this tactic on Job Smith whose father approached Lincoln with concern that his son had not been pardoned. Lincoln responded that “[…] I see you are not very well acquainted with me. If your son never looks on death till further orders come from me to shoot him, he will live to be a great deal older than Methuselah” (5). This suggests that Lincoln used the suspension as a de facto pardon in perhaps reaction to his critics.","Lincoln’s draconian side could come out from time to time. This is particularly evident in Lincoln’s refusal to pardon a convicted slave trader named Nathaniel Gordon. Lincoln denied requests from Congressman Alley of Republican-dominated Massachusetts and Rhoda White-- a wife of a New York judge and supporter of Lincoln—to pardon Gordon. Lincoln was terse in his response to Alley: “if this man were guilty of the foulest murder that the arm of man could perpetrate, I might forgive him on such an appeal, but the man who could go to Africa, and rob her of her children, and sell them into interminable bondage…can never receive pardon at my hands. NO! He may rot in jail before he shall have liberty by an act of mine” (6).  In upholding Gordon's executition to be held on February 21, 1862, Lincoln wrote that \"in granting this respite, it becomes my painful duty to admonish the prisoner that, relinquishing all expectation of pardon by Human Authority, he refer himself alone to the mercy of the Common God and Father of all men.\" Lincoln’s bleeding heart had at least one clear limit (7).","1.      Miller, W.

With no certainty of how long the nation would remain engaged in a bloody stalemate, the American citizens had the power to steer themselves out of political, militant, social and economic unrest. The Election of 1864 poised the Confederacy-backed Democratic Party against Republican and incumbent President Abraham Lincoln who endured a significant amount of the burden for causing the great divide between North and South, Union and Confederacy. This essay will use the recently digitized telegrams used in communication between Lincoln and his Union officials & colleagues to evaluate the mental state of the president through his writing style. Specifically, the telegrams with implications for Lincoln's reelection in 1864 will serve as the primary basis for analysis, although a myriad of other influences will be discussed in the evaluation of Lincoln's writing and mental health.","      One of the most salient factors that contributed to the nation's divide was slavery and its monetary ramifications for the agricultural economy of the South. Lincoln, above all, was a man who adhered to the law, no matter its accordance with morality and humanity. Moreover, though he is revered as \"The Great Emancipator,\" it is inaccurate to attribute the feat of abolition to Lincoln himself, especially given his 1860 campaign's promise to avoid interfering with slavery in states that already permitted its existence (Wilson). However, as President of the United States, he found that certain issues arising from the disagreement on slavery forced the nation into disarray and it was his job to restore order within, despite the unpopularity or disdain his efforts often attracted. In his inquiry of the treatment of African Americans in Kentucky, Lincoln telegraphed Major General Thomas to further investigate the matter (June 13, 1864). Thomas, a slave-owner, most likely did not oppose slavery, but was an authoritative figure within the Union Army and therefore was expected to follow moral, humane and, most importantly, lawful conduct. Lincoln, employing exculpatory yet urgent diction in his telegram, revealed no signs of confidence or understanding that this behavior was occurring but rather kindly warned the general that this matter must be fixed and prohibited immediately.","      Slavery was just one matter in which many disagreed with Lincoln's ideologies. In a telegraph sent to Governor of Indiana Oliver Morton, Lincoln communicated the need for the \"hundred day troops'\" advancement in search of strengthening General Sherman's campaign in Atlanta (May 21, 1864 (2)). Despite the high level of Lincoln's unpopularity at this point in time, the cooperation of government officials in several Union states in this matter represented the Union's agreement with Lincoln's war goals as well as a sense of political unity despite personal opinions. His writing remained formal, mannerly and optimistic, all of which contribute to this cooperation of government officials.","      One prominent characteristic observed through Lincoln's writing is the confidence he exhibits in all matters. As commander in chief, Lincoln asserts his authority through his communicative abilities (i.e., the telegram). No matter his receiver, his writing is almost always polite but urgent, noting a sense of importance in every matter he inquires about. The few exceptions to this observation reveal Lincoln's surmounting pressure to be reelected in a time of war and political/economic turmoil.","      First, in a telegram addressed to Major General Dixon (NY), Lincoln rebuked a New York-based newspaper for its publication of a \"false and suspicious proclamation\" that purported the President's plans in aiding the rebellious enemies (May 18, 1864 (2)). Not only is Lincoln's tone and vocabulary indicative of his frustration, but his orders for Dixon to seize military control of the publication establishment supports the reports of Lincoln having \"suppressed more than 300 newspapers\" during the war (Bulla, 2009).","      Similarly, in a letter to Horace Greeley (a NY newspaper editor), Lincoln first made explicit his \"disappointment\" in Greeley, feeling as he has been disrespected (July 15, 1864). Beyond this word choice, Lincoln's disappointment is apparent when he underlined two active verbs (send & bring). This illustrated the distinction between Lincoln's intentions and Greeley's actions regarding an obviously important conference between Lincoln and Confederate delegates. Lincoln's feeling of disrespect is then demonstrated by his decision to have his assistant John Hay manage this situation with Greeley rather than himself. Both of these outbursts occurred in 1864 and reveal Lincoln's recognition of the power of newspapers to report--and perhaps propagandize--information that could hinder the success of he and his administration, especially during a period of civil unrest.","      As the election drew closer, Lincoln still performed exceptionally as both a leader and a family man. Utilizing the telegram's immediacy, his constant communication with officials dispersed throughout the nation represented his desire to be involved in the decision-making process. This communication also allows for inferences to be drawn: Is his constant communication a sign of distrust in his appointed generals and officials? Has Lincoln become obsessed with the war efforts that he has neglected his other duties as President, husband & father?","      Many of his telegrams addressed to government officials and generals inquired about planned sentences & executions of war criminals, both Union and Confederates. Although he asked for many to be suspended or respited, it is not a compensation for his subordinates' lack of judgment but instead a thoughtful consideration of the implications that executions may hold for a politician who seeks reelection as POTUS. More often than not, Lincoln yearned to be included in the process but left the ultimate judgment in those directly involved, which is supported by his decision to allow Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and General Sherman determine how many soldiers can be released without weakening Sherman's position (October 13, 1864). Clearly, the soldiers who were released were of great political value to Lincoln and his administration now that they could vote in-person, but their absence in the field of battle was feared by Lincoln and therefore configured by Stanton & Sherman.","      In telegrams such as the ones dated September 8th, September 11th and October 11th of 1864, Lincoln's communicative efforts in family affairs is clear. Uncertain of Mrs. Lincoln receiving his first telegram to Vermont, he followed up three days later to report to his wife (now in NY) the updates of his health, their son Tad's goats, the death of a family friend and the travel of eldest son, Robert. A month later Lincoln reached out to Robert about their concern for his well-being and expressed his paternal instinct by planning to visit rather than depend on the communication that has helped he and the Union so much throughout the war. This observation is incredibly minute but highly indicative of the person Lincoln strived to be: involved.","      The legacy of Abraham Lincoln is one that people only dream of. He led a divided nation through a civil war and is credited with dismantling the institution of slavery. Yet, what few people realize is, some scholars have diagnosed him with depression. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) even uses him as a motivational story to encourage others who battle the disease today. In an interview, Joshua Shenk, author of <em>Lincoln's Melancholy</em> argues that Lincoln's battles with depression made him one of the best government officials (Cohen). Understanding that modern scholars believe the President Lincoln suffered from clinical depression changes the way one thinks about him. No where in this collection of telegrams does one find any sign of the magnitude of his mental health. Granted, they are short messages, it is impressive that if the diagnosis be correct, that Lincoln was able to exert power in an effective manner while still, in most cases, retain a sense of respect for the recipients.","      No matter the topic discussed or the role Lincoln played in each individual telegram, his dedication and consistency are irrefutable. Although some in-depth analyses of Lincoln's writing may reveal depression and other unappealing qualities overtime, this analysis proves that Lincoln maintained order and control in a time of disparity. Furthermore, his goals as president were too great to be achieved in one term and he craved a second term to help propel the country out of disunity, which is most apparent in his undaunted efforts to continuously bring an end to the war while securing his reelection as President of the United States. Lincoln's unwavering ability to communicate via the telegram proved advantageous for the Union in the Civil War. Moreover, his persistent awareness, kindness and generosity demonstrated through his writing revered him as a man of great respect, authority and leadership. At times, Lincoln revealed human-like symptoms of frustration, fear and uncertainty in his writing. However, with distance and countless responsibilities separating him from his family and blatantly different opinions dividing the nation, President Lincoln failed to surrender. In a time of absolute chaos, two-term President Abraham Lincoln prevailed as a political, economic and social reformer committed to restoring the United States of America."],"display_date":"May 18, 1864 - November 8, 1864","search_date":"1864-08-13","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":5,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":2996,"tag":"Telegram communication"},{"id":683,"tag":"Abraham Lincoln"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":2980,"tag":"1864"},{"id":1875,"tag":"Presidential Election"},{"id":3021,"tag":"Writing Style"}],"course":{"name":"Digital History and Pedagogy","school":"North Carolina State University","course_id":159,"school_id":30}},{"id":6529,"title":"Lincoln: Mastermind in Chief","course_id":159,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-07-02","end_date":"1864-07-02","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Abraham Lincoln was an apparent genius. He had the ability to tend to a country divided by political differences and opinions, act as a commander in chief, and skillfully direct generals. He did this concomitantly as he anticipated the needs of the war effort, used the most advanced and up-to-date technology to communicate orders, and tended to the matter of humanity. Combined, this assets point to his almost superhuman-like quality of leadership. In order to see this in action one simply needs to examine and analyze President Lincoln’s Daily Agenda and communications through telegraph to various entities. Our focus will primarily be on the 2nd of July 1864.","On July 2nd 1864 Abraham Lincoln had quite a full day. His activity, to our knowledge, began at 7:50 am with two telegrams to Honorable D. Davis and Honorable S.H. Treat.[1] He was seeking each man's \"summary of the evidence, with [their] impression, on the Coles County [Illinois] riot cases.\" The background story on this is that on March 28, in Charleston, members of the 54th Illinois Infantry clashed with area Democrats and a riot ensued. Nine people died, including six soldiers and three citizens. Twelve people were wounded. [2] Sending out these telegraphs was only the start to a very full day for President Lincoln. But in the first two telegraphs of the day he has already dealt with, at least in a small portion, political differences that divide the country. We can see as he moves from each part of his day to the next that this is not just haphazard but masterfully planned.","Lincoln seems aware that every minute of his day counts as well as his every action. According to reports of Lincoln’s daily agenda, he also confers with Cong. Julian (Ind.) on power of Congress to confiscate landed estates of Confederates. [2] Here Lincoln is moving to political issues that again could ultimately prove divisive in a future reconciliation. Also, the records show that Lincoln transmits to Senate information regarding African slave trade. This shows that Lincoln was forward thinking and not just in the moment.","In addition to his growing agenda, he met with Former Sen. Fessenden (Maine), who was newly nominated to the position of secretary of treasury. According to sources, it was a “long interview with President at White House.” [2] No office was too small for Lincoln’s attention and here he is careful to masterfully choose and place people in authority that he wanted and sometimes needed in so he could move forward with his war machine. Continuing in his ability to operate as a genius leader he speaks directly with Gen. Meigs regarding Ft. Leavenworth [2] which is key at this point to the Union cause. Lincoln puts on his commander-in-chief hat here to make sure that things are going according to plan. Next, the President approves an act granting lands to aid in construction of railroad and telegraph line from Lake Superior to Puget's Sound on Pacific coast. This is a military move that will help Lincoln secure an eagle eye view of the country and put him with in the heat of conflict in moments. It was also a genius move as it is giving Lincoln a legacy of being a builder of infrastructure and a president who ultimately wants his country to be technologically advanced. While all of this has gone in one day of President Lincoln’s life, he is still a husband and a father; hence, he must attend to the needs of his family. On this particular day, Mrs. Lincoln and Robert arrive home from an assumed extended trip. The President knows he must tend to his own family as well so he and the family begin summer residence at Soldiers' Home.","By looking at his July 2nd agenda as president, one can see that Lincoln had to be a mastermind. As president he was simultaneously contemplating the decisions he had to make concerning a country divided by political differences, acting as a commander in chief, and skillfully directing generals.

National Security Action Memorandum 196 established the ExComm to ensure effective decision making during the crisis. Arthur Schlesinger Jr. stated that it was during the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis when the world came closest to nuclear war. The memorandum called for Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy, and Army General Maxwell Taylor, including others, to gather in the Cabinet Room of the White House. Robert Kennedy had no experience in foreign policy crisis, but was a member because the President trusted him.","Before Kennedy’s presidency, the US was an enemy of Cuba and its leader, Fidel Castro. The Eisenhower administration trained anti-Castro Cuban exiles for a CIA-backed invasion of Cuba. That invasion, known as the Bay of Pigs, failed in April of 1961 under the Kennedy Administration, which further worsened Cuban-US relations. According to Schlesinger, Kennedy lost trust in his Joint Chief of Staffs and said, “If we do what they want us to do, none of us will be alive later to tell them that they were wrong.” Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, persuaded Castro to accept nuclear missiles to deter US aggression, starting the Cuban Missile Crisis","Kennedy was interested in removing the missiles from Cuba without military intervention, but he struggled with the idea that such a demand might lead the US into a nuclear war. Historian David Gibson stated that the ExComm discussed a diplomatic approach, in which the US would withdraw their medium-range ballistic missiles from Italy and Turkey and/or withdraw from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for the withdrawal of Soviet missiles in Cuba. The ExComm suggested a naval blockade to prohibit more weapons from entering Cuba. Advisors recommended more aggressive solutions, such as airstrikes on missile sites in Cuba, airstrikes on a variety of military targets in Cuba, and an invasion of Cuba.","During meetings, CIA officials briefed the ExComm on new intelligence about the missiles and the locations of Soviet ships and submarines, but there were no formal agendas. Gibson stated that Kennedy was the chief decision maker and recipient of all information. Kennedy asked advisors about surveillance, logistics, and military tactics. He analyzed each advisor’s answer and then probed them with follow up questions. For example, Kennedy wanted to know how quickly ground soldiers could invade Cuba following airstrikes. McNamara and Taylor clarified that it would take seven days of airstrikes, followed by eleven days of invasion until 90,000 soldiers would be in Cuba. The ExComm had sharp disagreements and criticized each other, but as Robert Kennedy said, “everyone had an equal opportunity to express himself and to be heard directly.” However, the anger and criticism of the men stemmed from the situation where a wrong recommendation could mean the end of the human race. The Cuban Missile Crisis ended on October 28, 1962 when President Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed that the missiles would be returned to the USSR in exchange for the US to pledge they would not invade Cuba again.  ","During a joint conference on the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1992, General Anatoly Gribkov of the USSR declared that 43,000 Soviet soldiers were in Cuba during the crisis. In addition, Soviet soldiers were equipped with short-range tactical nuclear weapons and were authorized to use them if communications with Moscow were severed. However, during the crisis, the CIA estimated only 10,000 Soviet soldiers and the ExComm had no knowledge of the tactical nukes. The ExComm’s thoughtful deliberation paid off. According to Schlesinger, the American invasion of Cuba could have been the start of a “global holocaust.”"," "],"display_date":"October 22, 1963 - October 28, 1963","search_date":"1963-10-25","locations":[{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":7,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":3071,"tag":"ExComm"},{"id":3070,"tag":"Robert F.

The speech consisted of Kennedy’s support to fund civil defense programs in the event of a nuclear attack by the USSR. The failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April created more tension between the US and USSR. The American public knew the devastation caused by nuclear bombs from Japan, yet the US lacked domestic civil defense systems because previous plans, according to Kennedy, “have been so far-reaching and unrealistic that they have not gained essential support.” Studies on the effects of radioactivity by the Department of Defense (DOD) encouraged the Kennedy Administration to support civil defense. Scientists and doctors warned the DOD of the biological effects of radiation from a nuclear attack, such as leukemia, bone cancers, and genetic mutations. These scientific insights invited a response which rationalized implementing civil defense measures.","Kennedy conceded that civil defense programs would be costly; he estimated that the budget “will in all likelihood be more than triple the pending budget requests; and they will increase sharply in subsequent years.” He also stated that civil defense would not prevent nor would it provide complete protection against a nuclear attack. According to Kennedy, what was preventing a nuclear attack was the retaliating attack by the US, known as Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD). Nevertheless, Kennedy claimed that civil defense acts as insurance- hopefully never to be used, but available just in case. His plan to build up the nation’s civil defence consisted of identifying the current fallout shelters and then adding shelters in government and private buildings. Using executive power, Kennedy assigned the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, to carry out the plan, since McNamara was already responsible for “continental defense.”","Kennedy conveyed that fallout shelters would save lives in the event of a nuclear attack, therefore implementing civilian security measures was worthwhile. During the initial blast of a nuclear bomb, a shelter kept its inhabitants alive when radioactivity debris was at its peak level. According to findings by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), survivors of a nuclear attack would still suffer from deadly amounts of radiation, since shelters only provided a finite amount of time before people must exit them. The integrity of civil defenses against a nuclear attack was questionable. It was expected that every child born after a nuclear war would suffer from genetic mutation. The AEC’s studies suggested that Kennedy’s plan would more so delay than prevent the loss of life. But even so, Kennedy believed some level of civil defense was better than none at all, even if the civil defenses provided a false sense of security.","Kennedy was a strong supporter of civilian defense; one reason being he thought he would never be forgiven if civilians were defenseless against a nuclear attack. He addressed how the unpredictable outcomes of war required effective measures to ensure civilian deaths would be limited. Kennedy reiterated that the insurance civilian defense provided would be worth the time, money, and effort. Unsurprisingly, Kennedy did not mention the social effects of constructing more fallout shelters. A move by the President to build more shelters could give the message that a nuclear attack was imminent, thus encouraging fear rather than a sense of protection. President Eisenhower opposed civil defense not only because of the cost, but because “too much preparation would demoralize Americans.” On the contrary, Kennedy’s perspective was to prepare for the worst scenario, but hope for the best outcome."],"display_date":"May 25, 1961","search_date":"1961-05-25","locations":[{"id":52779,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC"}],"tags":[{"id":2703,"tag":"John F.

The fact of the matter is that Birmingham is in worse shape than any other city in the United States and it’s been that way for a year and a half.” John F. Kennedy gave this statement on May 4, 1963 to twenty members of the organization, Americans for Democratic Action, after <em>The New York Times</em> released Bill Hudson’s photograph of a police dog lunging at a black civil rights protestor. Thanks to Kennedy’s secret taping system installed in the White House, this conversation and many more were recorded and eventually released to the public."," There were a total of six United States’ Presidents between 1940 and 1973 that secretly recorded their conversations in the White House. Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Dwight Eisenhower had previously recorded only a limited amount of conversation. When John F. Kennedy came into office, he changed that pattern. According to historian Bruce Schulman, in July of 1962, Kennedy secretly installed an elaborate taping system with concealed microphones in Cabinet Room light fixtures and in the desk of the Oval Office. When he flipped a switch, the hidden microphones transmitted to a reel-to-reel recorder in the White House basement. Both Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon continued with this system when they were in office after Kennedy’s assassination.","            Between 1962 and his assassination in 1963, Kennedy recorded hundreds of his meetings and conversations in the White House. These recordings included information regarding Kennedy’s thoughts on the Cuban Missile Crisis, space, civil rights, and the importance of Berlin to American diplomacy. They also demonstrated the key role that his advisors played in decision-making. Many advisors suggested both interesting and creative ideas in the recordings, one example being the Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who gave a detailed summary of three possible responses to the Cuban Missile Crisis.","            The 1992 passage of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act required all government archives to open records concerning Kennedy's death. As a result, not only the assassination tapes, but also Kennedy’s secret tapes, mainly on the Cuban Missile Crisis, were released. Although the tapes were often fuzzy and individuals mumbled in certain areas, skilled court reporters, audio forensics experts, and editors made sense of the recordings and produced transcripts of them. The Federal Government also released Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon’s tapes to the public.","            The release of the recordings excited media and historian experts alike. They not only provided a unique look into John F. Kennedy’s Presidency, but they revealed the process of high-level decision-making. Historian and Nixon tape editor, Stanley I. Kutler, believed the tapes presented the best opportunity to examine past presidencies: “Here, we have both exceptional candor and a practiced level of deceit; the display of a constant calculus of political considerations; the exhibit of raw, human emotions; and, above all, the revelations of extraordinary, illegal, seemingly unprecedented presidential behavior and power.”"],"display_date":"July 1, 1962 - November 22, 1963","search_date":"1963-03-12","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":2,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3075,"tag":"White House"},{"id":2703,"tag":"John F.

The act authorized the federal Department of Health and Human Services to maintain and establish clear property rights for both deceased human corpses and living donors with regards to organ donation and transplantation. These rights meant that there would be a federal ethical standard when it came to receiving money as an incentive to donate organs and ensured that no one person would be able to make a profit from the practice.","The National Organ Transplantation Act’s structure is categorized into four titles; ","Title I - Task Force on Organ Procurement and Transplantation","Title II - Organ Procurement Activities","Title III - Prohibition of Organ Purchases","Title IV - Miscellaneous"," The document, under Title III states “It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce”. If this law is broken, repercussion can lead to fines of up to $50,000 dollars. The main goal of this regulation was to keep organs from ending up on the black market. Compensating donors could lead to a downward spiral for the organ transplant system as we know it., and lead to a system where organization and equality does not exist and third party individuals may even make commissions or profits from organs sold. The ethical concern for respecting human body parts or deceased remains was an upmost concern of legislators in Congress."," The shortage of organs was at an all-time high in 1983 and the demand for transplantation was growing at an accelerated speed. The National Organ Transplantation Act provided a solution to the problem and established a structure for the United States transplantation system, along with influencing other systems by setting a precedent around the world. "," NOTA established the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) as a system or framework for organ donation. This system is in part reputable and maintained due to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS). The goal of UNOS is to maintain a system where the trend is to increase the number of transplants yearly while shrinking the wait list for organs. UNOS sought to improve outcomes of wait-listed organ recipients and donors or matches who are donating their organs to family members or strangers."," The National Organ Transplantation Act, while holding much weight in ethical standards and consideration for the future of the donor/recipient, has undergone much scrutiny over the past thirty years for not being progressive and for taking away organ donors’ financial incentive. The argument is that it can be virtually impossible for elective donors to donate because they are unable to take off from work for recovery, hence why compensation may be an incentive to shrink the organ waiting list. Advocates for NOTA believe that UNOS is involved in making the transplantation process a smooth one with fair and equal opportunity for all in the who participate in the process such as the donor, recipient, even family members who are directly related."," "],"display_date":"October 19, 1984","search_date":"1984-10-19","locations":[{"id":52836,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington DC"}],"tags":[{"id":3094,"tag":"Act"},{"id":3093,"tag":"Organ Donor"},{"id":3092,"tag":"Organ Transplant"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":162,"school_id":43}},{"id":6568,"title":"The King of the Road","course_id":162,"status":"P","start_date":"10/16/12","end_date":"10/16/12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As motorcycle riding became popular in the early twentieth century, so too did endurance contests and races. Harry Ward, the author of a<em> </em>1912<em> Washington Times</em> article, provided a glimpse into motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson’s integral role in building bikes for endurance rides. On Sunday, October 13, 1912, Washington area motorcycle enthusiasts participated in the National Capital Motorcycle Club’s endurance race. As the article noted, unlike in previous years, inclement weather had a significant affect on the number of participants in the event. Still, nine riders participated in the first endurance run. To no one’s surprise, the two Harley-Davidson motorcycles in the race finished with perfect scores. ","Harley-Davidson became an icon for perfect scores in endurance races. According to Ward, the world famous Harley-Davidson motorcycle became known as “The King of the Road,” and even more, gained a positive reputation as “100% Perfect,” or “The Greatest Endurance Motorcycle on the Market.” Harley-Davidson motorcycles had earned a perfect 1,000 point score at the Seventh Annual Federation of American Motorcyclists Endurance and Reliability Contest just four short years earlier, which only added to the prestige that this American motorcycle manufacture has already earned.","Harley-Davidson quickly emerged as a builder of reliable, quality motorcycles after Milwaukee residents William S. Harley and Arthur and Walter Davidson started it in a shed in 1903. Not long after, the company adopted a logo that would become recognizable just about anywhere, the “Bar & Shield,” which was created in 1910. The firm concentrated on building reliable machines that could handle endurance rides. The perfect finish that a couple of Harley-Davidson riders earned in Washington on October 14, 1912, came as no surprise. Originally, Harley-Davidson started out with a single cylinder engine, as that is what they could fit on the bike frame. It would not take long for the team to introduce an engine that would be able to produce more power; therefore adding a second cylinder, the v-twin. Named for the 45-degree angle at which the cylinders were configured, this design would become an icon of the Harley-Davidson motorcycle. The firm’s v-twin model, which came out it 1909, proved to be quite successful. As business ramped up with each subsequent event victory, so did the need for a much larger manufacturing facility. The small shed producing motorcycles in Milwaukee in 1903 soon grew into a six-story manufacturing facility. The factory manufactured bikes, as well as spare parts and accessories. Not only did the American motorcycle manufacturer gain immense popularity in the United States, they also secured their first export to Japan in 1912. ","Harry Ward’s article in October of 1912 not only shed light on just how popular the “King of the Road” would become, but helped to publicize the dependability that this machine offered in endurance races. Constantly looking for new innovative designs, Harley-Davidson upped the ante with their iconic v-twin motor and offered spare parts, which was a first for the company. By branding the motorcycle with distinct “Bar & Shield” logo, people would begin to associate Harley-Davidson with endurance and victory. Dominating the industry, and a true recognition of their reliability, Harley-Davidson became a major supplier to the military. In fact, in WWI more than half of the motorcycles produced by Harley-Davidson were purchased by the military. Motorcycle clubs began to pop up everywhere, and to this day, the legendary Harley-Davidson continues to flood the market with remarkable success."," "],"display_date":"October 16, 1912","search_date":"1912-10-16","locations":[{"id":52950,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":3100,"tag":"Harley-Davidson"},{"id":3098,"tag":"Harley Davidson"},{"id":3099,"tag":"Motorcycle"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":162,"school_id":43}},{"id":6604,"title":"Congress Overrides Johnson's Veto and Passes the Tenure of Office Act","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-03-02","end_date":"1/1/27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 2, 1867 Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, as it intended to prevent the President from removing members of office without the approval of the Senate.

Lastly, the Act made it clear that if anyone breaks the provisions set forth, they will be engaging in a high misdemeanor; they would be placed on trial, fined, and possibly imprisoned.

He committed to spreading democracy to counteract the perceived Communist threat from the Soviet Union, and because of this, he sought to make NATO successful. Should Eisenhower run for nomination, Walter Trohan reported to the <em>Chicago Tribune,</em> he expected Eisenhower “to support foreign policy, especially as it relates to maintaining the victory won in Europe where he was war time supreme commander.”","Unfortunately for the Republican Party, as the Supreme Commander of NATO, Eisenhower felt duty required him to abstain from running for President. In addition to Taft, Harold Stassen, Earl Warren, and Theodore McKeldin planned to campaign for president, but the internationalist Republicans did not believe any of them could take the nomination away from Taft. They wanted Eisenhower.","The “Draft Eisenhower” Campaign started years before. As early as 1947, President Harry Truman offered to step aside for General Eisenhower to run as the Democratic candidate, with Truman as his running mate. At the time, Eisenhower said ‘no.’ Four years later, Truman again asked Eisenhower if he would run, and again Eisenhower refused. In response, Eisenhower secretly made the offer to Taft.","Meanwhile, moderate Republicans Henry Cabot Lodge and Thomas Dewey asked Eisenhower to run for president on the Republican ticket. Eisenhower, like George Marshall and George Patton, believed generals should be nonpartisan, to maintain the professionalism of the military officer corps. Because of this nonpartisan pledge, Eisenhower never voted in a presidential election until 1948, after he retired.","Eisenhower maintained he had no desire to be president. In March 1952, his conversation with Herbert Brownell, former campaign planner for Dewey, changed his mind. Brownell told Eisenhower that Taft was the frontrunner for the Republican Party, and if Eisenhower wanted the nation to pursue internationalist policies, he must run. After decades of Democratic presidents, the country would likely vote for change. In 1951, Stalin announced the Soviet Union had a hydrogen bomb; by 1952, the cease-fire talks with Korea deadlocked.

Young African Americans in Birmingham, Alabama publicly, peacefully, protested against racial discrimination and segregation. For eight days, Birmingham authorities, led by the Public Safety Director, Eugene “Bull” Connor, responded to the protest by attacking the youngsters with police dogs and fire hoses. The public was horrified at the sight of the police officers brutally beating children, people knocked off their feet by the spray of high-pressure fire hoses, and police dogs biting young protestors.","On the evening of June 11, Kennedy made a nationally televised address in which he made his case for civil rights legislation that would end legalized racial discrimination and segregation. On that same evening, segregationist Byron De La Beckwith gunned down the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Mississippi Field Director Medgar Evers in the driveway of his Jackson, Mississippi home.","After the Civil War, a two-tiered society emerged in the South. The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Plessy <em>vs.</em> Ferguson (1896)—which legalized racial discrimination and segregation under the “separate but equal” doctrine (also known as Jim Crow)—encouraged the recalcitrant Southerners. The Plessy decision forced African Americans to live under Jim Crow until a few young lawyers from the NAACP finally broke the foundation of the Plessy decision. In May 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the NAACP and their clients in Brown <em>vs.</em> Board of Education, which ended the separate but equal doctrine—after 58 years.","Between 1954 and 1964, numerous violent clashes occurred leaving many dead before Johnson signed the Act into law. Johnson, a southerner himself, was <em>not</em> an early supporter of new civil rights legislation. After Kennedy’s assassination in November 1963, Johnson reluctantly picked up the mantle of civil rights, eventually making the cause his own, after he rammed the bill through Congress. Johnson told several of his aides that “by pushing the Civil Rights Bill through Congress, I have delivered the South to the Republicans.”","Deeply troubled about his election possibilities, Johnson continued his campaign for the presidency. He defeated Republican Senator Barry Goldwater, who voted <em>against</em> the Act, in a landslide victory. However, that victory cost the Democratic Party.

Saunders Redding published an opinion piece on the G. I. Bill of Rights in a column he wrote for <em>The Baltimore Afro-American</em> newspaper. African Americans who served in the segregated Armed Forces returned home from WWII to an equally segregated American society. Redding worried whether “colored men and woman would take advantage of its [G. I. Bill] provisions\" because military officials were discouraging black veterans from applyiing for benefits or not telling them about the benefits at all.  Redding’s fears reflected segregation in the South, where African Americans could not use the same bathrooms, dine with, or attend leisure events with white people. When white veterans discussed the newly passed G. I. Bill, African American veterans were not present. African Americans could not begin to receive veteran’s aid without the knowledge that such a program existed and how to apply for it.","The G. I. Bill did not have any explicit language in it that prevented African Americans from receiving its aid, but the segregation of American society made it likely that African American veterans would not get their share of veteran’s benefits. The bill offered four main benefits to veterans: business and home loans, education, unemployment compensation, and job placement. Policy makers designed these aspects of the bill to help veterans returning from WWII acclimate into society. However, when informed African American veterans went to local Veteran’s Administration centers for their G. I. Bill benefits, the administrators denied them their rights. The administrators covered up the racist denials with excuses that African American veterans did not qualify for veteran’s benefits based on the type of discharge order they received from the army. Only dishonorably discharged soldiers could not receive aid, but racist clerks at V. A. centers told African Americans their “general” or “blue” discharges were considered dishonorable.","In order to combat this inequality of civil rights, Redding urged newspapers and organizations to “put out a statement of what the bill means” so Americans, not just African American veterans, would understand that there was an aid bill and that the bill should apply to African Americans in addition to all other veterans. Denying African Americans the G. I. Bill aid would be harder for the local V. A. centers if more people knew about the bill and vocalized equality for African Americans.","Redding was an educated African American man with a degree in philosophy and held a respected opinion on contemporary African American thought. Redding supported WWII and hoped that it would change America in a way that would further the fight for African American’s civil rights. Redding’s column – A Second Look - vocalized his opinions on the problems and concerns of the common African American person and how to take action against them. Redding wanted to spread knowledge to help gain civil rights for African Americans.  "],"display_date":"June 22, 1944 - June 24, 1944","search_date":"1944-06-23","locations":[{"id":5927,"lat":39.2903848,"lng":-76.6121893,"zoom":8,"place":"BALTIMORE, Maryland"},{"id":52826,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":242,"tag":"WWII"},{"id":225,"tag":"Jim Crow"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":3225,"tag":"G.

The document goes on to describe the laws that were put in place to protect and enforce anti-slavery and some of the consequences if these laws were not followed. Also contained in this document are a few responses to the emancipation of slaves put in place by president Abraham Lincoln. While examining this document, it is proven that the emancipation of slaves created a gateway. The African American race was finally able to fight for what they believed in without a rather gruesome consequence such as a “whipping”. To Colored Men describes the beginning of freedom for the African American race and the opportunities that were received due to the emancipation of 1863.  ","On page one of the document, Abraham Lincoln gives a brief statement about how the government should provide protection for its citizens. When Lincoln made the statement, he was referring to every citizen regardless of race, class, or condition. Even though Lincoln said that all citizens should be protected, he emphasized the protection of one specific group, U.S soldiers. The emancipation meant absolutely no slavery, so if an enemy were to enslave a person because of his color, there would be brutal retaliation. The enemy were to remain enslaved until the person(s) of color were released.","As the document progressed, some of Lincoln’s servants responded to this new tactic referred to as “man for man”. For example, contained in one of the responses is a situation involving the capture of  three black soldiers. In the response, Lincoln’s loyal servant agreed to keep three rebel soldiers imprisoned until the others are freed.  During this time there was a zero tolerance policy on slavery. Retaliation had became the biggest practice of military forces in the year of 1863. Edwin M. Stanton made the statement  “ ..retaliation will be our practice now-man for man- to the bitter end.”. This statement meant that as long as their men were held captive, the more retaliation would be brought upon opposing forces. This also meant that they didn’t care about what the outcome would be, regardless they would still retaliate for their captured soldiers.","After the tactics and philosophy of the army were described, the document began to explain the benefits that African Americans would receive if  they had chosen  to enlist in the armed forces. When examining this section of the document, it seemed as if African Americans were treated the same as the Caucasian American. In reality they were. They received the same pay and the same benefits as the white males during this time. Some of the benefits are still provided to soldiers today. For example if a soldier were to be severely injured or to die, he and his family would receive “pensions” from the armed forces. They were even paid while enlisted regularly.","Also around this time, African Americans were some of the most fierce soldiers to step foot on a battlefield. For example, there was the Battle of  Honey Springs, Arkansas. The battle was between the First Kansas Colored Regiment and the 20th Texas Regiment.  The outcome of the battle was very unexpected. An army of colored soldiers took on an army that was twice its size. The Texas Regiment went into the battle with 300 soldiers and came out with 60. Through all of the times that African Americans were degraded, they had finally showed how strong and powerful they can be. It took a long time for the African American race to get to this point in history. This also proves that they had beat the odds and had that they are more than just a peasant or slave; they were warriors.","After examining To Colored Men, it can be said that this document explains the events following the emancipation of slaves along with the opportunities that came with it. The emancipation of slaves opened up many doors for the African American race. After the slaves were finally free, they showed people of  the U.S what they really were capable of. They fought in the armed forces and they never backed down despite their low number of soldiers that they had. This was the beginning of freedom for African Americans. The document comes to show that African Americans were in fact strong and that they were warriors.  African Americans had made great progress after gaining freedom, but there was more to come in their later years."],"display_date":"January 1, 1863 - January 1, 1888","search_date":"1875-07-02","locations":[{"id":52950,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, DC, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":2824,"tag":"Charles Sumner"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":98,"tag":"Emancipation Proclamation"},{"id":3252,"tag":"1863"},{"id":3253,"tag":"Colored Troops"},{"id":3254,"tag":"Enlistment Poster"},{"id":3255,"tag":"Recruitment Poster"},{"id":3256,"tag":"Edwin M.

He went to the military academy of West Point where, due to an administrative error, his name was put in as Ulysses S. Grant and his classmates began calling him Sam. Graduating 21<sup>st</sup> in a class of 39 he was not an exceptional student.  Indeed, he was not expected to become the commander of the Army of the Potomac due to his standings in school."," He was first noticed for his leadership in the Mexican War of 1846-1848 where he was awarded three awards two of which were for gallantry and one was for meritorious conduct. After the war had ended, he was forced to be stationed far from his family in remote regions. Drinking became his way to pass time which lead to him being viewed poorly. In 1854 He resigned from his position in the military to avoid being kicked out.","Grant, having to fall back onto his family to survive, moved to St. Louis, Missouri. He made many attempts to keep his family afloat in society being a farmer and other odd jobs. Eventually he was forced to move to his family’s business in Galena, Illinois where he took up the position of a clerk at the store. The Civil War began in 1861 and Grant rushed to join and regain his lost glory.","            First, he was stationed as a colonel of the 21<sup>st</sup> Illinois Infantry. Grant proved himself a great leader which allowed for him to climb in the ranks. Quickly he managed to gain the brigadier general in July 1861 then, in September was given command of the whole Distract of Southeast Missouri. In 1862 Grant earned the nickname “Unconditional Surrender” after his success in western Tennessee at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson.","After being recognized for his excellent military prowess Grant was promoted to lieutenant-general and the next day took command of the Army of the Potomac. Grant arrived in Washington saying “It had been my intention before this to remain in the West, even if I was made lieutenant-general; but when I got to Washington and saw the situation it was plain there here was the point for the commanding general to be.” General Meade was the previous commander of the Army and even suggested that Grant replace him in his command with a general he knew better from the west. This changed Grants view of Meade for the better stating “It is men who wait to be selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may always expect the most efficient service.”","April 6<sup>th</sup> 1862 Grant suffered great losses at the Battle of Shiloh after being overpowered by 40,000 confederate soldiers on the first day of fighting. They fell back to a defensive position on a road the position was known as the “Hornet’s Nest” the rebels were not able to break the position and their general, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, was mortally wounded and was replaced by P.G.T. Beauregard. On April 7<sup>th</sup>, Federal reinforcements came and helped overwhelm the Confederates. This was the bloodiest battle in the United States history at that point and caused many to call for Grant to be removed from command President Lincoln defended him saying “I can’t spare this man. He fights.”","Like any military campaign, Grant had his victories and losses. Grant taking over command of the Army of the Potomac was important for not only showing his strength but also the strength of the union. Without Grants aggressive offensives and leadership the Civil War could have lasted much longer."," "," "," "],"display_date":"April 27, 1822 - April 9, 1865","search_date":"1843-10-18","locations":[{"id":53022,"lat":43.9109016,"lng":-78.7666972,"zoom":9,"place":"St. Louis, Missouri, United States of Am"},{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":9,"place":"Washington, D.C."},{"id":53023,"lat":35.5174913,"lng":-86.5804473,"zoom":9,"place":"Tennessee, United States of America"},{"id":53024,"lat":42.4166744,"lng":-90.4290168,"zoom":9,"place":"Galena, Illinois, United States of Ameri"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":332,"tag":"battle of shiloh"},{"id":3246,"tag":"Ulysses S.

Already a time of great turmoil and uncertainty throughout America, McCarthy’s time in Senate was especially volatile for the homosexual community as investigations and interrogations were made in an attempt to expose them. The contagion of terror regarding communist spies and traitors consuming the nation made the homosexual community a convenient target for a tandem witch-hunt, as it was believed that they were “…vulnerable to blackmail and therefore…security risk[s]” (Johnson 1994, 47). This period, known as the Lavender Scare, was rife with conflict between the Federal government and the gay community as family, friends, and colleagues began being dismissed from their jobs (Johnson 1994, 46). The Senate issued a report, “Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government”, which condemned homosexuals as morally depraved and thus “…unsuitable for employment…” (Hoey 1950, 19). It was decreed that intelligences within the work place of “sexually perverted” activities were to be investigated immediately and the person expediently and mercilessly removed from their post, regardless of years of employment.","Beyond this, Hoey’s report recommended amending the regulations on homosexual activities to make prosecution easier and penalties harsher, further constricting the gay community and thickening the shroud of fear that hovered over them (1950, 17). According to Hoey, the dismissal of purported homosexuals was justifiable in that it was in the greater interest of society to be protected from these individuals, which he viewed as deplorable (1950, 20). This was further validated by the mainstream psychiatric reasoning at the time that claimed homosexuals could be treated if “…they [had] a genuine desire to be cured” (Hoey 1950, 3).","The Lavender Scare continued to escalate as the Eisenhower administration prevented the outright employment of those convicted of sexual perversion. Homosexuals holding places in office were seen as weakening the American government and a severe “security risk” (Johnson 1994, 48). Roosevelt also came under scrutiny for “…harboring at least one homosexual…” (Johnson 1994, 50) in his office, but instead of defending them, Roosevelt also forced their resignation.","These acts of bigotry and the hostility had a tremendous effect on the self-concept of homosexuals. As Sullivan noted, homosexuals were singled out and ridiculed, while society at large turned against them. This was a tremendously demoralizing experience, because not only were they being thrown from their jobs, but forced to live in an environment of hostility and stigmatization (Sullivan 1990, 208). As a result they suffered from depression, feelings of inferiority, as well as fear, hatred, and denial of their sexuality.","The “Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government” had dramatic ramifications in the treatment of homosexuals and their perception in society. It created a chasm in society, an “us” and a “them”, with lastly and profound consequences that remain interwoven in the fabric of society today."," "],"display_date":"1945 - 1969","search_date":"1957-07-02","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":6,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":3299,"tag":"LGBT/Homosexuals/Gays"},{"id":468,"tag":"employment"}],"course":{"name":"US History 1867 to the present","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":173,"school_id":28}},{"id":6686,"title":"An analysis of the Emanciptation Proclamation","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-09-22","end_date":"1863-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Emancipation Proclamation played a pivotal role in the progression of the American Civil War. This document was the first major action in getting rid of the institution of slavery in the United States. Though Abraham Lincoln did not receive open arms when creating this document, he did bring a new since of freedom to the African Americans in the country. This document had two sides, one side believed that it was time to take action and to win the war they needed to get rid of the one thing the south was fighting for. And the other side stood against it, they thought that getting rid of slavery was a wrong move and believed they were just ripping apart the country even more.","            The effects of this document brought many questions and many new ideas to the United States. In the document Lincoln States “All persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.” In the first sentence Lincoln jumps right in to the fire and does what he was there to do. Though there can be an argument made that Lincoln technically has no jurisdiction to free the slaves in the south. This document still shocked the minds of many people both in the union and the confederacy. Many northerners believed the idea of freeing all the slaves would hurt the country.","            Other than controversies, this document did bring a lot of good and a new since of freedom. This document did give birth to the African American man in the Union and chance to join the army.  Lincoln stated “I further declare and make known, that such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.” During this time the union was experiencing huge casualties on the battlefield. The freed slaves gave the Union the numbers it needed to keep the war going and help continue the pursuit against the Confederacy. Throughout the progression of the war slavery was a grey area, though people knew this institution generally caused the war they did not know how to handle the topic. Abolition did not come into picture until Lincoln realized that he had to take away the one think the Confederacy was holding on too."," ","            To conclude, the Emancipation Proclamation helped bring a shifting point to the American Civil War. After mass causalities and a happening of an immoral institution weighed heavier than it could have ever, Lincoln realized that he needed to take action.

His family was poor and he had no real schooling. He loved to read and write and studied many classics on his own. At age 12, he began a trade in printing and started writing poems. He held many jobs over the years and one was editor for a newspaper down in New Orleans called The New Orleans Crescent. While living in New Orleans during this time, he got a firsthand look at what the slave trade looked like and he was sickened by the sight. This inspired him to write, “I Sing The Body Electric”"," ","In 1861 when the Civil War began, Whitman was a freelance writer that would interview wounded soldiers in hospitals in New York. A year later, Wal Whitman’s brother was injured in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Soon Walt came down to help his brother and take care of him. When he got to Fredericksburg, he was so awestruck that he felt the need to volunteer as a nurse and care for the soldiers. He would help take soldiers to Washington D.C. so could receive better treatment. He only planned on staying a few days but ended up volunteering for the next 11 years. "," ","During this time in the Civil War, nurses received no proper training. This was a trial and error effort on the nurse’s part. They simply learned but doing. “Those who called themselves nurses learned by doing and, for the most part, gave medicines, fed patients and kept the hospitals clean.” Also during this time during the Civil War, there were fewer female nurses then there were male nurses. More times than not, male nurses were just recovering soldiers. Soon, the number of female nurses increased due to the fact that many of the soldiers turned nurses would die or become sick again. This called for an increase in the female nurse population.

Though in many ways this amendment wasn’t welcomed with open arms, it did project the United States into a new direction. Without the abolishment of slavery we would not be the country we are today and our history would be completely different.","            Throughout the Civil War the beginning goal of the Union was to bring the country back together and leave slavery intact. Once the confederacy proved that they weren’t giving up easily, Abraham Lincoln believed it was time to take action and take away the one thing the Southern States were fighting for. The first glimpse of the abolishment of slavery was with the Emancipation Proclamation. Though this didn’t fix the problem automatically it opened the eyes of many people throughout the country that slavery could in fact be abolished.

There are several differences that the Union and the Confederacy had towards the Emancipation Proclamation crafted by President Abraham Lincoln during 1863.The effect the Emancipation Proclamation had on both northern and southern minds is worthy of recognition by historians. The Emancipation Proclamation was constructed by Abraham Lincoln as a result of him desiring freedom for a civilization that was put down both physically and emotionally. Abraham Lincoln believed in the principle that all life should be valued and the preservation of the Union was of upmost importance."," ","Lincoln could be thought of as a golden knight; a savior to the African American slaves. The Union viewed the emancipation of slaves as a due right and believed that the demoralizing process known as slavery was an abomination to all of creation. The Emancipation Proclamation was created after the Battle of Antietam in 1862. Lincoln and the Union believed that the Confederacy’s perception of slavery was morally wrong, even if Lincoln would’ve confined slavery to only the southern states. Lincoln did not have the authority to completely ban slavery but he could confine it. Northerners viewed Lincoln as the “Great Emancipator”."," ","The Confederacy did not view the Emancipation Proclamation as a good idea as they would lose valuable labor that lead to an increased production and a better economy through a southerner’s eyes. The Confederates believed in slavery as a constitutional right and as a traditional virtue that originated with the founding fathers. Many people who lived in the South during that time didn’t understand the fragile and inhumane treatment that slavery caused. They viewed the Emancipation Proclamation as a permanent escape from their previous reality. Lincoln made a decision that despite the South rejecting, allowed the freedom of slaves from servitude."," ","The Union and the Confederacy despite their differences, exist as two entities that came together despite their differences. The Union’s opinion was the most logical and ultimately the one opinion that needed to be known. The confederates believed that the Emancipation Proclamation was wrong as it reaped them of their labor system that had worked for many years. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery throughout America completely leading all slaves to the freedom they deserved. With enough persistence, the North’s viewpoint finally was accepted by southerners. The southerners had a difficult time originally due to their lifestyle, however, the South adopted a new virtue.

Initially during this time there was only one man who had the authority to end the existence of the gruesome institution once and for all. The man in question was Abraham Lincoln.  Lincoln was elected President of the U.S in 1861. Being that he was the elected official, he bestowed the power to do something that slaves and citizens of the North had long waited to happen. He emancipated slavery once and for all just two years after being elected. Although he didn’t take charge immediately to end the existence of the gruesome institution, he did it just at the right time during the war."," ","    During the war Lincoln issued a Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. This document was issued by Lincoln in 1862, which was almost a year from the official document. In this document, Lincoln did in fact free slaves. But did he free every slave? Here’s the issue with the preliminary document. Instead of freeing all slaves, he only freed slaves in slave holding Union states. Being that slaves in the union would be emancipated, this would mean that slaves in confederate states would have to wait much longer than they had anticipated. This act also created questions like “ Why not free every slave ?”. There was more to the story leading up to the emancipation of slaves.   "," ","    Being that the country was in an internal war, Lincoln would have to be very clever with the decisions that he made. Because the Confederate Army had possession of part of the country, it was almost impossible for Lincoln to emancipate the slaves in full. The Confederacy definitely wouldn’t allow it. Although Lincoln was the president of the country, the South wasn’t too fond of his ideas and philosophies. The South perceived Lincoln as an imbecile and refused to let him take their source of commerce away from them."," ","Eventually, the Union pushed pass Confederate forces to the point where they had more control. Once they gained as much ground as they did, the war was putty in their hands. After gaining ground into Confederate territory, this opened the door for the emancipation of slaves. In 1863, on the first day of the year, Lincoln finally freed all slaves once and for all. Being that slaves were free, many doors opened up for the African American population. After being freed many of the slaves went on to join the Union Army to give them an edge over the once notorious south. Two years after being emancipated, the slaves joined the Union Army in victory over the Confederacy in 1865. The emancipation of slaves played a vital role in the Civil War. In fact there’s a possibility that the Confederacy may have caused an unexpected turnaround  had slaves  not joined in on the war.

In 1875 Chae Chan Ping, a Chinese laborer, immigrated to the United States, protected by the provisions of this treaty. Seven years later Congress, under intense pressure from labor unions and west coast politicians concerned about Chinese migrants competing with white American for jobs, passed the Chinese Exclusion Act in the spring of 1882, which was the most famous of several acts that amended the Burlingame Treaty by restricting immigration from China. After living and working in the United States for twelve years, Ping decided to make a return voyage to China, fully intending to return to the United States afterwards, and obtained all the certifications necessary to do so as stipulated by the act; he departed on June 2, 1887.","While he was away Congress amended the Chinese Exclusion Act by passing the Scott Act on October 1, 1888, which canceled all certificates of residence and prevented any Chinese people who had previously resided in the United States, like Ping, from returning. When he returned to the US one week after the Scott Act’s passage, his papers were declared null and void; thus he was denied reentry and detained. Ping soon after submitted a habeas corpus petition, asserting that he was unlawfully detained without a trial, to the circuit court of the United States for the northern district of California. This circuit court maintained that Ping, under the Scott Act, was not allowed to enter the United States and was thus not unlawfully detained.","The petitioners, now arguing that the 1888 Scott Act itself was unconstitutional, appealed the circuit court’s decision to the US Supreme Court.. On May 13, 1889 Justice Stephen Jay Field, writing the decision for a unanimous court, portrayed Chinese immigrants as a threat to American civilization, since they refused to assimilate into American culture and were outcompeting white laborers. He argued that immigration policy was a right of the federal government free from judicial review since a strict immigration policy, especially in regards to Chinese immigration, was vital to the national interest. Therefore any certification held by Chinese immigrants prior to the passage of the Scott Act, “is held at the will of the government, revocable at any time, at its pleasure.” Whether any such amendments are within the national interest or are at all constitutional “are not questions for judicial determination.” The Supreme Court thus upheld the decision of the circuit court for the northern district of California. After this decision Ping was deported; his final fate in China is unknown.  <em>Chae Chan Ping v United States </em>was not the only legal challenge to the Chinese Exclusion Act, but the decision Field handed down established a significant precedent of judicial deference to federal immigration policy, known as the “plenary power doctrine,” which continues to shape United States immigration policy to this day."],"display_date":"May 13, 1889","search_date":"1889-05-13","locations":[{"id":966,"lat":37.7749295,"lng":-122.4194155,"zoom":8,"place":"SAN FRANCISCO, California"},{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":8,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3379,"tag":"Chinese Americans"},{"id":746,"tag":"Supreme Court"},{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"}],"course":{"name":"Incarceration in the US","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":176,"school_id":94}},{"id":6734,"title":"The Omnipotent Kennedy Fade","course_id":174,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/60","end_date":"11/1/63","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 14, 1962, Jackie Kennedy gave her famous White House Tour on for CBS Television. Charles Collingwood of CBS guided the hour-long tour. Jackie represented a new, relaxed style of modernity and femininity. She demonstrated impressive knowledge of history by speaking about what events past presidents held in each room. In the Green Room Jackie noted, “this used to be the dining room, and here Jefferson gave his famous dinners and introduced such exotic foods as macaroni, waffles and ice cream to the United States.” Kennedy’s eye for beauty and desire for prestige established the myth and glamour that would define the era of the Kennedys. While many perceived Jackie as a flawless beauty and easygoing mother and wife, she struggled with her public appearance and confidence.","The Kennedys represented the image of a cultural revolution in the1960s. The modern <em>Mad Man</em> television series centers on this image with the new hopes, fears and the eventual decline of the American dream. The article <em>Don, Betty and Jackie Kennedy On Mad Men and Periodization,</em> discusses the symbolism behind the Jackie Kennedy White House Tour in the 1960s. The central characters in <em>Mad Men </em>noted that Jackie seemed nervous, even when she saw Jack at the end. The message behind the show addresses the story of image control. The images and reality observed was well groomed to a specific persona as opposed to the reality of the hardships the family faced. The flaws and secrets of the family are hidden behind the well-tailored clothes, bright smiles and good looks.","In historian James Giglio’s book <em>The Presidency of John F. Kennedy</em>, he accounted for the image the Kennedys had, compared to the reality behind the scenes. John Kennedy was one of the most image-conscious presidents and centered the media on his attractive children, glamorous wife and his livelihood as a family man. The Kennedy lifestyle hardly resembled the Camelot that Jackie portrayed after the assassination.","Behind the handsome façade, Kennedy suffered from failing health, aggressive behavior towards others and being unfaithful to his family. Jackie was well aware of her husband’s problems. Her frustration may have been taken out on her shopping sprees for designer clothes, jewelry, antiques and artwork. Jackie unwillingly assumed the political obligations as first lady. Once President Kennedy twisted Jackie’s arm behind her back and marched her over to female reporters so that would portray the right family image. Jackie often had unpredictable mood swings and would cancel engagements due to illness, only to be reported to be water-skiing at Hyannis Port.","Jackie was a major asset to the image of the Kennedy presidency. In the White House tour Jackie acted as the perfect mother and wife, but her tense posture and controlled voice showed otherwise. Jackie’s seemingly flawless beauty was an image created to shield the ubiquitous flaws in the Kennedy family private life.

New York Times reporter Wallace Turner wrote, “The other surviving brother in the family, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts has told his friends that he doubts seriously if Robert Kennedy knows what he wants to do.” The press interest in Kennedy may not have been as organic as it appeared. Turner served as a Press Secretary in the Kennedy Administration. Despite Kennedy being the popular favorite among Democrats for the Vice Presidency, Johnson detested the idea of choosing a Kennedy as his running mate in an effort to forge his own legacy. ","Following the assassination of his brother, the once confident Robert F. Kennedy suddenly felt unsure of himself in Washington. RFK served as John F. Kennedy’s most trusted advisor in addition to being the Attorney General.  Although RFK remained the Attorney General for several months under Lyndon B. Johnson, RFK lacked the purpose and drive he displayed while serving his brother. RFK fell into a deep depression immediately after his brother’s death and did not report to work for weeks according to On His Own: Robert Kennedy, 1964-1968, by William Vanden Heuvel. ","Under immense internal and external pressure, Robert Kennedy weighed his options for the next chapter of his life. Upon leaving his post as Attorney General in September 1964, the press widely speculated on where RFK would end up. Vanden Heuvel, a close associate of RFK, named some of the positions RFK considered pursuing following his departure from the Johnson Administration. The positions included several ambassadorships, Governor of Massachusetts, and New York State Senator. Taking over JFK’s legacy required RFK to run for office for the first time in his life. Lacking his late brother’s charisma, RFK benefited from immense carryover support from his brother in the Democratic Party. ","RFK’s popularity in the Democratic party made him a de facto candidate for Vice President to the incumbent Johnson in the 1964 election. RFK coveted the Vice Presidency because it would give him the greatest ability to fulfil JFK’s policy goals. RFK admired the Johnson administration’s continuation of many of the New Frontier programs and legislation introduced by JFK. Much to the delight of Johnson, the same polls of the Democratic Party that showed the steadfast support for RFK also revealed that Johnson would not need RFK in order to beat Republican Barry Goldwater. ","After Johnson passed over RFK for the Vice Presidency, RFK moved north to run for a senate seat in New York.

Kennedy. More than any other Catholic of the twentieth century, he was capable of facing this Herculean challenge.”  ","In 1966, Richard Cardinal Cushing, a close confidante and spiritual adviser to John F. Kennedy, sat for an oral history with Edward M. Kennedy. Cardinal Cushing first encountered John F. Kennedy during his campaign for Congress and said that he remained a steadfast influence in the young President’s life until his untimely death. Cushing attested that Kennedy called and visited him frequently to discuss a range of subjects, from federal aid to education to current events. In his interview with Edward M. Kennedy, Cushing described and evaluated the main conflicts Kennedy faced regarding his Catholic religion.","Cushing declared that some citizens undoubtedly did not vote for Kennedy solely for his Catholicism and he admitted that some in the Catholic hierarchy felt the time had not yet come for a Catholic’s election to the presidency. In sharp contrast, Cushing extolled Kennedy’s ecumenical spirit, which meshed with the reforms associated with the Second Vatican Council. Cushing likewise noted Kennedy’s “liberal rather than conservative Catholicism” and many “qualities of mind and heart” made him the only Catholic with a chance to obtain the highest office in the land.","Cushing stated that Kennedy’s faith never obstructed his relationships. Yet Kennedy’s faith and allegiance prevailed as a topics of heated controversy during his campaign and presidency. During his interview with Cushing, Edward M. Kennedy mentioned a highly-publicized incident regarding the Chapel of Four Chaplains in Pennsylvania, where Kennedy encountered harsh criticism for neglecting to attend an interdenominational service. Cushing said this was just one of hundreds of similar conflicts. This specific episode, however, continued to follow Kennedy, despite his insistence that he did not attend solely because “he was not credentialed to be a representative of the Catholic church,” according to historian Shaun Casey.","Kennedy’s Catholicism gave rise to other concerns, including fears that he would advocate to send an ambassador to the Vatican. Cushing considered this an “absurd objection” and proclaimed that he knew no one in the U.S. Catholic hierarchy who supported that initiative. Yet a group of Baptist ministers in St. Louis passed a resolution that encouraged Kennedy to send Cardinal Cushing himself – “Mr. Kennedy’s own hierarchical superior in Boston” – to obtain the Vatican’s authorization on Kennedy’s position regarding the separation of church and state. Casey wrote that a move like this would have presented Kennedy as submissive to the Vatican. Kennedy firmly denounced this appeal, reiterating that he felt strongly that his position mirrored those of most American Catholics.","As for federal aid to education, Cushing never passionately supported the cause, fearing that parochial schools would become subject to some federal control. But Cushing affirmed that Kennedy felt private or parochial schools deserved a place in the U.S. educational system. Kennedy even believed these schools should receive “some kind of aid that had no relation to religion,” as long as this motion would align with the Constitution. Historian Thomas Maier wrote that during a debate surrounding a 1950 federal aid-for-education bill, Kennedy openly argued that parochial schools should receive aid, at least for buses and health services.","Cushing told Edward M. Kennedy how he officiated the late President’s wedding to Jacqueline Bouvier, visited during one of Kennedy’s near-fatal hospital stays, gave the only prayer offering at Kennedy’s inauguration, and attended the funeral masses of both Patrick Bouvier and the President himself. In all the time that he knew the President, Cushing said he never once saw any evidence that an allegiance to the Vatican had influenced Kennedy’s loyalties to the presidency. In fact, he considered Kennedy “the greatest representative of brotherhood...we had among the laity.”","<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"],"display_date":"January 1, 1966 - January 30, 1966","search_date":"1966-01-15","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.911387,"lng":-77.03062,"zoom":7,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3561,"tag":"Richard Cardinal Cushing"},{"id":3563,"tag":"Vatican"},{"id":3562,"tag":"Edward M.

She created the image of a successful woman; rather than the stereotypical dependent and obedient women in the early 1960s. Most importantly, Jackie Kennedy served as a role model for women.","On February 14, 1962 Jacqueline Kennedy conducted a TV tour of the newly restored White House. Not only did she single handedly start the restoration, overseeing everything from wallpaper in the Monroe Room to china in the State Dining Room, she also presented the renovated rooms of the White House with knowledge and poise, intermittently providing historical context. The hour-long CBS special symbolized something greater than just presenting artifacts of American history to its viewers, it communicated that Jackie Kennedy was more than just Jack Kennedy’s wife. Through White House restoration, Jackie publicized her movement away from dependence and toward initiative and progress. Whether she intended directly or not, Jackie Kennedy provided women with a newfound inspiration for change; change that was well overdue.","President Kennedy was introduced at the tail end of the tour, and for once, it is to support the First Lady in her endeavors, rather than the reverse. “Being educated, having some knowledge your husband didn’t have, was glamorous, even enviable” according to Media Studies Scholar Susan Douglas. It was refreshing, revolutionary and important to young women in the United States at that time to see that a woman, not only a man, could do something great, something “magnificent” as R. M. Frisby states in a letter to the First Lady. Her voice, as Historian Gil Troy states, is “thin” with an “upper-class accent.” Her hair was done perfectly and her wardrobe, as always, superb. Not only was her appearance untouchable, but her knowledge as well. She articulated “beautifully sculpted grammatical sentences” and “compelling facts” throughout the televised special, creating an intimacy between the viewers and herself.","Troy recounts “reporters hailed the First Lady for transcending the typical polarities of gender and marriage.” Jacqueline Kennedy established a new interpretation of societal roles, one that spoke directly to females. The second youngest First Lady, only 31 years of age, according to Douglas was a “one-woman revolution” and this statement holds true as seen through the appreciative letters sent by citizens regarding the success of the White House restoration."],"display_date":"February 14, 1962","search_date":"1962-02-14","locations":[{"id":53140,"lat":38.8976763,"lng":-77.0365298,"zoom":17,"place":"The White House"}],"tags":[{"id":3565,"tag":"White House Restoration"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":2848,"tag":"First Lady"},{"id":2847,"tag":"Jacqueline Kennedy"}],"course":{"name":"JFK","school":"Marist College","course_id":183,"school_id":77}},{"id":6808,"title":"The Spider Man of Ronald Reagan: Defeating Threats to Masculinity","course_id":185,"status":"P","start_date":"8/1/81","end_date":"8/31/81","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As tensions arise in the sphere of gender rights in America, Spider-Man swings in to save the day, or at least save the men of the world from the threat of feminism. In August 1981, Fantagraphics Books released their third issue of <em>Amazing Heroes</em> which includes an interview with the new editor for Marvel’s <em>Spider-Man</em> titles, Tom DeFalco, on his plan to “revitalize” Spider-Man by “returning to the ‘grandeur and the power and the menace” of the hero’s original days. As Spidey’s revamping to “use his powers to the fullest potential,” the push to extend the date for the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) ratifications was struggling under the presidency of Ronald Reagan (Amazing Heroes 54). The Equal Rights Amendment, passing on March 22, 1972, had a seven-year deadline on ratification processes, meaning it could not be ratified after 1979. Congress approved an extension until June 30, 1982, but after the swearing in of Ronald Reagan, the ERA lost its support from the republican party (Francis). On the major political loss, Anne Costain says, “what makes gender differences distinctive in the 1980s is that they are now tied to a consistent preference in the part of women for the democratic party and its candidates” (Costain 115). A citizen’s right to not be denied or abridged based on their sex was undermined by more than half of the political system: the feminist movement was battling against Reagan’s presidency.","            Hegemonic masculinity took over the US and feminists were fighting for equal rights on the basis of sex. In the midst of this political tension, Tom DeFalco presses for a character of justice, masculinity, womanizing, and heroism of full amelioration, found in none other than the friendly neighborhood hero, Spider-Man. The political realm of equal rights was battling a threat and the face of masculinity that was in charge was being opposed by a mass movement. Spider-Man’s supposedly old-and-improved characterization is an agent of protection against the threat of femininity and, more specifically, feminism and gender inclusivity. In fact, based on a study about the embodiment of superheroes done by Dr. Edward Avery-Natalie, “evolution toward hyperbolic forms has been increasing since the Golden Age of comic books” (Avery-Natalie 81). Furthermore, male characters can be, as it is typically found in this study, fetishized to embody the fullness of male power that is depicted through masculinity of said character (Avery-Natalie 80). The article in <em>Amazing Heroes</em> includes sketches for the upcoming Spider-Man, captioned by DeFalco that he’s bringing back lots of “hoo-hah and shenanigans to spider-man” (<em>Amazing Heroes</em> 58). “Hoo-hah and shenanigans to spider-man,” is repeated throughout the story. The sketches detail the muscular, intense, action-packed, violence-packed fight scenes that Spider-Man takes action in. Penciled by Bob Hall, these scenes are exactly the fun and invigorating graphics that depict ideal masculinity: “children live in a historical period, undergoing political, economic, social, cultural and technological changes; those changes are so complex that boys and girls are confronted with many different experiences, which lead them to criticize certain hegemonic values” (Silva 526). In addition to Sylvia’s claim, the call to criticize hegemonic values is accompanied by the exposure to hegemonic values.

However, he also believed that it would be disastrous to simply repeal it without any new tariff to take its place.  He explained that the newest version of the tariff had not been in place for more than nine months and therefore they could not possibly understand its true ramifications, as they did not yet know the experimental effects of the tariff yet and that was imperative information needed to improve policy in the future.  Clay, known as “the Great Compromiser,” made his motives clear saying, “I am anxious to find out some principle of mutual accommodation, to satisfy, as far as practicable, both parties.”  ","            The first modification he proposed was a change to the tax percentage on the tariff.  Clay argued that it would be sufficient to change it from twenty percent to fifteen or seventeen percent to help lighten the burden felt by the South while still protecting the domestic textile industry from the competitive foreign market. Another modification he proposed reduced the cost of “woollens” by five percent for poor southerners as well as those that are intended for the consumption of slaves.  He hoped this would make the southern states feel less attacked by the tariff and see it as a protection on the country’s industry as a whole.  Clay acknowledged the uncertainty of this modification stating “no calculation could be more uncertain than that.”  After he had finished this portion of his speech, he explained that should this bill go into operation, he had no doubt that it would be adhered to by all parties, thus diffusing the nullification crisis.   ","            With these modifications, Clay’s bill was passed and the Compromise Tariff of 1833 went into effect.  This version made the South happy enough to diffuse rising sectional tensions for the moment.  The new version of the tariff still favored the power of the federal government and undermined the nullification doctrine.  Henry Clay eased sectional tensions by thinking about the future in a way that no other congressman was able to do and therefore, unknowingly, delaying the seccession crisis by another thirty years.  "],"display_date":"February 12, 1833","search_date":"1833-02-12","locations":[{"id":53196,"lat":38.8860434,"lng":-76.999525,"zoom":2,"place":"Capitol Hill"}],"tags":[{"id":554,"tag":"Henry Clay"},{"id":3669,"tag":"Nullification Crisis"},{"id":3670,"tag":"Tariff"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6859,"title":"The United States Army Dismisses Repeating Rifles","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-12-09","end_date":"1861-12-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            In December 1861, Union Brigadier-General James Ripley wrote Secretary of War Simon Cameron to give his opinion on the newest firearms advancements. General Ripley did so to address gun makers’ proposals to sell their repeating Henry and Spencer “magazine arms” to the Union Army. He went on to describe these rifles and the ammunition that allowed them to fire multiple shots without reloading. While the General noted that reports on the repeaters “are favorable,” he believed their trials were too limited to identify them as effective combat weapons. He also shared his concerns about the weight of the loaded rifles, safety of the self-contained ammunition, and complexity of supplying that ammunition. In his opinion, the breech-loading carbines, which were already ordered by the Army, were good enough. Ripley felt that the repeating rifles should “be stopped by the refusal to introduce any more unless upon the most full and complete evidence of their great superiority.”","             The world in which General Ripley wrote was one of great technological advancement, firearms included. Throughout the Civil War, most soldiers carried single shot, muzzle-loading rifled muskets. While these rifles were certainly an advancement over early smoothbore muskets, they were slow and difficult to reload. Capable soldiers could only fire a few shots per minute. To help remedy this, a number of inventors developed breach-loading carbines, which could be easily loaded from the rear of the barrel. Both Union and Confederate forces adopted numerous versions of this design and implemented them with some success.","Although breech-loaders were an effective technological advancement, the first practical repeating arms entered the market shortly before the outbreak of war. Lever-action type carbines, including the Volcanic, Spencer and Henry, proved to be the most enduring and effective designs. These weapons could be loaded with several rounds of self-contained ammunition in a tubular magazine. Actuating a lever ejected the spent round and reloaded a fresh one from that magazine, readying it for fire. The self-contained ammunition required by the Spencer and Henry rifles used a metallic casing, which conveniently held the bullet, gunpowder and the primer, mercury fulminate. Altogether, this system yielded a much higher rate of fire.","            Despite General Ripley’s letter discrediting the new repeating arms, they did see some official service in the Civil War. A number of Union units were equipped with Spencer carbines by 1863. A few units also adopted the superior Henrys, although more soldiers privately purchased them. Mounted cavalry especially coveted the repeaters. They proved to be quite effective in battle, allowing small numbers of soldiers to produce huge volumes of fire, even in adverse situations. Expended use of these repeating carbines, despite concerns, likely would have helped the Union achieve victory in the Civil War sooner. Yet, most army brass continued to follow Ripley’s overly cautious thought process. Even decades after the war, single shot trapdoor rifles remained standard issue. While civilians and foreign governments welcomed the repeating arms, the U.S. Army did not adopt one as its standard issue rifle until 1892."],"display_date":"December 9, 1861","search_date":"1861-12-09","locations":[{"id":52826,"lat":38.920310953731,"lng":-436.99169966104,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":3665,"tag":"Rifles"},{"id":2289,"tag":"Weapons"},{"id":599,"tag":"Technology"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6863,"title":"Daniel Webster Refutes Robert Hayne's Attack on New England in the Great Senate Debate of 1830","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-01-26","end_date":"1830-01-27","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 26 and 27, 1830, senators Robert Y. Hayne of South Carolina and Daniel Webster of Massachusetts got into a heated debate that captured many of the issues that threatened to tear the nation apart. The main issues involved the tariff and nullification. Two days prior to Webster’s reply, Hayne delivered a speech in Congress that attacked Webster by questioning his loyalty to the Constitution. In this speech, Hayne said that the South had \"everything to lose and nothing to gain.\" He believed the tariff only sought \"the protection of Northern shipping and New England seamen\" while the South reaped no benefits. The audience expected Webster to deliver a reply, and he did not let them down. Webster began his reply by saying, “…It is, Sir, the people’s Constitution, the people’s government, made for the people, made by the people, and answerable to the people.” Throughout the course of this reply, Webster argued that the federal government provided everything for the country. He stated that the sectional conflict resulted from the claims of state’s rights since the state governments tried to insert themselves into the areas recognized as the purview of the federal government.","Sectional beliefs divided the Senate which emphasized the tensions between the North and the South. At this point, the southern states felt that the federal government violated their rights by imposing the tariff. Robert Hayne advocated for states’ rights. According to Harlow W. Sheidley, he also proposed the doctrine of nullification in which a state could nullify laws that they considered unconstitutional like the tariff. This served as a pretext to the Nullification Crisis that would cause South Carolina to threaten secession. In Webster’s reply to Hayne, he argued that the southern states secede since the Constitution applies to both the North and the South. This debate brought into question the limits of what the federal government could do.","Webster’s reply to Hayne revealed his sense of federalism. His counterargument suggests that he saw a common identity as a country, not just North and South. Clearly, Webster tried to promote federalism over sectionalism. In his reply to Hayne, he implicitly stated his belief that the Constitution created the framework of the federal government. Webster believed that the federal government had the right to handle any conflict between the state and federal governments over an issue not clarified in the Preamble of the US Constitution. This explains his opposition to nullification, which justifies why he argued that states such as South Carolina had no right to nullify the tariff.  A century later, Senator Robert C. Byrd recognized that Webster knew how to appeal to a national audience during a time of governmental polarization. He also knew how to diffuse a situation by changing the subject. And because he possessed this knowledge, he decided to persuade people of the importance of a single democratic union. However, many southerners fully opposed these beliefs. Therefore, Daniel Webster’s reply to Hayne embodies the true sectional crisis that eventually leads to the American Civil War."],"display_date":"January 26, 1830 - January 27, 1830","search_date":"1830-01-26","locations":[{"id":52855,"lat":38.898899496695,"lng":-77.032655531551,"zoom":13,"place":"Washington, D.C."}],"tags":[{"id":1803,"tag":"Sectional Crisis"},{"id":150,"tag":"Senate"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":371,"tag":"Debate"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6865,"title":"Congress Passes Comstock Act","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1873-03-03","end_date":"1873-03-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","On March 3, 1873, Congress approved <em>An Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use.</em>  The Comstock Act created penalties for owning or selling anything deemed obscene.

Fitzhugh, Esq. of Virginia, a vice president of the society, offered resolutions to expand funding options. With a task as large as removing and relocating freed blacks from the United States back to Africa, “private charity is inadequate to its full execution; that the resources of the nation and the state are required for it…” The society needed the backing of the federal government to realize its chief goal.","The society dated to 1816, and the ACS could claim many prominent members such as Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln. The ACS had one main goal; to relocate freed blacks back to Africa. As the population of enslaved Africans began to rise, the population of disenfranchised freed blacks rose as well. This growing assemblage of former slaves posed a significant stress on the predominantly white and racist society. Their main concern centered on the integration of the “inferior creatures” into society, as Samuel Hopkins, a member of the society, argued. Blacks living freely in the states, “could cause only injury to the slaves and disadvantage to the public” said Hopkins. Religious motives affirmed this massive project. Robert Finley,  a prominent figure in the society added, “The ACS was born out of religious benevolence and charity.” Claiming to be working in the name of God, freed Africans would liberate, “50 millions of people from the lowest state of ignorance and superstition, and restor[e] them to the knowledge and worship of the true God.” Using Christianity as a foundation, Elias Caldwell, another member, asserted that colonization was “a great national object and ought to be supported by the national purse.” Colonization seemed to be the only option at the time and in order for a project of this magnitude to be realized, the “national purse” needed to be opened. ","The ACS may have disapproved of slavery, but it remained blinkered by racist ideas. They justified the relocation of freed blacks as a benevolent action that solved the problem. This relocation supposedly benefited the, “American civil institutions, morals, and habits,” spread the word of God and redeemed the rest of Africa, Finley argued. Seemingly the only available option, the ACS gained supporters and momentum in antebellum South, with strong support from southern plantation owners who worried about the impact freed blacks would have on their slaves. As far as implementation, the cost of colonizing required incredible amounts of lives and money. Due to the magnitude of the project, private charity alone failed to cover the cost and thus the need for the appointment of a, “committee to draft memorials, to be immediately presented to the two houses of congress.”  Henry Clay’s campaign failed to produce grant money from the US government but the ACS received some state aid over the course of their existence.

He did so via a mass television broadcast where he attacked the Klan after a woman by the name of Mrs. Liuzzo was killed by four men who were apparently associated with the Ku Klux Klan. The President was fierce in his statement telling the clan to stop “before it is too late” and even calls the group a “hooded society of bigots”?. Johnson acknowledges the threat that this group poses and realizes that he must take action in order to reassure his country’s safety. The article published by the Globe and Mail describes Johnsons mood as “sheer wrath” when hearing the news of the crime committed?. The reporter constantly hinted to Johnson’s emotion towards the KKK and how motivated he was to bring these men to justice. To explain his motivation, the article states that Johnsons father too dealt with the KKK and felt that the group was a threat to America’s safety?. Although his public attack on the Klan was used to cause intimidation, the article brings up a good point that by naming these four men publically, it could cause an unfair trial?. Nonetheless this article portrays Johnson sticking up for what he believes in and showing an enormous amount of bravery and courage. ","The Ku Klux Klan was first founded in 1866 with the goal of promoting terrorism and violence to those of African American heritage and those that had different religious beliefs to them.? There were two waves of KKK dominance; one lasting from 1866 to the late 19th century, and the other from 1915 to modern day. ? In Johnson’s announcement he stated how his father also ‘dealt’ with the KKK and here we see proof of that with the two separate waves of white supremacism. What led to the high increase of clan activity in the 60’s was when Johnson announced his plans for more Civil rights for those of colour with his new take on Liberalism and new definition to FDR’S “New Deal”. Unfortunately, Viola Liuzzo was just one of the many casualties as a result of the KKK. Viola Liuzzo was a poor white southerner born in Pennsylvania in 1925.? When growing up in the great depression she knew what it was like to be constantly moving due to a lack of funds. She noticed how those of colour were treated very poorly and were racially divided with different waiting rooms, water fountains, churches etc.? In 1965 when she heard about the opportunity to join the march in Selma Alabama she thought it was a great way to stand up against black oppression. During the march Viola was spotted sitting with a black man, and four KKK members saw this as a chance to “broadcast their message: killing Liuzzo and Moton would assure blacks that no march or demonstration would ever change what they considered the ideal southern way of life.”? The KKK were a very radical, dangerous group and did whatever was necessary to keep a white powered society; even if that meant killing someone of their own skin colour.  After Liuzzo was shot to death, the four shooters were caught just hours later where Johnson had a live broadcast declaring threats against the clan. "," "],"display_date":"March 27, 1965","search_date":"1965-03-27","locations":[{"id":52836,"lat":47.741745672861,"lng":-117.15857658134,"zoom":5,"place":"Washington DC"}],"tags":[{"id":151,"tag":"Ku Klux Klan"},{"id":889,"tag":"Racism"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":191,"school_id":28}}]}
