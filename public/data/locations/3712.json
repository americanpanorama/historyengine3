It served as the hub of life in the Lower East Side – teeming with women shopping, children playing and peddlers manning their pushcarts full of food. While the tenements towered high above blocking out the sky, the streets were overrun with peddlers and their pushcarts and their female clientele milling about from cart to cart, bartering and looking for the best deal. Between 1880 and 1890 over 60,000 Jews inhabited the Lower East Side, and for them, the streets served as their community center, marketplace, and playground. Everything that Jewish immigrant families needed could be found in the markets and carts on Hester Street crowding the streets: groceries, books, and even house wares. Interaction, especially for Jewish women, in the markets of Hester Street was vital to their survival in the new American culture","Immigrant women in New York's lower East Side lived a decidedly different life than the progressive reforming women. The staunch lines drawn public and private space did not apply to everyday immigrant realities. The cult of domesticity promoted the virtues of women managing their private sphere docile passivity, By contrast, Jewish immigrant women of the Lower East Side readily and actively engaged in public life and the market economy. Some even operated their own pushcarts and stalls. The streets of the Lower East Side were more than mere thoroughfares and marketplaces a place for women to congregate, forge social networks, and exert their influence.","The active place that Jewish immigrant women held in public market life was at odds with the established American bourgeois ideals concerning women's roles and propriety. It was not uncommon for Jewish women to work in the markets, peddle goods, while also managing the fiscal affairs for the family. They were accustomed to these breadwinning roles from the old country. But though Hester Street closely resembled European street markets, the moral reformers did not approve. Instead, they saw the poverty of the Lower East Side as a sign of a moral failure on the part of the Jewish mothers. The reformers sought a regeneration of the immigrant population through the adoption of the reformer's own Protestant work ethic. Female social workers at the time, like those of Jane Addams' Hull House in Chicago, did not see Jewish women's role in the market place as a way for these women to exercise their authority and autonomy. Rather they saw it as an example of idleness and chaos. They disapproved of women's participation in street life. The tension between the dueling views of a woman's place –connecting with the other immigrant women in the street versus acting solely as the queen of the household came to a head not in the first generation immigrant, but rather their daughters. It was this generation who felt the full brunt of the pressure from their mothers to remain loyal to the old culture and withstand the pressure to assimilate."],"display_date":"January 1, 1898","search_date":"1898-01-01","locations":[{"id":8931,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":68,"tag":"Progressive Reformers"},{"id":69,"tag":"Marketplace"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4472,"title":"Murder of Geographic Proportions","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1897-06-25","end_date":"1897-11-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["","What is more interesting than a story that involves a jealous love triangle that results in the murder of a man and the arrest of another who has been betrayed by a friend and lover? It is the realization that this is not a plot line for a fictional soap opera, but a real account that occurred in the Lower East Side of New York City in 1897. Martin Thorn and William Guidensuppe were both competing for the love of Mrs. Nack. When the barber, Thorn, discovered the encounters of Nack and Guidensuppe he was overcome with jealousy and killed Guidensuppe with Nack's help. The role that gender plays into this murder is not unusual when the urban circumstance is considered because the strict limitations placed on individuals by their close proximity to others.  When people are placed closer together there is more violence between males because they are hoping to establish a sense of dominance not only in the community, but also to protect their resources.  In this situation it could be argued that Thorn saw Guidensuppe as a threat to his relationships and his territory. Furthermore, it is the role that geography played out in development and resolution of this crime that is truly unique.","While the actual murder occurred in the Woodside community in Long Island, the body was purposely cut into pieces and hidden around New York so that the authorities would not be able to identify the victim, Guidensuppe. Two children from the Lower East Side found one part of the body when they were playing along the East River. They discovered only the torso and arms, while they discovered that the rest of the body was missing. The lower half of Guidenssupe's trunk was found in the northern part of the city by the Washington Bridge, and eventually the legs were found in a Navy-Yard in Brooklyn. The deliberate placement of the body pieces shows that Thorn and Nack's perceptions of communities within the city and the constraint that it places on the citizens was too strong to extend beyond the neighborhoods they lived in. The Chicago School of sociologists would argue that this had a huge impact on their decision to carry out the murder in such a unique way because they theorize that environmental characteristics like density, housing types, land use, social heterogeneity define the social constraints of an individual. If we hold this theory to be true it is understandable why Thorn and Nack would have thought this was the perfect crime because the threesome lived in a close proximity despite the size of the city: Guidensuppe worked for a Turkish bath on West Forty-Second Street and Mrs. Nack lived on near by on Ninth Avenue.","Location, however, was not a limiting factor and this was due mostly to the influence of the media.  As the men who found the remains at the Washington Bridge location recognized the unique packaging as a result of reading about the Lower East Side reports of a mutilated body being found in similar packaging. This is explained by the sociodemographic theory in which social interactions with neighbors are based in differential access to resources that allow people to deal with their social environment, and the paper being a constant resource in New York City these various enclaves were drawn together rather than being kept separate. This murder also showed the role of national media and its growth in this period as this article about the Guidensuppe murder was found in the Chicago Tribune. The editor and founder of the Chicago Tribune, Joseph Medill, was known for publishing sensational stories in hopes of gaining readers. This story certainly fits the bill with its articulate and vivid language like, \"body shockingly mutilated.\" While the motives of Medill were most likely profit driven to publish this piece it gives New York City a sense of legitimacy as their news was being published in other cities, and also gives rise to the spread of information around the country.  "," "," "],"display_date":"June 25, 1897 - November 8, 1897","search_date":"1897-09-01","locations":[{"id":8931,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":70,"tag":"Geography"}],"course":{"name":"History of Urban and Suburban America","school":"Furman University","course_id":16,"school_id":4}},{"id":4480,"title":"Great Migration, Religion, and Churches in New York City","course_id":16,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-01-01","end_date":"12/31/09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" The \"Great Migration\" of African Americans to the north in the early 1900's was the result of years of enslavement. The migration introduced new eager American citizens to the north during a time when new faces were foreign faces. For African Americans, the lure of freedom from Jim Crow laws, a higher and fairer wage for labor, and a fresh start to life was reasons enough to move to \"the promised land\". New York among other big cities was the destinations of choice for African Americans. The newly emancipated African Americans brought to the north a lifestyle they adapted to in the south. This lifestyle became integrated into communities African Americans inhabited. My primary source is a postcard from the early 1900's of Forest Avenue in New York City depicting a Congregationalist church at a corner street in a supposedly black neighborhood. The postcard not only depicts many traits of the turning century, but also provides small but significant insight into how the church acted as an aid and an outlet for those making not only a transition into a new century but also a social and cultural transition at the same time.","            The settlement in the north proved the church served as an alleviation and refuge from the acclimation to a strange new home and community. The church's role in the north was often similar to the way it was in the south during slavery. As conditions in New York became overcrowded, places of worship were hard to find among the busy streets. However once churches were developed, often being erected from older buildings, the church served as the center of a community. One of my supporting sources is also a primary source that is a newspaper article describing the events of the dedication of a new location for the <em>Forest Avenue Church</em>. Before it took the name <em>First Congregational Church of Morrisania</em> it was known as <em>Forest Avenue Congregational Church </em>and was established in 1851. The dedication described by <em>The New York Times</em> was not a long article, but gave only the basic details of the ceremony. The actual ceremony was long and included many keynote area speakers indicating this was a significant event for the community. The African American population boom brought new ideologies in denomination and Christian perspectives and accounted for more and more African American churches and communities springing up. Once many African Americans migrated north religion and worship continued to be a very key practice. However, the spirit and style of African American worship changed significantly once the migration occurred. More specifically was the Negro spiritual and how song and dance was incorporated in church. The worship services were not as stringent as they were in the South and for good reason because they now had reason to celebrate their deliverance. As this \"second emancipation\" occurred northern cities and people were forced to handle the product of victory in the Civil War. ","            Like many foreign immigrants, African American immigrants had to live in close quarters and earn small wages. They escaped much of the discrimination experienced in the south, yet hardships were not far off. Religion was a backbone of African American life in the south, and it was the same in the north. The church was able to unveil the well-beaten Underground Railroad allowing many more African Americans to travel northward. This was a time of change in American history that ushered in new developments for regional development and identity. Along with providing a link between the north and the south, the African American migration and subsequent expansion of the church provided a visibly direct by-product of the events of slavery and Civil War.

Her neighbors frantically stand at her side, their eyes darting back and forth across the busy streets looking for the lost little ones.  Finally, what seems like hours later, there is a banging at the tenement door.  It is a New York City policeman, toting the lost children by the hands.  Historical photographer Lewis Wickes Hine captured this emotional moment in a flash.  ","    Living in the Lower East Side in the early 1900s was a very dangerous undertaking, especially for children.  There was disease, gang fighting, murder, and fast and unpredictable street traffic.  Landlords let such dangerous activities continue in and around their buildings, as long as their tenants were paying the rent.  ","    Immigrants often encountered diseases both in their journey to and in America that they had not previously encountered.  These diseases flourished in the unsanitary and overpopulated conditions of the tenements.  There was very little access to fresh air, and children were forced to find places to play in dirty alley ways, often among trash and refuse.  ","    The neighborhood in which people lived became their identity.  Children innocently walking with their friends often would find their way onto another street, where it was not uncommon to be attacked just for being foreign to the neighborhood.  Immigrants frequently settled in pockets based on their nationality or race, and formed their own communities.  This segregation led to rivalries and hostile street fighting among neighborhoods, simply over these strong identities of location and race.  Children were afraid to venture outside of their block for fear of who and what they might encounter.  ","    Murders were also common in the city.  Cities were a relatively new phenomenon in America, and with the help of the industrial revolution cities like New York were expanding at a rapid pace.  The expansion was so fast that law enforcement officials were having a hard time keeping up.  Therefore, it was often up to neighbors to look out for one another until police could arrive on the scene.  Children were especially vulnerable to attacks from criminals, since they were small and weak.  ","    Street traffic was dangerous.  Carts filled the streets, and laws were frequently broken.  People in the city were in a hurry, always trying to race deadlines.  Wagons were constantly swerving to miss hitting people, darting in and out of the way of other wagons, and trying to remain within the confines of the street.  It was easy for small children to get caught underneath a wagon speeding recklessly down the street, especially in the dark of night.  The rules of the road were not the same, and crosswalks were non-existent.  Laws did not protect people against the dangers of street traffic, so a constant battle existed between pedestrians and drivers.","    The photographer, Lewis Wickes Hines, believed that by capturing the hardships of life for the Lower East Side Immigrants, he could bring about reform.  He often used his images to help start reform campaigns, with help from social welfare agencies.  ","    When a child went missing, even for a short period of time, it was natural for their mother to worry if they were dead or alive.  With the dangers that Lower East Side residents faced, it was a huge relief to see your missing child appear on your doorway in the hands of a capable police officer.  With photographs like those taken by Hines, these real world stories exist for generations to come."],"display_date":"1890 -

the dawn of the twentieth century, women discovered exciting new things to do with their bodies.  Women fell in love with exercise and this helped heat up the debate over the healthiness of wearing corsets.  An ad carried by the December 1902 issue of Munsey's Magazine, written like a letter from \"the family doctor,\" immediately noted that articles debating the merits or faults of tight lacing often appeared in the pages of the magazine written \"by all sorts and conditions of people.\"  The writer of the article, supposedly a medical doctor, agreed that there was much to be said for both sides of the argument.  The letter stated that \"stays are useful to support the female figure if used in moderation, and they are constructed with a due regard to health.\"  The ad, disguised as a letter pertaining to medical advice, then went on to recommend Mr. Thomas' Duchess Corset because it \"adds materially to the elegance of the figure without causing any injury to the vital parts.\"","While still wearing corsets, women in America discovered the joys of exercise.  Cycling, tennis, and basic aerobics became very popular, particularly among younger women.  Gyms for ladies sprung up in larger towns, and gymnastics evolved in to an important part of the curriculum in female education.  Fashion, however, mostly refused to keep up with the trend.  Though the popularity of exercise grew, women continued to wear restrictive corsets.  Much of the country fiercely debated the merits of wearing a corset, or at least the degree of tightness to which one laced the garment.  Experts weighed in on both sides of the debate offering no clear answer.  Many doctors warned wearing a corset led to problems with internal organs, especially the reproductive system.  Other doctors called those claims overblown.","Early twentieth century corset advertising did not over look the importance of altering the female figure, but it reflected the population's growing concerns and put more emphasis on health issues, even though many companies made false claims.  The author of this ad from Munsey's Magazine failed to mention what features made the Duchess corset more safe for women to wear.  The illustration included in the advertisement, if looked at as a technical drawing, shed no light on the subject either.  Often, manufacturers made claims of improved safety but failed to deviate from the standard production of a corset model.  The Duchess corset appeared to be one of these models.","Though many groups protested claims made by corset manufacturers, they failed to stop companies from making outrageous claims about their products.  Many women learned the hard way that corsets advertised as exercise friendly or more medically sound than past models showed little, if any, difference from corset models already on the market.  The false advertising continued as long as companies sold corsets and left the job of scrutinizing claims to the consumer.","<a

Much of the incentive to leave Ireland was due to the unfavorable living conditions in the Irish countryside According to the Irish who remained in Ireland, many of the women were frustrated by the male dominated agricultural society and had left their homes in hopes of finding luck in the United States.  These oversea journeys were life threatening, but foreigners were willing to take a chance.  To the immigrants, anything was better than what they were leaving back home.[4]","A portion of the women immigrating to the United States via Ellis Island had their voyages paid for by other relatives already living in America; however, it was not uncommon for the father to emigrate first, earn money, and then send it back home to pay for his other family member’s voyages or for a family to emigrate as a group or for single members to travel alone.","These girls faced many difficulties in America, due to the fact that they were uprooted from their homes in Ireland.  Previously, these Irish women were accustomed to working around the house and caring for others, but life in America was going to be much different.  Once the young women arrived, they needed to begin to search for work immediately.  Coming from an area where most people were agriculturalists, their transition to an area in the heart of New York City was drastically different from their familiar surroundings.","Of all the different groups of immigrants, Irish women were of the greatest amount.  This difference was due to the “emergence of the modern Irish family structure”  With the newly evolving land and family forms that were coming about, there was a decrease in the number of children emigrating.  Between the years of 1852 to 1921 the median age for female immigrants was 21.2 years old.  This age was “younger than the median age of marriage”, and therefore explains the reason why so many of the immigrants got married upon arriving in America.[5]","“Emigration was the end of peasant live in Europe; it was also the beginning of life in America”.[6]  Ireland depended on their crops for survival, and therefore life was miserable at home for many of the Irish families.  Providing for everyone became difficult, and as a result many Irish left their familiar hometowns to start a new life in America.  The decision to come to America marked a huge milestone in an individual’s life, because they were leaving their native land and putting their lives at risk. Assimilating to life in America was not going to be easy, and immigrants needed to be taught about the way of life in America."," ","[1] Diner, Professor Hasia R.. \"The Search for Bread: Patterns of Female Migration.\" In <em>Erin's Daughters in America: Irish Immigrant Women in the Nineteenth Century (The Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science)</em>.

I believe I could fill a volume by the mere enumeration of the diabolical and absurd nostrums offered by knaves to heal men who profess to hold in ridicule the Chinese doctors”.  Transportation made it possible for these men to seek out vulnerable Americans who were in desperate need of a cure only to take their money and recommend a remedy that had no basis.","According to Doctor Peter Conrad, the educated doctors of the times pressed to have legal regulation among health care practitioners and felt the current treatments were unreliable and often dangerous.  However, many people challenged this as they felt some of the treatments, especially from educated holistic practitioners, were valuable and often superior to that of the formally educated doctors.  Dr. Conrad states “belief held that the practice of medicine should be ‘democratic’ and open to all, or at least all men.”   Self-help was still a common practice among them.","The Americans viewed themselves superior to that of other countries and felt their newly discovered remedies were more advanced.  It seems this naive and narrow-minded approach dismissed remedies of their ancestors and left them with trial, error, luck and a false sense of elitism."," "],"display_date":1900,"search_date":"1900-07-02","locations":[{"id":49747,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":883,"tag":"diet"},{"id":230,"tag":"Medicine/Health"},{"id":267,"tag":"Health"},{"id":888,"tag":"Graham"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5232,"title":"Captain O’Brien Gives Birth to Theatre in Birmingham","course_id":62,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"12/31/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The citizens of Birmingham lived without art. That was until Captain Frank O’Brien, Birmingham, Alabama’s fourteenth mayor, leased the upper floor of a small brick building in the city’s Southside in 1872. It was named Sublett’s Hall in honor of a Confederate Major from Mississippi and was the first theatre in Birmingham. Captain O’Brien is best remembered for his other contribution to the city: O’Brien’s Opera House. Like Sublett’s Hall, O’Brien’s Opera House opened in the upper floors of a brick building. However, the Opera House was built ten years later in the city’s Northside. The theatre’s opening night was a sell-out. On that night, the theatre showed <em>The Black Cook. </em>The Parisian musical had been controversial when it played in New York. Sermons were even preached against it. Opening night was eventful for another reason. The lights would not turn on. Captain O’Brien borrowed headlights from locomotives from the nearby train yard.","In 1899, a New York company, Klaw and Erlanger, leased the theatre for five years for $4000. The story attracted attention because New Yorkers were taking interest in Birmingham’s new theatre life and <em>The New York Times </em>even reported on it. O’Brien’s Opera House attracted large crowds from all parts of the young city until 1900 when the larger and more beautiful Jefferson Theatre opened a few blocks away. The Opera House would reopen in 1906 under different ownership as The Gaiety, a burlesque house. The Gaiety closed in 1912 and was demolished in 1915, but theatre was just beginning to flourish in Birmingham.","According to Don Haarbauer, theatre in Birmingham is unique in the South because the city was founded after the Civil War and therefore has few ties to the society of the “Old South.” The city never had an aristocracy devoted to the arts. Instead, artistic interests were left to the middle class. Haarbauer says that this allowed theatre to thrive in downtown for many years. It started to see its decline, however, with the rise of suburban multiplexes."],"display_date":"1890 - 1910","search_date":"1900-07-02","locations":[{"id":206,"lat":33.553582253,"lng":-86.8959288939,"zoom":9,"place":"JEFFERSON, Alabama"},{"id":8931,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":203,"tag":"Birmingham, Alabama"},{"id":955,"tag":"Theatre"},{"id":579,"tag":"New York City"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":62,"school_id":10}},{"id":5484,"title":"Excellent Progress on the New York Subway","course_id":85,"status":"P","start_date":"9/27/02","end_date":"10/28/04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","On September 27, 1902 the <em>Scientific American</em> highlighted the development of the first New York City subway. The monthly <em>Scientific American</em> magazine, which focused on scientific discoveries and technological innovations around the world, detailed the progress of the subway through the use of various diagrams and articles.  The New York Subway was well underway during the publication of the article and was scheduled to be completed ahead of its previous publicized date. The newly created transportation network would be utilized to further stimulate the economic, social, and transportation needs of New York City’s residents."," ","Subway systems were integral in the economic development of New York City. The subway system allowed citizens to continue to expand outward from the densely settled area around Manhattan and Brooklyn and thrive by allowing traditionally geographically disadvantaged citizens to travel further from their homes. This allowed many citizens to have a greater sense of freedom and a broader social and economical reach. The availability of new forms of transit allowed these individuals to get to their destinations cheaper and more efficiently without sole reliance on elevated commuter railroads or horse drawn forms of transportation. The construction of the New York Subway facilitated the creation of many new jobs and a consistent supply of work by linking many different businesses with customers that were previously inaccessible and allowing both parties to benefit from its usage."," ","The creation of the New York Subway system was a great engineering achievement in the early 1900s. The <em>Scientific American</em> article stated the project required the excavation of over 1,700,000 cubic yards of earth and the employment of over 65,000 tons of steel in its construction.  One of the biggest concerns with a project of this magnitude was allowing other transportation systems to operate without disruption during construction. Much of the modern infrastructure of New York City was already in place and it was of great concern to leave it undisturbed. It was necessary to relocate gas, water, and electric lines while excavating the tunnels and connecting the underground network. While removing the millions of yards of debris, it was of great importance to maintain the structural integrity of the tunnel. Tunnels were dug using a method known as \"Cut and Cover\". Through this method, one side of the street was excavated to a depth of at least 30 feet, the subway tunnel was constructed, and eventually it was covered upon completion. In contrast to previously constructed shallow subway tunnels, the New York City Subway tunnels were supported in all directions by concrete walls and utilized a network of steel beams and waterproofing. This structural composure added many different benefits to the subway system. In cases when it was necessary to excavate both sides of a street simultaneously, support bridges and trestles were erected to maintain street access for ground transportation. Engineers used these systems to minimize any detrimental effects above the surface while they continued to further expand the New York subway system belowground."," ","Many of the building supplies that were designated to be used in the production of the New York Subway were shared with above-ground transportation systems. The materials used for the subway tracks were adopted from the above-ground trolleys. While the availability of trolley tracks was a benefit, it also facilitated the need to develop new solutions in regards to powering the tracks. Engineers carefully worked to retrofit the trolley tracks and modify the foundation the tracks were laid on to facilitate the delivery of electricity to the subway line."," ","Upon the first day of its completion, over 150,000 eager riders rode the New York subway system according to an article in the<em> New York Times </em>dated October 28, 1904. The first train arrived at One Hundred and Forty-Fifth Street from City Hall Park in exactly twenty six minutes and the reality of rapid transit was realized by many New Yorkers. The articles in <em>Scientific American</em> and <em>The New York Times </em>did an exceptional job stirring public interest for the new transportation system. These articles placed an emphasis on the many attractive features that the New York Subway had to offer and highlighted the many different architectural and engineering achievements. The<em> New York Times </em>article had a broader focus and placed a lesser emphasis on the intricate construction process of the system.    In contrast, The <em>Scientific American</em> article focused primarily on building details and engineering aspects of the project and was intended for readers with a scientific interest in the project."],"display_date":"September 27, 1902 - October 28, 1904","search_date":"1903-10-13","locations":[{"id":49747,"lat":40.7964015502,"lng":-73.8979738005,"zoom":10,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":792,"tag":"Transportation"},{"id":598,"tag":"New York"},{"id":1364,"tag":"Subway"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":85,"school_id":43}},{"id":5764,"title":"Racial Relationships within the Suburban Community","course_id":112,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/55","end_date":"12/31/73","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The large amount of social change that occurred within the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century arose from the push toward equality between the groups of people urging the nation for integration.  These groups pushed for the basic rights for people of any gender, race, or sexual-orientation.  This desire to change the nation led to many government and social acts to protect and provide these oppressed groups with basic rights that had been stripped from them, but these changes where not over-night successes.  It took years for the effects of these changes to be felt.","One of the most commonly discussed topics that arouse from the civil rights movement is racial equality, arising from the dissatisfaction of the black community after the war.  There was a strong drive to rid the nation of the bigotry and prejudice that constantly followed them everywhere.  Eventually there was a slow process of integration and ever growing opportunity for the African American community, but along with this success, there was the presence of opposition and subtle condescension by some members of the white community.","The movement of more and more black families into the typical suburban “white” neighborhoods, for example, usually caused some form of confrontation in one way or another.  In the county of Westchester, New York, there seemed to have developed a fad that came to be called “Rent-a-Black parties” by the African American community and “Integrated Parties” by the members of the white community.  They usually dealt with the invitation of a black guest by white hostesses, as a form of acceptance into the community.  Many times these party invitations did stem from a friendship and shared interest, but there were those invitations that arose as a subtle form of ridicule.  Eventually these forms of “community acceptance” did go into decline as the peculiarity associated with the “new black family” by the white community became less and less of an issue."],"display_date":"1955 - 1973","search_date":"1964-07-01","locations":[{"id":30037,"lat":40.9100159753,"lng":-73.7674032747,"zoom":9,"place":"Westchester, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":1787,"tag":"Suburbs"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":705,"tag":"Community"},{"id":629,"tag":"race"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":5771,"title":"<strong>Women's Suffrage Parade in New York</strong>","course_id":115,"status":"P","start_date":"1/2/07","end_date":"1/2/07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Women did not have the right to vote in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, nor were they allowed to participate in any form of politics. They were not satisfied with such inequality. A visiting European dignitary -- Paul H.B. d'Estournelles de Constant -- noted the commitment shown by American women to achieve their rights. He noted that people laughed at the woman who claims the right to vote. Therefore, women pushed the boundary in setting up movements that enabled them to get involved in political activities. “The movement in favor of votes for women is a protest of outraged morality against the masculine infringements of politics on private life, conscience and individual liberty” (Estournelles de Constant p.72). \" I have heard the most frivolous society women admire the grandeur of an immense procession that went past their windows in New York. it was a women's demonstration, carried out on a winter day, amid rain and mud. Thousands and thousands of women, of all ages, all classes and all kinds, marched past, without distinction of place, forgetful of the times in which they lived, of their inequalities of station, of their joys and sorrows, their minds fixed upon a common purpose -- the emancipation of their sex and the right to act, compete, protest and vote in public as well as in private.\" (p.68)","Estournelles notes that eventually women finally earned the right to vote, in eleven states initially. In 1912, six states -- California, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Colorado and Washington -- had been won over to the principle of votes for women; the last five being among the least populous states in the Union (p.72).","The women’s rights movement changed the landscape of our society into what we know today.

Kovic found himself being treated in unbearable conditions by nurses and doctors who were often being overworked and unsupported. Kovic laid in his own filth at times while hospital staff could not make it to him to clean up his area or change his bedpan. Not only was the hospital run down and grossly understaffed but the nurses and doctors often had horrible attitudes towards the war and the veterans. Nurses even told Kovic how “nobody gives a crap about the war in Vietnam” while rats run around the filthy floors scavenging food. Meanwhile, the government failed to recognize severe problems in their VA hospitals.","            Throughout the 1960s and 1970s thousands of Vietnam veterans were coming home wounded from the war. Whether they came home with a bullet wound or missing a limb, they often spent time in VA hospitals across the nation. These hospitals often were kept in poor conditions mainly because of the lack of nurses and money that the government was spending on the war. Wounded veteran Kovic recalled that, \"It never makes any sense to us how the government can keep asking for money for weapons and leave us lying in our own filth.” The government prioritized their spending more on the war effort and less on the veterans and their treatment after returning home.","            The conditions in these hospitals and treatment of patients were often made worse because of the nursing shortage that was occurring at the time. As Kara Dixon has noted, army nurses during World War Two often numbered around forty or fifty thousand. During the Vietnam War this number reached an all time low of less than five thousand army nurses. This shortage caused many issues in the dark days of the war in Vietnam when thousands of soldiers arrived home wounded and in need of assistance.","            Since the lack of Army nurses was growing during the Vietnam War this forced the hiring of many civilian nurses and doctors to work in VA hospitals. This often led to a lack of personal care from the nurses and an understaffing of many of the hospitals. It was not uncommon for civilian nurses to oppose the war and they would let veterans know about it often. Kovic remembers vividly the day when a hospital nurse came to him and said “You can take your Vietnam and shove it up your ass.\" A comment like this showed the overall attitude of some of the nurses and the poor conditions that many of these veterans would have to return home to after serving their country."," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":"March 6, 1968","search_date":"1968-03-06","locations":[{"id":21194,"lat":40.8370495,"lng":-73.8654295,"zoom":8,"place":"Bronx, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":292,"tag":"Vietnam"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":2873,"tag":"Veteran"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":153,"school_id":3}},{"id":6766,"title":"A Shocking Revelation in Medicine","course_id":177,"status":"P","start_date":"1868-01-01","end_date":"1871-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["A physician sat at his patient’s bedside, dumbfounded. Typically docile, well-mannered, and pious, she shouted obscenities, overcome with rage displayed in forceful expressions of perversions. Dr. Alphonso Rockwell could do little to comfort the woman and spent most of the night there. The evening was interrupted when William Miller, a kind-hearted and elderly “electrician,” arrived at the door with a single, ordinary induction coil. Amusedly, Rockwell watched the uneducated man administer a dose of electricity, hereby witnessing unforeseen positive results. ","In <em>Rambling recollections: an autobiography</em>, Rockwell detailed his experience treating a woman with brain inflammation and impotence in remedying the increasingly common condition. Historical and sociological research published in<em> Pushbutton Psychiatry</em> explained its growing presence as the consequence of evolving American culture. In the years following the Civil War, new liberties complicated life and affected the psyche. Nerve sensitivities were exhausted by new demands of politics, religion, education, and philosophical thought. Women were deemed particularly susceptible, ill-equipped to handle such great mental activity. In 1868, medicine provided no relief for these mental afflictions, but Rockwell’s patient provided him undeniable proof of the need for alternative treatment.","Research into Miller’s method proved risky. Electrotherapeutics were mentioned only in hushed voices, considered little more than quackery. The stigma stemmed from its cultivation by ignorant laymen, based solely on experience rather than pathology or electrophysiology. Its early application was crude, a current forced into the body using a battery or induction coil and wire—without knowledge of various electric currents or their effects on diseases. The media further influenced the stigma with advertisements for illegitimate at-home devices, rendering physicians powerless to distinguish electrotherapeutics as medical science. Entering this field could quickly tarnish a doctor’s reputation. ","However, the meeting with Miller gripped him. Despite professional hazards, Rockwell retired his general practitioner title and began an apprenticeship under him. He began his own practice and recorded thousands of cases with his silent partner, Dr. George Beard. He experimented on charity cases directed from Beard’s clinic to develop theories and standard applications. After only two years, they accumulated enough research to publish several articles, which piqued substantial curiosity in the medical community. In 1871, they published <em>A practical treatise on the medical and surgical uses of electricity, including localized and general electrization</em>. This lengthy piece explained what lay-practitioners could not: electrization was a stimulating tonic that immediately disrupted ailments and, after long-term exposure, improved disposition and strengthened the brain and muscles’ capacity for labor. This revelation was invaluable in remedying the overly-taxed population. "," ","Rockwell could not have known his visit to a hysterical patient would be a catalyst for the scientific acceptance of a quack treatment. He provided strong evidence that electrotherapeutics could increase the ability to tackle the demands of modernizing civilization. Its merit was validated by prestigious individuals seeking its benefits and widespread introduction of electrotherapeutic devices in institutions. Though methodology hardly resembles its beginning, the practice continues to be used in the modern day, despite the persistent stigma and controversy that accompany it. "],"display_date":"1868 - 1871","search_date":"1869-12-31","locations":[{"id":53110,"lat":40.8115504,"lng":-73.9464769,"zoom":8,"place":"Harlem"},{"id":8915,"lat":40.7127753,"lng":-74.0059728,"zoom":8,"place":"NEW YORK, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":3472,"tag":"alternative medicine"},{"id":3489,"tag":"Electrotherapeutics"},{"id":3490,"tag":"Electricity"},{"id":3491,"tag":"Shock therapy"},{"id":3492,"tag":"Quack medicine"}],"course":{"name":"The History of Medicine and Public Health","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":177,"school_id":94}}]}
