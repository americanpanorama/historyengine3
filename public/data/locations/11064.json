He went to the military academy of West Point where, due to an administrative error, his name was put in as Ulysses S. Grant and his classmates began calling him Sam. Graduating 21<sup>st</sup> in a class of 39 he was not an exceptional student.  Indeed, he was not expected to become the commander of the Army of the Potomac due to his standings in school."," He was first noticed for his leadership in the Mexican War of 1846-1848 where he was awarded three awards two of which were for gallantry and one was for meritorious conduct. After the war had ended, he was forced to be stationed far from his family in remote regions. Drinking became his way to pass time which lead to him being viewed poorly. In 1854 He resigned from his position in the military to avoid being kicked out.","Grant, having to fall back onto his family to survive, moved to St. Louis, Missouri. He made many attempts to keep his family afloat in society being a farmer and other odd jobs. Eventually he was forced to move to his family’s business in Galena, Illinois where he took up the position of a clerk at the store. The Civil War began in 1861 and Grant rushed to join and regain his lost glory.","            First, he was stationed as a colonel of the 21<sup>st</sup> Illinois Infantry. Grant proved himself a great leader which allowed for him to climb in the ranks. Quickly he managed to gain the brigadier general in July 1861 then, in September was given command of the whole Distract of Southeast Missouri. In 1862 Grant earned the nickname “Unconditional Surrender” after his success in western Tennessee at Fort Henry and Fort Donelson.","After being recognized for his excellent military prowess Grant was promoted to lieutenant-general and the next day took command of the Army of the Potomac. Grant arrived in Washington saying “It had been my intention before this to remain in the West, even if I was made lieutenant-general; but when I got to Washington and saw the situation it was plain there here was the point for the commanding general to be.” General Meade was the previous commander of the Army and even suggested that Grant replace him in his command with a general he knew better from the west. This changed Grants view of Meade for the better stating “It is men who wait to be selected, and not those who seek, from whom we may always expect the most efficient service.”","April 6<sup>th</sup> 1862 Grant suffered great losses at the Battle of Shiloh after being overpowered by 40,000 confederate soldiers on the first day of fighting. They fell back to a defensive position on a road the position was known as the “Hornet’s Nest” the rebels were not able to break the position and their general, Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston, was mortally wounded and was replaced by P.G.T. Beauregard. On April 7<sup>th</sup>, Federal reinforcements came and helped overwhelm the Confederates. This was the bloodiest battle in the United States history at that point and caused many to call for Grant to be removed from command President Lincoln defended him saying “I can’t spare this man. He fights.”","Like any military campaign, Grant had his victories and losses. Grant taking over command of the Army of the Potomac was important for not only showing his strength but also the strength of the union. Without Grants aggressive offensives and leadership the Civil War could have lasted much longer."," "," "," "],"display_date":"April 27, 1822 - April 9, 1865","search_date":"1843-10-18","locations":[{"id":53022,"lat":43.9109016,"lng":-78.7666972,"zoom":9,"place":"St. Louis, Missouri, United States of Am"},{"id":52855,"lat":38.9071923,"lng":-77.0368707,"zoom":9,"place":"Washington, D.C."},{"id":53023,"lat":35.5174913,"lng":-86.5804473,"zoom":9,"place":"Tennessee, United States of America"},{"id":53024,"lat":42.4166744,"lng":-90.4290168,"zoom":9,"place":"Galena, Illinois, United States of Ameri"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":332,"tag":"battle of shiloh"},{"id":3246,"tag":"Ulysses S.

With in-land battles being crucial in determining the victor, often Navy triumph’s would transpire to in-land achievements as sea, and river battles would aid soldiers in combat. That understood importance resulted in the  Union expanding the Navy  by approximately six hundred percent. Out of this, bold strategy, technological innovation, and bravery was demonstrated by Union marines, and sailors. This can be seen as in just one battle, the Second Battle of Fort Fisher, fiftyone sailors and marine earned the Medal of Honor; one of the highest awards a serviceman can receive. With this the American Civil War proved to be paramount in the development of our contemporary Navy. Having had great feats accomplished by the expansion, the Civil War presented the Navy with many first accomplishments in battle and technological advancements.","Civil War Navy battles depicted many acts of savvy military strategy that fathered great Union successes. In one Battle, the Battle of Port Royal that took place November 7th, 1861, disastrous weather compelled Union leaders to terminate an inland operation in South Carolina and instead attack Port Royal Sound. This ultimately was a desirable action as Union ingenuity, along with their intense determination earned them a  successful campaign. Lasting four and a half hours, the Union victory resulted in them being able to take full control of the Port. This gave the North access to the Charleston harbour; which enabled them to fortify the blockade on a crucial sea port (Trust). Another significant battle was that of Forts Henry and Donelson which occurred February 16, 1862. In this Navy battle Union Leader Andrew H. Foote, working alongside famed Ulysses S. Grant, led a flotilla (a fleet of ships) out of Illinois in order to operate an attack on Fort Henry; which resulted in the Tennessee River opening up to the North. This action as well as that of  instantaneously  pivoting to the East to conquer Fort Donelson on the Cumberland river led to Union victory. With that, the fall of the port then fell onto the control of the Union as it eventually forced Nashville to surrender; the first capital to fall to the Union (Trust). With all of that, it should be noted that with the Second Battle of Fort Fisher taking place January 13-15, 1865, the Union victory allowed confederate commerce via the seaside to be terminated entirely throughout the remaining portion of the war.","The Civil War was when Americans first used Ironclad ships in battle. This revolutionized Naval warfare as it then permitted ships to gain speed, and hold larger guns, changing the atmosphere of war significantly. It was at this time period that torpedoes were also introduced to Naval warfare, as well as the use of submarine to gain the element of a surprise attack and intel (Mil). This rapid increase of technology within a relatively short period of time is indicative to how imperative most individuals believed technological innovation and advancement was, as well as the production of competent ships and boats. This can be seen as in 1853 America had but only eighteen ships, but after the eruption of the Civil war developed ninety ships. One of the most memorable ironclad ships was Monitor; led by Union forces in a heated battle against the Merrimac. As these type of ships were previously unknown, their impact was impressive.","On September 5th, Thursday, John G Morrison stated in his diary that he was “ turned in last night like a trooper’s horse, ready to bounce,” and that he was “not disturbed” by the action of entering battle. This kind of bravery and selflessness is not an isolated case within one soldier as many Union and Confederate men exhibited immense amount of bravery before entering battle (Morrison). So even though many a times, it was dark and or cold, many were still able to perform their duties knowing that it is what was needed of them.","Though overall Naval victories were not as imperative as in-land victories, winning the war on water was an essential aspect of the American Civil War. It aided the Union into victory as with the sea and river campaigns, it permitted them to take over crucial ports and fortify blockages that cut of Southern sea commerce, and potential aid foreign states. As well as this, throughout the American Civil War many technological advancements and innovations were made; the first ironclads were made, submarines were used in warfare, and torpedoes were introduced.","<strong><br /></strong>"," "],"display_date":"November 7, 1861 - January 15, 1865","search_date":"1863-06-12","locations":[{"id":53046,"lat":43.9508633,"lng":-79.7641511,"zoom":8,"place":"Tennessee, USA"},{"id":53047,"lat":43.9079666,"lng":-78.4576144,"zoom":8,"place":"Illinois, USA"},{"id":53048,"lat":43.9138071,"lng":-78.6287105,"zoom":8,"place":"Fort Henry, USA"},{"id":53049,"lat":43.9900275,"lng":-77.7131275,"zoom":8,"place":"Fort Fisher, USA"}],"tags":[{"id":113,"tag":"Navy"},{"id":2966,"tag":"American Civil War"},{"id":599,"tag":"Technology"},{"id":3308,"tag":"Battle tactics"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}}]}
