Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox courthouse thus ending the Civil War. Grant's tactics surrounded Confederate soldiers to such an extent making it impossible for them to either further fight or escape.  Lee's army numbers less than 20,000 men, and he has little choice but to give up and surrender. The meeting at the home of Wilbur McLean in Appomattox between the two generals lasted 2 and a half hours going back and forth, and eventually Lee signed the terms that Grant proposed. The terms included three demands; Lee must turn over all of the rebel armies, artillery, and property to officers designated by Grant, he must disband the entire rebel army, every officer and man was allowed to return home and would not be harmed or disturbed by authorities as long as they obeyed the laws under which they lived.  Lee, having signed these terms, this effectively meant the dissolution of the Confederate army and the Confederacy as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;The end of the Civil War marked one of the most significant turning points in history for the south, not only had they been defeated and their dreams of secession destroyed, but it put an end to their southern way of life.  Lee and his rebel army fought until the end, they never gave up on their goals and somehow maintained an optimistic attitude to attack when outnumbered and out powered five to one. But the surrender to the North dissolves hopes of freedom, and the people deeply fear what awaits them as they enter back into the Union under President Lincoln.  On April 9th, Lee realized that he had lost too many men and that the Confederacy itself had lost too many men and too many states to survive, and reluctantly he raised the white flag, marking the end of the Confederacy."],"display_date":"April 9, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-09","locations":[{"id":13628,"lat":37.3722533013,"lng":-78.8121458288,"zoom":9,"place":"APPOMATTOX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":712,"title":"Lee Ordered the Disarming of his Army\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-10","end_date":"1865-04-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["April 10th, the day after General Lee surrendered to Grant effectively terminating the Civil War, Lee issued a speech containing a political position, and a thanking and discharge of his army. In this speech Lee announced that the Confederate spirit had not been, nor ever could be conquered.  He commended his men for their loyalty, and their constancy and devotion to [their] country.' He argued that the southern cause will not perish nor be defeated under the Union; a southerner's independence is deeper and internally drive, it is not something that can be suffocated by a defeat. Southerners, he argued can live a separate independence,' meaning a life in the defined place of the South with stable relationships.

Important enough that it was stored with the Duke family's personal belongings, one postcard from the late nineteenth century displayed a famous Timothy O'Sullivan photograph taken of the McLean family seated on the steps of their home. The postcard told the story of April 9, 1865, where Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant in the house of Wilmer McLean at Appomattox Court House, Virginia. The two Generals met in a room on the left side of the house and drew up the articles of surrender that marked the end of the War Between the States. The interesting part of the Surrender House history was just beginning as shown by the last line on the back of the postcard - This building was torn down to be rebuilt a St. Louis World's Fair.","The discovery of the postcards in the attic added to the history of the Surrender House. In 1867, the McLean family sold the house and moved to Alexandria, Virginia where Wilmer McLean had been born and built his fortune before marrying the widow Virginia Mason and moving to Appomattox County, Virginia. After transferring hands a few times between the Pascoe and Ragland families, M.E. Dunlap of Niagara Falls, New York, who had lofty plans for the property, eventually bought the house. Originally, his zealous plans were to move the house either to St. Louis as stated in the quote of the postcard or to Chicago for the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893.","Instead of hiring New York architects and contractors, Dunlap kept the process local and hired a Lynchburg, Virginia contracting company by the name of Hardy and Hancock Contractors to draw up blueprints of the house in order to have it successfully dismantled, moved, and rebuilt in its new location. In February of 1893, C. Hubbard of Hardy and Hancock Contractors made five blueprints of the building: the basement plan and house section, the front porch cornices and columns, the window and mantle details, the first floor plan, and the second floor plan. Unfortunately, the plans to move the house to the World's Fair never materialized, so Dunlap decided to have the house moved to Washington, D.C. where it would be on permanent display. Dunlap ordered for complete dismantlement of the house before running into a shortage of cash and legal problems. Thus, the house sat boxed in Appomattox County for 50 years where the wood rotted and the bricks crumbled.","Either a member of the Duke family bought the postcard at Craighill and Jones, Inc. in Lynchburg, Virginia or someone - a friend or a relative - sent it to the Duke family. The Craighill and Jones, Inc. label affixed to the postcard remained although there was no address present anywhere on it. At the time the McLean House postcard was printed, Appomattox County residents including the Duke family believed the house would not remain at its current location, and only pictures and postcards would serve as reminders of the house's rich history. The Duke family looked into the past, saw the house as a reminder of a moment in their lives, and realized that the Surrender House was a piece of history not only to within Appomattox County and Virginia but nationally as far as Chicago and St. Louis."],"display_date":1893,"search_date":"1893-07-02","locations":[{"id":13631,"lat":37.3722533013,"lng":-78.8121458288,"zoom":9,"place":"APPOMATTOX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2641,"title":"Religion in the Old South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1813-01-01","end_date":"1825-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" Religion was a common tie that bound the South together in the early nineteenth century.

This license enabled Mr. Austin to distill from domestic materials for one week only. The rules set forth by this license were issued by the United States, not the state of Virginia. Mr. Austin's license shows how alcohol was an important part of the social scene of the South. According to Charles Wilson and William Ferris, the South has always been into heavy drinking, even when Virginia was only a colony, and the colonists heavily on many occasions. Southerners were also known for the variety of drinks that they consumed. Wilson and Ferris explain that brandies were made from apples, peaches, pears, and other local fruit...imported wines/ graced wealthy tables... (and) All classes drank rum, which was obtained in exchange for southern commodities. After the Revolution, molasses became expensive, and whiskey became the major drink of the South."," The Upper South, including Buckingham County, became a region for distilling bourbon which was distilled from corn, a crop which grew well in this region. Whiskey stayed as the prominent drink of the South until the mid twentieth century. Many settlers illegally distilled alcohol on the frontier of the South. Because alcohol was a large part of life in the South, the residents experienced both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, alcohol became the social beverage to most in the South. Whether it was beer at a small farmer's get together or wine at a wealthy planter's dinner party, alcohol became the drink of the social scene in the antebellum South. On the negative side, alcohol brought about widespread alcoholism and violence. "," The negative effects of widespread alcohol use became the main motives for the temperance movements throughout the nineteenth century. The temperance movement took a while to gain a hold in the South, but the religious revivals helped this movement gain momentum. Some townspeople supported this movement, included those strongly influenced by the religious revivals, but they were strongly outnumbered by the alcohol supporters. The wealthy planters still enjoyed drinking as a social activity. Small farmers benefited economically from distilling. The temperance movement of the early nineteenth century accounted for 44 percent of the population of the country, but only eight percent of the South; none of the southern states adopted prohibition in this time period.  Many immigrants had settled in the South along the frontier, making this issue strongly divided among the North and the South; these immigrants came from backgrounds where drinking was a dominate part of their culture. Many of these immigrants had settled along Virginia's frontier, making Virginia a wet state where alcohol supporters outnumbered prohibition supporters. Despite this tension, alcohol remained dominant in the social scene of the South in the early nineteenth century and many farmers sought to distill their own alcohol as Mr. Austin did."],"display_date":"September 30, 1817 - October 7, 1817","search_date":"1817-10-03","locations":[{"id":13687,"lat":37.5453300062,"lng":-78.5815976608,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2691,"title":"The Expansion of Slavery and its Effect on the South\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-03-25","end_date":"1820-03-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["As a Congressman from Buckingham County and member of the Virginia House of Delegates, Archibald Austin was always in the know about local events. In a letter from Waller Taylor in Washington to Mr. Austin, Mr. Taylor explained the happenings in Washington and all of the current political events that were taking place, such as admitting new states and territories. In his March 25 letter, the Florida question was put to rest with a Treaty with Spain. Waller Taylor expressed his gratefulness that the Missouri question was settled, despite his disagreement -- These are not as bad as they appear upon first blush...This is at least some consolation, but it does not justify compromising the principles of the Constitution. "," Taylor's letter speaks of the addition of new states to the United States that sparked heated political discussion. Americans on both sides of the conflict were concerned about upsetting the balance of slave states and non-slave sates in Congress. If the numbers favored either side, their way of life would come to dominate the country. The addition of both Florida and Missouri sparked extremely intense debating between the North and the South. ","As a slave holding state, Virginia wanted to expand slavery into the new states so that the South would have the upper hand in Congress and eventually make slavery the common way of life for the entire country. Certain territories were admitted with slavery and others were not. When Florida entered the United States in 1809, it was a territory that allowed slavery. On the other hand, Missouri entered the country in 1820 - its position on slavery was highly debated in Congress. The Missouri Compromise called for Missouri and Maine both to enter the United States at the same time. Missouri would be a slave state and Maine would enter as a free state. The Fugitive Slave Law was strengthened and the slave trade in in Washington DC was abolished. From this point forward, slavery in territories would be determined by 36'30 latitude line that was Missouri's southern border. "," Although the Missouri question was settled, Virginians and the rest of the South saw very little compromise. Both sides felt like they got the bad side of the arrangement. The South wanted to extend slavery into as many territories as possible and this put a damper on this hope for expansion.

The cuts were not deep and Davis was not seriously injured. The black man escaped by running down the railroad tracks and away from Davis and other townspeople. Mr. Davis had no idea who the man was or what had provoked him to such a violent act. "," However, the next day the young son of George Burton was with a black man named Frederick Claytor. They decided to go tramping together, but Burton was appalled by the black man's behavior and reprimanded him for his repulsive acts. Heated words were exchanged and the Claytor pulled out a pistol and shot Burton in the shoulder. Claytor was arrested in Chesterfield County and was taken for examination to Justice Perkins. It was suspected that Claytor was the same man who had assaulted Mr. Davis, but Mr. Davis failed to show up at the jail to identify him. "," The judge's verdict in this case is unknown, but this case was important because it showed the fear that white's had towards blacks and the violence that some blacks showed to whites in retaliation for their inferior status in Southern society. Violence was a tool that whites used to establish the status quo and order within Southern society. However, when violence was used by blacks against whites, that social order was disrupted. As can be seen in this episode, black violence was portrayed as irrational and unpredictable. White anger was excusable, but black anger was disturbing and unjust. In many ways, this episode reflected the inferiority of blacks that many whites believed was inherent. While Claytor was a tramp, Burton only engaged in tramp-like activities. Black stereotypes were also enforced in this story, as social outcasts who were damaging to society. This distinction between blacks and whites was reflected in the paper and in the way that whites treated blacks.

Hubard of Washington, D.C. wrote a letter to his nephew, James L. Hubard, of Buckingham County, Virginia. James was a young man at the time, still in the formative stages of his life, and it appears that he and his uncle corresponded regularly about education, family life, and women in central and northern Virginia. E.W. began the letter by acknowledging his receipt of James' last dispatch, dated the twentieth of January; during the mid-nineteenth century, parcel mail was still transported largely by horse-drawn carriage, so a three-week delivery period from Buckingham to Washington would not have been out of the ordinary. In the subsequent paragraphs, James' uncle addressed several aspects of the affluent, civilized lifestyle he led and advises his young nephew on the values of a southern gentleman. ","First, E.W. praised James for reading the new books that he sent to his nephew. James was very studious and intelligent, qualities evidenced by the fact that he finished the books very quickly and impressed his uncle with his voracious appetite for learning. E.W. could only hope, he wrote, that William, Robert, and Edmund (James' little brothers) follow in [his] good example and engage in reading and learning new literature. Next, the well heeled gentleman from the capitol city shared in his nephew's excitement over the success of his hunting and fishing expeditions. Although James wrote that he was a proficient shooter, he also expressed his dissatisfaction with his attempts at trapping. His uncle responded by offering his opinion on the two methods of hunting game, praising the virtues of trapping animals when he stated, It takes more sense and skill to out-wit and catch them, than to take your gun and shoot them. Trapping, he declared, is accomplished by tact and skill while hunting with a rifle depends on the force of powder and shot; this emphasis on guile and cunning is a recurring theme of E.W. Hubard's letter. Lastly, E.W. encouraged James to develop his musical talent, expressing his belief that those who are gifted with a particular acumen for singing or playing an instrument should nurture those talents and develop their abilities to fruition. In closing, James' benevolent uncle requested that he pass on his love to the rest of the family, including his younger brothers, and to tell them that he wishes he could one day correspond with them in the same manner as he and James did then. ","E.W. Hubard's letter to his nephew embodies several facets of southern gentlemanliness and reveals a great deal about the education and upbringing of affluent young men in central Virginia. E.W. urged his nephew to read as much as he can, not only in an effort to enhance his intrinsic worth, but also to uphold the tradition of the family of scholarly appearance and reputation. He repeatedly moralized the values of cleverness, exemplified in his lecture on the desirability of the crafty entrapment of game animals rather than the brute force method of shooting from afar. According to E. Brooks Holifield's <em>The Gentlemen Theologians</em>, Among the goals of piety, in relation to the ideal of southern gentlemanliness, were introspective watchfulness, purity of intention, strenuous inner discipline, and self-control. E.W. Hubard echoed these qualities in his letter to his nephew when he claimed that gentlemanly behavior develops from a keen intellect, quick wit, a rapacious desire for reading, and the ability to excel at music and dance. These characteristics and high aspirations colored the various political, social, and economic interactions of southern white gentlemen during the mid-nineteenth century in central Virginia as well as the American South as a whole."],"display_date":"February 9, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-09","locations":[{"id":13689,"lat":37.5453300062,"lng":-78.5815976608,"zoom":9,"place":"BUCKINGHAM, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3755,"title":"Confederate Surrender at Appomattox Courthouse\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-10","end_date":"1865-04-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 10, 1865, General Robert E. Lee wrote to the Headquarters Army of Northern Virginia. The general explained the Confederate Army's surrender was caused by the Union's overwhelming numbers and resources. General Lee continued to commend his soldiers for their bravery and devotion to the Confederate Army. He explains that any continuation of the conflict would have resulted in enormous loss. He stated I have determined to avoid the useless sacrifice of those whose past services have endeared them to their countrymen. The letter went on to explain that the conditions of the surrender allowed his men to return to their homes and await further instruction. The North held advantages over the Confederacy that increasingly came into play during the course of the Civil War. The Union held an insurmountable advantage over the Confederacy in terms of industrial strength and population. The Union had a population of 22.7 million, compared to the nine million in the Confederate States. Also, the union's industrial capacity allowed for a strong navy, which the South lacked. With its predominately agrarian economy, the South had no way of supplying the demand of its troops. Without any real industrial capabilities the South relied mainly on the cotton trade to gain money and support from foreign countries. However this policy failed due to the naval blockade of the southern coast. General Robert E. Lee's letter emphasized the shortcomings of the South's ability to provide for its army.

Compiled by Stuart McD. Farrar, the census polled residents of the county on June 30, 1850 and organized the data by household. Each household was numbered and every person who lived in the house was included within the family. Each family had to report every person who lived in the house as well as their gender, age, and place of birth. Additionally, the census reported the value of each estate, occupation of the residents, and the number of slaves on each farm. ","    The information that illustrated what kind of citizens owned slaves revealed much about the social hierarchy of Appomattox County. While most household heads reported their main occupation as either laborer or farmer, very few concluded that they owned more than one slave. In fact, those households that owned at least fifty slaves or more typically reported an additional primary occupation, such as the Flood family, where Henry D. Flood, the head of the family, was an attorney. Additionally, very few masters who owned at least fifty slaves were under the age of fifty. Most families were incredibly young, such as Major and Jettrina Powell, both under age twenty-five. The Powells owned no slaves and resided in Appomattox County as a family starting their new life together.  ","    It is clear from the census that Appomattox County, unlike certain areas of Virginia, was a region of developing infrastructure. While the central Virginia town of Lynchburg had one of the most successful regional tobacco markets, western counties like Appomattox were more focused on self-sufficient farming. Several farms grew tobacco in order to earn more income, but few farmers made a large profit. Competition with the wealthier Virginia counties that produced cash crops was not possible, and so the area was mostly home to families who had established themselves as yeoman farmers.

As Lee read the terms over, he noticed that Grant allowed the officers to keep their side-arms, private horses, and baggage.

Hummel, General Robert Edward Lee reflects on the Civil War and his role in helping heal the wounds between North and South in an attempt to mend the shattered Union.  In Lee’s own words he spoke of the South’s role in re-entering the Union, “What course I shall pursue I have not decided upon, and each man must be the judge of his own action.  We must all however resolve on one thing not to abandon our country.  Now more than at any other time, Virginia and every other state in the south needs us.  We must try and with as little delay as possible go to work to build up their prosperity.”  Lee further encouraged the south in its position toward peace with the North in stating, “To secure such a peace it was not only necessary that the south should abandon its arms, but abandon also all enmity and negative position, and accept with cheerful alacrity the changes of the time.”  Lee’s surrender at Appomattox ended the bloodiest war the U.S. has ever seen, and it is difficult to imagine that this task could have been carried out by a man with more honor and respect than General Lee. “Robert E. Lee had no bitter words for his former enemies.  By word and personal example, the general continued to lead the South—not to hatred and defiance but to reunion and reconciliation.”","                One of the most intriguing aspects of the interview was Hummel’s discussion on Lee’s indictment to the federal court of Norfolk for treason by President Andrew Johnson.  Proceedings for Lee’s indictment were stalled however due to General Grant’s demand that the charges be dropped arguing that treason charges would compromise the arrangements for surrender made at Appomattox.  Though revered by the nation after the Civil War, Robert E. Lee remained unscathed to the analyses and criticism of many historians.  In his book Lee Considered, Alan Nolan offers a different side to the Lee phenomena as if to emphasize that much of what is known about Lee has been recorded by historians and journalists biased toward the Confederate general.  Nolan offers a different approach to Lee's role in helping mend ties between north and south arguing that his role was in fact quite limited and insignificant.","Ever the gentleman, Lee earned the respect of his foes as well as the love of his officers and soldiers.  Hummel depicts a portrait of Lee in the aftermath of Appomattox by stating, “ All men admitted his high sense of honor, his unostentatious practice of all the Christian virtues, his true religious feeling, his calm endurance of untoward results, and his quiet observance of the duties of life.” "],"display_date":"April 9, 1865","search_date":"1865-04-09","locations":[{"id":13628,"lat":37.3722533013,"lng":-78.8121458288,"zoom":9,"place":"APPOMATTOX, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":657,"tag":"Appamattox Court House"},{"id":656,"tag":"Robert E.

There he learned that the wicked had no hope beyond the grave, scaring him into searching for a friend, which he found in God. His newfound faith instilled a positive outlook within him that God would always be there to help him. His master at the time did not understand religion, claiming he could whip the fancy of religion out of him; so he tried, but upon failing to break Tom’s spirits, he was defeated, and Tom was no longer whipped after that day. Although beaten and bloodied, Thomas felt strong and whole because of the Spirit that warmed his heart, the love of God defeating the physical brutality of his slave master. With his master’s permission, Tom joined the church; his master himself thought if there was a Christian in the world, it was Tom. Throughout his life, Thomas Anderson’s faith in God was unshaken.","It is commonly known that to be enslaved is to endure a life of brutality at the discretion of one’s slave owner; the case of Thomas Anderson was no different. In order to combat the ideal of such cruel treatment, slave owners would allow their slaves some sort of reward, benefit, or “freedom,” as Saidiya Hartman discussed in her book, <em>Scenes of Subjection, </em>about masters who allowed for festivities such as a Christmas party. Thomas’s slave master allowed for his participation in the church, which thus can be perceived as one of the “freedoms” a slaveholder may have provided. This “freedom” is simply a tool utilized by slave owners to justify to themselves that their ruling and power over their slaves is not as harsh as it seems, when indeed it is. By offering such privileges, the slaveholder hopes to pacify his slaves, while also expecting hard work in return; this is exactly what these privileges resulted in, but more so out of fear that if these offerings were not respected, the master’s brutality would intensify. These “freedoms” created fear among slaves, just as a beating would do, being used as a scare tactic to achieve the master’s personal demands. This was a system that instilled fear in slaves, who would succumb to the brutal world they lived in.","Yet another brutal aspect of the life of the enslaved was the inhumanity among the slave trade. Individuals involved in the slave trade were young and single, as this allowed the individual to be as detached from any sense of family bonds and dynamics, therefore being able to separate families without being troubled by conscience. Despite the hardship associated with ones family being separated, Uncle Tom spoke of such matters in a positive light, bringing attention to his hope for a reunion. He did discuss the hardship involved in seeing his children dying, being sold, or being traded and taken away from the family, but he looked to his religious foundations to free him of negative thoughts and a poisonous mentality. His faith in God gave him hope that he and his children would one day be reunited, if not on earth, in the life that followed. Luckily, the “freedom” Thomas was allowed taught him to approach life with his head unbowed. God instilled within him a positive outlook on life that allowed him to carry himself through the hardship, trusting that his faith in the Lord would serve him what he deserved for enduring the life he did."," "],"display_date":1854,"search_date":"1854-07-02","locations":[{"id":52766,"lat":37.4315734,"lng":-78.6568942,"zoom":4,"place":"Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2730,"tag":"Slavery and Religion"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":149,"school_id":2}},{"id":6667,"title":"A Marriage License and its Properties","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1850-01-01","end_date":"12/31/50","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Before and during the Civil War era, marriages were seen as a beneficial contract to, normally, the male spouse.

This was to formally end the Civil War and for General Lee and his army to surrender and go on parole for acts of against the United States. Proceeding towards May 29, 1865 President Andrew Johnson issued a Proclamation of Amnesty and Pardon in the direction of the people of the South who had participated in the Civil War, General Lee was one of these people who submitted an application for a pardon.

One commander that stood out to me was Thomas Jackson. Jackson graduated from West Point, a U.S Military academy around 1846. Being that he graduated around that time he was able to fight in the Mexican War which lasted from 1846-1848.  After fighting in the Mexican War, he went on to pursue a teaching career. After teaching for a while, the secession of Virginia came about in 1861. After Virginia seceded from the Union, jackson took immediate action to join the Confederate army.","<strong><br /></strong>","After joining the army, the first wave of secession was already in place. The first wave lasted from December of 1860 through February of 1861. During the first wave, seven southern states took action and declared their independence from the Union. Throughout the first wave, Jackson hoped that his home state, Virginia, would remain in the Union. Although his home state seceded, he continued to show his loyalty towards his state rather than the Federal Government. In the army, Jackson originally served as colonel until he was promoted to brigadier general under General Joseph E. Johnston. Being that Jackson taught artillery tactics, he would have no problem leading men on the battlefield.","<strong><br /></strong>","Of course the first battle of the war came, and Jackson was ready to fight. The first battle in the Civil War was the Battle of Bull Run. In this first battle Jackson earns his nickname. His nickname comes about through a Union general. As Jackson rushed his men to close a gap against union attack, a Union general said “Look men, there’s Jackson standing like a stone wall”. After that day Thomas Jackson became known as “Stonewall” Jackson.  Some people might question why someone would just be standing in the middle of a battle. Later on during the Civil War, Jackson was eventually commissioned as a major general.","<strong><br /></strong>","Throughout the Civil War, Jackson led his men through some great victories. But little did he know that the end was near. Jackson’s final battle took place in Chancellorsville, Virginia. In this battle, Jackson went to fight with almost two times less men than the opposing Union Army.  The Union came into the battle with about 130,000 soldiers, and Jackson brought about 60,000 soldiers to the battle. Jackson already knew that he had the lower hand in this battle. Being that he had the lower hand he decided to join forces with Robert E. Lee to help fight towards victory.","<br />Out of that 60,000 soldiers, Jackson took 28,000 and  engaged in diversionary attacks against Hooker’s exposed flank. Jackson’s attack caused extreme casualties to the Union force. Following the attacks, Hooker was eventually forced to withdraw his soldiers. Hooker’s withdrawal meant victory for the Confederate Army.  The attacks by Jackson lasted until sunset. Following the end of the conflict, Jackson took some of his men to the forest to scout for approaching Union forces. Because it was night time, a North Carolina regiment mistook the Confederate Army for Union troops and opened fire. After realising that they weren’t Union soldiers, they ceased fire only to find that they had wounded Jackson. Jackson later died because the wounds were too severe for him to survive. Jackson went on to be known as one of the most notorious leaders during the Civil War."],"display_date":"April 16, 1917 - April 18, 1917","search_date":"1917-04-17","locations":[{"id":53067,"lat":38.3084627,"lng":-77.6344334,"zoom":8,"place":"Chancellorsville, Virginia"},{"id":52766,"lat":37.4315734,"lng":-78.6568942,"zoom":8,"place":"Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":2930,"tag":"Virginia"},{"id":2676,"tag":"Stonewall"},{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":3347,"tag":"1861"},{"id":3348,"tag":"Thomas Jackson"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}},{"id":6718,"title":"Green Grass, Dark Nights","course_id":171,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/47","end_date":"1/1/48","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["            One morning while playing on the woodpile, five year old Charles Grandy was approached by his slaveholder who sternly said to him, “Boy, do you see this grass growing along the side of the fence? Well pull it all up.” Grandy, who was born into slavery, dutifully pulled all of the grass out. Immediately after finishing the task his master assigned to him, Grandy was carried to the fields where the cotton and other crops were growing, and he was instructed to pull out all the grass growing near the crops as well. Due to Grandy’s young age, he was not allowed to use any of the gardening tools, so all of the manual labor the little boy was forced to do was done by hand. From that day forward, Charles Grandy’s days of playing were replaced with the daily task of removing all of the grass and weeds growing near the crops on the plantation. ","            Typically, children born into slavery were not immediately aware that they were enslaved. Often there was a specific moment or event that showed the child that he or she was not free.

Occasionally he would be asked to do small errands; however, one may conclude that he did not realize he was doing those small errands due to his enslavement.
