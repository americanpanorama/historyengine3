Brookes sent a letter to his father from his plantation in Jasper and Jones counties, Georgia. In the letter he discussed many problems he was facing on the plantation.  The troubles he wrote about included having to postpone planting, having to buy animals and having to deal with a fire in a field that burned a fence. He began the letter by discussing a delivery of materials by wagon that he had to send back to the city of Madison in the neighboring county.  The address did not clearly state that he was the intended recipient.  One reason the wagon's return was such a setback to Walker was that, among other things, this delivery contained two sacks of salt.  At the time salt was not only a condiment to improve the flavor of food, but a key nutritional component and a preservative. Without enough salt, Walter's health and food supply could have endangered.","In his book Salt: A World History, Mark Kurlansky recognized that salt had been an important substance throughout history.  People first and foremost had a biological need for salt.  Beyond this, though, salt was important because without easy refrigeration techniques, salt was necessary to store meat for later or to send it to sell in other places. This made salt trade and production an important element in the American economy from its earliest years. ","During the American Revolution there had been a series of salt shortages assuring that people in the years following would not forget salt's importance or the difficulty of obtaining it.  After the revolution there was increased salt production in the United States, this biggest production coming out of New York and Virginia.  Still, most of the salt in the United States was being imported.  ","Salt became especially important in the Civil War.  According to Kurlansky it was not only arms that the Southern army lacked but also salt.  For soldiers on the move salt was essential.  It allowed them to carry meat with them and served as a disinfectant during wars. ","We know that the Brookes family was wealthy, and so their financial ability to obtain salt was probably greater than most people in the South.  Since salt had to be imported either internationally or from a few places in the United States it was difficult to come by for everyone.  The shipping confusion experienced by Walker Brookes demonstrates the imperfections that existed in the system of distributing goods over the South.  Walker could not count on receiving what he needed when he expected it to come.  Having to send back a shipment of salt was not a matter of life or death for Walker Brookes, but it still provided plenty of reason to complain."],"display_date":"January 25, 1848","search_date":"1848-01-25","locations":[{"id":1945,"lat":33.3203883365,"lng":-83.69013905,"zoom":9,"place":"JASPER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2822,"title":"The Value of the Extended Family\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1838-10-21","end_date":"1838-10-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1838 Iveson Lewis Brookes received a letter from his cousin, P.B. (signed with only initials) informing him that his nephew, P.B.'s son, might be moving to Augusta, Georgia for a job. Augusta was near the plantation Iveson was managing for his son in Jasper and Jones counties.  We can tell from the letter that Iveson and P.B. were not particularly involved in each others' lives because P.B. took much of the letter to update Iveson about events in his family over the past few years. Despite this relatively weak relationship between the cousins, P.B. asked Iveson, would you act the part of a Father in watching over his morals. To P.B. extended family would be an important source of security for his son if he chose to move far away from his parents. ","This instance in the life of the Brookes shows that the family, and more specifically male patriarchs, was responsible for inculcating moral values. In addition, for Iveson to play the part of the father he would make sure that his nephew was kept in line and disciplined.  At other times and places different people and institutions held the important responsibility of keeping watch over the discipline and moral education. At this moment in the South, this responsibility was undergoing a shift from the church back toward the family.  Church records reflect that over the course of the 1830's churches were beginning to give up power to the family. They shifted pew organization from gender-segregated to family-friendly and reduced the amount that they disciplined their members.","In their book Paternalism in a Southern City, Edward Cashin and Glenn Eskew show how patriarchal power relates to and results from the plantation system and the Great Awakening. They argued that even outside of plantations themselves, southern society was based on the plantation system.  In this system it was the patriarch who was in control.  The plantation system allowed the man to stay at the house as a controlling figure. During this period in the North women were often left to manage the house while their husbands were at work.  In the North in the 1830's, it was the woman who became the source of moral wisdom in the family."],"display_date":"October 21, 1838","search_date":"1838-10-21","locations":[{"id":1944,"lat":33.3199345603,"lng":-83.6889280155,"zoom":10,"place":"JASPER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3030,"title":"Foundation of the Bible Society in Monticello\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-09-26","end_date":"1826-09-26","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["P.W. Gautier proudly wrote to the Georgia Statesman on September 26, 1826, proclaiming the establishment of auxiliaries of the American Bible Society throughout the counties that surrounded Monticello, Georgia. The Society sought to circulate the Bible without note or comment to the community. Gautier explained that the Society was simply answering the demands of the people of the area who deserved access to the Holy Scripture at reduced prices. As the letter ran in the newspaper, the Society was creating a depository in the area that would sell half-price Bibles to all the destitute and down-trodden who desired to read it but could not afford one at full price. In this way, the Society sought to send the word of Eternal Life to the remote regions of the Earth. The Society wrote the newspaper in order to find out, with the help of the Georgia Statesman, how many local citizens wanted Bibles and how many members of the community faced such a harsh poverty that they could not purchase their own Bible. The Society hoped that the newspaper would help identify those in the Monticello community that could not even afford half-price Bibles so that the Society could furnish them gratuitously and without cost. ","The Society finished their letter by asking the community's assistance in establishing an additional auxiliary in Jasper County. They firmly believed that every Christian has a duty to spread Christ's word, which remained the only sure and unerring guide which God has given to man. As Christianity spread across the world in the nineteenth century, this auxiliary sought to spread their religion within the Black Belt of Georgia.","Bible societies had recently flourished in other states, but in Georgia spreading the Bible to the poor had become a forgotten cause. The Society believed that all men and women had the right and ability to follow Christ?s teachings as given in the Bible and that Georgians especially deserved their attention. Hundreds of thousands of Americans remained entirely destitute of any portion of the word of God and the path to Heaven through Jesus Christ. The Society sought to right this wrong through a proliferation of the Bible to all households, regardless of socio-economic status. The expansion of the American Bible Society occurred at the same time that Alexander Campbell began leading the Restoration Movement that focused on the unity of Christendom through the guidance of the Bible's teachings. The faction of this movement that included the American Bible Society shared a desire to distribute God?s Word without footnote or commentary and thus unaltered from its original translated state. Rather than focusing on the commentaries of secondary sources, the American Bible Society believed that it was the job of the reader to decipher precisely what God?s word meant rather than to rely on the potentially misguided work of another.","The American Bible Society was one of many societies dedicated to spreading Christianity and the Gospel in the American South. Early in the nineteenth century, a benevolent empire of national societies spread across the nation in the hopes of transforming the United States into a nation of the kingdom of God on earth. These societies put special emphasis on the South because they viewed the South as a culturally and morally backwards region that needed a religious purpose and direction to save it from the depravity of slavery and its morally bankrupt frontier conditions. Rural Georgia symbolized both of these conditions, so the American Bible Society answered its religious call by expanding into the Monticello area."],"display_date":"September 26, 1826","search_date":"1826-09-26","locations":[{"id":1943,"lat":33.3252749518,"lng":-83.690146578,"zoom":10,"place":"JASPER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3035,"title":"New Rector at Eatonton Academy\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1821-10-21","end_date":"1821-10-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On October 12, 1821, Secretary William Williams of the Eatonton Academy sent a letter of inquiry to the residence of Iveson Lewis Brookes. The content of the letter, as authorized by the Eatonton Academy Board of Directors, asked Brookes to move from his estate in Bibb County, Georgia, to Jasper County, Georgia, in order to serve as the Rector of the Academy. Secretary Williams' letter began by outlining precisely why Brookes should move to Jasper to become the Rector of the Academy. Williams regretfully explained that Brookes' salary would be 800 half-yearly because of a lack of funds at the Academy that revealed a sign of the times. The Panic of 1819 and its depressing economic effects that lasted into 1821 continued to plague Black Belt Georgia and the Academy itself, so the Board could not possibly offer Brookes a higher salary. ","Secretary Williams then turns to the necessity of a prompt reply. He explains to Brookes that a returned letter of acceptance would be considered by the Board as a binding contract that would guarantee Brookes' presence at the Academy before the beginning of the next term. The Board's expectations for Brookes are clearly defined. He would serve as an ally of the classical kind for the Board and lead the community under the high expectations of the Academy. The Academy met from 8 AM - 12 PM and from 2 PM - 5PM from March 22 to September 22 and from 9 AM - 12 PM and 1:30 PM - 4 PM from September 22 to March 22. The schedule, Williams explains, adjusts according to the farming season. Students and faculty at the Academy celebrated two vacations of three weeks each after their examinations. Brookes would be asked to serve the Academy outside of the academic institution as well. Three local churches in Jasper County lay in despair. Intelligent and respectable elderly members of historic and proven congregations needed a man young in the ministry to guide their religious walk. These local Baptist churches faced financial constraints, a lack of leadership, and a spiritual void that the Board believed only Brookes could fill. Mr. Jefferson, a minister in one of the floundering churches, would help maintain the historical integrity of the churches, but the Board needed Brooke to breathe new life into the religious community. Williams' letter ended in the hope that Brookes would make his way to Eatonton Academy a few weeks before the first Monday in January in order to become acquainted with the Academy, the church, and the community before beginning his duties as Rector. As a later letter shows, Brookes would in fact move to Jasper County and take the position. ","By 1800, Baptists grew to become the largest denomination in the United States. Like today, the Baptist Church drew many of its congregations from the South. Churches sprung up throughout Milledgeville and nearby Macon County, and Christian academies for young men placed advertisements throughout the newspapers of the state. In a time when southerners prided themselves in their education and religious sentiment, Christian academies like Eatonton could be easily found throughout the South. The growth of many of these religious academies followed a focused movement of the Baptist Church to expand its Southern Enterprise through evangelism, missionary work, and the establishment of religious educational academies like Eatonton. The Baptist Church recognized the power of large national religious movements that swept the country in the 1820s and 1830s and heeded the call of evangelism. As a larger movement of organized benevolence swept the South in the Methodist and Presbyterian churches, the Baptists followed suit."],"display_date":"October 21, 1821","search_date":"1821-10-21","locations":[{"id":1943,"lat":33.3252749518,"lng":-83.690146578,"zoom":10,"place":"JASPER, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}]}
