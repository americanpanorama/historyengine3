Race, size, or color does not matter. When it comes to music, all cultures come together, one voice is heard. Folklore music is a prime example of this, and Zora Neale Hurston played an extremely important role in it. Not many African Americans had the opportunity to publish any type of works, or even to express their opinions on music, but Hurston was able to and represented all those who did not have the opportunity to do so. She introduced folklore and showed us how important music is, and the role it played in African American’s lives. <br /> Folklore music really represents cultures, their beliefs as well as religion. Much of music is written to express our feelings about certain topics, Africans viewed music as a getaway, they believed that through music they were able to achieve a lot more than by actually physically reacting to a certain issue. When music was made, spirits were lifted, and feelings were expressed; much of folklore music was played during special celebrations such as weddings and burials. It brought people together, and as Hurston mentioned “it does not belong to any special time, place, nor people”. Hurston taught us so much about the evolution of folklore here in Florida, and the role it played in both white’s and African’s lives. She once mentioned that a verse is “just a talking sentence,” to show us how powerful music was really is. To prove her point Hurston included in her book Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies, Vol. 12, No.1 fragments of folklore songs from various parts of Florida. These songs had powerful verses and stanzas that reached out to many, and painted a picture of what African American’s lives were like. <br /> Hurston often wrote about folklore music, but she also wrote “narratives and hoodoo practices.” She published many different books on music and its impact in states such as Florida, and Alabama; she also included examples of typical songs that were often popular among Africans in such regions. Her books were very descriptive and often told stories in form of songs about certain characters and their everyday lives. The characters portrayed in her books were mostly based on a non-fictional character; often people she knew and was close with. The songs reflected events that often took place in this person’s life, just told the story of their life. A perfect example of this would be Mules and Men, in which the “book really yields a valuable account of our Southern United States Negro.” <br /> Hurston’s books are known all over the country, and her works are greatly recognized in states such as Florida. History owes a great deal to Hurston, thanks to her we now know a great deal of how and what music folklore was influenced and how it was brought about here in our own Floridian backyards. We are also able to get a glimpse of what life was like during the slave trade periods, just as well as how, not only people were affected by slavery, but how culture and music were also impacted."," "," "," "],"display_date":1939,"search_date":"1939-07-02","locations":[{"id":23214,"lat":28.7169229525,"lng":-81.2362806752,"zoom":10,"place":"Seminole, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":460,"tag":"African American Folklore"},{"id":471,"tag":"music"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4892,"title":"African American Schools","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-01-01","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the spring of 1865, slavery successfully ended in the United States when the Confederate army surrendered. All slaves in the Confederacy were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation set by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, which said that slaves in Confederate-held areas were free. Slaves in the border states and Union controlled parts of the South were freed on December 6, 1865, by the Thirteenth Amendment. Between 1861 and 1865, about four million black slaves were freed.","In the beginning of the nineteenth century, the education of African Americans was not a main concern in the United States. The South had strict laws against educating African Americans to protect slavery. The North however did have schools for African Americans but they were inferior to white schools. The buildings were crowded, the teachers were not as experienced and there were not as many courses offered in the curriculum. In the South, most of the education that took place with in churches. By 1834, many Sunday schools had reading as part of the course; this was because they had to be able to read the Bible in order to be a good Christian.","In a picture from 1890, it shows the first school for African Americans built in Winter Park, FL. There are thirty-five colored children and two colored men standing outside a building that appears to be quite small. The boys are dressed in a clean shirts and pants and the girls are wearing clean dresses. Although the conditions of the building were still inferior to the white, it was a huge step for African American education progress in the South.","The nineteenth century was an important period for African American education in the country. The beginning of the century saw little to no schooling available to African Americans and in the end there was the assimilation of public schools. Education for African Americans was not even close to being equal to what the white children was offered. But education was in progress and free public education was a major accomplishment for African Americans."],"display_date":"1865 - 1890","search_date":"1877-12-31","locations":[{"id":1441,"lat":28.7108435556,"lng":-81.3703448213,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":238,"tag":"African American"},{"id":467,"tag":"Black Schools"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":5605,"title":"Naval Air Station Sanford and Its Impact on The United States and The City of Sanford, FL","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/50","end_date":"12/31/68","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Orlando Sanford airport stands east of state road 17-92 about twenty miles north of Orlando. Today the Orlando Sanford is a small commercial airport, dwarfed by Orlando International Airport only thirty miles away. While Orlando International may be bigger, it was a product of the Disney Empire, which moved in during the 1970s. Orlando Sanford Airport, however, was originally an important naval air base, and a direct byproduct of the Cold War. Its history is tied directly with its location and the time in which it was operational, and is an important look into Florida’s Cold War history and impacted Sanford in the decades that followed.","Commissioned in 1942, Naval Air Station Sanford, or NAS for short, was chosen as a major training and staging area for carrier-bound aircraft. During the war it had supplied pilots to about half of the US navy. After the war, the base was decommissioned and the field opened to private businesses. While it was a public space between 1946 and 1950, the field hosted the New York Giants training camp, a retirement home, a hospital, and a clothing company.","The onset of the Korean War showed that the US government still had their eyes on the field. When it reopened in 1951, NAS became instrumental in the aeronautic war effort, as well as in the onset of the Cold War. The facilities were made permanent and the runways repaired, but the most substantial addition was the on-base living facilities built in the adjacent swampland. In 1961, NAS Sanford was responsible for the first flight of the RA-5C Vigilante: a carrier-based bomber that was one of the first designed to deliver nuclear ordinance from the sea. As the Vietnam War gained momentum, the Vigilante was repurposed as a reconnaissance strike craft.","The impact on the city of Sanford, however, was far more apparent. Prior to NAS, Sanford was a rural celery farming community made up of predominantly African American residents. When the base moved in during the war, racial tensions grew as black residents were being pushed out of their neighborhoods by enlisted whites and their families. During the Cold War, the demography turned away from the historically black county. In the 1940 census, half of the population of Sanford was black; by 1960 it was only 11 percent. When the NAS Sanford was decommissioned in 1968, it dealt a massive financial blow to Sanford. The base indirectly provided jobs for thousands of Sanford citizens, and the closure eventually lead to a migration of middle class whites away from Sanford and Seminole County as a whole.","The NAS was incredibly influential in the construction of modern day Sanford. NAS Sanford was important during the Cold War as a staging area, but had unforeseen effects as an important demography shaper. Without NAS Sanford’s influence, Sanford would be a very different place than it is today."," "],"display_date":"1950 - 1968","search_date":"1959-07-02","locations":[{"id":29415,"lat":28.7169229525,"lng":-81.2362806752,"zoom":10,"place":"Seminole, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":603,"tag":"United States Navy"},{"id":46,"tag":"gentrification"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}}]}
