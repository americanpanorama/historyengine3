Hoover, a white labor organizer, had gained momentum in South Carolina as he promoted interracial labor organizing.  He was shot by an enraged group of white vigilantes on May 8th.  With Hoover's help the Knights of Labor's membership quickly encompassed thousands of African-Americans.&lt;br /&gt;     The meeting of the Knights of Labor illustrates the growing desire for more organized labor in general as a reaction to the unchecked capitalism of industrial America.  Furthermore the murder of Hoover displays the South's historical resistance to organized labor well into the 20th Century."],"display_date":"May 8, 1887 - November 1, 1887","search_date":"1887-08-04","locations":[{"id":2334,"lat":33.40893004,"lng":-82.6767315906,"zoom":9,"place":"WARREN, Georgia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}]}
