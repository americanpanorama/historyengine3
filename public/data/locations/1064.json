Southern whites still believed in white supremacy and tried to assert their control over political, economic, and domestic realms.  But blacks did not back down.  This was a period of strong black assertiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Clarksdale, Mississippi, on October 2, a neighborhood of blacks organized a mob.  They led an insurrection against the whites near the plantation of J.K. Wilkinson.  Two blacks were killed, several were injured, and nine were captured.  The other blacks retreated, still armed.  None of the whites were hurt.  Sheriff Harris gathered a posse to restore order."],"display_date":"October 2, 1892","search_date":"1892-10-02","locations":[{"id":7001,"lat":34.2291680018,"lng":-90.6026880055,"zoom":9,"place":"COAHOMA, Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}]}
