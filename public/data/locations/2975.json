This flourishing trading spot transformed itself into a popular resort where northerners came to flee from the harsh cold northern winters. According to the Seminole Hotel Booklet, the Winter Park area was ideal for northern settlement since it was full of natural beauties such as \"crystal lakes\" and \"southern pines\".  To conserve the natural beauty of this community, the Town Improvement Association was established in 1887.","            Since its establishment in 1881, Winter Park has gone through many developmental changes in order to accommodate its growing population.  Northerners saw Winter Park as an opportunity to gain wealth through the planting of citrus. Transportation became more accessible as a railroad line was placed in between Sanford and Orlando by the end of 1881. In 1882, Winter   Park received its first train station. Its first schools began to open in 1883 including the establishment of Rollins College in 1885. All of these advancements in Winter   Park lead to an economic boom which resulted in its incorporation as a town in 1887. In order to sustain the towns economic success, conservation organizations like the TIAWP were installed.","    A look at the TIAWP's constitution, one can see the conservation methods taken by community members to preserve the towns renown beauty. Article II of the Constitution states the object of the Association is to \"improve and ornament the streets and public grounds of Winter Park\". Members of the TIAWP planted trees as well as cultivated them. Other member duties included cleaning and repairing broken sidewalks as well as embellishing the streets.  Becoming a member consisted of planting a tree in the community or paying a small fee. Becoming a life member entailed subscribing in paying annual fees to the Association. According to Article VIII, members were promised a \"system of premiums\", where they were awarded for their service to the community.","            The Town Improvement Association of Winter Park was necessary for not only conservation reasons, but mainly for tourism. Due to its beautiful landscape, the town seems attractive to northerners. Hotels around the regions thrived due to this natural scheme. The Seminole Hotel Booklet profited from such claiming how the entire state of Florida was \"challenged to produce a prettier or healthier spot\". These hotels can accredit most of their success to conservationist organizations such as the Town Improvement Association of 1887."],"display_date":"March 3, 1887","search_date":"1887-03-03","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"United States History to 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":9,"school_id":5}},{"id":4214,"title":"Ocklawaha River\n","course_id":9,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-03-25","end_date":"1881-03-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the 1880's people who visited Florida were astounded by its many mysterious assets, \"grand, impressive, strange, tropical-now gloomy and awe-inspiring, now fairy-like and charming, and again weird and wild\" nature, as writer George Barbour described in his book for Florida tourists. The Ocklawaha River flows north from Central Florida, ending near Palatka, Florida. The river stretches over 100 miles, flowing into several large lakes in the Central Florida region. In the 1860s, the Ocklawaha River was cleared to provide a steamboat transportation route to Silver Springs, Florida, the end of a popular tourist journey (especially for Northerners) on the river. Many of the people who describe the entrancing nature of Ocklawaha River traveled it by steamboat. Once the railroad arrived in Silver Springs, however, the Ocklawaha River steamboat route was abandoned.","            The exotic nature and beauty of the Ocklawaha  River inspired one notable poet, Robert Paine Hudson, who wrote lyrics about the river in a poem titled \"Ocklawaha\". The lyrics were published on May 25, 1881 in Sanford, Florida and later published into a book of poetry titled <em><u>Love, Home, and the Southland</u></em>. The lyrics describe the people who traveled the river, such as the Indians who \" 'Gainst the white man here rebelled\", and Hudson writes about how the white man pushed the Indians to vacate their land. Again and again, Hudson reiterates the beauty of the Ocklawaha, \"What though we bade young Spring adieu, there's left a still more glorious hue\".

The statement is only one of many Hardy presents in his 1887 book, <em><u>Oranges and Alligators</u></em>, that illustrates the verbal abuse other U.S. regions heaped on Florida. In defense of the state, Hardy wrote about the exotic nature and beauty of Florida that he discovered on his own journeys through the area. ","            Hardy relays an interesting personal story in this document about the assumption that Florida was malaria ridden. While Hardy was traveling in Orlando, one man in his group fell ill with a high fever and aching pains. The group assumed he had contracted malaria. In response one gentleman said, \"Malaria?...He can't have malarial fever, for there is no malaria here-Unless, he has been imprudent enough to be out-of-doors after sunset.\" ","            Insurance companies were as particular then as they are now. To the Hardy group's dismay, they discovered that because of the risk of malaria, most insurance companies declined to provide life insurance below a latitude line of 30° south. At that time the group was traveling considerably below 29° south. The rumor that malaria was rampant in Florida was not entirely false. Gordon Patterson's scientific journal stated that mosquitoes bred well in the many bodies of water covering the state. It took a yellow fever epidemic in 1888, one year after the publication of Hardy's book, for the government of Florida to develop a board of health for disease control. ","            Alligators were a big attraction for Florida tourists in 1887, just as they are today. While Hardy was traveling by Lake Maitland, a young man in his group heard of an alligator that had been spotted by the bank of a lake near a neighborhood. The young man, thinking it was dangerous, found it, shot it, and brought it home to display. Soon after, a resident wrote him a letter, saying he had, in fact, slaughtered a pet alligator the resident had raised from a baby. Hardy's description of the whole scene includes the observation that at the time, alligators were popular domestic pets in South Florida. Hardy also states that it was possible to mail an alligator to the North (alive, unless it died in the process); all it took was a box to put it in. Promoters pushed alligators as ideal domestic pets; they only needed to be fed once a week."],"display_date":1887,"search_date":"1887-07-02","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":2,"tag":"Health/Death"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"}],"course":{"name":"United States History to 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":9,"school_id":5}},{"id":4549,"title":"The Lasting Tradition of Eatonville","course_id":21,"status":"P","start_date":"1898-01-01","end_date":"1898-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["            A report on the Eatonville Farmers' Conference by a speaker from the conference Nathalie Lord shows that the meeting was geared towards continuing the goals and dreams set forth at the establishment of the Hungerford School and the town of Eatonville.

In 1892 it was thus announced that both the election and the Hannibal Square area was not included in the incorporated limits of Winter Park. The City Council gave black citizens the option to use the building as a school house. There was one catch, the black citizens could not use it for free, it was twenty-five dollars for the school term (1893-1894). Thus, they declined the offer. ","            The town counsel was initially in the wrong according to the town solicitor. The town solicitor stated that they had no legal authority what so ever to neither remove the school building nor maintain a school, which was outside its specific town limits.

This building was part of the school and was on the north side of West New England Avenue. It accommodated first through eighth grade, and first, second and eighth grade was taught in separate rooms. As for the remaining grades, they were taught in three rooms. The rooms were well lit and equipped with a teacher's desk in the front of every class.

The youngest grade went into the school first and then so on and so fourth until everyone was in the building. Though facilities at the school was limited they did have a basketball clay court where many of the children liked to play. However, students had to bring their own balls, marbles, yo-yos, etc from home if thy wanted to play basketball or any other activity that required recreational tools.

They were taught the basics of reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as spelling, history and geography. Though the Hannibal School only provided for grade first through eighth and no high school there is no doubt that the children were prepared for it. Many student moved to find high schools in which they could attend or were just satisfied in graduating elementary school. If students did wish to move to high school they would attend Hungerford in Eaton Ville, Florida, where they could continue their studies and prepare for their futures.

Soon after her birth she moved to Eatonville, Florida which always remained her home throughout her life. Eatonville was the United States first incorporated black township, her father and many other African Americans were involved in the towns governance. Hurston was a very famous black author of short stories, novels and plays. Having close relations with people such as W.E.B. Du Bois, whom she called the “Dean of American Negro Artists.” Hurston along with Du Bois was very much involved with African American rights and the acceptance of blacks into society. She wished to break the color barrier and used her talent as a writer to inform people of the injustice that was racism.","As a leader in the Harlem Renaissance Zora Neale Hurston was a revolutionary in helping to protect the rights of African Americans. She was known during the Harlem Renaissance for her wit, irreverence, and folk writing style. Hurston was though most well know for her popular novels. Even though a novelist she was also very interested in play writing. Dr. Glover a professor at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida received a letter from Hurston speaking about a time in her life where writing became much more difficult, and society was becoming less and less accepting of her. In the letter written in 1934 she discusses a few hardships in which she is going through along with her love for the theatre. Rollins was a school that collaborated with Hurston showing her plays at the school and supporting her throughout her endeavors. Near the end she tells Dr. Glover that she will soon be eligible for a full professorship and talks about maybe being able to teach there. She later states that although she may become these things, “[her] interest in the theatre need not die.” This only heightens the evidence of Hurstons passion for the arts.","Hurston achieved great fame in her lifetime but she also suffered disgrace and was forgotten by the public.

Although Hurston did not get the credit she deserved when she was alive, she was honored after her death. Her novels and plays are now getting the recognition they always deserved. A movie was made celebrating her novel, “There Eyes Were Watching God.”","Zora Neale Hurston is confirmation that when trying to fight for your rights, your freedom or even you acceptance in society there are passive ways in which you can present your arguments and there are more forward ways.

The girls depended on Susan to help them through tough times, nurse them to health when sick as well as be a friendly face in the hallways of Cloverleaf dorm. Miss Wesley was born in Thomasville, Georgia, but came to Winter Park as a young woman and found work at Rollins College as a dorm mother. “Throughout her life here she [had] been and influence of good in [the] community through her personal life and through her work in the Baptist Church.” She not only was an influence on the girl but the whole town of Winter Park.","One stormy day in 1944 there was a terrible hurricane that hit Winter Park. Miss Wesley went straight to the Cloverleaf dorm to make sure all the girls were fine. The Rollins College Sandspur reported on her story of heroism after the hurricane, entitling it, “Lets Sing a Song About Suzy.” Miss Wesley’s interview and article had quotes from her describing her treacherous trip from her home to Cloverleaf dorm. While mopping and cleaning the corridors of the dorm she was asked why she felt she need to go to the dorm. Answering quickly, “I just know that I had to get up here and take care of those chillens.” Miss. Wesley thinking more about the well being of the cloverleaf girls than that of her own house, which the wind had taken the roofing off. She risked her life to walk to the dorm mid storm. This act of selflessness showed her heroism and her faithfulness to the care of those girls. Because of Miss. Wesleys dedication to the girls she was awarded with the distinction of being a recipient of the Rollins Decorations of Honor. One which no other black woman had received in Rollins College history.

The Seminole Hotel was a grand resort in Lake Osceola and it was a vacation destination which attracted many wealthy northerners who were escaping the unpleasant weather from their home towns. While it is evident that white northerners enjoyed the warm weather and the great destination, African Americans who were already in the area were not affluent enough to enjoy the properties of the Seminole Hotel. Instead African Americans were offered a different way to step foot onto the premises, they were the employees that hosted the white wealthy guests.","As mentioned in the Winter Park Historical Association website, the Seminole Hotel boasted <em>“that more millionaires and beauties were gathered on its piazzas than any other space in Florida.”</em> In this regard we easily understand that during 1886 when the Seminole Hotel was built, African Americans were just fortunate enough to be employees of the Seminole Hotel. Across the South during this period, African Americans were denied employment and equal opportunities by whites for various reasons, but were fortunate enough to find some opportunities at the Seminole hotel. As observed in the photos of the Seminole Hotel, Steve Rajatr in the Winter Park Magazine reveals that  “a large portion of their Winter Park staff of porters, bellhops, cooks, and maids were black residents who lived in Hannibal Square and who were neighbors of white families who lived on the east side of town. The hotel was one of the major companies in the area that employed black residents.”","While looking back at the importance of the Seminole Hotel we must recognize that a picture found in the Rollins College Archives with an African American woman boating wealthy white northerners on Lake Osceola depicts both positive and negative interpretations. While I rather see a picture of both African American’s and Whites enjoying the sites of the Seminole Hotel, it is still beneficial that African Americans were hired by one of the only employers that would employee them. “The city’s founding fathers intended Winter Park to be a resort destination for affluent families who wanted to escape harsh winters in the Midwest and Northeast and African American’s were apart of making these wealthy families feel welcomed.” Through the Seminole Hotel the African Americans contributed to the American experience in many ways, some more obvious than others."," "," "],"display_date":1886,"search_date":"1886-07-02","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4842,"title":"Eatonville and the Robert Hungerford Industrial School","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1888-01-01","end_date":"12/31/10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Dr. Robert Hungerford is best known for the school in Maitland, Florida that was named after him, however, his willingness and selfless attitude in preaching education is what best characterizes the type of person he actually was.

Calhoun, who gained a college education and one of Dr. Hungerford’s brightest scholars.  A few years after the school opened, Dr. Hungerford’s father gave the school one hundred and sixty acres of land as a memorial to his son and the school greatly expanded.","The Robert Hungerford Industrial School was soon established and it provided African Americans with means of learning as well as direct industrial work experience.  The school owned more than two hundred acres of suitable land for farming and building.  The students of both sexes would attend school for half of the day and work the other half of the day.  The county of the school was given two hundred and forty dollars a month to cover the wages of the teachers, however, the principle nor the treasurer received any pay for their work.","In a time where the country was going through much racism and hatred toward African Americans, education was not viewed as very important.  This was until Dr. Hungerford came into the scene and ultimately transformed education for the African American people of the South.  His generosity and willingness to help poor African American children was taken very seriously and opened the door for many young men and women.  The creation of the Industrial School provided real life work experience, as well as many different learning opportunities.  Students came from all over Florida to take part in this excellent program that quickly took off from the very beginning.  The early 1900’s were a very tough time for African Americans, although Dr. Hungerford wasn’t directly apart of the creation of the school, his willingness to reach out and help the African Americans went a long way in establishing some of the first means of education in the South.  Black students were provided opportunities that at the time were unheard of in many parts of the U.S.  Several years after the original creation of the school, Hungerford graduates were successful students in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Virginia.  Although the original school is no longer present, the name still lives on as the name of an elementary school in Eatonville."," "],"display_date":"1888 - 1910","search_date":"1899-07-01","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":445,"tag":"Education for blacks"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4845,"title":"Zora Neale Hurston performs \"From Sun to Sun\" at Rollins College","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"2/11/33","end_date":"2/11/33","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Friday, February 11, 1933 Zora Neale Hurston’s program “From Sun to Sun” was shown at the Recreation Hall of Rollins College at 8:15 in the evening.

Such songs included “Shack Rouser,” “East Coast Blues,” and “Alabama Bound”.  The scenery for “From Sun to Sun” was designed and created by Iven Tate, a young Negro artist from Orlando, Florida.","Hurston was born on January 7, 1891 in Notasulga, Alabama, though later in life claimed she was born in Eatonville, Florida in 1901. Eatonville was the first incorporated Negro town in America, where Hurston and her family moved to when she was three years old. In her 1928 essay “How It Feels to Be Colored Me” she describes the experience of growing up in Eatonville. She began her studies there, attending a grammar school in Jacksonville and later going to Morgan Academy in Baltimore, Maryland.  Hurston published four novels and over fifty short stories, plays, and essays.","In 1927 she was admitted to Barnard College where she majored in anthropology and studied under Dr. Frank Boas. Hurston was the first Negro to ever be admitted to the college and graduated in 1928.  By January 1932, she was working closely with the Creative Literature Department of Rollins College in an effort to produce a concert program of Negro folklore. On March 1 of the same year, a special half hour performance of folk songs and dances was given by Hurston, staged specifically for Miss Ruth St. Denis, a famous American dancer.","Hurston spent four years (1927-1931) in the South collecting material for this production in an effort to recreate an authentic portrait of folk-style songs, dances, tales and rituals. The work songs in the second number of the show (“Cold Rainy Day,” “Let the Deal Go Down”) refer to the songs sung by men working on the railroads, in the sawmills and in the phosphate mines in Florida. Sometimes the words simply add body to the tune as the music portrays the sounds of sawing a log, the swinging of a pick, and the driving of a nail.","Some of Hurston’s songs originate from jooks, a place of leisure for Negroes in the South. Jooks were a place where Africans could dance, sing and socialize amongst themselves. The jook songs are commonly known as “blues”, but many of them are considered ballads because they tell a story.  A person literate enough to put them on paper never hears these songs; they travel by word of mouth from one jook to another.","Hurston’s tour of “From Sun to Sun” has traveled across the country, touching all who experience its power. Negroes and friends of the Negroes will appreciate its heartfelt message of the slave experience. Zora Neale Hurston’s own participation in the program only adds to its influence and shows that she herself believes in its message and meaning."],"display_date":"February 11, 1933","search_date":"1933-02-11","locations":[{"id":22732,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":438,"tag":"Rollins College"},{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":436,"tag":"florida slave history"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4848,"title":"Racial identity and the American Experience","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"5/7/28","end_date":"5/7/28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A person’s racial identity is the “global human population distinguished as a more or less distinct group by genetically transmitted physical characteristics.”[1] Segregation has been deeply rooted within American culture for the past two centuries. It has forced people to become more aware of their racial identity and moreover, it has been taken to the extent of violence as well as less extreme scenarios. In her 1928 essay about racial identity and segregation, Zora Neale Hurston claims, “I remember the very first day I became colored.”[2] She wrote that moving to a new region and coming face to face with segregation first exposed her to racial identity. Until this point she knew very little about the role segregation and racial identity played in American culture.","Initially, Zora lived in a primarily Negro town of Eatonville, Florida. In Eatonville she knew very little about segregation and the role it played in African American lives. The only white people Zora knew were those who simply passed through town, coming from or going to Orlando. She would salute them while they were passing and the white men were always very courteous and friendly. They would ask her to dance and sing, and would give her small amounts of money for her performance. Zora thought her fellow townspeople acted strange when these white people passed through her town because they would peer through curtains and most were afraid to come out on their porches. However, Zora did not think much of it and thought “white people differed from colored only in that they rode through town and never lived there.”<sup>2</sup>","Finally, Zora was confronted with her first taste of segregation and the large imaginative line that was drawn between whites and blacks when she was thirteen. Zora was sent off to school in Jacksonville where she first became aware of her skin color. She was treated differently in several different ways, but claims she was not sorrowful or ashamed of her heritage at any point. “I have seen that the world is to the strong regardless of a little pigmentation more of less. No, I do not weep at the world--I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.”[3] Someone was always letting Zora know in some way that she is the granddaughter of slaves. Whether it was the inability to make some white friends, or her peers teasing her at school she refused to let it depress her.","Accordingly, segregation has shaped American culture for the past two centuries, and discreetly continues to do so today. Immediately following the Civil War and the emancipation of African American Slaves, there was obviously resentment between races. This resentment turned into extreme segregation, hatred, and even violence. This extreme segregation shaped American culture for almost half a century. Restaurants, parks, bathrooms, hotels, and many other public facilities turned into establishments that would split races apart. This segregation led to verbal and physical arguments and would often lead to horrendous acts of violence and abuse. Consequently, Zora mentions numerous instances of lynching and use of weapons resulting from this tension. The relationship between blacks and whites, especially post- Civil War, seemed almost worse than when blacks were slaves. Children who were not raised during the time of slavery were and are still forced to lead lives completely shaped by segregation. Children were often forced to stop communicating with friends of other races because the hatred and resentment was so intense during this time.","Furthermore, prejudice and discrimination affected the minds and emotions of many children. A study was conducted by Kenneth and Mamie Clark to investigate children’s racial identification and preference. They used dolls and drawings to decipher which images children preferred and which matched closest to their own skin color. The findings concluded that many black children preferred the white doll or drawing, and often picked colors that were lighter than their own skin color. Kenneth and Mamie also observe that their findings \"indicate a clear-cut preference for white and some of them evidence emotional conflict when requested to indicate a color preference. It is clear that the Negro child, by the age of five is aware of the fact that to be colored in contemporary American society is a mark of inferior status. A child accepts as early as six, seven or eight the negative stereotypes about his own group.\"[4] In fact, these decisive observations helped determine that schools should not be segregated by the Supreme Court case, <em>Plessy v. Ferguson.</em>","Segregation is still currently present in the United States, though not to the extreme of violence as it was thirty to fifty years ago. Affirmative action, all black colleges, scholarships, beauty pageants, and organizations exemplify putting racial categorizing. The initial concept of segregation following the Civil War contributed to these examples of segregation in American culture today. Zora Neale Hurston explains her first hand account of segregation and the difficulties she had. She explains the differences between her same race community she lived in initially to the challenges she faced when she moved to an area with mixed races. Segregation has given a whole new meaning to racial identity, and has taken a significant position in defining American culture for forty years following the Civil War."," ","[1] Mifflin, John. 2007. <em>American Heritage Medical Dictionary. </em>Houghton Mifflin Company","[2] Hurston, Zora. 1928. <em>How it Feels to be Colored Me.</em>","[3] Hurston, Zora. 1928. <em>How it Feels to be Colored Me.</em>","[4] Clark, Kenneth, and Mamie Clark. 1940. <em>Skin color as a factor in racial identification of Negro preschool children</em>. <em>The Journal of Social Psychology</em>"],"display_date":"May 7, 1928","search_date":"1928-05-07","locations":[{"id":21523,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":457,"tag":"racial identity"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4849,"title":"From Eatonville to Broadway","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/10","end_date":"12/31/35","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Born in Alabama and raised in Eatonville, Florida, Zora Neale Hurston became one of the greatest-known black female authors of all time. Zora once said:","\"I was born in a Negro town.  I do not mean by that the black backside of an average town.  Eatonville, Florida is, and was at the time of my birth, a pure Negro town-charter, mayor, council, town marshal and all.  It was not the first Negro community in America, but it was the first to be incorporated, the first attempt at organized self-government on the part of Negroes in America.\"","Zora’s life reflects the same “attempt” as did the formation and incorporation of Eatonville; she paved the way for all female writers in America, specifically those of African descent, through the strength of her own story.","Throughout history, Zora can often be found on the frontier of African American accomplishments. In 1927, she was the first African American to be admitted to Barnard College. After graduation, Zora immediately set out to explore “Negro” folklore. Through her strong determination and interest- and after only a few months- Zora had amassed the largest collection of “Negro” folk tales in her field. She used her extensive research into African American life and history to construct plays which recalled traditional “Negro folk-lore.” One such play is her famous <em>From Sun to Sun</em>, an adaptation of <em>The Great day</em>, a theatrical revue- a theatrical performance involving short satirical and topical songs, sketches, and monologues- written in 1932.","Zora frequently worked with Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida to construct and perform her creations. The concert program of “Negro music” for <em>The Great Day </em>was built through Zora’s collaborative effort with the creative literature department of Rollins College. The John Golden Theatre on Broadway housed the first performance of <em>The Great Day</em> on January 10, 1932- Zora had made it to Broadway. On February 11, 1933, she staged an adaptation of <em>The Great Day</em> called <em>From Sun to Sun</em>, “a program of original Negro folk-lore,” at Rollins College with “Native Negro Singers and Actors.” The event program included a brief biography about Zora Hurston, an outline of the play, and specific descriptions and explanations of each song included in the revue. At 8:15 pm, “Negroes” and “white friends of the Negroes” gathered at Rollins’ Recreation Hall to “experience the richness of the material at their own doorstep.” The play was a success, as many college and local newspaper write-ups from the period suggest, and Zora continued to display her creations at Rollins in front of captive audiences for years to come.","Though she fought and stood against racial prejudice throughout her life, Zora Neale Hurston stands as one of America’s most celebrated authors.  Zora’s creative path began in Eatonville, and by the mid 30s, it brought her to all the way to Broadway.

Although efforts were made in the newly formed free black communities to organize schools, few African Americans received any education at all before the Reconstruction Era when public schools were opened. Even then, establishments for black children were poorly financed and largely ignored. Emerging in the 1870s, Jim Crow laws ruled the educational system and schools became legally racially segregated. In 1890, the first “coloured” school building in Winter Park was opened to African American children, under the harsh conditions of the time.","In 1896, the Supreme Court decision of Plessy vs. Ferguson established separate public schools for black and white students. The decision also deprived African American children of equivalent educational advantages. “Coloured” schools had to make do with scant financial support and negligible resources. A damaged photograph from 1890 documents the opening of the first school building for African Americans in the city of Winter Park, Florida. This schoolhouse appears consistent with the common characteristics of “coloured” schoolhouses emerging across the nation- few teachers, far too many students, and clearly under-financed. Two schoolteachers pose in the photograph alongside roughly 40 students – schoolchildren who mostly are in want of shoes. The schoolchildren in the photograph range from toddler-aged to early teens- a characteristic typical of the time, as generally one teacher supervised dozens of students in all subjects, and grades.","The lack of proper and fair financing for black learning institutions affected the quality of the education provided. Teachers could not give pupils ample individual attention, and therefore students were made to work exponentially harder in order to succeed. However, as the 1890 photograph illustrates, attendance was high and both students and teachers alike were proud of their new privilege, however tainted it may have been.","The struggle for fair and equal education for African Americans was long and hard, but much progress was made through the efforts of organizations such as the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People) and individuals like Oliver Brown, who pushed for fairness in the education system.U.S. schools were legally desegregated in 1954 by the Supreme Court decision of Brown vs. Board of Education, which overturned Plessy vs. Ferguson, and stated that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” Groups of African American students like “Little Rock Nine” began to enter previously “all-white” schools, and thus began the long process of de-segregation in American public schools.

This hotel was a huge addition to the Winter Park community. It consisted of two hundred rooms and provided plenty of activities to entertain the guests, such as a bowling alley, croquet, tennis, and a billiard room. A bonus of being on the lake was that they were able to offer sailing, rowing, fishing, and two steam yachts. It was located close to Rollins College, so many family members of the students stayed there while visiting. It drove in famous and wealthy people such as President Grover Cleveland and William Rockefeller.","Along with the good business came numerous job opportunities for the African-Americans in the surrounding area. With only twenty-one years after slavery was abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment (1865), it was very difficult for African-American to get jobs, never mind jobs with good salary. During the Reconstruction Era, plantation owners hired the newly freed African Americans to keep production up. These arrangements did not work well, and therefore a great deal of the land was occupied by both white and African American farmers and sharecroppers.","The Seminole Hotel was a one of the only businesses that employed African-Americans in the South during this time. Some of the jobs included maids, bellhops, landscapers, cooks, baggage carriers, and caddies. They employed men, women and children to carry out these duties. Also when important figures stayed at the hotel, there would be the additional job of driving the mule and carriage to the train station just down the road, to pick up and drop of the guest. The workers were treated well here and made a reasonable pay. In a picture, dating between 1886 and 1902, shows eleven young African-American men dressed in caddy uniforms, scrabbling on the dirt ground in search of money. Most of the young men are piled on top of each other or sprawled out on the ground, while only one appears to already have some money in his hand, because he is away from the group and is looking down at his cupped hands. Written on the back of the picture it says, “Scrambling for money thrown by Seminole Hotel guest.” This picture suggests that not only did the hotel treat their workers well, but the guests did as well. They generously threw out money to these workers that were working to help support their families.","While other businesses were discriminating against the newly freed people, the Seminole Hotel invited them in with open arms. Their hard work and helping hands helped keep the hotel open for six years until a fire in the kitchen burned down the hotel. The hotel was not re-built and many people became unemployed.

W. France about her 1934 production of <em>All De Live Long Day</em>. Zora lived her life in an attempt to revitalize and find the truth behind her African American culture, which at the time was mostly represented elaborately and inaccurately. The majority of her work was presented from research she had done extensively because she wanted to recreate her findings as purely as possible. Through folktales, songs, folk plays, and dances, Zora was able to not only to identify her culture, but also show the world the artistic works of African-American people. A look into her past as an ethnographer as well as her experience with dance can help us understand why and how she wrote this production.","I find it important that there is an understanding that African American culture is influenced continuously and had been influenced since these shores were beached. Ever before Zora's time, hundred of factors have limited, scarred, undermined, and frightened Blacks in the United States. And along with this, their history had not been created by themselves, but by their white superiors of the time. People didn't make much effort to truly observe African American life and culture, and so misconstrued ideas about black folk art forms of the past were represented. But Zora could see through this. Being more than just a writer, dancer, or singer, her anthropological and ethnographic background opened her eyes onto peoples who were similar and heavily influenced the rapidly changing culture of African Americans. “Hurston had spent a relatively short but productive period in contact with the full roster of artists, intellectuals, and patrons of the Harlem Renaissance, drawing on her acquaintance with Southern black folklore for writing stories and for storytelling in social gatherings.” <sup><sup>2</sup></sup>","In reference to her approach in studying and arranging dance, Zora was a careful observer.","With particular concern about the ways in which commercialized depictions of blackness were being misconstrued as representative of African American life, Hurston set out to produce a concert that revealed in embodied form her own nuanced theory of black vernacular expression. At root, this theory sought to re-situate African American cultural products in relation to the material conditions of a Southern rural folk community, as well as to African diasporic roots and routes. <sup><sup>3</sup></sup>","She tried as best she could to immerse herself within the culture. The final act in<em> All De Live Long Day</em> is reenacts many different dances, including the Courtship dance, the Crow dance, and the Fire dance (which she was particularly fond of). These are not just a random assemblage of movements: each one has strong roots in African American culture. Her data and observations took place in looking at Caribbean dance, which is more unchanged from its origins. The Caribbeans and African Americans have long been connected and influential towards one another, beginning with the roots. And Zora didn't just observe, she participated with the people, learning the intricacies and feelings behind the dance.","The African American are a people who have had to deal with rapid change in status and ideologies. Because of this, it can be easy to look at what is considered to be historical and accept it as fact. But, when an elite and prejudiced group is the one setting things in stone, intentionally and unintentionally “facts” can be recorded incorrectly. Zora Neale Hurston is a woman who looked at her people with pride and therefore wanted to open the world to their truth. Though seemingly unimportant, songs, folklore and dance can help distinguish a people from another, showing the beauty in differences. A background in anthropology and writing allowed Nora to both put herself on level with those she was studying and correctly express it in such a way that is accurate and intricate. African American history has had its long and tedious battles, making it more than deserving of realistic representation.","1 Zora Neale Hurston “All De Live Long Day” Rollins College Archives (January, 1934)","2 Benigno Sánchez-Eppler “Telling Anthropology: Zora Neale Hurston and Gilberto Freyre Disciplined in Their Field-Home-Work,” <em>American Literary History</em>, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Autumn, 1992): 464-488","3 Anthea Kraut “Between Primitivism and Diaspora: The Dance Performances of Josephine Baker, Zora Neale Hurston, and Katherine Dunham,” <em>Theatre Journal</em>, Vol. 55, No. 3, Dance (Oct., 2003): 433-450"],"display_date":"January 1934","search_date":"1934-01-16","locations":[{"id":22732,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":437,"tag":"Zora Neale Hurston"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":460,"tag":"African American Folklore"},{"id":496,"tag":"Dance"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4887,"title":"The Rebirth of Zora","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["<strong><br /></strong>","The collaboration between Zora Hurston and the Directors of The Museum in folklore entitled “From Sun to Sun” was revolutionary for both the museum and for the African American population at the time. The Museum was known at the time at Rollins to be “a house for the arts”. The theatre worked together with Hurston to present a series of one act plays, musical programs, and various dance and poetry readings in a creative endeavor to help expand and discover new ways to present the arts to local residents. In the document, which is the program presented for “From Sun to Sun” there is a biography of Zora Hurston’s career. In the biography it is revealed that she was born in Eatonville, Florida and later attended school in Baltimore Maryland. In 1927 she was the first black person to be accepted in Barnard College. She became involved throughout her academic career in “Negro folklore” and became what can be considered a legend in this genre. Most of her folklore was published by the American Folklore Society. She also went further in her career to publish more stories and research articles which were published by prestigious journals such as  <em>The Survey Graphic</em>,  <em>The World Tomorrow</em> and <em>The New Negro.</em> Hurston came to Rollins in order to collaborate in an effort to establish “Negro theatre for her own people”.  We can infer from this that because of the time period, despite her large success at as a writer, poet, and director she was still in search for a place where she could truly express her work in a theatre environment without the perhaps discrimination from the outside world. She needed a location where her work could flourish and just plainly exist as art.","In an article written by Joanne Braxton details the autobiographical tradition of African American women, including Hurston. African American women began writing autobiographies in the 1940’s. However these stories did not start gaining publicity and serious attention until the 1970’s.  In the 1980’s critics began to reevaluate autobiographies that were overlooked in the 40’s and when they began to be published. One person that is noted that deserved re-evaluation of her works was Zora Hurston. In the Rollins program “From Sun to Sun” she expresses the need to find a place where she can call her own in an artistic environment. Hurston was in a constant search to indeed find a place in which she could “re-create, restore and re-invent the self” . It is also expressed in many of Zora’s own personal writings accounts of feeling extreme loneliness and isolation and how she so badly was striving to fit in and feel like everyone else.","In an article by Joyce Irene Middleton which is entitled “Where to look for Zora” there is a reoccurring theme which suggests that Zora was an insightful talent that was shamefully overlooked by other scholars at the time that she was publishing. A person by the name of Alice Walker started a movement to “Remember Zora” in the 1970’s which worked to understand Zora’s material to a clearer extent and to uncover reasons why she was once overlooked. In  Walker’s essay “Looking for Zora” she revealed many of Hurston’s memories and tried to uncover why in fact Zora was so influential and powerful as a black woman author. The most significant point in which people seem to be enthralled with her work is because it came so strongly that she was in fact in charge of her life and her unique emphasis on self possession. This was most interesting because of the time period in which she emerged which was a time in which African American women were still facing the hardships of discrimination.","Zora was an inspiration because of her persistency to be heard and intense drive to find her authentic self in a theatric environment. She was on a personal quest of liberation and more importantly strove to share her story with people, including her local native people of the greater Orlando community which was demonstrated by her association and collaboration with Rollins. This was both revolutionary and inspiring for the local community."," "],"display_date":1970,"search_date":"1970-07-02","locations":[{"id":36752,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":503,"tag":"From Sun to Sun"},{"id":459,"tag":"Female Authors"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4891,"title":"Eatonville Influences Zora Neale Hurston","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/20","end_date":"12/31/30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Zora Neale Hurston was an African American author famous during the New Negro Movement (Harlem Renaissance), which was in the 1920’s and 1930’s. She wrote four novels and published more than fifty short stories and plays. Her writing was influenced by the small town of Eatonville. Eatonville is located in central Florida.","Eatonville may be a small town but it is packed with African American history and culture. After the Civil War, freed African Americans were segregated from the white community. They had three options; one was to leave the United States and go to Mexico, Canada or back to Africa. The second option was to try to assimilate into the white society where they would suffer inequality and discrimination. Or the last option was to establish all black communities, where they would try to be a self-sufficient town but with equal rights. Many of these all black communities were located out west in Kansas and Okalahoma. Eatonville was one of the few black communities established in Florida and it is the oldest of twelve to remain today. Eatonville became an official city on August 15, 1887. It was an all black town that was built around their culture, religion, family and education.","Zora Hurston was born in Alabama and moved to Eatonville at the age of two. She was so proud to be from an all black community that she carried it over to her writings, she even declared being born in Eatonville in biography. In her plays she used an all-negro cast to act in her Afro-American Folklores. According to her program from the play, “All De Live Long Day,” which was perform at Rollins College on Friday, January 5, 1934,  she had four sections then an intermission followed by the last three sections. The play consisted of music and dance. It was about the struggles of black life and it was a very inspirational message for that touched to hearts of the audience. It was based off the life of Negroes in Florida but mainly in her home town of Eatonville.","Eatonville shaped her life and her writing. The town honors and recognizes Hurston and all her hard work by celebrating her through the annual arts and humanities events at the Zora Neale Hurston Festival. This festival celebrates her life and her work as a writer. It attracts thousands of locals and tourists each year and it is a way to take a moment to remember the life of African Americans before and during her life in Eatonville."],"display_date":"1920 - 1930","search_date":"1925-07-01","locations":[{"id":21523,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":227,"tag":"Women of the South"},{"id":85,"tag":"Harlem Renaissance"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4898,"title":"How one woman helped to valut African American culture into the spotlight","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"10/29/32","end_date":"10/29/32","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Born in 1891 in rural Alabama, Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood in the first incorporated black town in the nation, Eatonville, Florida. Zora attended school in Eatonville until only 13 years old, when she traveled to New York City with a traveling theatre company. In the city that never sleeps, Zora would develop her creative mind and make her mark on history. Hurston seized the tremendous opportunity of living in New York during the Harlem Renaissance, a period of blossoming of African American culture through music, poetry, dance and other forms of media. First, she obtained three degrees from illustrious learning institutions including Columbia University and Howard University. Soon after, she was blessed with a shot to work with Langston Hughes, arguably the most famous black writer in American History, on a play entitled, “Mule Bone: A Comedy of Negro Life in Three Acts.” Hurston went on to publish books such as the 1934 work “Jonah’s Gourd Vine,” detailing African American life in the deep-south and bringing it to the forefront of society. Through her life’s work and experiences, Zora Neale Hurston exposed the masses to African American life and folklore, broke racial boundaries, and inspired change here in Central Florida and across the nation.","Growing up in Eatonville, Hurston was fully immersed in African American culture and folklore. She specialized in theatre and comedy decided to pursue her interests further at Columbia. During her academic years, she conducted extensive field studies throughout the American South, becoming an expert in the field. Here at Rollins College, interest in American folklore was mounting. In a letter from October 29<sup>th</sup>1932, Professor W.R. Wunsch pleads with school President Dr. Hamilton Holt to allow an African American folk performance in the Annie Russell Theatre. Wunsch challenges the President to “break the ground as it were: to make the students sensitive to the lyric beauty of swamp and citrus grove, […] find the drama in the life of fisherfolk and sponge divers, […] to get the students to ‘dip their nets where they are.’” He goes on to specifically request Hurston, insisting that he “can think of no better way to introduce the students to the honest-to-the-soil material at their own doorsteps than to present to them in a program of folk songs and dancers a group of Eatonville negroes, headed by Zora Hurston. Zora, a national authority on negro ways, has won an enviable place for herself in American dramatics.” Clearly, there was desire for Zora’s expertise and creativity in the field local folklore here at Rollins, but the President was somewhat apprehensive to approve because of the well established racial boundaries of the time.","These pre-existing racial boundaries were tremendously difficult for African Americans to overcome, as the Jim Crow laws of segregation were still widely in effect. Dr. Holt illustrates this in his response to Mr. Wunsch’s letter. He allows the performance to take place, however, he adds, “Of course we cannot have negroes in the audience unless there is a separate place segregated for them.” Holt continues by hinting that he fears the judgment of others, warning, “I do not think I would advertise it very much outside our own faculty and students.” This mentality held widely throughout the south was a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to overcome. Hurston did an incredible job of shrinking the barriers by thrusting the lives and cultures of African Americans into mainstream society. Her first book, entitled “Jonah’s Gourd Vine,” was critically acclaimed as something totally new and fresh. Additionally, her academic success provided opportunity and paved the way for many African American women to follow.","The Harlem Renaissance set the stage for real progress in America. The timeless works of Hurston, Hughes, and countless other intellectuals, artists, poets and entertainers provided the building blocks for the Civil Rights Movement. This cultural movement shined the African-American experience in the spotlight, and in turn changed how African Americans were perceived. As rural, southern blacks moved north to larger cities, they developed a new image, one of urban sophistication. The idea of the black identity was forming, and antiquated, racist laws could no longer suppress it. In his response letter, Dr. Holt acknowledges that he is in favor of racial progress, telling the courageous Mr. Wunsch, “I am glad you are doing this as it is one of the best steps in the right direction.”","Zora Neale Hurston achieved incredible things in her lifetime. She won numerous awards as an actor, playwright and author. But arguably her most important contributions to this world came in the form of advancing her people and fighting for equality. Through hard work, a will to succeed, and being in the right place at the right time, she inspired true change in our country. Hurston is a figure that will be forever immortalized through her works and accomplishments, an integral part of African American and Florida history."],"display_date":"October 29, 1932","search_date":"1932-10-29","locations":[{"id":22732,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"},{"id":22428,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":85,"tag":"Harlem Renaissance"},{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":4974,"title":"The First Blacks","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/77","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The First Blacks","            In this country about thirty to fifty years ago racial segregation existed among blacks and whites in the education system. It was only in the 1950’s when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional in the case of Brown v Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas. Yet, it was only about forty years ago when Rollins College began to accept African American applicants. In 1965 only white students attended Rollins, five years later twenty African American students attended Rollins.","            Troy Layng was a white graduate from Rollins in the late sixties. He returned to Rollins to shockingly find a change in the student body, African American students. Layng conducted several interviews among the black students, and astonished by the active roles they played at Rollins. Among the students were; Laurence Martinez, leading scorer on the Men Basketball team, Chapel reader, nominee of the 1969 edition of Outstanding College Athletes of America along with a number of other leadership roles on campus. Anita Thomas was a member of ; Rollins Players, Steering Committee, Community Action Board and was a discussion leader in the College Preparation Week. Layng also interviewed two other African American students that were proactive during their four years at Rollins. Layng asked a series of questions concerning the student body’s perception of African American students, the advantages and disadvantages of attending Rollins, the reason or reasons why they selected Rollins, racial issues they face among the student body and faculty, and etc.","            The initial interview question was “Why did you select Rollins?” two out of the four student response were similar, they both mentioned the nice atmosphere but at the same time they both were concerned with the amount of blacks students that attended Rollins. The other two answered in another tone, one was fairly confident in her academics throughout high school and was convinced that Rollins chose her instead. Unfortunately the last student did not have Rollins or any other College in his future plans until his guidance counselor introduced Rollins as the best school in the South. Motivation and self determination was established among these students, in their academics and active roles at Rollins.","            An interesting question that was asked was “What could Rollins do to attract a greater number of black students” each response included the concern of financial aid and scholarships, appealing courses to those of color, incorporate black board members in the Admission Department and a stronger communication and interaction between white and black students especially among black students themselves. But their main disquiet was forming a better understanding among the social cooperation of both white and black students. Another major concern of the students was how the white students perceived them. The students in the interview repeatedly mention the importance of cultural mergence.   The previous questions were the most interesting to the students, they actually seemed genuinely concerned with the future of African American scholars. On the last page of the document there was a list of African American students that attended Rollins. Originally, the name of the document was “Negro Undergraduates at Rollins” but “Negro” was crossed out and “Black” was written it its place. This symbolizes the improvement of racial awareness among the student body at Rollins. The list has the year of six semesters, names of the student and class status. Interestingly enough there were only one African American student form 1964-1965, but from 1969-1970 there was a significant leap from one to about African American students.  De-segregation in the South was a huge issue. Of course whites didn’t want Blacks to attend the same schools, or have equal rights. There was a lost “promise” among the African Americans. Whites were too afraid that the Blacks would take over and fight back. Ideally this happened, but of course the blacks had a tough time voicing their opinions. The Jim Crow laws were imposed on the African Americans. [1] ","            To close the twenty African American students that attended Rollins a mere forty years ago opened the door for many other races. So many years later Rollins is still known for its academics and also recently known for the change among the student body.

Ergood and Robert White Jr., officially opening the store to the small public of Winter Park in September of that same year.

He created thousands of breeds of flora and set up the foundation for Florida’s thriving nursery program. He was by all means a friend of nature, but more than that he had a vision of the future. The growth of Levittown suburbia hindered this dream, but by no means did it destroy it. His vision of residential life in Florida, in fact in most of America, was one where nature was as much at home on the property as the homeowners were. Even taking it a step further, his vision included nature taking a primary role, not in Frank Lloyd Wright’s ideal home-as-a-part-of-its-surroundings style, but one where the homeowner could never forget that Earth’s natural beauty was right at his front door.","Nehrling’s dream of the future involved a simple, affordable home, in his mind in the colonial style common in the South. Without a doubt he saw individuals sitting in rocking chairs on their creaky wooden porch and staring out at the nigh-undisturbed flatlands whilst cooling themselves off with a nice glass of freshly brewed iced tea. Beyond the house – for the house is merely the home of the human, while the rest of the world is nature’s home – countless types of tropical and subtropical plants dot the landscape, the palm trees providing shade along the formal avenues while bushes and shrubbery form a natural fence for the grassy green lawn.","Henry Nehrling was not an environmentalist in the modern sense of the word. He did not bemoan the evils of industry and consumerism on his soapbox only to return to his shack on Walden Pond. In fact, some of his plants were used by Henry Ford to develop parts of his assembly line, and automobiles have had a horrendous impact on the environment. Nor was he a businessman; he committed decades of tireless work into his botanical garden because he enjoyed it. His vision of the future was not about saving the environment or making money. He simply wanted to use his horticultural knowledge to make the United States a prettier place."],"display_date":"1890 - 1915","search_date":"1903-01-01","locations":[{"id":1444,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1499,"tag":"Nehrling"},{"id":1500,"tag":"botany"},{"id":1501,"tag":"horticulture"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5575,"title":"<strong>Making the Journey</strong>","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/55","end_date":"12/31/74","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Everyday, Charles Thomas Anderson would embark from the Winter Park Post Office.

He was born in 1917 in Hopkinsville, Kentucky where he claimed his residence until December 1941 when Japan attacked the American military base Pearl Harbor, leading to the United States joining World War II and Anderson joining the cause. After serving as Master Sergeant in the Air Force, Anderson’s life would be forever changed due to the G.I. Bill. This bill made it easier for veterans to own more land more than ever before, specifically in the suburbs.[2] The suburbs were a place where these veterans could raise their baby booming families with a white picket fence and achieve the American dream. The suburb was a passport to consistency, community, and safety. Just as getting to work was important, so was the initial move into the suburbs.[3] For Anderson, in particular, the suburbs of Florida, where lower taxes and tropical weather made this American dream an even better reality, was the ideal place to call home.","Charles Thomas Anderson sought to maintain this dream through employment, employment he found at the Winter Park post office.

It is in this eclectic town that just approximately eighty years prior, in 1934, that Robert E. Langford’s grandmother rolled up to a house at 716 Interlachen Avenue. She witnessed first hand the beautiful moss-covered oak trees of Winter Park, and stated, “This is the place.” She bought the home that August for $12,000, officially beginning the legacy of the Langford Resort Hotel.[1]","Years then passed and American involvement in World War II would begin and end as the entire state of Florida, one of the least populated states in the South, began to transform into a tropical destination.[2] Then in the early 1950s, Robert E. Langford, having been raised in the hotel business in Chicago, decided that he wanted to build a hotel in the very neighborhood that his grandmother called home. Langford realized that with the inventions of air conditioning to stifle the Florida heat and air travel to get to destinations easier than ever, Central Florida was ripe for development.[3] He immediately began purchasing property across the street from his grandmother’s house on East New England Avenue to build the one million dollar Langford Resort Hotel.","The two-hundred room luxury Langford Resort Hotel opened its doors officially in January of 1956. Along with it being Central Florida’s first air-conditioned hotel, the modern design of the Langford included the Empire Room, a famed supper club that featured nightclub acts from around the country; the Tree Tap Room, used for dances and banquets; and a seventy-five foot swimming pool surrounded by lush foliage, a petting zoo, and a variety of tropical birds.[4] This hotel quickly became the exotic escape that Florida tourists vied for and attracted numerous influential people including Ronald and Nancy Regan, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Walt Disney while he was scouting the area for a location for his theme park.","After forty-four years and countless guests, in May 2000 the Langford Resort Hotel closed its doors forever.

The Old Winter Park Road was a “nature country –like tree-line”[1] road that connected the city of Winter Park to Orlando. However, with the widening of the road, it was required to cut down the beautiful tall trees on both sides. The decision faced oppositions, specifically by the garden club, which was mainly composed of ladies who resided near the road. The ladies decided to take action to defend the tree. They took turns at shifts under the trees where they usually had a picnic and sat for several hours.","This story not only demonstrates the women movement post World War II in the United States but it also reflects the General Federation of Women’s Club. “The General Federation of Women's Clubs, an umbrella organization of sixteen thousand women's clubs in the United States and overseas, believed that women's public activism would strengthen American greatness at home and abroad, secure peace, and protect democracy in the years following World War II.”[2] It reaffirmed women’s authority over their homes and local community as it focused on personal activism. Moreover, it empowered women by considering them as mothers helping America’s liberty and Future.","Overall, the ladies of Winter Park did not belong to the General Federation of Women’s Club, yet it is noticeable that they shared the same belief that their public activism was capable of achieving their interest.

He died of a heart attack at night in his home, two years after he left his presidency at Rollins. During his earlier life, Holt worked for the <em>Independent, </em>which was a weekly magazine founded by his grandfather and other members of a Congregational Church. Eventually Hamilton Holt would become the owner and editor of the <em>Independent</em> and continue to publish his literary work.","Holt promoted peace and disarmament during his lifetime. He won a myriad of accolades and awards for his work on social justice and peace. In 1924, he was the Democratic Party’s candidate for a special election in Connecticut, his home state, but was defeated by now famous Representative Hiram Bingham, who was also the man who discovered Machu Picchu.","After losing the election, Irving Bacheller, a trustee of Rollins College asked Holt if he would be interested in becoming the next president at Rollins.  Hamilton Holt’s response was that while he had never actually taught students, Holt believed that he had enough experience being taught and spending time in university setting that he should be able to perform the duties of President of Rollins College. Upon accepting the job, Hamilton Holt then had to travel from Connecticut to Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. During this time period it was not an easy feat to travel such a long distance. There was no commercial air travel, and driving was not an option. Hamilton Holt most likely arrived Rollins via train from Connecticut and  disembarked at the old Winter Park train station, which is now used on weekends for the farmers market. From the station he most likely walked down Park Avenue and through the front gates of the campus.","Hamilton Holt redefined education at Rollins with the Rollins Educational Conference system. The impact of Holt’s changes are still evident in Rollins education today. Holt created a system in which students had an 8-hour day with hour periods, instead of just 8 hours of learning a day. This system allowed students to learn three subjects in one day and the fourth period was devoted to working so students could pay for tuition or immerse themselves in the arts. Holt held discussions between schools and scholars so they could discuss what should be learned in the classroom. This system created a debate centered on practicality versus continuing the traditional education path. Holt transformed Rollins from a struggling school into a striving liberal arts college with the reputation it has today. This is why Holt Avenue, Holt Building, and the Holt Night Evening School are all named after him.

The other hotel, the Seminole Hotel, boasted of visitors of such caliber as Henry Flagler, William Rockefeller, and even United States President Grover Cleveland. The Hamilton Hotel was the first in Winter Park to have a bathroom in each room;  while it may seem strange to not have a restroom today, it was common to share bathrooms during those days. In 1941, the price for a room was $2.50 per day, much cheaper than today’s prices.","In the 1970’s the Hamilton Hotel was remodeled and renamed to the Park Plaza Hotel, which it is still known as today. The hotel has risen in popularity, and is now considered one of the nicer hotels in Winter Park. The location for the hotel is excellent because it is situated on Park Avenue, the main road in Winter Park filled with shops, restaurants, a park, and a train station. The hotel’s rooms over look Park Avenue and the park, providing an aesthetically pleasing view. Also, ever since the Seminole Hotel closed, Park Plaza has tried to fill the gap or at least lure some of the more prominent crowd to Park Avenue, which would boost their earnings and also aid shops and restaurants on Park Avenue. One of the ways this was accomplished was by buying huge reproduction beds from the 1700’s and 1800’s, attracting people who wish to experience something new.","The hotel acted as a crucial part in the expansion of Rollins, because it provided visiting parents a place to stay other than the exorbitantly priced Seminole Hotel, which most people would not have been able to afford. The Park Plaza Hotel aided in the growth of Rollins College, which aided in the growth of Winter Park, and so the city conssiders it an important landmark in Winter Park today.

During that time, he and his wife and sons lived at 233 Pinewood Drive in southern Maitland. His journey to his job roughly six miles away was typical for a middle class educator in central Florida. A winding labyrinth of suburbs encircled both his house and the High School at which he worked, and only briefly made contact with any major thoroughfares. The route mainly consisted of a long, slow straightaway crowded with trees and families. MacHardy’s trip to work yields great insight into the suburban middle class culture in Winter Park in the 1970s and 80s.","The city of Maitland is one of the oldest incorporated cities in Central Florida, and somewhat of a sister city to Winter Park. By the turn of the twentieth century, transportation allowed for more people to settle farther from the railroads that confined Winter Park and the surrounding areas. The 1950s saw a boom in Maitland’s growth as corporations were making their way into central Florida.The first suburbs were built to house workers from the Martin Marietta Corporation, and with the growth of State Road 17-92 in the 1960s, the suburban development flourished even more.","The arrival of Disney World in 1971 drew more commerce into central Florida than ever before, and between 1972 and 1979, Maitland added twelve new residential subdivisions as a result of this expansion. If it is any indication of the demographic of Maitland, the 2010 census showed 80 percent of the inhabitants as white. Undoubtedly, this would have been much higher in the 1980s when Mr. MacHardy lived there.","Built in 1969, Winter Park High School already catered to the suburban professionals of Winter Park itself. Its location away from downtown Winter Park allowed for growth and development of suburbs for middle class white professionals who wanted a safe haven for their children. These professionals in the 1980s used the brand new surrounding suburbs as a means of staying close to work while simultaneously being close to a suitable school system tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Fairbanks Avenue.","Bob MacHardy’s journey to work was short and typical for a Winter Park professional. Essentially as a scenic route away from any semblance of urbanity, his journey reflected the 1980s resurgence of suburbanization in response to the relative degradation of the 1970s, as did the suburban developments around his workspace itself.

This encompassed the desire for a man to feel as if he was a man, how he viewed himself, and how he thought he was viewed by others.","The struggle to come into manhood would start in a boy’s adolescence, now that America was in a place where adolescents were permitted to be adolescents. Young boys were not expected to work their teen years away to support their families and America was turning towards secular interests with the rise of a middle class.","As society dictated, there were many things that a man should be capable of to be considered a ‘man.’ These included physical perfection, as seen in cultural examples such as <em>Tarzan, </em>who embodied the epitome of fitness, intelligence, and mastery of his surroundings.

Regulations were put in place and men were expected to be educated so they could be functioning members of society. Through a solid education men were expected to be able to support a family.

From the time that settlers arrived in the early 1700s, Native Americans have been a target of racism. They were forced into slavery, removed from their land, exploited by the United States government and forced to assimilate into US culture. United States citizens and government both worked to promote racist attitudes towards Native Americans. This was apparent in the various acts of legislation that were passed through the government and the wars the US fought against the Native Americans. Although racism was fueled in part by white supremacy, Native Americans also provided an impetus for this racism by resisting oppression by the United States government. A major example of hostilities between Native Americans and the government were the Seminole wars in Florida.","The Seminoles were the most persistent in evading US military and government efforts to dislodge them. They cost the lives of many soldiers in the US military throughout various wars.

However, as there are exceptions to every trend, in the writings of Kirk Munroe the Indians were treated as equals instead of inferiors. In his writings, this was a common theme that defied the racism permeating US society of the time. For example, in a diary that Munroe had written, which served as inspiration for several of his works, he described his encounters with Indians. These are graphic encounters, but Munroe made a point to treat the Indians fairly, and in doing this, he escaped being scalped or beheaded.

These men, the Florida Highwaymen, were a group of around seven men originally. Alfred Hair and James Gibson, two of these original Highwaymen, grew up together as friends, competing in everything. It was this competitive nature that led them to try and outdo one another in the arts, leading them to bringing in as much as $300 in one day in 1950s America (about $3000 today). Today, Mr. James Gibson has painted over 10,000 paintings and has served as the Ambassador of Art for Florida. He has four paintings hanging in the White House and has sold several of his works to former President George Bush, Sr. <br /> As influential as this group of artists was, however, they went forgotten for quite a long stretch of time. Having entered the art world during a time when Florida’s real estate and tourism business was booming, these artists found themselves presented with a large audience of prospective buyers. As this trend declined, however, many of the Highwaymen moved on to different areas of work, causing their influence to be entirely unremembered until 1995, when Jim Fitch, an arts acquisition agent, rediscovered this group of artists. One of the first books on the group listed as many as twenty-six African Americans under the Highwaymen, one woman among their ranks. <br /> Despite their success, the Highwaymen didn’t live completely without fear of competition. “There was envy from other men. One night it came to a head at a juke joint called Eddie’s Place,” Jacki Lyden said in an interview with two of the Highwaymen. Al Black, salesman for the Highwaymen and Alfred’s top businessman, recalls the story, he was at Eddie’s that night. The song “War” came on the jukebox, and Al Black and another unknown group began singing along to it. The next thing anyone saw was someone named J.L. shooting Alfred Hair in the chest. (Lyden) At the young age of 29, Alfred died, all but taking the Highwaymen business with him. Al Black found himself with no paintings to sell, and while he tried to paint his own, he became addicted to drugs and was accused of fraud, eventually being sentenced to twelve years in prison. Even in prison, Black would find space on penitentiary walls to paint Florida landscapes. Of the rest of the Highwaymen, only Gibson kept on painting."],"display_date":"1950 - 1975","search_date":"1962-12-31","locations":[{"id":28935,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1786,"tag":"1950s American Art"},{"id":1785,"tag":"Florida Landscapes"},{"id":1784,"tag":"Artist"},{"id":238,"tag":"African American"}],"course":{"name":"The Comic Book City","school":"Rollins College","course_id":112,"school_id":5}},{"id":5834,"title":"Abortion Law vs. Morale in the 1970s","course_id":119,"status":"P","start_date":"5/8/70","end_date":"5/8/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["It is the 1970s, and a liberal arts college published a newspaper that contains an article about the emergence of the women’s liberation movement, and which focuses on the moral aspects of having an abortion. The author’s name is Gwen von Stetten, a student at Rollins College, and this article was written May 8, 1970; three years before the decision of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and <em>Doe v. Bolton</em>, (both decided on January 22, 1973), two court cases that had made it to the Supreme and state courts, respectively. The question of how much the state and national government is able to interfere in a women’s right to have an abortion became a growing debate on personal rights and freedom, an occurring theme in the newly dubbed ‘Me Decade’ of the 70s.","While the discussion of abortion in the women’s liberation movement was indeed a sensitive one, before the landmark case Roe v. Wade came into the public sphere, the notion of abortion was only allowed in cases if the expectant mother had a serious health risk of carrying the baby to full term. In fact the article precedes both cases, yet writes about both the anti-abortion and pro-abortion views. The argument of the <em>Roe v. Wade</em> case was that under the 4<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, and 14<sup>th</sup> Amendments, women as well as men were allowed due process, the right to privacy, and the ability to purse life, liberty and happiness. Carrying a child that a woman may not be able to take care of, whether due to financial issues, abandoning any educational and occupational aspirations, or for various other reasons goes against the 14<sup>th</sup> amendment. During this time, students became more disillusioned about their government’s ability to decide and intervene in personal matters such as healthcare, especially young women, and thus began to form new political divisions as a result.","In the article, the student writer chooses to use the moral line of thought when addressing her readers, manifesting the fetus into a helpless being to invoke emotional and moral beliefs in her audience. Articles such as these reformed how abortion was discussed in politics-when developing an argument the viewpoint previously would have more of a legal structure, citing whether or not it is possible to perform safe abortions.  Because of the landmark case, the legality of abortions was put into question by the American public at large, introducing a new ideology of politics and law-making that has been mixed in with morality. This opened up grassroots groups such as the New Right, conservatives who are morally opposed to the women’s liberation movement and pro-abortion laws in particular. The article closes with a political and moral quandary that has split America in two, and thus has become a mainstay in political and legal disputes since."],"display_date":"May 8, 1970","search_date":"1970-05-08","locations":[{"id":36752,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1907,"tag":"roe v. wade"},{"id":1906,"tag":"women's liberation"},{"id":796,"tag":"Women's Rights Movement."}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision- 1970s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":119,"school_id":5}},{"id":5835,"title":"Gender in the 1970s: Women's Fashions","course_id":119,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/71","end_date":"12/31/79","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["With fine fabrics and linens that were “soft and sunswept”, Leedy’s on Park Avenue had clothes for “discriminating girls of all ages”[1]. This advertisement reflects the changes in women’s fashion in the 1970s. After the 1960s, known as a decade of peaceful, nonviolent reform movements, the 1970s brought changes in gender roles. Many women demanded equal rights and advocated for careers outside the home. Following the Title VII provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the National Organization for Women was formed in 1966 to help create equal partnership with men. Due to the increase of women working outside of the home in nontraditional work settings, the fashions of women’s clothing started to change. Women that were working in factory jobs obviously needed work clothes – clothes with heavy thread, strong zippers, rugged fabric and heavy-duty pockets. To meet this new demand, the world’s largest retailer, Sears, Roebuck, and Co., “has developed a line of women’s work clothing to take the place of the old clothes, sweatshirts, jeans and men’s work clothing”[2] that many women wore on the job. While miniskirts, makeup, and high heels were popular in the 1960s, many feminists in 1970s rejected the assumptions of feminine beauty and culture by cutting their hair and wearing jeans and pants. From the protest years of the 1960s “American women were no longer willing to follow the lead of fashion designers. Women wanted more than one look and seemed to thrive on choice”.[3] These changing fashions for women were a result from a feeling of repression as one woman explained that “women have been forced to dress as objects since the invention of patriarchy. Why are women forced to dress certain ways? Because our clothes help keep us oppressed. They are a constant reminder of our position”.[4]  In the 1970s, fashion designers introduced a new line of skirts known as the “midi” and “maxi” skirts that came down to women’s ankles and were meant to replace “miniskirts.” While this trend didn’t last long, clothing stores quickly brought back miniskirts, women’s rejection of the longer skirts, “implicitly illustrated that women ought to be able to dress as they pleased, even if the fashions they picked emphasized their sexuality rather than their feminine virtue”[5]. Although not all women changed their styles to button down shirts, jeans, and men’s boots, the transformation in how women dressed challenged how the American society in the 1970s viewed women."],"display_date":"1971 - 1979","search_date":"1975-07-02","locations":[{"id":36752,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1560,"tag":"The 1970s"},{"id":1758,"tag":"Gender"},{"id":197,"tag":"fashion"},{"id":196,"tag":"women's rights"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision- 1970s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":119,"school_id":5}},{"id":5841,"title":"Abortion in the 1970s","course_id":119,"status":"P","start_date":"5/8/70","end_date":"5/8/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the 1970s, abortion became a hot topic that was either avoided in conversation or would lead to a heated debate.  Even today, the debate over abortion is still present.  When the Roe v.

According to the 1978 records of the Vital Statistics of Florida (VSF), dissolutions of marriage (including annulments) reached an all-time high, while remaining below the 1975 divorce rate, at which it had peaked. The divorce ratio in 1978 was 7.4%, an increase from 7.2% in 1977, however still 0.1% shy of the 1975 peak ratio of 7.5%. Still, the table referenced in the VSF shows an overall increase in the frequency of marriage dissolutions through the 1970s. This growth is obvious when looking at the proportion of divorce in the 1970 (5.4%), compared to 7.4% in 1978. It is clear that within the span of 8 years, the rate of divorce in Florida grew by a substantial 2%.","Of course, the Florida State Board of Health offers several factors to be taken into consideration whilst evaluating the statistics concerning divorce. Many of the people whom establish residency in Florida do so solely for the purpose of taking advantage of the state's liberal divorce laws. This fact might account for the high frequency of divorce in Florida when compared to the national average. In 1978, for example, the ratio of dissolutions per 100 marriages in Florida was 69.3, whereas nationally, the ratio was far less, at only 50.3. Still, the State Board of Health predicts a decrease in the difference between these two ratios as other states become more liberal in their own divorce policies. When evaluating the number of marriage dissolutions in Florida, using the numbers collected over the years, the growing divorce trend becomes quite visible. In 1960, for example, 19,511 marriages were dissolved in Florida. By contrast, 37,202 marriages were dissolved in Florida a decade later, in 1970. And in 1978, 66,018 marriages were recorded as having been dissolved in the state of Florida. Given, the occurrence was rising more rapidly than the national average, but that is not to say that the national divorce rate had not been rising as well. In fact, the national divorce ratio had been following an upwards trajectory since 1963, and according to the National Center for Health Statistics, an estimated 1,130,000 divorces were granted in the US during 1978. This was 3.6% higher than the national divorce total for 1977. These statistics paint a clear picture as to the evolving social tendency towards divorce becoming a more frequent occurrence in 1970s America.","There are several logical inferences to make regarding these statistics, the most obvious being that divorce had become a more acceptable practice in US society during this decade. The significance of the rise of divorce in the United States is perhaps most evident in everyday family life. Such an increase in divorce alludes to the changing face of the typical American family during the 1970s. Average American adults during the 1970s probably knew more people who had been divorced, or re-married, than their parents had known. Having step-parents, or being a single mother was probably more common in the 1970s than it had been in the 1950s or 1960s. Regardless of the forces that fuelled this societal shift, the rising divorce rate, as documented in the 1978 Vital Statistics of Florida, clearly marks a change in the American landscape. The growth of dissolutions of marriages during the 1970s speaks to the transformative nature of the decade, and hints at the effect it had on the family dynamics of Americans."],"display_date":1978,"search_date":"1978-07-02","locations":[{"id":36752,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":1496,"tag":"Florida"},{"id":527,"tag":"Divorce"},{"id":1560,"tag":"The 1970s"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision- 1970s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":119,"school_id":5}},{"id":5857,"title":"Black Professionals in the 1970's","course_id":119,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/71","end_date":"12/31/79","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Following the riveting decade of 1960s, African Americans started to act upon the social and political equality that they were granted by the Civil Right Movements. Some of these freedoms include the desegregation of schools and public areas and African American assimilation into society.

In the 1970s, 9.2 percent of African-American professors were women, and 29.3 Caucasian women were employed during this time. [1]Eleanor Mitchell was the first African-American professor at Rollins College to teach an International Relation courses.  She would later lead the first study aboard trip to explore Africa.  Mitchell goal was “insure that anyone who is interested, could find career opportunity information on international relations.”  During the trip to Africa, student would explore Senegal, Dakar, Liberia’s capital Monrovia, Ghana’s capital Accra, and the last stop Nigeria; which was the “slave coast”, where the slaves would have to wait until they were shipped off to the United States.[2] Following the trip to Africa, she was able to take four students from Rollins to the Model U.N session held at Auburn University, At the Model U.N session these students won a trophy for participating in the French Delegation.Still relatively young at 24, Mitchell opted to continue her studies in political science in Tallahassee.

During the 1880s and 1890s, the United States was experiencing a time of innovation, and Winter Park’s amenities promoted these new inventions and attracted wealthy citizens to vacation in the town.","Winter Park was a new and popular city after its founding in 1881. Those who helped found Winter Park, such as Loring Chase and Oliver Chapman, were hoping to attract northerners to the area. The Seminole Hotel was Winter Park’s main attraction, providing a place for tourists or natives to stay. The Seminole hotel advertised that it could hold 400 visitors, and that it had the newest innovative amenities, including elevators, private bathrooms, and electricity. While advertising the numerous amenities it possessed, the hotel was also promoting that all of the employees at the hotel were white men from the north. This was advertised because of the racial tensions between whites and African Americans at the time. The Seminole Hotel attracted many northerners, often referred to as “snowbirds.” Winter Park was successful in attracting tourists from the Northeast, as well as tourists from different areas of Florida.[1]","The Seminole Hotel opened on New Years Day of 1886.[2] Although the Seminole received much attention from tourists, it was not the first hotel to be built in Winter Park. The Rogers House was a small bed and breakfast opened in 1882, just after the founding of Winter Park.[3] These hotels were attractive to wealthy individuals of the North. Many believed that Florida was a place to visit to better one’s health because of the warm climate and moderate weather. Because the winter months were the most profitable times of the year, The Rogers House and the Seminole Hotel were only open from November to April. Many wealthy and prominent people visited the Seminole Hotel during its prime, including President Grover Cleveland, and President Benjamin Harrison and his wife. Visitors of the Seminole Hotel could participate in games of tennis, and croquet; they could also take a boat out on to the lake, and take horses out for a trot.[4] The Seminole Hotel was in operation from 1886 to 1902, when it burned down during its off-season of September.[5]","Along with the hotels that made Winter Park a desirable vacationing destination, there were other leisurely activities offered in the city. Boating on Lake Osceola, golfing, and shopping on Park Avenue were some of the activities offered in Winter Park. Traveling to the town was made easier with the building of the rail line through the town, called the Dinky Line.[6] The inviting hotels, the countless activities offered, the preferable weather, and the location of Winter Park were the deciding factors that made Winter Park such a popular place for a “southern jaunt.”"," "],"display_date":1885,"search_date":"1885-07-02","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2319,"tag":"\"Dinky Line\""},{"id":2318,"tag":"\"The Rogers House\""},{"id":2317,"tag":"\"Seminole Hotel\""},{"id":2316,"tag":"\"Winter Park\""}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6140,"title":"Occupy Winter Park: The Negro Influence","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-12-01","end_date":"12/1/06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Argueably, nothing shaped Southern history more dramatically and quickly than the integration of African American citizens into the newly liberated lifestyle. For, the subsequent conflict and tug of war between politics, racism, and the constitution resulted in many structural changes in voting, economics, and progression towards a more industrialized future, many of which to the detriment of negro citizens. The new inhabitants of Florida often carried the same traditions, biases, and customs, resulting in the same issues of the more developed states. However, while complete, universal freedom seemed bleak under the heavyweight of opression by Jim Crow laws, many of the black population adapted to create a functional form of society and become an integral system of  vocality and even influence. Due to the advancements of the economic and political success in Hannibal Square, the African American population proved a steadfast sufficiency to coping under white-dominant pretenses.","In earliest planning of Winter Park, the city’s co-founders Loring Chase and Oliver Chapman gridded out a specific and distinct living space where the black population was to reside. For, as African Americans proved to be the main source of labor for the greatly and economically successful Seminole Hotel, many of the current residents were welcomed and encouraged to migrate for permanent residence in Winter Park[1]. The evident seperation of Hannibal Square from the rest of the town created a comfortable and nonthreatening enviroment for many of the white citizens. There was a regiment balance and order to the co-existance and symbiotic relationship between the two races. However,  as Winter Park experienced a steady increase of African American citizens, the political correlation and impact also rose and dramatically changed. Numerically, out of 297 black citizens 64 were registered to vote as compared to the white population of 203 with only 47 registered to voted[2]. Therefore, the political tides disrupted what had been previously viewed as an ideal balanced system of life in Winter Park. The evidence of political shift to Republican Party or the ‘Party of Lincoln’, based upon the logical predictions according to the demographic, created such a panic within the Democratic Party that when Hannibal Square demanded incorporation with Gus Henderson provoking the insentive in 1887, it was met with strong adversay despite economic advantages that could benefit Winter Park[3]. The influence of Hannibal Square even managed to elect two black men, Frank R. Israel and Walter B Simmons as two of six on the official council of Winter Park, and allow them to maintain their position despite multiple petitions and attempts of impeachment[4].","As stated by an article in the Lochemeade, the local Winter Park newspaper, “A score of citizens colored and white I wondered what they gathered around to even meet one individual is rare. Together who hail from the precipents of Hannibal Square”. [5]The rise of tolerance and influence led to overall success of Hannibal Square though much dissent and adversary were still present and active in its growth. Hannibal Square may be the more of the exception than the rule when it came to the lifestyle of the black citizens during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, however, it still sparked the hope for future change and despite the obvious setbacks, there was still a growing chance to survive with diligence in such a world. As Fredrick Douglas once stated “Without a struggle there cannot be progress.” Hannibal Square stands a shining example that through the struggle, the cultivation of progress prevails and illuminates in our history today."," ","[1] The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica. \"Winter Park (Florida, United States).\" <em>Encyclopedia Britannica Online</em>.

At its head was Hannibal Square, Winter Park, Florida resident Gus C. Henderson, who acted as the paper’s manager. A staunch Republican, Henderson began the newspaper with the goal of providing the citizens of Hannibal Square and Winter Park with political updates as well as local social news. Clearly stated in its “Introduction” article, <em>The Advocate</em> pledged its responsibility to, “take a stand that we may never be afraid or ashamed to advocate.” To Henderson, publishing editorials and informative articles about the political occurrences in Winter Park was of the utmost importance, and for this reason, he willingly, “[entered] the journalistic life with all its difficulties and bankruptcy…” As the article acknowledges, many black-owned and operated newspapers in the South remained unsuccessful due to both economic hardship as well as the high illiteracy rate among black populations. The 1886 Constitution of Florida also all but eliminated black individuals from political relevancy. <em>The Advocate</em>, however, reached great success, as the paper would go on to capture the attention of black and white citizens alike, and remained one of the two black-owned newspapers in Florida for a time. Henderson himself worked not only as the business manger, but also became a reporter, editor, and advertising salesman for the paper.","Although Henderson confirmed that this newspaper would not become a “political machine,” he made it clear that <em>The Advocate</em> would never hesitate to promote views that are right and just. What Henderson is referring to is not specified, but the context in which the newspaper was originally published suggests that political advocacy for the Republican party, as well as the rights of black individuals were both on the paper’s agenda. At the time of the first publication, the predominantly black Hannibal Square district of Winter Park had recently been incorporated into the rest of the city due to a great deal of political activism on Henderson’s part. Like Henderson, the creators of Winter Park and Hannibal Square, Loring Chase and Oliver Chapman, were also members of the Republican party. For these reasons and more, Henderson had long been a proponent for the Republicans, even crediting the party with aiding in the abolishment of slavery. Such political views hinted at in this introductory article would later be clearly reflected in the articles and editorials published in the paper’s future issues, and politics would play a key role in making <em>The Advocate </em>a voice for the black individuals of Winter Park, Florida in the late 19th century."],"display_date":"May 31, 1889","search_date":"1889-05-31","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2322,"tag":"Gus Henderson"},{"id":2321,"tag":"post-reconstruction"},{"id":2273,"tag":"Newspaper"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":1496,"tag":"Florida"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6142,"title":"<strong>Hamilton Disston: The Man Who Reshaped Florida</strong>","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1881-01-01","end_date":"1896-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Hamilton Disston's mission was to transform Florida from a state full of swamps to an almost tropical paradise. He put down his famous saws and left his home in Philadelphia to travel down to Florida and take on the highly risky and tough job of finding a way for people to want to move to Florida.","Hamilton was born on August 23, 1844 in Philadelphia. His father, Henry Disston, was the head of the Keystone Saw, Tool, Steel, and File Works which would eventually be renamed to Henry Disston and Sons. Hamilton worked at the factory as an apprentice. During the Civil War, Hamilton Disston and others from the factory left to join the Union Army, and he returned after the war ended in 1865. When his father died in 1878, Hamilton Disston took control of his father's company, which was renowned for the saws that they produced. William D. Bloxton, governor at the time, eventually was able to get Hamilton Disston to sign a land deal in 1881 to make Florida more appealing for people to move down there, especially the wealthy. By 1855, five years after Florida was given almost seven million acres of land, the state established an Internal Improvement Fund. The fund was created to help build various construction projects, like railroads, to improve Florida overall and its economy. However the poor amount of money the fund received from the land it sold caused it to go into massive debt."," ","In 1881 Hamilton Disston signed a deal to drain the lands that were being filled with water from the Kissimmee River and Lake Okeechobee. To drain out the lands and to keep them from filling up with water again, Hamilton Disston had Lake Okeechobee drained, by connecting it to the Caloosahatchee River which would effectively allow the lake to flow right into the Gulf of Mexico. For the Kissimmee River, Hamilton Disston had a series of canals built that would allow the river to flow into a series of lakes. After he successfully completed draining out most of the land in the area he was working on, Hamilton and others were able to start farming on the land. Hamilton Disston and his workers were able to successfully drain out the lands and allow Florida to be developed into a better area to live in. Farming became big, even Hamilton Disston grew his own sugar canes; on the land he drained. Towns sprung up across Florida, including Winter Park. While Hamilton Disston was in Florida he became sort of a celebrity. During the dedication of the Lyman Gymnasium at Rollins College, Hamilton Disston, nicknamed the Florida Sugar King at the time, and his wife were some of the distinguished guests invited to attend it. The couple even stayed at the Seminole Hotel, which was famous for hosting wealthy visitors to the town of Winter Park.","Despite his success in transforming Florida, Hamilton Disston's good fortune would eventually run out. Although Hamilton Disston was able to profit off the selling of his land, much of the land was still not being sold. To go along with his inability to sell the rest of the land in 1893 there was a big economic panic, and a huge freeze in Florida that destroyed a lot of the crops in the area, which hurt Disston even more. Hamilton Disston also did a good deal of investing in steamboats as well as the land in Florida, but the steamboat investment was short lived due to the emergence of railroads in Florida that were now able to be built on the newly drained land. Hamilton Disston would eventually commit suicide on April 30, 1896, most likely due to the economic burdens he was dealing with. Hamilton's brother William Disston would take over the factory after Hamilton's death, and restore it almost to its former glory.","Hamilton Disston, a wealthy northern saw maker born into his wealth and position, had a goal to transform Florida into a habitable area for people to move down south and make a successful living. He was able to reshape Florida into wet, swampy land, to a state where people could move down and restart their lives through various ways, like farming. Although his success only lasted about ten years and ended in economic failure and suicide, he still was able to make an impact to the overall condition Florida was in."," "," "," "],"display_date":"1881 - 1896","search_date":"1888-12-31","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2323,"tag":"Hamilton Disston"},{"id":1496,"tag":"Florida"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6143,"title":"The Columbian Exposition: America’s Showcase to the World","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-05-01","end_date":"1893-10-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On September 7, 1893, Professor John Howard Ford returned from Chicago where he had placed an exhibit of Rollins College at the Chicago World’s Fair.[1]  The exhibit was placed in three different sections at the Fair: the Educational Department of Liberal Arts, the Denominational Department, and in the Florida Building.[2]  Ford was acting president at the college, having stepped into the position following President Edward Hooker’s resignation in 1892 due to his failing health.[3]  Dr. Ford was a member of the faculty from 1886-1901, during which he taught Greek, English Literature, and Psychology.[4]  In addition to his teaching and presidential duties, he served as Dean of the Faculty from 1894-1897.[5]","The Chicago World’s Fair, also known as the Columbian Exposition, was held from May 1-October 30, 1893, and highlighted “the industrial and technological progress of the United States.”[6]  The Fair commemorated the 400<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Columbus’s arrival in the New World.  Chicago beat out a number of cities to host the Fair, their cause aided by extensive lobbying and millions of dollars pledged to cover costs.  It took head architect Daniel H.

The original claims, made by the majority white democrats and self-proclaimed “honest Christians,” stated that the officials were “robbing the town, keeping no records of their transactions, appropriating money in large blocks without cause, and in short, committing all kinds of rascality.”[1] However, the “One Who Knows,” the informant for <em>The Advocate</em> argues in favor of the current officials. He claimed that all money was accounted for and every bill passed and paid for was done so according to state law. He also advocated that the Treasurer was a trustworthy man who would not misappropriate money and he challenged anyone to check the books and find fault in their statements. If they cannot, he challenged the accusers to go back to school and to “practice the religion that some of them preach.”[2]  It appears that “The One Who Knows” and the original accusers were very focused on money in conjunction with justice.","The theme of money proved itself to be a sore topic around this time period. The early 1890’s was a period of economic growth. By 1890, Robber barons had already gotten their hands into the economic world, so much so, that people were worried about their power; therefore, the Sherman Anti-Trust Act was passed in 1890. This act aimed to limit “monopolistic tendencies,” and in turn, bar combination in restraint of trade.[3] This whole system of Robber Barons and monopolistic economy scared many people into believing that their money would be stolen from them at any time.","Another event that panicked people into believing that their money would be lost was the Panic of 1893. The Panic of 1893 began in Argentina, where British and other foreign investors, had been heavily investing in the America’s wheat crop. However, in 1893, the wheat crop failed, and there was a coup in Buenos Aires, causing the foreign investors to withdrawal all of their investments from the Americas.[4] This unfortunate event dropped the weekly bank clearing totals almost $100 million (approximately $400 million today,) as many people in central Florida took their money out of the banks.[5]","The three events discussed are causes of controversy and called for justice incited by money. These scares can be seen as an origin for the money worries in Winter Park in the first place. It could help explain why the accusations were made in the first place and why the “One Who Knows” felt so compelled to respond and prove them wrong; instilling justice to the ones wronged in the first place."," "," "],"display_date":"February 23, 1893","search_date":"1893-02-23","locations":[{"id":1444,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2328,"tag":"The Advocate"},{"id":2327,"tag":"Gerrymandering"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6146,"title":"Florida's Phenomenal and Progressive Political Position in 1893","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-07-08","end_date":"1893-07-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the late nineteenth century, several factors contributed to the establishment of the post-Reconstruction era South. Such factors include creating a balance between agrarian and industrial economic profit, establishing a sustainable political atmosphere, and moving towards development that would place the South in equal ranks with the North in terms of industrialization and productivity. Despite this overall sentiment to rebuild the region, certain aspects of the New South’s society were harder to establish than others. In particular, politics of the 1880’s and the 1890’s caused numerous setbacks due to the extreme partisanship, internal corruption within each party, and the competitive nature of elections.","Winter Park, Florida had effectively settled itself in terms of generating economic profit for the town, creating a pleasurable lifestyle for its residents and guests, as well as establishing a stable political environment. Various hotels such as the Seminole advertised sunshine as the key to escaping the unbearable winter months in the North as well as advertising its luxurious and spacious atmosphere. Labor was needed to provide for the flock of Northerners, so recently freed black citizens were encouraged to move to Winter Park as a place to live and work.[1] This influx of tourists created large economic profits for Winter Park, and thus caused other industries began to evolve as well. Despite the inclusion of black citizens into the town, social tensions did remain throughout the South, but the political upset are discussed in more detail in this article.","“A Quiet Election” provides an inside look into this stable political setting that is unusual compared to the rest of the South. In July of 1893, one ticket or platform ran for Town Council positions of mayor, marshal, collector, treasurer, and clerk, but these men did not have an opposing force to campaign against.[2] Florida has a history of political transformation especially after the Spanish-American War, in which the United States gained large territories in the Southwest region. Sectionalism and the later argument of secession created divisions among Floridians, so the political atmosphere of this state was, contrary to what “A Quiet Election” illustrates, composed of several different affiliations.[3] Further, the two-party system existed when Florida was admitted to the Union in 1848.[4] As a result, the continued competitive nature between the two major parties, as well as smaller third party organizations, made up the political culture within Florida. The book <em>The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction </em>provides description of the standard regional Southern politics of the 1890’s: The Civil War and Reconstruction created a two-party system that transformed into a two-region system, with the North being mostly Republicans and the South being mostly Democrats.[5] Political parties were not mentioned and rather the article, “A Quiet Election,” only discusses information concerning the homes and reputations of the men elected. With this new round of officials, the newspaper ends on a progressive and positive note, “[A]nd now things are moving on. For them, we hope success.”[6]","In conclusion, the standard political aspects of the 1890’s in Florida as well as the majority of the South included severe party loyalty and an overarching theme of competition between the two major parties. Despite this fact, Winter Park seems to experience a completely different political landscape as illustrated by the City Council election of July 1893. One ticket of men ran for office and thus were elected. The article did not mention their party affiliations and instead discussed their relationships to the Winter Park community with an encouraging outlook for continued progress and industrialization of the town."],"display_date":"July 8, 1893","search_date":"1893-07-08","locations":[{"id":1444,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2330,"tag":"Election 1893"},{"id":2329,"tag":"1890s"},{"id":1496,"tag":"Florida"},{"id":1495,"tag":"Winter Park"},{"id":1444,"tag":"American Politics"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6147,"title":"Brawn and Beauty: The Seminole Hotel","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1890-01-01","end_date":"1890-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the year 1886, Winter Park made a decision that would change the way people saw the community. The Seminole Hotel built on Lake Osceola, which contributed to the economic advantage of the town. The destination became a widespread vacation spot for wealthy northerners and thus generated a large majority of the profit for the economy. It was apparent that the wealthy northerners enjoyed the warm weather and beautiful scenery.","The hotel being such a success among the northerners; it brought in publicity from all over, which brought in the wealthy and famous people to stay in the hotel such as William Rockefeller and President Grover Cleveland, along with several senators and acclaimed citizens from the nation's capital.","Along with its great publicity, it brought good business with job opportunities for African-Americans in the neighboring area. Even after legal protections made for the newly freed slaves, it was still difficult for African-Americans to obtain decent jobs with a good salary.","<em>“After the Civil War, there were plenty of displaced African-Americans citizens looking for a place to live and work in the South. Despite the abolition of slavery, land ownership rights were restricted, making it difficult for blacks to become financially stable…Chase and Chapman were about to market their town to the wealthy white northerners in 1881 as a winter resort and a sound financial investment for the developing citrus industry. Needing an abundant labor force to work in hotels and groves. They welcomed the former slaves as member of the community”(Winter).</em>","Most of the job opportunities for African Americans were working in hotels, such as the Seminole Hotel, which was a one of the only businesses in Florida that employed African-Americans during this time. Not only did they employ men and women, but also, children to carry out these duties. When the famous decided to stay at the hotel, most every worker had to work double, they would also be given additional jobs, such as driving the carriage to the train station to pick up and drop off the guest. The workers were treated well at the hotel and made a decent salary.","While other businesses still discriminated against the newly freed African-Americans, the Seminole Hotel hired them in a heartbeat. Through their affiliation with wealthy northerner hotel guests, local African-Americans were able to find off-season jobs such maintaining gardens for the wealthy people who had to go back home to the north in the summer. Thus beneficial for African-American families in Winter Park, because through these connections they were primarily assured work all year round.","In conclusion, the Seminole Hotel not only brought a vacation destination to the wealthy northerners, but an economic profit to the community, as well as a monetary wealth to those African-Americans who worked at the hotel."," "],"display_date":1890,"search_date":"1890-07-02","locations":[{"id":1444,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2332,"tag":"Seminole Hotel jobs"},{"id":2331,"tag":"Winter Park 1890"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6148,"title":"Cuban Students, American Dreams","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1899-01-24","end_date":"1899-01-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1899, there were a total of twenty-two Cuban students attending Rollins College, whereas before 1896, there were none. According to the Winter Park Scrapbook, they were the moral and intellectual equals of their American peers, though most knew very little English upon arriving in Winter Park. These students chose Rollins College primarily because of its proximity to their homeland and its affordable cost; many came from old patrician families whose fortunes had been ruined by the Cuban War for Independence and the Spanish-American War. These students were merely a few of thousands of young Cubans looking to come to America for an education, after their country severed ties with Spain[1].","The causes of this dramatic shift in educational preferences are interwoven both directly and indirectly with the consequences of the Spanish-American War and represent just one aspect of a shift throughout Cuba and the world. After years of war, Cuban society was in an upheaval; much of the upper class had lost everything, and a new economic and political system was well on its way to supplanting the old. For over three hundred years, Spain had been Cuba’s ruler and primary economic partner, but trade shifted markedly towards the United States when the price of sugar, Cuba’s chief export, dropped in 1884. This was the beginning of the decline of the wealthy sugar aristocracy, as American companies began to purchase and update struggling Cuban sugar mills to cut costs. Thus the island, once completely dependent on Spain, now had a much closer and wealthier trading partner[2].","The Cuban War for Independence began in 1895 but was not the first time Cubans had fought to free themselves from Spanish rule. This time, Cuba’s importance to the American economy ensured that, unlike in past struggles, the war got international publicity. Because of yellow journalism, there was a growing demand for American intervention in Cuba’s plight. After the famous sinking of the<em> USS Maine</em>, this demand culminated in the Spanish-American War of 1898. The United States quickly defeated Spain and won the war, by the end of which Cuba was ravaged by years of fighting but free of Spanish control. When the United States took temporary control of the island at the end of the war, ties between the two countries were strengthened even further[3].","This change in Cuba as a nation was only a piece of a larger transformation occurring throughout the world. By the twilight of the nineteenth century, the west was all but won; the United States was beginning to look beyond its own shores and becoming involved in global affairs. In the Spanish-American War, America truly made its entrance onto the world stage, defeating a major colonial power and taking Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines as overseas territories as well as assuming control of Cuba[4]. The United States established a new reputation as a force to be reckoned with, and as it shifted its focus outward, the world in turn began to look towards it as a leader. The influx of Cuban students at Rollins and the widespread demand for American education described in the Winter Park Scrapbook directly after the Spanish-American War ended were just one part of this shift in both Cuban and global views as America took her place among the pantheon of global powers."," ","[1] Loring Augustus Chase, The Winter Park Scrapbooks “The Strike on the Domerick” (Loring Chase, Winter Park, 1893) 556","[2] Jose M.

The district in question, Hannibal Square, had been incorporated into the surrounding Winter Park community hardly five years before city councilmen voted to reopen the incorporation debate, the goal being to exclude the largely black (and therefore Republican) town from the local voting district. Obviously, this would provide the primarily white Democratic council with a political advantage, come election time.","One particular article in the city’s only black-owned newspaper, <em>The</em> <em>Advocate</em>,entitled “A Colored Man’s Views” discusses the possible negative consequences of the exclusion of Hannibal Square from Winter Park, and the deception of black voters by white Rollins College professors. Its author, a black individual named H. H. Lovett, proposes that without the protection of Winter Park’s laws, Hannibal Square will become, “a place where all the toughs of Winter Park will come; where liquor will be sold; where all kinds of bad people in Winter Park will come to cause trouble and drink.” Unsurprisingly, Lovett was concerned about his town’s crime rates; with the disenfranchisement of black individuals in the post-Reconstruction years, violent acts of racial intimidation and crime saw a considerable increase. Florida in particular had the highest lynching rate in the entirety of the South. Hannibal Square itself was a thriving African American community, and more than likely was not on the verge of becoming a hotbed of racial crime; however, after the reopening of the incorporation debate, when white councilmen had previously promised the original decision was final, Lovett’s mistrust and concern is valid.","Lovett also mentions Winter Park’s Rollins College in his editorial. In particular, he draws attention to a man named Professor Ford, who urged African American voters in the area to vote “dry” in order to prohibit the college’s students from the sale or possession of alcohol, believing it would benefit the school. The dry vote won, and like many African Americans, Lovett believed their community would be treated with respect as a result. This was not the case, and as Lovett explains, “…all went solid and the Prof. said we did noble and acted the part of good citizens. Now how are we to be treated? The first chance he and Prof. Austin get they sign a petition to cut us out of town…” Rightfully, Lovett and his fellow black citizens felt betrayed at this attempt to exclude their town from the Winter Park community. In some ways, this incident was part of a large state-wide attempt to disenfranchise African Americans. With the New Florida Constitution in 1885, the state implemented poll taxes, separate ballot boxes, and other methods to dissuade black individuals from voting, and ultimately make them politically irrelevant. This systematic oppression may have lead to episodes like the one described by Mr. Lovett in his editorial; African Americans had no voting power, as a result there was little reason for leaders to pander to or support them.","Overall, Lovett’s article is indicative of a widespread problem African American’s faced, not only in Florida, but across the United States. As Reconstruction ended, black individuals found it increasingly difficult to be heard, and faced not only the beginning of segregation, but a drastic rise in the amount of racial intimidation, especially in states like Florida. Despite difficulties faced by black publications at the time, newspapers like <em>The Advocate </em>were instrumental in bringing light to issues like that of Mr. Lovett’s."],"display_date":"February 2, 1893","search_date":"1893-02-02","locations":[{"id":1444,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2432,"tag":"political corruption"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":123,"tag":"Reconstruction"},{"id":2321,"tag":"post-reconstruction"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6248,"title":"Ghosts in the Political Machine: Black Disenfranchisement in Winter Park","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1889-10-01","end_date":"1889-10-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["There was little that stood out in the reporting of the October 1889 elections in the young town of Winter Park. Of the 103 registered voters, 85 casted votes with the almost unanimous re-election of the officials.[1] Upon further examination of later elections, a trend forms when it comes to voter turnout. In 1890, fifty-five people voted in the municipal elections, forty-three in 1891, and thirty-nine in 1892.[2] The drop coincides with the southern movement of disenfranchising the black vote. During those years, Winter Park included Hannibal Square, a black community where the registered black voters outnumbered all the white voters of the rest of the town. As Reconstruction ended and Republicans were pushed out of the South, various laws and barriers, including poll taxes, began to be passed into law.","Poll taxes are taxes applied to people eligible to vote that must be paid before their vote can be casted. Poll taxes have been used in all of the American colonies at one period or another, but the South embraced the concept at the turn of the century.[3] The Florida constitution of 1885 authorized a two dollar poll tax and the legislature carried out the provision in 1889.[4] The two dollar tax to vote was not a great hindrance to most whites, but the effect on blacks is undeniable. It was said that the law virtually disfranchised two-fifths of the state's voters and reduced the Republicans (then known as the ''black party'') to impotence, at the same time that it purged the Democratic Party of an unwanted element, and it made Florida a one-party state.[5] By the time the tax was repealed in the South, it no longer mattered as there were other racially exclusive laws that kept the vast majority of blacks from voting.[6] With no blacks voting, no blacks were elected to office. Between the years of 1873 to 1895, blacks in the Mississippi legislature went from a high of 64 to zero. In 1901, the last southern black congressman relinquished their seat and a black congressman from the south would not be elected until the 1970s.The disfranchisement continued down to the local level.[7] A few years after the 1889 elections, Winter Park executed their own disenfranchisement of the black community of Hannibal Square.","The mythology around the history of Winter Park and Hannibal Square is painted as one of a black community and white community working together. The reality of the situation was a conflict for power. Of the total number of registered voters in Winter Park, 64 were black and 47 were white in 1893, so any measure that blacks were against could be voted down if enough people voted.[8] The Democrats in Winter Park understood that as long as Hannibal Square was part of the town, the Republicans would have control of the local government. Unable to redistrict the town through a straight vote, a petition was successfully sent to the Florida State legislature to redraw the town borders. Without the support of Hannibal Square, the power of Winter Park shifted away from the elected government to the new, Democratic Party controlled government, symbolic of the southern return to white-only politics. In the report of the 1889 election, one note was left out about who was re-elected. One of those re-elected to office was F.R. Israel, a black man. In five years, Israel would no longer be a citizen of the town he once aided in governing. Blacks made progress after the Civil War to gain a political voice, as illustrated by the election of F. R. Israel. The transformation of Winter Park in five years mirrored the new South. The black population was pulled away from their political accomplishments and prevented from the regaining of the voice they once possessed. Once again, they were the ghosts fighting to be heard."," ","[1] \"The Town Election Last Thursday,\" Winter Park Scrapbook, Archives and Special Collections, Olin Library, Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida. 319-1.","[2] Claire Leavitt MacDowell, “Winter Park – the Second Decade, 1890-1899” in <em>Chronological <br /> History of Winter Park</em>, (Winter Park, FL: Winter Park Herald, 1950) 48-53.","[3] <em>Dictionary of American History</em>, ed.

Public School No. 31 had an especially good turnout, with both white and black in attendance. Mayor Robert White Jr. and Founder of Winter Park, Loring Chase, came out to celebrate this moment promoting education.  Chase boasted that “with this, as with Knowles School for white scholars, Winter Park takes formal possession of the best school building in Orange County for a colored school,” and was arguably the best colored school in the state. This dedication towards supporting education in Winter Park both parallels and contrasts with other southern states during this time period. Unlike the rest of the South, Winter Park allowed its black residents to attend school without the fear of being harmed and with the reassurance that they would be receiving a good education. Similar to the communities in other parts of the country, Winter Park began to put more emphasis into the quality of its education.","The fact that a large segment of the town gathered to support the opening of both  Public School No.31 and Knowles School emphasize the importance of education to the community. While the schools were segregated, the ability for the town to support the safety and education of its black citizens was astonishing in comparison to the rest of the south. During this period white southerners embrace racial restrictions for African Americans. These policies banned blacks from experiencing many of the benefits that whites were able to enjoy. For example, while whites were able to go to school and pursue education, racial segregation forced blacks to rely on inadequate resources in their schools. Black students were often forced to learn in broken-down schoolhouses as well as use outdated textbooks. Additionally, students in the South were often victims of lynchings, school burnings and the like. However, in Winter Park the stakes were much different; students were able to attend school with a feeling of security because the town supported both school openings equally. They were also assured that they would receive an adequate education due to Public School No.31 being considered the best of its kind in the state.","Indeed, after the Civil War Florida began to place more emphasis on the importance of education. The US was investing heavily in the importance of education in the 1890s. By 1890 over 70% of all children attended grammar school. Additionally, the amount of high schools in various states rose from 160 in 1870 to over 6,000 by the end of the century. During this time the amount of explicit and implicit expenditures in the US school system rose from $314 million to $515 million in 1880 and 1890 respectively. Winter Park was not far behind in this process. The opening of Knowles School and Public School No.31 in 1890 proves that the importance of education bled into Florida as much as other parts of the country during this historical period."," "," "],"display_date":"February 1890","search_date":"1890-02-14","locations":[{"id":1444,"lat":28.5664573086,"lng":-81.3013732137,"zoom":9,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2433,"tag":"southern education"},{"id":939,"tag":"Public Schools"},{"id":467,"tag":"Black Schools"},{"id":266,"tag":"Segregation"},{"id":1336,"tag":"racial equality"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6220,"title":"Republicans Try to Take back Control","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"3/4/93","end_date":"3/4/93","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the late nineteenth century, the post-Reconstruction era South created many years of turbulence. Mainly between the two largest political powers the Republicans and Democrats. The politics of the 1880s and the 1890s created an abundance of delays due to the bigotry, internal corruption within each political party, and the extreme competitiveness of elections. As Reconstruction diminished, the status of any freedman may have increased but the discrimination is still there[1].","After the Reconstruction period the Republicans called themselves \"radicals.\" The radicals were averse during the war by moderates and conservative parties led by Abraham Lincoln. After the war by there was an even larger split between the nation the \"Conservatives\" in the South and \"Liberals\" in the North. Radicals were strongly against slavery during and after the war. Moreover, disbelieved ex-Confederates that demanded harsh administration for the former rebels and accentuate civil and voting rights for freedmen, otherwise known as the recently freed slaves.","Although African-Americans gained freedom in the South, they did not gain equality. Despite the Republicans efforts during Reconstruction, many African-Americans in the South still had to deal with the struggles of poverty, the lack of proper education and unemployment. Exhausted and unemployed, many African-Americans moved to cities to search for work. As a result of the migration, the population of African-Americans in the South increased tremendously by roughly 75 percent during the late 1800s. Other freed African-Americans tried to establish farms but lacked the right resources and equipment; they were compelled to rent out land under the sharecropping system. Discrimination in the South intensified with the passage of Jim Crow laws in the 1880s. The Jim Crow laws were racial segregation laws that went into legislation between 1876 and 1965 in the United States. The Supreme Court were still demoralizing and discriminated against African-Americans, shown in the court case of Plessy v. Ferguson decision in 1896, which declared all “separate, but equal” to be constitutional.","While in Florida around the time of post-Reconstruction a Judge by the name of Hon J. R. Mizell[2], being interviewed about legislation in Winter Park. He explains that there is nothing wrong with the government while he speaks so highly of those in office. He goes on explaining about those in office and how they each have honor and integrity and no fool would go against any of them. Mizell clarifies how it would be childish of individuals to petition on Park Ave because it will result in large amounts of money by both sides; it will increase taxes, deter people from settling. Winter Park had adequately constructed a balanced in profit coming through the town, bringing an enjoyable lifestyle for its residents, all while trying to keep a calm political atmosphere[3]. Hotels in the surrounding areas began to spread the ideas of sunshine in Florida to get those Northerners to escape the insufferable winter months. With the arrival of tourists creating large fiscal profits for Winter Park and created a chain for other big industries began to develop over time as well. Despite the migration of African-American citizens into the town, social tensions did continue throughout the Southern states.","All in all, after post-Reconstruction nobody was happy with the government and how it was presented, not the Conservatives or Liberals. Though Judge Mizell did touch on something important that though the petitioners may have had the majority of the white vote they did not have a chance against the Democratic legislature."],"display_date":"March 4, 1993","search_date":"1993-03-04","locations":[{"id":41939,"lat":28.5146851201,"lng":-81.3237702415,"zoom":9,"place":"Orange, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":1496,"tag":"Florida"},{"id":2436,"tag":"Judges"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6234,"title":"History Engine II","course_id":131,"status":"P","start_date":"1893-02-11","end_date":"1893-02-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />","Racial Tensions in the Post-Reconstruction South"," ","Cameron Ochse","History Engine 2","Decade of Decisions: 1890s"," ","On February 11th, 1893 in the blossoming town of Winter Park, Florida a letter was sent into Gus C. Henderson’s newspaper, The Advocate. The letter portrays frustration at the soon to be separation of Hannibal Square and Winter Park, despite their incorporation just a few years prior. The writer discussed how it was a blatant act of gerrymandering; accusing Democrats in the Winter Park government of wanting to remove Hannibal Square just so there would be less Republicans in the area. The only two Republicans in the legislature at the time were Walter Simpson and Frank Israel, both African-Americans elected from Hannibal Square voters. Democrats from Winter Park knew that with the majority of registered voters residing in Hannibal Square, it was only a matter of time until they would lose their power and Winter Park would become a Republican town.","Many Southerners rejected the idea of equality and slowly rights that had just been given to blacks from Reconstruction were stripped away. They were used to the idea of blacks working in farms as slaves, but the 1890s brought about a new age of industrialization and invention, beginning the slow diminishing of farmers. The New Constitution of Florida was created in 1885 and implemented policies to suppress the voices of immigrants and blacks. The Constitution of 1885 stemmed from conservative Floridians who valued the “Old South” and desired for whites to remain supreme while immigrants and blacks stayed below them. Government decisions such as these that only encouraged the conservative mindset that repressed blacks.","Once the government began to stand on uneven terms regarding racial rights, disputing viewpoints began to emerge. Much conflict arose over whether the dispute between Hannibal Square Republicans and Winter Park Democrats revolved more around race or politics. Throughout the 1890s the Republican party began to slowly move away from seeking African-American rights to more of an indifferent attitude towards it. Yet in the author’s letter to the Advocate he mentions how the citizens of Hannibal Square are treated as “outsiders” and will be left without political protection if removed from Winter Park. With that fact it is likely that the separation was in part stemmed from the conservative views of the whites in Winter Park and only heightened by the Republicans beginning to outnumber the amount of registered Democrats.","America was already struggling in the differences between Democrats and Republicans. This article was published around the beginning of the Panic of 1893, which would occur directly after Democratic president Grover Cleveland was elected into office. Cleveland was determined to repeal the Sherman Act of 1890, but this ultimately caused silver prices to plummet. Monetary issues were only part of the cause for the Panic of 1893, but regardless it was the Democrats that were blamed for the ordeal. After this event America lost respect for elitist Democrats and started to sway towards the Republican party up until the Great Depression. Despite the slow political shift, blacks still did not receive rights until the later half of the twentieth-century. Hannibal Square was unincorporated from Winter Park, but was added back into the city limits in 1925 due to financial issues. This only proves how the anonymous author’s letter to The Advocate in 1893 was correct in discussing how often the legislature changed it’s mind regarding town limits."," ","Bibliography","Unknown author, “It is Still Alive: Hannibal Square Must Come Out” (The Advocate article in Chase Scrapbook vol. 2, Archives and Special Collections Olin Library, Rollins College, Winter Park, Florida, February 11th, 1893) p. 421","Fairolyn Livingston, “Window on Hannibal Square: A View of Life in Early Westside Winter Park and a Portrait of the Lives and Careers of Walter B.

Mainly towards the 1890's Florida experienced a rapid increase in population, due to people migrating down south. Many of the people that decided to migrate down were white New Englanders and colored people, many of whom were former slaves.  However, with the influx of migrants from other states tensions followed, mainly racially with the influx of former slaves.","The majority of the migrants coming down to Florida were mainly white northerners. A vast number of them came from New England. From a period of twenty years from 1880 to 1900 the white population more than doubled from 142,605 to 297, 333, while making up almost 60% of the Florida population.[1] Some of the New Englanders tended to form societies of their own containing other New Englanders. These societies they formed were called New England Societies. [2]These societies of New Englanders included permanent residents of Florida who used to live in New England, and even included the New Englanders who only stayed down in Florida for the winter. The New England Society in Florida would meet on various occasions and places throughout the year, one of these places was the City of Winter Park.[3] One of the main reasons people tended to migrate to Florida, besides the tropical winters, was the increase in jobs due to the development of Florida. The second main group to come into Florida were the former free slaves. Between 1880 and 1900 the black population in Florida had increased from 126,690 to 230,730. [4]Some of the more popular reasons that African Americans came down here for was work. Many either worked on the construction of the railroads under Henry Flagler or started or helped out on farms in the area.[5]","Despite the increase in migration, many southerners did not enjoy having these new residents in their state. Besides the white northerners, some of the groups experienced heavy discrimination in the south, including Florida. The main group to be exposed to a negative view on their influx into Florida and the rest of the South, were the blacks. One of the most basic and widely used discrimination tactic against the blacks were the Jim Crow Laws[6]. The Jim Crow Laws were a series of legal acts that enforced segregation mainly in the South. Anti black movements throughout the South were effective for the southerners in keeping the blacks separated from their daily lives, and giving them the least amount of freedom they could possibly get, which was easy for them to do in the south despite the fact that in some areas, like the entire state of Florida, blacks made up more than a third of the population. The white northerners on the other hand were more accepted by the residents of the state of Florida. As long as they could be considered white, the residents presented little aggression towards them. They were allowed to stay in hotels, move down here, and open their own businesses without the risk of segregation. Some of them, like the New Englanders, even created their own societies to stay connected with other people that were from their area.","The migration of fellow Americans into the state of Florida continued a trend of population expansion within not just Florida, but the South. Many of these migrants came from former slaves and white northerners mainly from New England. However, despite the massive increase in population for Florida some of the migrants, mainly the former slaves, were unwelcome in many areas of Florida and the South."," "," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1880 - January 1, 1900","search_date":"1889-12-31","locations":[{"id":1443,"lat":28.6157324623,"lng":-81.3533405132,"zoom":8,"place":"ORANGE, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":366,"tag":"Migration"},{"id":2442,"tag":"New England Societies"}],"course":{"name":"Decade of Decision 1890s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":131,"school_id":5}},{"id":6225,"title":"Inspiring Words From L.A.

On February 14<sup>th</sup> of 1890, two new schoolhouses were dedicated in Winter Park. One of the schoolhouses was for white children, and the other schoolhouse, located in Hannibal Square, was for African American children. Education was becoming more important to families and their children during the late nineteenth century and many children were encouraged to attend elementary and secondary schools.[1] The curriculum in schools was changing, and the encouragement of African American children to attend school was also becoming more prominent. In Florida as well in other states, public schooling was becoming more popular, giving children, whether white or African American, the chance to learn basic skills needed in everyday life.","The dedication of the new schoolhouses was, according to the <em>Advocate</em>, “one of the most remarkable events that have happened in Winter Park.” The children that were to attend the new schools were a large part of the dedication; they were seated in the front of the dedication area and were involved in the ceremony itself. A man named J.T. Becks spoke of the beginning of schooling in America; the first school was started in 1642, and others were built in the years to come.[2] The public school curriculum in the United States included lessons that were “devoted to the cultivation of literacy and citizenship in all the people.”[3] The curriculum was turning toward a more secular theme during the nineteenth century.[4] The three main subjects that were taught in public elementary schools were reading, writing, and arithmetic.[5] Controversy surrounded what curriculum would be created for African American students. Many believed that their education should be “practical so that black children could become self-reliant, get jobs, and advance themselves and their race.”[6]","The public schools in Winter Park were offered to African American children as well as white children.[7] Even though education was offered to both races, the debate between mixed and separate schools was still a prominent issue in the United States. Following the Reconstruction Era, different states had different beliefs as to whether public schools should be mixed or if they should be separated by race. During the 1890s, many southern states rewrote their black codes, mandating that schools be segregated.[8] Even though the schoolhouses were separated in Winter Park, a ceremony was still held in Hannibal Square to open the new schoolhouse for African American children.[9] Mr. White, the Mayor of Winter Park, told the crowd gathered at the opening of the Hannibal Square schoolhouse that African Americans had a “knowledge unsurpassed by any other people.” Mayor White also commended the colored people “for their strict obedience to justice.”[10] The Dedication of the new schools in Winter Park focused not only on educating white children; they also complimented the African Americans for their determination and want to pursue public education.","The dedication of the two new schoolhouses was considered one of the most important events after Winter Park’s founding. The ceremony held for the dedication emphasized the importance of gaining an education for both white and African American children, and also gave the city an opportunity to come together for a common interest."," "," ","[1] Chase, Loring. \"The Dedication.\" In <em>Winter Park Scrapbook, 1881-1906: Loring Chase Scrapbooks</em>.

Citizens at the time considered it not only the greatest achievement of their city council, but “the best thing ever done here.”[1] These lights made walking at night much safer, and their value to the town was estimated to be ten times the cost of installing and running them. Street lamps were placed in front of stores owned by several prominent gentlemen, the entrance to Rollins College, the Congregational and Episcopal churches, and in Hannibal Square. As stated above, the community appreciated them greatly and felt that, though scattered, the street lights improved their community immensely.[2]  This wild enthusiasm that swept Winter Park was a microcosm of the craze that spread across the nation as electric lighting and other modern technology became available and formed the roots of the modern consumer society.","The public lighting industry at the time was controlled by companies like Edison General Electric or GE, and Westinghouse, which competed both with each other and with French electricity companies like Saxoleine to innovate better lighting. These companies launched large advertising campaigns to draw in potential business; Saxoleine in particular was known to print many different posters to be displayed around the city, usually of suave, elegantly dressed people holding up gas lamps[3]. Firms also focused on developing new products in order to compete with their rivals, enlisting scientists and chemists to innovate novel ways of using electricity. Electricity companies also began attacking each other’s reputations; Edison spread claims that Westinghouse’s alternating current generator was unsafe and was used in the first prison execution by electric chair just to put a black mark on their name.[4] The companies continued to expand, selling more new lighting to towns, cities, and individuals.","As the country slowly became industrialized and began to rely on mass-produced goods rather than local food and products, people became increasingly focused on consumption. An upper class of impossibly wealthy business magnates emerged, flaunting their wealth for all to see and causing the rest of the public to idealize the pomp and grandeur of their materialistic lifestyle. The emerging middle class of white collar workers looked to emulate this lifestyle, and found themselves increasingly able to do so as new technology such as electric lighting made their lives easier and more efficient. Simultaneously, prices were dropping and goods were being mass-produced by large companies. This meant that the middle class had more leisure time and could much more easily afford luxury items.[5] Enthusiasm for new technology, which occurred in Winter Park, was the result of both newfound materialism and the fact that this type of new technology improved their standard of living and gave them more free time. With these lights, one could easily stroll around Winter Park all night without fear of getting lost in the dark. Though only one small technological improvement in a single part of the country, the installation of these lights was a microcosm of the technological revolution occurring throughout the country. It would have allowed shops to stay open later and, thus, make themselves more available to consumers, further fueling the desire to consume. This nationwide desire gave birth to the huge conglomerates that marked the era and grew into the corporations and products we know today."," ","[1] Chase, Loring Augustus The Winter Park Scrapbooks “No More Darkness” (Loring Chase, Winter Park, 1891) 360","[2] Chase, Loring Augustus <em>The Winter Park Scrapbooks</em> “No More Darkness” (Loring Chase, Winter Park, 1891) 360","[3] Cordulack, Shelley Wood. \"A Franco-American Battle of Beams: Electricity and the Selling of Modernity.\" Journal of Design History 18, no. 2, 147-66.

This school was built in 1922 and served as a one-teacher type school. Historically this picture gives a good idea of what the Rosenwald schools looked like after they were built. It’s nice to be able to put a picture to all that we are learning about. The picture shows a black and white image of a small wooden building with one door and windows surrounding the building. Along with the picture, this website as shows what part of the community contributed financially with this school. It shows that the Rosenwald project gave $500.00, Negroes gave $295.00, whites gave $10.00, and the public gave $848.00. Therefore, the public gave the most money when it came to making sure this school got built. That makes sense because according to the book <em>History of Walton County</em> by John L. McKinnon, Walton County was a place that thought highly of African Americans. In the book <em>History of Walton County</em> it goes into great detail of how slave owners treated their slaves in Walton County. The book says that if a married couple was split up and sold into different families, they would make sure to let them spend weekends with each other at one of the others homes. This is an example of white people in Walton County at least showing some kind of compassion and respect towards African Americans. Therefore, going back to my primary source picture and financial records of the Black Branch School, it makes sense that the public of Walton County would have put the most money into the making of this school. I think it also worth noting that this school was just one out of five Rosenwald Schools that was built in Walton County. Five schools may not seem like that many, but with my research on other counties in Florida at the time, some only had one school with a larger population. Walton County definitely had the most schools within its county region than any other county that I personally researched."," ","However nice slave owners are made out to be in Walton County in the 1920’s, they were still slave owners. African American children were still forced to attend a separate school and families were still split apart. This leads back to the cultural and social issue that can be found from this picture. While this picture shows a very small school that had to be used for many children. Walton County was a county just like others who believed that the white race was superior to African Americans. Thus, leading up to the Black Branch School needing to be built in the first place. I believe there is a definite political issue, among other issues, that are linked to this primary source picture due to those reasons. With everything I get my hands on about how historians talk about the issue of slavery and education, they seem to give examples as to why people justified it. Whether it is greed or racism. The article Historical Fiction from PBS talks a lot about how there were many different kinds of racism. Historians have proved that it wasn’t just white people that enslaved black people, but black people also enslaved black people. Along with Native Americans enslaving black people. I’m sure there could be a reason for anything, however, when it comes to the political issue of slavery it seems that people practiced it due to greed. There’s no doubt that there were large sums of money that could be earned when someone owned a lot of slaves. More work could get done and therefore more products were being sold. However, at what expense? I would say the cons of slavery greatly outweighed the pros. With all of that being said the picture of the Black Branch School in Walton County probably looked a lot like many other Rosenwald Schools being built around that time. With the research that I could find on Walton County it seemed that there was at least some sense of respect for African Americans around the 1920’s. I believe that the public of Walton County putting in the most amount of money to build this school says a lot about the opinion of all of the people living there at the time."," ","In conclusion, education in Walton County for African Americans could not have been stellar. It certainly wasn’t fair when standing next to the education the white children were receiving. However, at a time when our country was blinded by hateful thoughts and actions, it does seem that Walton County was at least slightly better when it came to having some kind of human compassion.  "],"display_date":"February 19, 1916 - February 22, 1916","search_date":"1916-02-20","locations":[{"id":52897,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Winter Park, FL"}],"tags":[{"id":2943,"tag":"Rosenwald"},{"id":2946,"tag":"Walton County"}],"course":{"name":"African American History Since 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":154,"school_id":5}},{"id":6511,"title":"Southern African American Industrial School Funding in the Early 1900s","course_id":154,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/00","end_date":"12/31/15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Many African American industrial institutions in the south, especially the Robert Hungerford industrial school in Eatonville, Fl had many struggles upon its establishment in 1899. Journeying along through the early twentieth century, this chain of schools based their education off the Tuskegee institute under the guidance and teachings of the profound educator named Booker T. Washington. One study that is not touched on enough or regarded highly throughout African American history, is the surrounding question of how were these industrial institutions in the south able to stay afloat financially to support their education for young African Americans during the time of segregation between White and Black schools?","There is a lot of first-hand evidence from the Robert Hungerford industrial school’s Fourth Annual Report, written in 1903 to the Board of Trustees principal Russell C. Calhoun, on the basis of funding. This annual report included a thank you letter from Principal Calhoun  to the Board of Trustees, thanking them for their contributions. Additionally, Principle Calhoun speaks about the progression of the industrial school in 1903 and ask for assistance in the expansion the institution into the future.","To give a rough estimate, based off the letter from Principal Calhoun to the Board of Trustees, the industrial school’s populace counted up to 105 students. Also, the school also taught 12 different trades such as Blacksmithing, Wheelwrighting, Carpentry, Farming, Cooking, Sewing, Laundering, Poultry Raising and Dairying. To support the teaching upon these trades the property sat on 200 acres of land with one Dormitory. Amongst these acres of land, the amount of shops, tools, and livestock altogether accumulated up to $5,286.75. As the industrial institution expanded in later years, we deduce that a great deal of support was needed within the different areas of funding from different organizations or entities in the rural south. Yet is had difficulty finding the much needed support.","When it came to funding education for minorities in the United States, especially for African American schools in the north and south, they traditionally received the shorter end of the stick when compared to White schools. It is worth noting that much of the funds for African American education came from black communal efforts such as churches and intuitive finances. Separate funding was given within the terms of segregation and fell in line with the distribution of local real estate taxes. The south found ways to avoid paying these taxes and authorized local school authorities to handle the circulation of funds between African American and White schools that were supported by State legislatures. State legislatures were notoriously known for underfunding city schools, which is still prevalent to this day, especially within the African American community.","In viewing African American education from a broad scope, we can see that there was much inequality in the funding platform provided by the white community. This situation happened in both the north and south but it was considerably more prominent in the south. Slightly shifting our focus to the topic of campaigns especially towards the Northern Campaigns. The southern industrial institutions, such as the Robert Hungerford industrial school, set up “Northern Campaigns” to raise from 3,000 to 30,000 dollars through daily written appeals from the southern institution’s trusted representatives. These appeals were sent to white charity groups in an effort to obtain their support for the education platform that these southern industrial institutions had to offer.","Through these grueling and difficult efforts to receive some type of financial support, African American educators had to compete against sales groups who tirelessly searched for reformation with crusades and quarterly settlements from northern philanthropic funding. Although most African American southern industrial institutions lost a vital avenue into the northern philanthropic trusted funding, there were some successes such as Hampton University and Tuskegee Institute. Northern Philanthropists used the success of these southern African American industrial institutions with the thought that these southern educational institutions were enormously financially supported.","James H. Dillard, southern white educational activist connected with many philanthropic activities, once declared that twenty-five percent of northern money for black education \"might better be sunk into the Potomac River before it comes over.”"," There were also false claims for donations for industrial schools that never existed in the south. In 1912, there were seventeen industrial institutions aided by the government, 15 were located in the south, but none African American. Soon enough African American industrial schools in the south were quickly sending appeals to the North. ","The reason for the written appeals were to show the humility and consistency of the importance that African American fund raisers and educators to northern philanthropist about the success of their schools. . The following from James S. Russell, Principal of the St. Paul, Virginia, Normal and Industrial School to New York investment banker George Foster Peabody, was representative: “In overalls, with plows, mattocks, hoes, and other implements, our agricultural students may be seen today adding two hundred acres of low lands to the present acreage; milking cows; caring for the swine; truck gardening; putting in the winter cover crops, etc. In the workshops, building wagons, buggies, shoeing horses, making harness.... In the classroom like bees getting the fundamental requisites for trades.... So great is the sacrifice and earnestness of these poor boys and girls that they justly deserve ... the sympathy and support of all persons interested in human struggles.”","African American educators and fund raisers proved their passion and support to the industrial education for black males and females by reaching out and speaking in campaigns, meetings, and publications to Northern philanthropists. In these publications, they emphasized that southern industrial schools will have a remarkable benefit to the African American community in the rural south through the many trades that it taught and had to offer. Religion also played a vital role in the Northern Campaigns since it was highly valued among northern white philanthropists as well. Consequently, black educators emphasized and incorporated the importance of God and Christianity for attending African American students in these Northern Campaigns.","The 1915 Northern Campaigns were considered successful in funding as a whole. Although defining success might be different from school to school. Due to WWI, different complications between the philanthropic community and poorly planned events may have created problems in the funding campaigning. The Robert Hungerford industrial school resolved in 1909 and was considered one of the most successfully funded. There were other smaller African American industrial schools that faced financial burdens as they try to establish themselves into the future of the black southern industrial institutions."],"display_date":"1900 - 1915","search_date":"1908-01-01","locations":[{"id":52904,"lat":28.6147216,"lng":-81.3806249,"zoom":8,"place":"Eatonville,Fl"},{"id":52903,"lat":28.4844995,"lng":-81.2518833,"zoom":8,"place":"Orange County, Fl"}],"tags":[{"id":2962,"tag":"1900-1915"},{"id":2961,"tag":"Industrial Schools"},{"id":2960,"tag":"Northern Campaigns"},{"id":2959,"tag":"Fl"},{"id":1237,"tag":"Tuskegee"},{"id":1133,"tag":"Booker T.

This source is important because it gives us a clear and solid image of a life insurance company that was completely ran, and successfully ran, by African Americans during a time where that was not an easy task. Throughout researching Atlanta Life Insurance I discovered that Alonzo Herndon founded the company. Alonzo was a barber and entrepreneur, and also a former slave. After establishing this new company he quickly became the wealthiest African American in Atlanta. Atlanta Life Insurance Company became the leading African American insurance company in the nation."," ","When talking about Life Insurance, it can seem like a bore of a subject. However, this topic is so imperative, especially when linking it to African Americans, because it was something that primarily white companies denied African Americans. When one dies, it is a very grief stricken time. On top of the grief, it can be a very costly event. Life Insurance is simply is a security that someone pays into while they are alive to ensure that their families will not be burden by their death. Life Insurance covers everything from funeral costs’; to a lump some of money to help a family when something unexpected happens to the primary source of income. When talking about the security of someone’s family after they are no longer here to help them, well it’s a topic that most people are not willing to gamble with. When so many African Americans who work hard to support their families are denied this basic right to feel secure in their families’ well being, it is nothing short of a tragedy. This is where Atlanta Life Insurance came in. This company well was established in its promise to give African Americans the security that every other white person can decide to have if they so chose. It was a promise that they so rightfully deserved."," ","            While doing research through my other sources such as: <em>Supreme Life: The History of a Negro Life Insurance Company, </em>the information I read has a lot to do with the basic principles on what is and isn’t fair. Historians will say that white people during the 1940’s and 1950’s, when life insurance became this booming industry, didn’t want African Americans to be able to participate. To me, that logic simply says one thing and one thing only. Which is: in our opinion, your life and your family’s well being doesn’t have the right qualifications to justify you needing such a tool as life insurance. What kind of terrible person would think that? Mostly all of America. Research shows that African Americans opened up their own institutions for things that they were denied other wise because they had to find a way to protect themselves and their family. When you think about it as a dignified human being, it’s a quite simple thought."," ","In conclusion, the discussion when it comes to Life Insurance for African Americans and The Atlanta Life Insurance Company is one worth having. How would you feel if you were forced to live each and every day with the knowledge that if something devastating happened to you, your family would be completely helpless financially? Life Insurance is a basic way to ensure the security of your family after ones passing, it’s the only responsible thing to do when you love someone more than you love yourself. The only thing someone’s family should be thinking about after such a devastating loss is putting their life and heart back together as much as they can, not how they are going to afford to bury the loved one they just lost. That is why I for one am extremely thankful for companies like The Atlanta Life Insurance Company, and for guys like Alonzo Herndon. For taking a chance and gambling on a company that they were passionate about, and having the fortitude to stick it out when the rest of the country was seemingly against them."],"display_date":"March 1, 1916 - March 15, 1916","search_date":"1916-03-07","locations":[{"id":52921,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Winter Park, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2860,"tag":"Equality"},{"id":1458079244,"tag":null}],"course":{"name":"African American History Since 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":154,"school_id":5}},{"id":6531,"title":"Barber Shop History in Central Florida","course_id":154,"status":"P","start_date":"3/18/16","end_date":"3/18/16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Obviously, getting your hair cut is something that everyone probably wants and needs to do multiple times a year. Deciding on where to go for a hair cut may cause a slight dilemma since there are so many choices. Even at the start of the business community in Orlando there were many different barber shops to choose. Cutting hair seemed to be something that brought a lot of business and became widely popular. It also helped shaped the business community that has evolved so much in Central Florida.","                  According to the Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce Business Directory, there were approximately seventeen barber shops around 1957. That is a good amount of barber shops that men could choose from. One of the main barber shops of the time was a small shop called “Joe’s” and was located on Church street. Joe’s promoted only the best old fashioned classic flattops and the perfect around the ears shave’s. However, Joe’s did more than just accommodate for hairstyles. They brought in a sense of community with every customer who stopped in. According to the owner of Joe’s now, which remains a family business, every customer had a different story that helped shaped what they would become.","                  African American barber shops can actually be linked heavily to times of slavery. Apparently African Americans would serve high end white clients while they would work for white owners of the shops. Many African American men preferred the working conditions in a barber shop as opposed to working in fields or doing heavy labor. Having this job allowed them to be able to support their families as long as the white men continued to pay for the barber shop itself. After a while, African Americans decided to start opening their own barber shops to serve black men in certain black communities. However, many of these shops did not get so much business because as time went on the demand for highly trained and skilled professionals to take over went up.","                  Today, there remain hundreds of barber shops in the Orlando area that are still up and running! Even Joe’s, that dates back many decades still operates. Barber shops have evolved throughout history and remain an amazing business that holds a unique story.

Even if an African American completed medical school it was difficult to find a good hospital that would hire them because of their skin color[1].  As a race with so many obstacles in their way, there happened to be one man who defeated the odds, Dr. William Monroe Wells. Dr. William Wells was a prestigious African American Doctor and business owner, whom catered  to African Americans during segregation.","            Dr. Wells is most commonly known for being an incredible and well known African American doctor in Orlando. Dr. Wells was born in Ft. Gaines, Georgia in 1889. After completing medical school at Meharry Medical College he moved to Orlando in 1917. He dedicated his life to helping African Americans  so that they could receive the best medical care possible, even if they could not afford it. During World War II, Dr. Wells was the only African American doctor in Orlando. This was a shocking fact because white doctors refused to care for African Americans. This is important because at one point Dr. Wells was the only physician in Orlando that would be willing to see, help and treat African Americans. Dr. Wells was most famous for delivering over 5,000 babies in Orlando during his time practicing medicine.  Wells was not only famous for delivering African American babies, but he also treated patients with scarlet fever, influenza and pneumonia. He helped African Americans who were sick or in labor even though he knew they would not be able to ever pay him.  Dr. Well’s profound contribution was that he made it possible for many African Americans to receive quality medical care during the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in Orlando, Florida[2]. This is profound because without Dr. Wells African Americans would not have received medical attention during this time.","            Dr. William Wells was also a member of the Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce and provided his information to the local business directory so that African Americans seeking medical attention would be able to contact him. The 1948 Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce was the primary source for this history engine because it showed real life advertisements and provided a directory to which African Americans could find safe reliable healthcare. African Americans could rely on these businesses owned and run by other African Americans, so they would not face discrimination[3].  For African Americans in Orlando, Dr. Wells not only created the availability for healthcare but also provided that healthcare without discrimination through the Negro Chamber of Commerce.","            Not only was Dr. William Wells passionate about providing medical care to African Americans, but he also wanted to provide safe places for them as well. In 1926, Dr. Wells received a building permit from the City of Orlando and constructed the Wells’ Hotel. During this time the hotels were segregated making it very difficult for African Americans to find safe accommodations while traveling.  Attached to this hotel Dr. Wells’ also built and owned a popular Casino called South Street Casino. The Casino was a popular place for famous African American singers and entertainers[4]. Dr. Wells wanted to provide a safe lodging for rest after their shows.  Dr. Wells predicted the dangers for African Americans traveling without a place to stay during the era of segregation.  He also was able to create a venue in the hotel space, which allowed a safe place for African Americans to let loose and have fun.  It was obvious that Dr. Wells not only cared about providing healthcare, he was also passionate about offering lodging and an entertaining nightlife for African Americans to enjoy safely[5].","            Dr. Williams Wells is a crucial part of African American History in Orlando because he was passionate about providing healthcare, lodging, and nightlife to African Americans. During a time when African Americans had no option for medical care, Dr. Wells was a saving grace by providing his medical assistance. Imagine the fear of not having access to safe medical care. That was the reality for African Americans before Dr. Wells broke through the barriers of color in modern medicine. Imagine traveling and not having a safe place to stay; this was also a reality until Dr. Wells opened his hotel and casino. Access to healthcare and a physician should have been every persons right, but this was not the case for African Americans during the 1920s – 1960s. Without Dr. Wells citizens of color in Orlando would not have had access to healthcare when they were ill or while giving birth. Dr. Wells was responsible for the healthy and safe deliveries of over 5,000 babies in Orlando alone, which speaks volumes of his impact to the black community. Dr. William Wells was an incredible doctor, businessman, and leader among the African American Community."," "," "," ","[1] \"History - Opening Doors: Contemporary African American Academic Surgeons.\" N.p., n.d.

One entry, “The New Jones High School”, contains information on Jones High School after its recent renovation in May 1952[1]. The entry on Jones High School grants a valuable insight into the funding, resources, and conditions of segregated schools in Orlando. Additionally, this information on Jones High School in 1957 provides a point of reference that can be used to draw comparisons between Jones High School and other Southern segregated schools.","            The entry on “The New Jones High School” in <em>The Voice of Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce: Business Directory 1957</em> was published at an interesting time in the African-American fight for civil rights. Three years prior, African-Americans won a major victory in the Supreme Court Decision on <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>. By negating the <em>Plessy v. Fergusen </em>Supreme Court Decision of ‘separate but equal’, de jure segregation was declared unconstitutional. However encouraging this decision seemed, the fact remained that de facto discrimination was still a reality in the South. Thus, it is somewhat surprising that Jones High School was able to provide the resources that it did. Additionally, the renovation that improved the conditions of Jones High School in 1952 occurred before the <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> yet after the renovation the value of the school increased by $100,000.00 bringing the total value of the school up to $1,000,000.00[2]. There are a few potential reasons for the ability of Jones High School to provide a relatively high quality of education to its students, although the reason is not provided in the entry. Firstly, the <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> decision of ‘separate but equal’ provided a legal standing for organizations such as the NAACP to challenge the inequality of funding between white and black schools. Secondly, the African-American community in Orlando may have been prosperous enough and invested in the value of education enough to provide money to Jones High School. Alternatively, it could be that Jones High School was the only African American school in the area that was able to provide these resources and other African-American schools in the area simply did not exist or were under funded. In this case, Jones High School, although well equipped, could have remained inadequate to educate all the African-American children in the Orlando area. Additionally, <em>The Encyclopedia of Florida </em>cites a large influx of workers to the Orlando area numbering near 11,000 in 1956 when the Glenn L. Martin Company established a defense plan in Orlando[3]. Many of these workers may have been African American and could have brought families with them. Thus, the African American population in Orlando may have increased to the point where the resources of Jones High School may have been inadequate.Ultimately, it is unclear from the primary source document how Jones High School received funding for such an extensive renovation and whether this renovation met a standard of equity with the surrounding white schools.","            The renovations undertaken at Jones High School in 1952 provided “16 standard classrooms; a chemistry laboratory; a physics laboratory” and other spaces for academic pursuit. Additionally, however, much of the space provided was also for non-academic, work-related training such as “[an] advanced cooking classroom, a classroom for childcare…[a] training room for the training of table service [and] cooks…[and] one agriculture classroom”[4]. This dual emphasis of academic advancement and training for manual work represents the influence of Booker T. Washington’s philosophy of ‘advancement through education and work’ that persisted up to the Civil Rights movement. From the historical context surrounding the primary source and the primary source itself, it seems that Jones High School represents, to a certain extent, a compromise between the demands of African-Americans being voiced at the beginning of the Civil Rights movement and the de facto segregation that permeated the culture of the American South. This raises the question of whether these conditions were common across the South in African-American Schools. More specifically, what were the social and cultural experiences of African American students in the segregated south at the beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement?","            In her study titled <em>Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South, 1935-1969: A Review of Common Themes and Characteristics</em>, Vanessa Walker provides a synthesis of many different studies focusing on the quality of African-American education in the segregated south. Walker counters the commonly accepted depiction of African American schools wholly inferior to white schools[5]. More specifically, Walker states that the common view of African-American education before desegregation highlights “inequality in facilities, lack of transportation, shorter school terms, teacher-pupil conflicts, overcrowding” and more[6]. Additionally, Walker claims that the general depiction of African-American education portrays “African American students and their parents…as complacent” in regards to education[7]. However, in her analysis of other studies on the subject of African-American education Walker finds “the emergence of Black common schools were largely attributable to the interests of ex-slaves in education as a means for liberation”[8]. Ultimately, Walker claims that her analysis of studies on African American education indicates, “that the segregated schools in the South appear to have certain consistent characteristics” that counter the common conception of African American schools as vastly inferior to white schools[9]. Rather, African American schools often employed “exemplary teachers and principals…increasingly well trained and who created their own culture of teaching”. Additionally, the adversity facing African American schools often shaped the characteristics of the African American schools: “many of the schools’ characteristics appear to have been a direct response to the challenges they faced and intimately connected to the oppressive circumstances in which they operated”[10]. Specifically, African American schools placed an emphasis on cultural programs, strengthening the community, and leadership from the principal that actively endorsed ideologies on how to advance African-American civil rights[11]. Thus, although it was true that African American schools were often underfunded, they remained one of the central hubs of African American communities and experienced lots of support from the community.","            At more of a micro-level analysis, Linda Coats investigates the personal experiences of African-Americans that attended segregated schools in the south. Coats’ article <em>The Way We Learned: African American Students’ Memories of Schooling in the Segregated South</em> attempts to answer the question “what memories of school have lasting impact on students and what are some distinguishing teacher behaviors that impact students’ academic and career success?”[12]. Coats’ findings are in line with the general analysis provided by Walker. Coats discovered a theme of caring and dedication amongst teachers at African-American segregated schools in the face of racism and discrimination: “African American teachers during this era had to face many challenges brought on by socio-political factors…[yet] they were motivated to work harder to ensure that their students learned”[13]. First hand accounts from students also indicate that teachers were focused not only on education but holistic improvement of their students. One account states, “Teachers were nurturers and guides. Just as our parents, they expected good personal grooming, manners, your best effort, respect, and personal responsibility”[14]. Additionally, accounts support Walker’s finding that African American schools placed emphasis on community building: “students’ memories provided a glimpse into the teachers’ lives outside of school. For most, there was a powerful relationship between the school and the larger community”[15]. Furthermore, Coats states “this shared relationship, perhaps, contributed to their responsibility not only to their students’ academic development, but for their social and moral development as well”[16]. Ultimately, Coats’ findings from first hand recollections of students’ experiences in segregated African American schools indicate the importance of schools in the community and the schools’ role in not only education but also furthering the movement for racial equality.","            Given the points presented by Coats and Walker, it can be seen that African American schools provided a hub for the surrounding community while also providing hope for the advancement of racial equality via education. Furthermore, schools provided a place where philosophies for the advancement of African Americans could be implemented by teachers and principals. Thus, schools like Jones High School were, and still are, incredibly important for the surrounding communities and the fight for racial equality at a national level."," ","[1] The Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce, <em>The Voice of Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce: Business Directory 1957</em>, “The New Jones High School,” 34.","[2] The Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce, 34.","[3] <em>Encyclopedia of Florida</em>, “Dictionary of Places: Orlando.” New York: Somerset Publishers, 218.","[4] The Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce, 34.","[5] Vanessa Siddle Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South, 1935-1969: A Review of Common Themes and Characteristics,” <em>Review of Educational Research</em> 70 (2000): 253, accessed March 5, 2016, doi: <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/1170784.\">http://www.jstor.org/stable/1170784.</a>","[6] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 253.","[7] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 253.","[8] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 257.","[9] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 276.","[10] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 276.","[11] Walker, “Valued Segregated Schools for African American Children in the South,” 276.","[12] Linda T.

By the time the business directory for 1957 was published, there were twenty-nine Black beauty shops in the Orlando area. Among those twenty-nine shops, only twelve were on the 1945 business directory; this means that seventeen Black salons opened in the nine-year period between 1949 and 1957. For a quaint community that pales in comparison to the Orlando that we know today, it seems a bit excessive to have twenty-nine salons; but one must examine the factors that could have caused this change in Orlando’s Black community. The monumental changes in the education, economic status, and respectability standards of African Americans mirrored themselves in their self-care, and throughout this article, I will discuss these issues on a societal scale and some specific elements that could have influenced the sharp increase in the Orlando’s Black beauty industry.","Beauty parlors have long been a safe haven for women; women could vent their problems to one another and meet a local political figure in the same place. To this day, women visit the beauty salon on a consistent basis to alter one of their most basic features: their hair. “Ever since African civilizations bloomed, hairstyles have been used to indicate a person’s marital status, age, religion, ethnic identity, wealth, and rank within the community. In some cultures a person’s surname could be ascertained simply by examining the hair because each clan had its own unique hairstyle.” “Realizing the prominence hair played in the lives of western Africans, the first thing enslavers did was shave their heads; this was an unspeakable crime for Africans, because the people were shorn of their identity.” Although slavery dismantled many ancient African hair traditions, hair remained an important social construct, and by the 1950s, the tradition of immaculately coifed hair had been resurrected with heavy social baggage in tow.","Over time, African Americans had learned to recognize several themes in relation to beauty. First, hair that was longer and straighter was “good” while hair that was short and kinky was “bad.” Black women almost obligatorily straightened their hair using a variety of methods and for a variety of social reasons. The appearance of “good,” well-groomed hair was one of the most important forms of social capital in the Black community, second only to light skin. “Some Black Americans with extremely light skin and straight, kink-free hair chose to break through the barriers that a racist society had constructed by simply passing themselves off as White.”","Second, the grooming routines of African Americans often communicated ideas about their education and economic status. As Colin A. Palmer states, “Through the styling of their straightened hair, African Americans struggled to define a space for themselves within the framework of the dominant aesthetic that could challenge, oppose, and undermine it while reaffirming black cultural values. Although some middle-class blacks wore their straightened hair in styles similar to those popular among middle-class whites, others combined their straightened heads of hair with pomades and hairdressing creams to explore bold, innovative, and creative styling options.” Those who did not conform to the socially normative straightened styles were assumed to be uneducated or unemployed, as hair straightening was often a requirement for employment. They were also seen as less respectable among Blacks and Whites alike. This was especially important because the 1950s ushered in a new “New Negro.” Black youths were taught to expect more and saw themselves integrating White spaces by will or by force. With this, came a responsibility to represent the community well; this meant that one must always look presentable—hair included.","So what caused the spike in beauty salons in Orlando specifically? Orlando leaders downplayed many of the city’s social issues as to not ruin the reputation in the eyes of prospective tourists, but “no place was immune from the social changes brought about by the civil-rights movement, not even Orlando…” Orlando was the last city in Florida to dismantle the White Voters Executive Committee, the organization responsible for Orlando’s primary elections—open to Whites only. “The first Orlando primary election open to all races was held in 1950.”  Blacks from the working class, as well as doctors and nurses, lawyers, businessmen and women, store owners, and pastors preparing to enter a White space such as a polling place would certainly be encouraged to look their best; this include a fresh hairdo. Another phenomenon that was active but private in 1950s Orlando was the Nation of Islam. The strict grooming standards for men and women that the Nation emphasized also required an increased number of haircare professionals.","In conclusion, the Orlando community was changing in big ways in the 1950s. For the African American community, the idea that being well-groomed was associated with one’s respectability had residual effects when the visibility of African Americans in White spaces increased. This decade set the stage for major advancements in the Civil Rights Movement, so it only makes sense the African Americans were prepared. The Black beauty salon continues to be a staple in the community, and Black hair stylists are consistently pushing the boundaries of their craft, staying on the forefront of every new hair trend."],"display_date":"1949 - 1957","search_date":"1953-07-02","locations":[{"id":52922,"lat":28.5383355,"lng":-81.3792365,"zoom":10,"place":"Orlando, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"},{"id":3005,"tag":"Black Hair"},{"id":3006,"tag":"Straightening"},{"id":3007,"tag":"White Spaces"},{"id":3008,"tag":"Hair Politics"}],"course":{"name":"African American History Since 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":154,"school_id":5}},{"id":6535,"title":"Atlanta Life Insurance Company","course_id":154,"status":"P","start_date":"12/31/22","end_date":"12/31/52","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Atlanta Life Insurance Company was located on 539 W. Church St. in Orlando, Florida. This location was a branch office to the larger Atlanta Life Company, which was located in Atlanta, Georgia on 148 Auburn Ave. The Atlanta Life Insurance Company advertised maximum insurance on risk for $50,000, and offered industrial, health, accident, and life policies. Alonzo Franklin Herndon, an African American entrepreneur, founded this black-owned business. Herndon was also the first president of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company. Born on June 26<sup>th</sup>, 1858 to a white famer and slave, Herndon made his life by working hard and he is now known to be one of the first black millionaires in the United States. His legacy of wealth began when he made the decision to purchase a failing insurance company in 1905. Starting from $5,000 assets in 1905, he managed to have over $400,000 in assets by 1922. Herndon then changed the name to Atlanta Life Insurance Company. The expansion of the company led to the existence of branches in Kansas, Missouri, Texas, Florida, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Herndon went on to save other insurance companies to maintain self-reliance in black businesses, and to insure that African American men and women would continue to have jobs. The Atlanta Life Insurance Company became one of the most prosperous black-owned businesses in the 1920s. ","Racial segregation in the South led African Americans no other choice but to come together and improve their living situation. Even though most were poor, entrepreneurs grew out of the harsh oppression and collectively produced places where African Americans can go without facing any discrimination. Black-owned businesses were formed and they came offering a wide variety of services. Barbershops, grocery stores. Billiard halls, insurance companies, funeral homes, and beauty parlors were some of the staple businesses that appeared in African American communities. These businesses were able to flourish due to the lack of competition from their white counterparts. White owned businesses did not and were not located in black communities, and blacks were not able to participate, shop, or even walk in any of these places. Due to this phenomenon, black-owned businesses became the backbone of black community progression. ","The existence of black owned businesses is particularly important. They are imperative because they are a deliberate employer of African Americans. They also provide stability towards the economic development within their community, and they can also serve as mobilizing resources for the African American community.  The assets of Negro life insurance companies increased from $22 million on December 31<sup>st</sup>, 1940 to $161 million on December 31<sup>st</sup>, 1952. African American operated and owned life insurance companies were founded to provide more adequate coverage. Generally, businesses operated by African Americans are considered to be small time operations. However, life insurance companies are so important their existence plays a main role in the black business industry. ","The existence of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company in Orlando, Florida is no different than any other life insurance company located in the south.  “The black owned life-insurance company constitutes as one of the few bastions of black capitalism” (Jacob, Hughes). The Atlanta Life Insurance Company had assets of $27.7 million on December 31, 1952 and was thought to have more assets than all black life insurance companies combined with the North Carolina Insurance Company in 1940. “Atlanta life, as one example, evolved out of a sacred-secular institutional matrix in postbellum Alabama” (Weare). Its subsistence was made possible by racial discrimination in the south and racial discrimination from white insurance companies. The formation of life insurance for African Americans provided them with many benefits that they previously did not have due to the color of their skin. Life insurance can cover events such as permanent disability, accidental death, diagnosis of a terminal or critical illness, as well as death.  These benefits can provide families with funds after a loved one has passed away. That benefit of life insurance alone is key when thinking of them in an African American community. During this time of extreme racism, many African Americans were being murdered. Before they would not be able to afford a burial or even decide on where and how they want their family member buried. African Americans did not have access to life insurance through any white owned companies, and if they did they paid significantly more on life insurance than what they would have if it was a black owned life insurance company."," In conclusion, the presence of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company and the services they provided not only helped African Americans in Atlanta but also in Orlando, Florida.  This company was a haven for blacks in the Orlando community as it was for the other states Atlanta Life was in. It success was made possible by the wealth and passion Alonzo Herndon had for providing a service to his fellow African Americans. "],"display_date":"December 31, 1922 - December 31, 1952","search_date":"1937-12-31","locations":[{"id":52922,"lat":28.5383355,"lng":-81.3792365,"zoom":8,"place":"Orlando, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3009,"tag":"#thesouth"},{"id":3010,"tag":"#blackbusinesses"},{"id":3011,"tag":"#lifeinsurance"},{"id":3012,"tag":"#OrlandoFlorida"}],"course":{"name":"African American History Since 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":154,"school_id":5}},{"id":6536,"title":"The African American Negro Chamber of Commerce(AANCC):The Social Status of African American Police Officers within their community","course_id":154,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/57","end_date":"3/21/16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In sight of the 1957 African American Negro Chamber of Commerce directory, discovered on page 54, are honorary descriptions under the pictures of the first six African American Police officers selected to join the Orlando Police Department, Orange County Florida. Their names are Richard A. Jones, John W. Jordan, Gainous Wright Jr., Mayo Howard, Belvin Perry Sr. and Otha Lee Kelly. Richard A. Jones and Belvin Perry Sr, were the first two Black officers to join the force. The first to break the color line in the Orlando Police Department (OPD) was Officer Jones. He was also the first black OPD sergeant and lieutenant. Officer Belvin Perry Sr was the father of Chief Judge of Florida Ninth Judicial Circuit (retired), Belvin Perry, Jr.  Retired Chief Judge Belvin Perry, Jr was the presiding judge over the high profile Casey Anthony murder trial in 2011. ","The City of Orlando was one of the last cities to develop a police department but these officers still were able to implement their marks during the turbulent times of segregation and social injustice that were mostly, directed toward African American and other minority communities. Especially, in the Southern States at the beginning of the Civil Rights era. These police officers primarily served in the black communities and among African American business districts.","  All six officers were perceived as tremendous role models within the African American communities in and around the City of Orlando, Florida. The expectations were massive when it came to representing their communities. These police officers were known to serve and protect their assigned beat with professionalism and demonstrations of fairness to all. Additionally, they illustrated what it meant to wear the uniform of a police officer as an African American and display what it took to properly, uphold the law.  These police officers brought a significant amount of pride to the black communities, packaged with a few stressful factors to be taken into consideration as well. The 1950’s brought about major changes in law enforcement with the assignment of Black police officers in various cities of Florida. While there was advancement of racial and ethnic diversity in law enforcement, segregation and discrimination continued well into the 1960’s in the south. It’s worth noting that New York appointed the first Black police officer in 1891.","There is no doubt that the first Black police officers were pioneers in their profession in Florida. These Black officers had to endure the trials and struggles of racial integration and law enforcement reformation. When it comes to African American and other minority police officers they have additional pressures pinned to them when carrying out the responsibilities married to the law enforcement profession. I can imagine them feeling alienated and disrespected in a sense, especially, when they had the same responsibilities as the white officers but lower pay and in separate facilities.","  On a general scale, especially, from 1957 up to today there are mountains of  evidence supporting social pressures brought by a significant number of police officers among the African American and other minority communities. These police officers are engaged in the practice of abuses  and violent acts that further heightened the racial and ethnic tensions in the United States. It was initially thought that if an African American or minority officer (not white) was assigned to an African American or minority community there would be a decrease in police abuse and unjustified acts. However, this has been proven not to be the case. Today the disconnect between police officer continues to grow primarily in American communities where there is a large population of minorities, poverty and crime at high.","In 2015, in response to people’s assessment and outcried in many cities of the United States, against police unfairness and their excessive use of force, President Obama called for mediation between police and the community they served. The call was also an effort to reduce racial tension in many cities and communities and rebuild police reputation and trust.","We can present the question “why do members of the police force engage in unethical behaviors and use force to bring public order?” I can only reply that sometimes when people face challenges which they can not deal with or control, they tend to use extra force to control or change the course of a “perceived” bad outcome. Sometimes police officers deal with stressful and dangerous situations, day-in and day-out , until they break down emotionally and act contrary to the law they swore to affirm. By the same token, there are police officers that perform the functions of law enforcement with pride, integrity, and honesty in the mist of any turmoil or pressure situation. "," ","We must not forget President Obama’s call to work on our relationship law enforcement with the goal of reducing racial tensions and rebuilding trust. Also, we must not forget the pioneers that fought and paved the road for social and cultural integration and equality."],"display_date":"January 1, 1957 - March 21, 1916","search_date":"1936-08-11","locations":[{"id":52926,"lat":28.5383355,"lng":-81.3792365,"zoom":8,"place":"Orlando,FL"}],"tags":[{"id":3020,"tag":"Orlando, Fl"},{"id":3019,"tag":"OPD"},{"id":3018,"tag":"First"},{"id":3017,"tag":"1957"},{"id":3016,"tag":"AANCC Directory"},{"id":1182,"tag":"social status"}],"course":{"name":"African American History Since 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":154,"school_id":5}},{"id":6537,"title":"The Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce in Context: 1949-1957","course_id":154,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/49","end_date":"12/31/57","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The 1949 Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce Business Directory and the 1957 Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce Business Directory show the major growth of black owned businesses in Orlando, Florida. The number of businesses listed in 1949 was 169. This grew to 389 in 1957. The businesses in these documents and the production of the Directories themselves reflect the strength of the efforts of Orlando’s African Americans to help themselves economically just as their efforts to create schools did in education.","The fact that there was a Negro Chamber of Commerce in Orlando reflects the ideas and values of Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Dubois who actively promoted the idea that creating businesses was crucial to the improvement of black lives in America and, in fact, the world.","Previous to the 1949-1957 period, Washington started the National Black Business League (NBBL). He and the league encouraged the development of black business mutual help organizations all over the nation and in nearly every industry. The Orlando Negro Chamber of Commerce was such a group designed and committed to the development of black businesses and successful black entrepreneurship.","The 1949 Directory section, “Employment” states key reasons for joining Orlando’s black community. Foremost among these is the presence of three black owned banks and three black owned insurance companies. These were important not only to customers who had no access to white banks and could not get insurance from white companies. They were important because they meant access to capital -- to loans necessary to start new businesses. The number of banks owned by blacks in Orlando declined, according to the Directories from four in 1949 to one in 1957, and the number of insurance companies owned by blacks rose from two to four during that period.","In general, the growth of the Orlando black business community reflected the national economic growth that followed World War II. It was also fostered by segregation according to John N. Ingham. The context of this growth and the self-help efforts that underlie it is of major change that challenges the whole effort and the whole idea of it.","The Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. the Board of Education began the lengthy process of desegregation leading to the later Civil Rights era. In 1957 and 1958 the whole country underwent a serious national economic recession that hit all businesses hard but created especially tough challenges for black businesses. Desegregation and economic recession meant increased competition for black businesses. White businessmen began to buy out black businesses even if they kept a “front” of black representatives, salesmen and other employees. The black community became less an “out of mind” community than a potential market for white businesses. This is seen in the black beauty industry that was so important in the economy of the black business. The African American beauty industry was the second largest black industry in the country after eating and drinking type businesses. In 1939 there were 11,293 black owned barbershops and beauty parlors in the nation with a total income of $12,963,000 and employing 7,540 people. (Walker 76) The number of beauty parlors and barbershops in Orlando grew from twenty-seven in 1949 to forty-seven in 1957. This meant growing business for not only the Orlando black community but also for the black manufacturers and suppliers of products needed in the shops. But as the 1950’s developed, national beauty product manufacturers competed with black firms to make black beauty products. When they couldn’t beat them in the market, larger white firms with more capital bought up successful black firms.","But there was worse in the context of the 50’s. As early as 1953, then President Dwight Eisenhower disbanded the Commerce Department's Division of Negro Affairs and eliminated Emmer Lancaster as its head. (Weems and Ramdolph 39) Lancaster was heading toward the opening of the lucrative area of defense contracts to black owned businesses. Given the importance of the large and growing military industrial complex to the Orlando area the elimination of access to defense contracts by black business only added to the challenge of white corporations taking over black markets and particularly black banks by white owned corporations. With restricted access to capital, black firms were particularly vulnerable to the general trend of corporate takeover and national marketing.","Lack of participation in the large and growing area of defense contracting, increased white competition, the failure to recover from the 1957-58 recession, and lack of access to capital (loans and business start-up loans in particular) were largely due to discrimination. These factors planted huge roadblocks for black entrepreneurs and business people nationally and in Orlando. They even led to questioning the value of the ideas of Booker T. Washington and other leaders who saw black business as a major path to the improvement of black lives in America.","Scholars like John Butler cite the success of the people who descended from the black entrepreneurs of this period and the power of the values they passed down to later generations. But others such as Earl Ofari Hutchinson argue that only a radical change in the basic economic system of capitalism will lead to equality of the races and the improvement of the lives of African Americans. The historic context of Orlando’s black business community supports this idea. "],"display_date":"1949 - 1957","search_date":"1953-07-02","locations":[{"id":52922,"lat":28.5383355,"lng":-81.3792365,"zoom":8,"place":"Orlando, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3022,"tag":"Black Business"},{"id":3023,"tag":"Afro-American Business"},{"id":3024,"tag":"Orlando Business"}],"course":{"name":"African American History Since 1877","school":"Rollins College","course_id":154,"school_id":5}},{"id":6579,"title":"Oppression and Violence Against Civil Rights Leaders in Florida","course_id":167,"status":"P","start_date":"9/21/16","end_date":"9/27/16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["“Six hundred persons… attended the service in a modest church about a mile from the house where Mr. Moore meet his death when a bomb exploded under his bedroom.” Moore, the state leader of the NAACP, led in a time when violence was at an all time high due to the fight for integration. The change towards the breakage of the racial barrier in the United States finally occurred in 1954 in the ruling of Brown v. Board of Education. The ruling not only desegregated schools, but also had indirect effects on the nation. Michael Klarman argues that Brown did so by, “...thrusting the desegregation issue onto the national agenda, searing the conscience of previously indifferent northern whites, providing legitimacy to desegregation demands by blacks, or inspiring blacks to challenge the racial status quo.” The decision in Brown v. Board of Education was met with great anger by the southern states. Anger amongst Southerners led to the oppression of Black civil rights leaders in Florida.","The notorious Ku Klux Klan used violence against Black civil rights organizations, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. According to Daryl Harris, “White violence has been used to limit Black political and economic breakthroughs.” White violence came to power when Jim Crow segregation was ruled unconstitutional and integration became unpopular for the public whites. Much of the violence was used to repress and contain Blacks pursuing social change like integration and equality.","The Ku Klux Klan oppressed black civil rights activists and leaders through the use of violence and murder. Dr. Robert B. Hayling, a leader from St. Augustine, was beaten along with three of his companions at a Ku Klux Klan rally in September of 1963. His home was shot at in February of 1964, killing his dog and nearly missing his pregnant wife. In 1964 in Jacksonville, leader Johnnie Mae Chappell was killed by four men. On the day Mrs. Chappell was killed, she was gathered with hundreds of activists demanding an end to segregated stores and hotels. Adam Smith argues that the men never paid for the crime, as one served three years in prison and the others had their charges dropped.","Virgil Darnell Hawkins, a NAACP leader, was denied the right to attend law school at the University of Florida by the Florida Supreme Court under the Plessy v. Ferguson “separate but equal” ruling. Two weeks after the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the University of Florida. The state Supreme Court agreed that they had to allow Negro admission, but the federal court had not stated when admission had to occur. Hawkins fought for twenty-eight years until he could finally practice law in Florida.","The similarity between the civil rights leaders was that they were protesting for rights they were given by the constitution, but not accepted by society. The ruling in Brown v. Board of Education and other constitutional laws meant that the only way there could be racial injustice was if society made it that way.

Many citizens from all throughout the state came to visit and inspect the new developments progress. This community was unlike any other housing development of this time since all the houses were going to be “owned and peopled by Negro citizens.”  The Washington Shores community was going to be one of the first developments in the nation to start “setting a pattern… for meeting the housing shortages of minority groups, especially Negros.” ","The concept for a Negro-owned community was created in 1947 when John Graham, a tile manufacturer in Central Florida, was faced with the task of finding housing for a Negro employee of his. Appalled when finding that White landowners were charging outrageous rental fees in African American areas of Orlando, Graham gained aid from the Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, and the city government to help ease “congested quarters of the Orlando Negro section” by establishing a non-profit organization to fund the housing development. Segregation of white and black housing communities in this era was a major issue, often “during the 1950s urban expansion…discriminated forced blacks into small, disconnected communities and to travel longer distances for goods and services than did whites.” Thus, the idea of a Negro-owned community close to the hustle and bustle of Orlando was met with excitement.","The development of the Washington Shores community “presents a remarkable case study of civic cooperation.” Throughout Orlando, citizens and businesses contributed to the development of the housing. The Orlando legislature expanded the city limits in order to ensure that the community would have adequate fire and police protection, as well as necessary utilities, such as sewer, electricity, and paved streets. And a Negro real estate firm was given the job of handling the sales of all housing. The aid of the city came with the assurance that this community would not soon become a “slum.","The cost of buying a home in Washington Shores ranged from, five hundred dollars for a normal lot to one thousand for one on the lake shore, with a down payment of $125. Most homes in this community were planned for a five or six-bedroom layout. This low pricing of a home in the 1950s was unheard of, but for many African American families, this was a struggle. Yet, the cities cooperation with the development of Washington Shores aided many African Americans planning on moving to this community, the First National Bank of Orlando gave financial aid to those purchasing homes in the community. ","The Washington Shores community of Central Florida was met and enjoyed with wide appeal.

According to the Minutes of Meetings, Dr. Wagner wrongfully took the financial responsibility of the college into his own hands without the consultation of his peers.  Michael J. Worth and James W. Asp’s book <em>The Development Officer in Higher Education: Toward an Understanding of the Role </em>demonstrates how Wagner should have consulted the college’s developmental officer by insisting that the president’s job is to create revenue for the college.[2] Although the Winter Park community hated Dr. Wagner for what he did, they seemed to forget that the Board of Trustees were the people who initially supported his plan. People also seem to forget that Wagner considered other alternatives, such as increasing the immigrant population and raising college tuition, before doing what he felt was in the best interest of the college."," ","In the 1950s, the United States was involved the Cold War against the Soviet Union. Due to lack of soldiers from the previous World War II battles, the United States implemented the Selective Service Act, which gave President Roosevelt the right to draft men into the military. Wagner feared the draft would affect Rollins’ enrollment population and, ultimately, the revenue of the college. Wagner’s first plan of asking for the influx of Latino immigrants onto campus was denied. According to the <em>New Georgia Encyclopedia, </em>during this time minorities could have been a solution for Wagner’s population problem, but neither helped because the majority of schools were segregated at the time.[3] This block hindered Wagner’s solutions and forced his hand against his peers."," ","Trudy Banta and Gary Pike’s work “Revisiting the Blind Alley of Value Added” identifies the role of a college president to be to make appropriate changes to improve the teaching and learning processes at the institution.[4] Faculty and community members argued that Dr. Wagner was doing the opposite of this and, thus, hurting the students’ assessments. Wagner was criticized for not applying his democracy teachings to this situation. Ann McGee’s “The Role of President in Supporting College’s Foundation” speaks on what the students of Rollins wanted Wagner to do instead of firing faculty.[5] They simply wanted Wagner to use his presidential leadership to increase the school’s fundraising efforts. Wagner’s complete dismissal of the idea is what caused the rift between him and his counterparts and ultimately led to his impeachment."," ","The Wagner Affair came to an end in 1951 with the promotion of Hugh Mckean. The Wagner Affair was seen as a disappointment in Rollins College history, but it was also a learning experience for future endeavors. His actions were not ill intentioned but were proven incorrect nonetheless. This short affair provides not only Rollins but also other colleges with the realization of the importance of having a president who knows their role and can show financial wisdom in times of a crisis. The president must help the students and the school as a whole, combining personal insight along with communication between departments, like the Board of Trustees, to determine the best decisions.

that is, after all, the decade in which students organized in masses never before seen to protest for social and political change.  Scholars point to several factors that influenced the period of apathy in the 50s.  In his book, <em>Student Politics in America</em>, Philip Altbach cites the political climate of the time and the start of the Cold War as main causes for a decline in political activism on campus.  He explains, “At a time when students were literally afraid to sign petitions even on non-political local issues, it is not surprising that Socialist or radical groups should find their memberships dwindling.” In his study into students’ value patterns in the 1950s, Dean Hoges found that students were heavily inclined toward conservative and Christian values and were disinclined to get involved in politics.  Overall, researchers conclude that the few student movements that did take place were generally over broad social and educational policies and were non-violent in nature.","The students’ reaction to the Wagner Affair, then, was both typical and atypical of the time.  The walkout staged by the students was non-violent, but the subject of their protests was one directly related to the college, rather than a broader issue.  The division this caused between students and faculty and high-level administrators was one never before experienced at Rollins.  The issue was eventually resolved with the dismissal of President Wagner, but not without leaving its mark on the school and the town of Winter Park.  It exposed the underlying political influences and conservative attitudes within the higher education system.  Wagner governed in a domineering style, using showmanship and charisma, much like prominent political figures of the time, and students were willing to follow his lead until he crossed a certain line.  It showed that student unrest was real, even if it was stifled by the prevailing attitudes of the decade and it demonstrated the use of peaceful protest techniques that would be utilized in the Civil Rights movement.  More than anything, though, the Wagner Affair provided a glimpse of what was to come in the 60s."],"display_date":"February 1, 1951 - May 31, 1951","search_date":"1951-04-01","locations":[{"id":52897,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Winter Park, FL"}],"tags":[{"id":3131,"tag":"student activism"},{"id":1648,"tag":"1950s"},{"id":2954,"tag":"College Students"},{"id":3123,"tag":"Paul Wagner"},{"id":438,"tag":"Rollins College"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}},{"id":6592,"title":"Communism in Education","course_id":167,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/47","end_date":"12/31/51","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Dr. Paul Wagner “preached on a theme that audio-visual education is the only remedy for the woefully inadequate teaching methods in public schools all over the country.” Wagner’s ideas of implementing audio-visual technology into Rollins College resulted in society accusing him of being Communist. But why? The emergence of McCarthyism became a nation-wide sensation that placed fear into society. McCarthyism exaggerated and exploited the Communist threat, creating an atmosphere of false accusation in which people believed they were bettering society.  “And their voices were all the more credible because of their anti-Communism, which was born not out of fear or anxiety, but rather the conviction about the wrongness of Communism.” Jennifer Delton argues that the goal of anti-Communism was to thwart liberals, not to get rid of Communists. She continues to state that Communism attacked and took over the leftist and liberal organizations due to the fundamental contradiction in the Communists’ relationship to mass movements.","Communist influence was to be kept out of all aspects of society, including education. American people became increasingly worried that Communist influences would infiltrate the schools and pervert the minds of children.  The U.S. Commissioner of Education, Earl McGrath, played a role in spreading anti-Communism throughout education. McGrath summarized the thoughts of many Americans when he stated, “Two conflicting philosophies of government and of life are now competing for the allegiance of the peoples of the world. One of these is totalitarianism… in Communist states of Russia and her satellites. The other is democracy.” When Wagner pitched his idea of audio-visual education, he believed it needed to be implemented after how successful it had been in Germany under Hitler, in which he made Belgium a Fascist state in two years.","Soviet Foreign Minister Andri Vishinski sought to conquer the world not with an atom bomb, but by spreading  “... our ideas, our brains, and our doctrines.” Due to this, civil liberties were impaired in America all in the name of national security. The academic freedoms of educators were limited, as seen with Wagner. James Rodgers and Wesley Null argue that the longer America faced the Communism problem, the broader the definition of “Communist” became. McGrath understood that the Cold War was different, as it was more intellectual than physical. Public schools existed under McGrath to win the Cold War. In order to help win this battle, McGrath implemented “Americanization” programs that teached new immigrants the American way of life. Teachers were screened to make sure that they were not too liberal, and were forced to sign loyalty pledges. Some teachers were fired and even blacklisted from employment in America.","A study was conducted on the tolerance of Communism amongst college students based on social background, secular values and religion at the University of California-Berkeley campus. According to Armand Mauss, the right-wing groups are anti-Communist and hold traditional values. The primary source of this anti-Communist group was religious and militant beliefs. Left-wing groups hold more liberal ideology and do not condone limiting civil liberties.","Paul Wagner’s idea of audio-visual technology was shut down due to Cold War politics. These politics allowed for society to accuse Wagner of being a Communist because of his liberal education idea. Little did society know that Wagner’s idea was ahead of it’s time, and audio-visual technologies would play a huge role in the future of education."," "],"display_date":"1947 - 1951","search_date":"1949-07-01","locations":[{"id":52921,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Winter Park, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":2247,"tag":"communism"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":968,"tag":"Liberal Arts"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}},{"id":6593,"title":"The Wagner Affair: A Historic Hidden Story","course_id":167,"status":"P","start_date":"3/1/47","end_date":"3/1/51","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["   Who would ever think that life would take such a wicked twist in such a rapid pace back in 1947-1948 when it comes to the history of Rollins College? After the war, there was much concern for possibility of a drafting system that would put the future of colleges across the United States in much turmoil. Facts that unfortunately drove college administrations to plan for and consider a threat to their attendance figures. When Paul A. Wagner assumed the role of President of Rollins College in 1949, he promised to bring an innovative mentality that will reface the image of the traditional college. Little did the rest of the administration know that along with those innovations, Wagner would be part of one of Rollins’ most historic moments and not in such a positive way."," According to documentation from a series of meetings held in 1947 prior to Wagner’s assumption of his presidency, in regards to the paramount needs of Rollins College, the Trustee-Faculty Committee met on three different occasions to thoroughly discuss methods to fulfil the current needs. With much collaborating brainstorming, they came up with four recommendations that are as follows: 1) A substantial increase in faculty salaries; 2) A revision system of retirement pensions for faculty and staff; 3) Large needs of the various departments; 4) New Buildings. Although lack of funding was not a major discussion in these meetings, it is almost positive that the college’s monetary condition must have been in consideration to reach this determination. These recommendations came about due to the unsuccessful efforts to get Rollins added to the approved list of the American Association of Universities.[1]When Paul Wagner became president of Rollins, he presented his vision and aspirations for the college to be with a brand new focus on technology and with plans to bring modern perspectives, ideas and methods. He felt that this would accelerate the learning process for the students. According to the Florida Times-Union, a newspaper published in Jacksonville, Florida, Wagner “brings a brilliant record with him to Winter Park educational institution.” However, it seems that almost immediately that he took office, things began to change drastically. [2] ","            Rollins College has a culture amongst its Executive Committee, Faculty, and Students that was based on community. Decisions were made as amongst everyone. Because after all the sense of family and community was a huge part of what Rollins College was. This was no secret to Wagner when he came on board. This is a culture that is highly promoted on campus and the community. However, it was probably one of the first betrayals that Wagner did as soon as he had the opportunity. Paul Wagner adopted a huge concern when he came into office due the post-war drafting concerns that had been established. This was a fear that across the United States affected all universities. After thoroughly doing his research, Wagner then began to make his presidential moves and began to utilize his authoritive power. Decisions of what he didn’t truly count with the community based process that defined the college. This began to spark much concern with faculty and even the Executive Committee. Fearing a future draft system that will hit the college extremely hard with attendance, Wagner, made a proposal to the Executive Committee to make a drastic cut in faculty and salaries as well. A move no one expected."," Documented by the Executive Committee from the Rollins Alumni Association, after many meetings that Wagner presented aggressively his proposal for positions cuts, it was pointed out how convincing Wagner was. However, there has been one main point that still lingers, although many figures and funding amounts where discussed in these meetings, however, there was never any fundamental figures released by the Administration to back up Wagner’s diagnosis. The predictions were definitely a concern, however, the cuts were based simply on a guess by Wagner. There were not given alternatives, nor was the faculty and staff asked to gather thoughts on finding alternatives to obtain the funding needed to stay afloat. The formula that was used by Wagner to determine the professors that were going to be dismissed was also another blur. Although the formula was approved by the Board of Trustees, there was not a sufficient explanation on the results of the calculations. [3]"," All this was happening too fast. The students grew very concerned of all the intermural sports that were being cut as well. And faculty felt that instead of the community based culture they were used to, they were feeling a growing dictatorship from the way Wagner was taking control of all the decisions and not counting with anyone as he had promised to carry on from the previous president Dr. Hamilton Holt. According to archives on the financial aspect of the college, they were receiving gifts from the community, showing that there could have been alternatives to such drastic cuts. There were also letters sent from Haverford College in Haverford Pennsylvania[4] and Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio stating that they are not releasing any of their faculty or staff due to this drafting prediction. This was yet another indication that there were alternatives. [5]"," To conclude, this incredibly ugly moment in the history of Rollins College will forever live in the memory of the community. A moment in history where an individual that intended to help out to improve the college’s deficit issue, almost brought the college to ruins in many ways besides financially. The Wagner Affair is much more than just economic figures it’s also a case of disloyalty to a community that could have led to much division, however, the sense of community was much stronger than that. The Rollins family fought against all odds to save and recover its culture and respect. They fought until Wagner had no choice to walk away without the choice to look back. But forever leaving the memory of what it could have been.  "," "," ","[1] Board of Trustees, Recommendations of the Trustee-Faculty Committee Concerning the Paramount Needs of Rollins College, Board of Trustees, 1947.","[2] \"Rollins Trustees Turn to Youth for New President,\" The Florida Times-Union, August 27, 1949.","[3] Rollins Alumni Association, Executive Committee, Rollins Alumni Association, 1951.","[4] Haverford College, Office of President, Haverford College, 1951.","[5] Oberlin College, Office of President, Oberlin College, 1951."," "],"display_date":"March 1, 1947 - March 1, 1951","search_date":"1949-02-28","locations":[{"id":52897,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Winter Park, FL"}],"tags":[{"id":3132,"tag":"The Wagner Affair"},{"id":3133,"tag":"The Hidden History"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}},{"id":6594,"title":"The Wagner Affair: Educational Attainment","course_id":167,"status":"P","start_date":"9/2/45","end_date":"5/31/52","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["     The Wagner Affair left Rollins College in a financial crisis, with the desire to reach a state of peace and accord. The Executive Committee of Rollins College addressed the Alumni Association on March 30<sup>th</sup>, 1951 and discussed the present and future financial image of Rollins College. According to Paul Wagner, president of Rollins College, there would be a probable 30% decrease in the student body in the following academic year. The final calculation showed that out of the 425 undergraduates enrolled, only 199 were expected to return the next year. The Statement of the Student Committee, however, showed their resistance to the dismissal of faculty, which was inevitable after the student body count dropped. They believed that the education they paid for was not one they were receiving. The students trusted that by paying the tuition, they would be able to study under the professors of their own choosing in their major fields. Their educational attainment depended on the faculty and their experience and guidance.","     The issue at Rollins and with Paul Wagner began around the time the United States was recovering from the war. The end of World War Two and the start of the Cold War, however, did not affect the educational attainment for students and even war veterans coming back from war to a certain extent. Laws, like the G.I Bill, were considered the “most ambitious educational experiment.” The number of veterans who enrolled in college exceeded many people’s expectations, as veterans accounted for 70% of all male enrollment. Historians and economists point to the G.I Bill as a policy instrument that had the greatest effect on the level of educational attainment of returning veterans and on the overall higher education in America. It was seen as a policy that democratized the collegiate population as it made college a viable option for men with different racial backgrounds and low-income families.","    However, this was not completely true as the effects of the G.I Bill on collegiate attainment did differ for black and white Americans residing in the South. Black veterans in the South were limited in their educational attainment and the choices available to them. The G.I Bill did not provide enough opportunities in higher education for black veterans in the South. When it came to investments in colleges and universities, it was limited which was proven to affect their benefits in the long run. As the Cold War expanded and the Korean war came closer to happening, drafting increased rapidly which put pressure on men and their future. As the student body count at Rollins decreased as more men were leaving for the army, Paul Wagner tried to create solutions to solve the financial issue that was going to hit Rollins. The sudden drop in the tuition that they were going to receive set them into a mode of panic which resulted in quick and not thought through resolutions to avoid a huge debt. However, as segregation continued to hold a place during the 1950s, increasing the minority population at Rollins was not going to work.","     The concern of the students at Rollins College with their educational attainment can be related to the bigger issue of education attainment in the United States after the Second World War and the start of the Cold War. Some of the laws that were imposed to help increase higher education did not help everyone in need. The war had a strong negative impact on postsecondary education as it drew students out of colleges much earlier leading to a delay in the attainment of a complete education."],"display_date":"September 2, 1945 - May 31, 1952","search_date":"1949-01-15","locations":[{"id":52921,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Winter Park, Florida"}],"tags":[{"id":3130,"tag":"Wagner affair"},{"id":438,"tag":"Rollins College"},{"id":3123,"tag":"Paul Wagner"},{"id":3134,"tag":"Educational Attainment"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}},{"id":6595,"title":"THE WAGNER AFFAIR AND THE G.I.

Since its founding in 1885, much has taken place. During the 1950s, the Wagner Affair became part of this history. Paul Wagner was the president of Rollins from 1949 to 1951. Wagner was the ninth president at Rollins. He was the nation’s youngest college president, and took office at the age of 32. Even though his time was short, he still made a huge impact.  During his time as president, colleges were facing financial issues. Rollins could not escape it. He did a lot of things that upset the college and the surrounding community. He is the infamous president who took away the football team, and fired staff member regardless of their tenure. Wagner also threatened to get rid of other sports due to money.[1] Clearly, students were very unhappy. The community was also upset. They couldn’t believe all the changes that Wagner was making.","            The Board of Trustees were also making issues. To the students they seemed to be a part of the problem. When Wagner first proposed the firing of professors, the Board of Trustees approved it. It is believed that this Board of Trustees did not care about how their actions affected the college. Since they approved much of what Wagner proposed, the blame was placed on them as well. [2]","His actions prompted the students to organize a walk out. They did not support the choices he made, and thought the walk out would show their unhappiness. In May of 1951, a few students walked out of class. This was their way of boycotting the system. The students who chose to walk out, claimed they would continue to do so, until the school had done something about Wagner.  Not all students walk out however. Students who were at Rollins due to the G.I. bill didn’t want to follow everyone. They feared that if they walked out, they would get in trouble with the school. They did not want to risk their benefits from the bill.[3]","The G.I bill was very helpful to those who had served in military. Veterans were able to have lower interest mortgages, and attend college for free or cheaper than most. Veterans could also go to trade schools if the wanted to. Although, during this time, there was a decreased enrollment. The Korean War also lowered the enrollment. This made these G.I students to be more valuable. The bill allowed the middle class to expand like it never had before. The bill provided more to these veterans than the WW1 veterans had when they returned. [4] They were able to reach their idea of living the American dream. The bill made it possible for veteran to be almost half of a colleges population. By 1951, the number of graduating veterans was doubled. [5]","They had their own issues to face, other than Wagner’s actions. One issues they had to deal with was the age difference between the other students. Since veterans tended to be older, they might have thought the walk out wasn’t worth it.[6] These veterans most likely did not want to draw more attention to themselves. They did not want to loose anything that the bill had given them. Overall, the Wagner Affair was an issue that was felt by everyone in the community of Winter Park. It seemed that nothing good had come from this."," ","[1] Rob Humphreys, \"In Memory: Paul Wagner,\" Rollins.360, February 24, 2016, <a href=\"http://360.rollins.edu/people/paul-wagner-rollins-college-president.\">http://360.rollins.edu/people/paul-wagner-rollins-college-president.</a>","[2] Israel Kugler, “Status, Power, and Educational Freedom”, <em>The Journal of Educational Sociology</em> , 25, no. 9 (1952): 512-15.","[3] “Rollins Students on ‘Strike’” <em>The Gazette (Schenectady)</em>, May 11, 1951, final edition.","[4] Edward Humes, <em>Over Here: How the G.I.

According to the article, Rollins and faculty and students were largely dissatisfied by how the dismissals were handled by Wagner; they felt such drastic action should not have been carried out without first consulting them on the issue. The article “Trustees Back Faculty Cuts” highlights and illustrates the dissatisfaction and changing relationship that the public had with large institutions during the fifties. ","            American secondary education expanded during the fifties due to both a rise in population and the growth of the middle class. Historian Richard Stanley writes “Colleges and universities, both public and private, experienced an unprecedented period of rapid growth following the end of World War II.”[1] Increased enrollment meant “…educators warned of coming teacher and classroom shortages—crowded schools plagued the educational system throughout the decade.”[2] During the Eisenhower administration, more schools were built across the country and education became more centralized. The fifties in the United States are characterized as a period of rapid political, social, and economic change; this culture of change trickled down in to the curriculum of many American colleges. Many schools began to alter their curriculum in an attempt to safeguard American political ideals. For example, Alabama State College implemented a curriculum with a heavy emphasis on democracy, student responsibility, and patriotism during the period. Students were taught “…life lessons about democracy, loyalty, dedication, perseverance, and the responsibility of being a contributor. Moreover, these deeply profound lessons were woven throughout the classic liberal arts college preparatory curriculum.”[3] Similarly to Alabama State College, the use of curriculum as a tool of political socialization was also prevalent at Southern Methodist College during the fifties. Historian Adrienne Caughfield explains “…American classrooms, now seen as battlegrounds, in which young innocents—not only school children, but also college students, newly released on campus without parental supervision—became targets of Marxist persuasion. The thought of such agents shaping the minds of American children justified a severe response.”[4] These examples demonstrate how the American public’s fear and distrust of communism and other foreign ideas trickled down into the education system. ","            The fifties were a period marked by administrative and political distrust. This was exemplified by the changes in culture and curriculum that were implemented in liberal arts schools across the country during the decade.

Unfortunately, Rollins College, an educational institution founded in 1885 by Lucy Cross and the Congregational Church, was no different from the majority of its peers. In the post-war era, colleges across the nation suffered from lowered attendance rates, and with the impending conflict in Korea potentially reducing their student body yet again, many institutions felt they were in a time of crisis. Rollins College was, again, no exception, with this tumultuous landscape providing the opportunity for the greatest scandal the college has faced to date, the Wagner affair.","Paul Wagner was brought to Rollins to serve as president after the esteemed career of Hamilton Holt. Handpicked by Holt himself based on promises of a more engaged student body, Wagner initially seemed all the heir-apparent he had sold himself to be; however, as the Korean anxiety grew and financial crisis seemed eminent, his series of totalitarian demands upon the student body and faculty pushed the already shaken college into action, and Wagner was unwillingly ousted only two years into his presidency. As Wagner’s career burnt out, Holt was called back into action in hopes of gathering support in removing his successor, which was deemed necessary if the college were to survive. In his attempts, Holt engaged in personal correspondence with many of the members of Rollins’ Board of Trustees, including Dr. Paul Stillman of California.","In his correspondence with Stillman, Holt makes it clear that he will ensure insomuch as he can the compensation of Stillman, and other out of state trustees, who attend to ensure that Wagner is removed from office, reaffirming that, if nothing else, the Rollins Board of Trustees was something of an old boys’ club. Of the eleven trustees who voted to remove Wagner from office, only two were women, and one of these was the wife of acting President McKean. The men involved in the administration of Rollins were from an elite and educated class of white Americans, with most of the trustees living lives of prestige and security even in these uncertain times, far from the issues that affected the students and faculty of Rollins College.  ","Obviously, the social norms were not on the side of femininity. As smized by May in her work<em> Homeward Bound: American Families in the Cold War Era</em>, “These public health professionals argued that inside as well as outside the home, women who challenged traditional roles placed the security of the nation at risk.” Retroactively, these beliefs and actions seem absurd, if not blatantly incorrect and offensive, and within the confines of the decade, and even with regards to the Wagner affair, female students, administration, and faculty would begin to push for more presence in higher education."," "," "],"display_date":"April 18, 1951 - May 24, 1951","search_date":"1951-05-06","locations":[{"id":52973,"lat":28.5999998,"lng":-81.3392352,"zoom":8,"place":"Rollins College, Winter Park"}],"tags":[{"id":3141,"tag":"gender inequality"},{"id":438,"tag":"Rollins College"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 120 Decade of Decision 1950s","school":"Rollins College","course_id":167,"school_id":5}}]}
