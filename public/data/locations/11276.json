During a two week stay in Germany, Lewcock visited the cities of Trier, Mainz, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Bonn, Cologne, and Dusseldorf and their surrounding villages. The purpose of this visit was to get a general view of what life looked like for an average worker, not to gage budgets. Working class children on these city streets looked well-nourished and the women looked comfortable going about their daily business. In comparison to visits to many distressed areas, this was a reliable way of gaging quality of life. According to Lewcock, one must simply look at the shops in each working class district, they were well stocked and filled with customers, and that there was very little vacant property all indicated that the working class was doing well. The cities were a picture of prosperity, in Konigalle in Dusseldorf on a Saturday afternoon, the magnificent streets were filled with people enjoying themselves, drinking coffee and Kuchen and shop owners actively engaging with customers. One would be hard pressed to find any distress. A couple of strange things stood out. In Frankfurt, even with the Nazi’s party official stance against the Jews, the Synagogue was in good shape. It was in use and the custodian seemed well. Additionally, <em>The Times</em> was available in each of these cities and was in high demand, often sold out. Lewcock concluded that it was obvious, with German shops being full, people fed and living well enough to buy foreign newspapers, the living standard in Germany is shown to be quite high and not restricted.","            This article recounts a visit to 1937 Germany and in the 1930s Germany had managed to pull itself out of a terrible economic depression caused by the Great Depression and the reparations that they were forced to pay after World War One. Before World War One, four German marks equalled one US dollar. They had been hit so hard that in the 1920s it cost 250 billion marks for a pound of sugar[2]. In 1933 Hitler used the German economic situation to his advantage to be elected into power. In 1933 the economy took a turn for the better, and in 1936 Hitler started expanding German territory and occupied the Rhineland. The German recovery from the depression was quite impressive, jobs came back, pride in Germany returned and social institutions began again, but it came with draw backs[3]. During Hitler’s reign, anti-semetic attitudes became very popular and spread throughout Germany. Nazi Germany believed them to be sub human[4] and in 1936 the threat could be felt[5]. This culminated in the 1938 Kristallnacht; an attack on Jewish people, buildings and business by Nazi fanatics. The treatment of Jews was known to the world.  Many people in the US and Europe wanted to boycott the Olympics, which were being held in Germany, due to the human rights abuses[6]. In short, Germany had managed to make a major economic turn around and had begun a hostile effort against its Jewish citizens."," "," "," ","Bibliography","Dowswell, Paul. <em>The Usborne Introduction to the Second World War</em>.

(Blame Nazis for rupture. (1937, Aug 21)) The Soviets are most annoyed by these new political ties and influence as it is starting to affect their own states such as Czechoslovakia. Many people blamed these rising tensions and split between Czechoslovakia and Portugal on the Nazi party. On August 20<sup>th</sup> 1937, the diplomatic agreement between Lisbon, Portugal and Praha, Czechoslovakia was severed and the Soviets reported that a third power was involved with this decision. The Soviets stated that the relations were cut so that the German’s could pave a way for the fascist regime in Europe by showing how much influence they held. The German newspapers of course denied these claims stating that the third power was most likely either the French or the Russians themselves in a smear like campaign against the Germans. Both were already militarized near Czechoslovakia but were both a part of the anti Fascist movement so this severing of political relations would be a negative blow to both of their ideologies. Most saw this ruse the Germans were trying to pass off as true and still continued to blame the growing influence of the Nazi party and the power they were exerting in the shadows on the split of diplomatic relations. ","The Nazis had been slowly gaining power and presence ever since they had become the majority party in in 1932 gaining a total of over 30% of the votes in Germany. (\"The Nazi Rise to Power.\") With this they were able to start making moves which eventually led to the events of World War 2. They started creating alliances with other countries near them like Italy to create a powerful force in Europe known as the Axis. The power they were able to exert can be seen in the newspaper article above, they were able to sever relations between two parties without the use of their military. Seeing the Nazi’s influence growing was what would begin to create tension between them and the Allied Forces. They saw the fact that the Nazi party could carry out moves like this from in the shadows as a threat to the stability that had been re-established in Europe. The tensions would constantly rise in Europe until they erupted into what would eventually become World War 2. You can see smaller incidents such as Germany being able to sever the political relations between Portugal and the Soviet State as just one of man incidents that would lead to a war, which many didn’t wish to see so soon after the conclusion of the first World War."," "],"display_date":"1930 - 1945","search_date":"1937-12-31","locations":[{"id":53096,"lat":39.399872,"lng":-8.224454,"zoom":8,"place":"Portugal"},{"id":53059,"lat":54.5259614,"lng":15.2551187,"zoom":8,"place":"Europe"},{"id":53094,"lat":51.165691,"lng":10.451526,"zoom":8,"place":"Germany"}],"tags":[{"id":3437,"tag":"Influence"},{"id":3436,"tag":"Rise to Power"},{"id":3435,"tag":"Nazi Party"},{"id":1732,"tag":"Nazi"}],"course":{"name":"Critical Writing and Research for Historians","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":179,"school_id":28}}]}
