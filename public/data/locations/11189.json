Smith-Hodges was owned by a man named Hiram Cassedy. Smith-Hodges praised Cassedy, saying that when he was there she and the other slaves were treated and fed well under his ownership. Cassedy was not just a plantation owner, he was also a well known judge. He was unable to oversee day-to-day operations on his plantation, so he hired an overseer to look over the slaves and their work while he was away. A profit-driven power struggle would often arise when an owner was forced to hire an overseer.","Smith-Hodges’ life on the plantation would drastically change when the overseer was in charge. Cassedy instructed overseer to not be hard on his slaves, yet when he would leave, they were worked longer, harder, and whipped to draw blood. Conflict that resulted from a master’s treatment of an slaves and an overseer’s treatment of the slaves came as a result of how they profited from the slaves’ work. “He had money in every one of us,” said Smith-Hodges. “De oberseers was white men workin’ fer wages.” Cassedy saw the slaves as more of a long-term investment. His ability to keep them working and be able to sell them for profit depended on their health. Cassedy’s effort into having his “property” earn him back profit paints him as more of a “good cop” character, effectively entering him into conflict with the “bad cop,” or the overseer. The overseer made a wage based on the amount of work slaves completed in a day; he was uninterested in their long term. These competing interests often caused situations like Fanny’s.","The “good cop,” bad cop” roles of the owner and overseer continued to play into the power they had on their plantation. Social standing, not just business interest, contributed to the power struggle between overseers and owners. Overseer’s reputation with the slaves they abused and the general public often corresponded. In historical accounts of varying classes of people, they were seen as unrefined, violent, and almost as low of class as the slaves they controlled.","In full knowledge of the reputation their overseer had, owners would often accept their “good cop” role in order to separate themselves from the lower-class, harsh daily work of the plantation. Their slaves were then able to be worked hard, earn them profit, yet they were not seen as having the brutish role of the overseer. This is most likely the role Cassedy happily accepted when he would leave town to be a judge. He was able to play his high-class and benevolent, yet earn profit because of his overseer’s bad reputation."," ","Slaves would often use the negative reputation of their overseer to their advantage; it was easier to resist and manipulate someone less powerful and of a lower class than their master. At Fanny’s plantation, many slaves would run away while the overseer was on duty. “Afte’ supper, we set ’bout an’ sing an go places. Sometimes de men would steal off an’ go ter other plantations,” she said. Slaves throughout the South also used manipulation and resisted their overseer’s grasp by escaping to the woods. Even at an old age, Fanny Smith-Hodges was able to remember this power struggle, and the violent impact it would ultimately have on slaves involved.","<strong><br /><br /><br /></strong>"," "],"display_date":"1850 - 1865","search_date":"1857-12-31","locations":[{"id":53068,"lat":32.3546679,"lng":-89.3985283,"zoom":8,"place":"Mississippi"}],"tags":[{"id":3322,"tag":"Slave Owner"},{"id":3321,"tag":"Overseer"}],"course":{"name":"Human Trafficking: Yesterday and Today","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":171,"school_id":11}},{"id":6723,"title":"African-American Work Songs","course_id":176,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-01-01","end_date":"12/31/47","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi all had large state penitentiaries with them, where African-American men and women resided. Many people visited these prisons to listen to and record these talented men and women singing, including the famous folklorists John Lomax, Alan Lomax, and Dr. Harry Oster. The recorded singers talked about their life experiences, including prison, and the way that music had greatly impacted them. Before they became musicians and wrote their own music, each man was involved in work songs while in prison. Work songs are pieces of music that are sung while conducting a task. The songs might be a connected narrative, description, or protest song. They are the reason that people visited prisons to record music. ","Prison work songs are a piece of evidence connecting slavery to incarceration. Once African-Americans came to the U.S. as slaves, they sang songs that reminded them of home and their cultural roots as they were in the midst of oppression. Some songs that were sung carried different meanings and messages within them and each song had its own style or rhythm to it. The most common feature of work songs is the call-and-response format where a leader would sing a verse or two and the other men and women would follow with the chorus. To keep every person motivated and in sync while working through the blistering hot or freezing cold days, they sang songs. The work songs were sung to maintain a steady work pace and to keep the beat for the song, the prisoners used their tools. For example, while chopping logs and singing, half of the men would swing their axes down into the log, while the other half of the men were on their upswing. This kept a steady momentum to make work a bit easier and keep the prisoners sane. ","As the prisoners spoke about their music, they provided information about some songs and what the songs meant. One African-American man who stuck out as he was a great singer and very well-known to the public was Huddie Leadbetter (Leadbelly). Leadbelly talked about one song in particular called \"Go Down Old Hannah.\" \"Old Hannah\" is what the prisoners called the sun throughout the south. They sang about the color of \"Old Hannah\" and the pain it brought upon them and their partners or friends working next to them. They wanted the sun to go down for it meant their work day was now over. Here is an excerpt from the song, \"Go Down Old Hannah\": \"Why don't you go down, ol' Hannah / Don't you rise no more. / If you come up in the mornin' / Bring judgement sure. / Well I look at ol' Hannah / She was turnin' red. / Well I look at my partner. / He was almost dead.\" Some work songs were known from prison to prison as they were first sung by African-Americans as slaves. Other songs were unique to the prison itself and had their own-meanings. They are beautiful, powerful and moving pieces of music that hold a great part of American history. "],"display_date":"1867 - 1947","search_date":"1907-07-02","locations":[{"id":52817,"lat":31.9685988,"lng":-99.9018131,"zoom":4,"place":"Texas"},{"id":53068,"lat":32.3546679,"lng":-89.3985283,"zoom":4,"place":"Mississippi"},{"id":53077,"lat":30.9842977,"lng":-91.9623327,"zoom":4,"place":"Louisiana"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":3384,"tag":"Work Songs"},{"id":3385,"tag":"Prison Songs"}],"course":{"name":"Incarceration in the US","school":"Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis","course_id":176,"school_id":94}}]}
