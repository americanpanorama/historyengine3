The Bisbee deportation was not just a localized event, but instead one that involved many cities in Arizona. Tucson was just one of the cities that monitored Bisbee heavily and supported the deportation. The Tucson Citizen, one of the local newspapers, covered the Bisbee Deportation in great detail and presents a biased view against the strikers/deportees. On July 12<sup>th </sup>business in Bisbee was suspended as the Citizens Protective League (CPL) rounded up about 1,000 members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). The CPL, armed with weapons and 2,200 men strong, corralled anyone associated with or perceived as a member of the IWW into the city baseball park and loaded them up into cattle and box cars. The CPL was composed of 1,200 volunteers from Bisbee and 1,000 volunteers from the nearby city Douglas. The sheriff had called them all loyal Americans ready to arrest the strikers on charges of vagrancy, treason and disturbing the peace. The sheriffs description of the IWW as unpatriotic, strangers to the region, and treasonous simply highlights how the general public saw the IWW and immigrants. The CPL had declared that there shall be no mark of the IWW by nightfall. At noon in Tucson, Mayor O.C Parker was informed that twenty four carloads of deportees may be sent to his city and in response he met with Sheriff Rye Miles, Dr. A.G Schnabel and Tom K. Richey to discuss about the possibility of the IWW members being sent to their city. Mayor Parker, on behalf of his city, declared that under no circumstances are the trains allowed to unload in Tucson and the Sheriff threatening deportation if they do unload. Even after being informed that the train was sent to New Mexico instead did nothing to lower tensions, and the Mayor and Sheriff stood on guard with the Home Guard ready to mobilize at any moment’s notice. They stood guard against trains that are carrying the ‘undesirables’ into Tucson."," ","The Tucson Citizen article is from the Tucsonan’s point of view, and how they saw the Bisbee deportation. The newspaper covered heavily on the CPL and opposition against the IWW and strikers, showing a heavy bias. The Mayor and Sheriffs announcements and actions showed that Tucson strongly opposed the IWW and their members being sent to their City/County. Douglas’ assistance with the Bisbee deportation showed how the general public viewed the IWW and the strikers, and the negative perception is because many saw the IWW as immigrants/non-Americans. The Strike began on June 26<sup>th</sup>, 1917 and those on strike were mostly Mexican and Europeans, who were paid less than native-born Americans, and the response to the strike highlights the racism the United States had towards immigrants. At the time the United States was both highly xenophobic and nativist, and the events of World War 1 led to Germans being a target of discrimination and being branded as enemies, and anyone deemed radical or anti-war was treated the same as well. While the perpetrators of the Deportation were tried in court, their charges were dropped and any attempts to convict them were unsuccessful due to the court declaring that no laws were broken. In the greater scope of the United States’ History the Bisbee mining strike was another incident regarding labour reforms. From 1900 to 1920 there were many unions that sought to introduce new regulations or improve working conditions and pay, and some succeeded and some failed. The Bisbee Strike and the I.W.W were some of the failures. What hindered the I.W.W was that it was too radical and anarchist and this affected the I.W.W’s relations with other Unions. Another important point to consider was the United States involvement in World War 1, so tensions about enemy spies or enemy sympathizers were possible. In fact there were rumors of the I.W.W being pro-German and the I.W.W being anti-war certainly did not help them at all and prior to the Bisbee deportation the government was cracking down on the I.W.W. In the end, even if the horrid act was justified in some way, the Bisbee Deportation was illegal and unjustified and stands as another instance of a lack of labour regulations in 20<sup>th</sup> century America. "],"display_date":"June 26, 1917 - July 12, 1917","search_date":"1917-07-04","locations":[{"id":53041,"lat":31.4481547,"lng":-109.9284084,"zoom":8,"place":"Bisbee, Arizona"}],"tags":[{"id":3290,"tag":"Deportation"},{"id":3291,"tag":"Labour Reform"},{"id":3292,"tag":"Institutional Racism"},{"id":3293,"tag":"Anti-Union Violence"},{"id":3294,"tag":"Miners"}],"course":{"name":"US History 1867 to the present","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":173,"school_id":28}},{"id":6676,"title":"The Deportation of Striking Miners","course_id":173,"status":"P","start_date":"6/26/17","end_date":"7/12/17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["From the eye of a non-historian, this photo which shows hundreds of people marching","from a small town to what looks like a rural area, would look pretty unusual. A large string of","people being escorted by other men to an open area, whilst a factory seems to be running in the","far background from the big crowd of people. Some questions would arise, such as, “Where are","those people heading to? Why are there hundreds of people going in the same direction?”.","These questions can be answered if the time and place in which the photograph has been taken","is considered. ","            Bisbee, Arizona was the home to many large copper mining companies in the early","1900’s, and during the First World War, the price of copper increased greatly and the copper","companies received large profits. With high price and high demand of copper, it made Bisbee","very wealthy. But with such high demand came harder labour for the miners. Even though the","companies were getting more and more wealthy; they did not increase the salaries for the miners.","In addition, the working conditions were harsh and dangerous for the miners. Eventually the","workers became more upset with the labour, so they joined The Industrial Workers of the World","(I.W.W.) and on June 24, 1917, the I.W.W. presented the copper companies of Bisbee with a list","of demands. These demands included better and safer working conditions, and the stoppage of  ","unequal treatment towards the immigrant workers. The copper companies then refused all the","demands that were given from the I.W.W., which then resulted into a strike. Nearly half of the","miners in Bisbee were on strike, which was a major set back for the copper companies in Bisbee.","Another reason why the strike happened was because the relationship between the I.W.W. and","law enforcement was not good. The law enforcement didn’t seem to care too much about labour","conditions and needs, and organizations such as the I.W.W. During this time, the conflict of","labour relations in the U.S. became more and more severe. The law enforcement denied the","accommodations of immigrant labour which overall aggravated all immigrants. This constant","unnecessary hardship for the immigrants gave them no choice but to fight back, which resulted in","the strike. But the photo did not capture a moment from the strike, instead it captured a moment","which resulted from the strike.","            As the strike was in session, the state of Arizona needed a way to get the people of the","strike back to work. Instead of accommodating the demands of the I.W.W., a different route was","taken. 2000 deputies in Arizona came together under Sheriff Harry Wheeler, and planned on","taking matters in their own hands. In the morning of July 12, 1917, the deputies went to Bisbee","to locate and capture all I.W.W. members and even supporters of the movement. They ended up","capturing over 1000 people and escorted them from Bisbee, through Lowell, and to a train so it","can later bring them to Hermanas, New Mexico where they were left abandoned.","            This photo captured the moment where the deputies were escorting the workers to the","train so they can be deported. The photo shows the deportees walking from their towns for the","last time. In the background shows smoke arising from a factory as workers are being deported","just miles from it. The factory in the background shows a bit of irony considering half of","Bisbee’s miners were on their way to another life.

Even with the price increase of copper, the wages of the miners however, stayed the same. The copper mine owners were hoarding the proceeds. Many of the copper miners were immigrants or children of immigrants and saw the hierarchy between the first class owners and they themselves as the working middle class. This hierarchy created a means for the owners to run the town as they saw fit, which left the minors and the other citizens helpless to protest against them. The Industrial Workers of the World or IWW, a union, tried to step in and have the workers rise up and push the owners to unionize. When the workers presented their list of demands to the Bisbee Mining Companies and went on strike the mine owners had both the minors on strike and any sympathizer rounded up, placed on a train, and sent to New Mexico and left in the middle of the desert. These stranded workers soon received word that they would not be allowed back into Bisbee, and that all entrances to the town were barricaded and under surveillance.","After the deportation of the workers occurred, six citizens from the Citizens Protective League of Bisbee and Douglas travelled to Phoenix, Arizona to speak with Governor Campbell. Their purpose was to give the Governor a first hand account of the events the lead up to the deportation of the mineworkers, from the point of view of the copper mine owners. At the time the meeting took place, the minors and their sympathizers were still not welcome in the Bisbee and Warren mining district. After their piece was spoken Governor Campbell informed the men that deporting the minors was completely illegal, innocent men were deported against their rights. He also went so far as to tell them the law was meant to be upheld by the Governor, and that the committee and mine owners had taken the law into their own hands. In a broader historical context the deportation at Bisbee matters because it highlights the tensions between law enforcement and political organizations like the IWW, where law enforcement officers were growing increasing agitated with groups like the IWW trying to unionize the immigrant factory laborers. This agitation arose because many of the law enforcement officers were trying to follow instruction from government officials and the factory owners themselves, and these mass strikes that the IWW were encouraging were keeping law enforcement from following these instructions."],"display_date":"June 24, 1917 - July 12, 1917","search_date":"1917-07-03","locations":[{"id":53041,"lat":31.4481547,"lng":-109.9284084,"zoom":8,"place":"Bisbee, Arizona"}],"tags":[{"id":3290,"tag":"Deportation"},{"id":2541,"tag":"Law Enforcement"},{"id":3301,"tag":"Immigrant"},{"id":3302,"tag":"IWW"}],"course":{"name":"US History 1867 to the present","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":173,"school_id":28}},{"id":6683,"title":"Report on the Bisbee Deportations","course_id":173,"status":"P","start_date":"6/26/17","end_date":"11/6/17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the aftermath of the strike and deportation of workers in the booming town of Bisbee, Arizona, President Woodrow Wilson set up the Federal Mediation Commission to investigate the events in detail. In the commissions’ published report, it states that on July 12, 1917, the Bisbee Deportation was an embarrassment for industrial peace and that it, “Deeply affected the opinions of laboring men, as well as the public throughout the country.” (W. B. Wilson et al. 3)","Released on November 6, 1917, the <em>Report on the Bisbee Deportations</em> claimed that the strike was unjustified because an impartial process should settle grievances. The report determined that many people supported the strike because of their loyalty to fellow workers and to not be disliked by their peers. (W. B. Wilson et al. 4)","Despite the sheriff and governor of Arizona’s request for the aid of federal troops, two separate investigations on June 30 and July 2 concluded that the strike itself was peaceful and that troops were, “Neither needed nor warranted under existing conditions.” (W. B. Wilson et al. 4) Instead of receiving federal troops, Sheriff Harry Wheeler and approximately 2,000 men, who wore white armbands to distinguish themselves from other mining workers, herded 1,186 men. The men were put onboard a train that brought them to Columbus, New Mexico. Columbus authorities refused to take the deportees and were taken to the desert town Hermanas. The deportees were left stranded without food, water, and shelter for two days. On July 14, the War Department was notified of the stranded deportees and they were escorted back to Columbus.","The report notes that the leaders of the deportation never illustrated their fears to the governor of Arizona when they requested for federal troops two previous times. Therefore, the report concluded that this was, “Wholly illegal and without authority in law, either state or federal.” (W. B. Wilson et al. 6)","Of the deportees, 199 were native born American and 468 were citizens. There were 472 registered under the selective-draft law. Foreign born workers were split between 20 different nationalities. (W. B. Wilson et al. 5)","‘New immigration’ began in the early-twentieth century. From 1901 to 1914, 13 million immigrants born in southern and eastern Europe moved to the United States. By 1910, one-seventh of the American population was foreign born. (Foner 683)","Strikes weren’t uncommon during The Progressive Era. In 1907, 10,000 black and white dockworkers in New Orleans fought against employers who wanted to eliminate their unions and reduce wages. (Foner 696)","In 1913, immigrants from Europe and Mexico demanded wage increases, an eight-hour workday and the right to shop and live in places not owned by the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company. When 11,000 strikers and their families were evicted from company housing and moved into tent colonies, the armed militia killed 20 to 30 people, including children. (Foner 697)","The report recommended that the governor of Arizona punish those responsible, while creating separate investigations to determine whether there was any interference with the enforcement of selective-draft law and with lines of communication, respectively. (W.B. Wilson et al. 7) What’s truly telling is that despite insurmountable evidence against the sheriff, the report concludes that President Wilson and Congress should determine whether the deportation is a crime. The sheriff and his vigilantes were never convicted of any crime."],"display_date":"June 26, 1917 - November 6, 1917","search_date":"1917-08-31","locations":[{"id":53041,"lat":31.4481547,"lng":-109.9284084,"zoom":8,"place":"Bisbee, Arizona"}],"tags":[{"id":31,"tag":"Immigration"},{"id":3302,"tag":"IWW"},{"id":3290,"tag":"Deportation"},{"id":2645,"tag":"Woodrow Wilson"},{"id":3303,"tag":"Harry Wheeler"},{"id":3304,"tag":"Arizona"},{"id":1090,"tag":"strikes"}],"course":{"name":"US History 1867 to the present","school":"University of Toronto Scarborough","course_id":173,"school_id":28}}]}
