The three candidates for President, Democrat James Buchanan, Republican John Fremont and the Whig/ American Millard Fillmore were thus reticent of the fact that they would need to make decisive statement about slavery in order to capture votes.  Fremont was decidedly anti slavery, vowing to quell its expansion if elected. Fillmore took a strong stance in support of slavery in an attempt to win southern votes, declaring that if Fremont won, he would not submit to his rule, and the South should not either.  Buchanan took a middle ground, sympathizing with southerners and stating that slavery was an issue for the individual states to decide upon which garnered him southern support.  &lt;br /&gt;All three parties used print as a way to endorse their candidates.  Tickets for both the Democratic and Whig/ American Parties, specifically informed constituents the candidates to vote for in their specific districts when voting day, November 4, came.  The broadsides backing Buchanan and Fillmore are not surprisingly from southern districts while one would be hard pressed to find broadsides for Fremont in the South.  Simply put, Fremont and the Republicans did not have any semblance of southern support in the 1850s.  The Republican Party would not be able to attract many southerners to their ticket until the twentieth century.&lt;br /&gt;In the end, James Buchanan defeated Fremont and Fillmore.  Although, Fillmore succeeded in attracting southern votes, like the majority of New Orleans' residents, Buchanan had more mass appeal.  The defeat of Fremont was seen as a victory in the dispute for control of Kansas by pro slavery advocates, but this victory turned out to be short lived. Buchanan, the fifteenth president and the only bachelor to ever hold the position, is commonly viewed as one of the worst presidents in the history of the nation.  Buchanan proved to be ineffective at repairing the then growing split between the North and the South; this split eventually led to the secession of southern states and the war that later ensued."],"display_date":"November 4, 1856","search_date":"1856-11-04","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":54,"title":"Republicans Run their First Presidential Candidate\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-11-04","end_date":"1856-11-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Republican Party was formed as an anti-slavery party and in the presidential election of 1856, John Fremont became the party's first candidate for president.  Ironically, Fremont was the only candidate in the presidential election from the South, yet he was also the only one who spoke out against slavery.  Fremont campaigned to wipe out what he felt to be the two biggest sins plaguing the country: polygamy and slavery.  Fremont was an explorer of the western frontier and proved to be effective at promoting the idea of Manifest Destiny.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The political climate of the era remained particularly tense due to conflict in Kansas and Missouri over slavery.  This anti-slavery stance did not help him gain popularity with the majority of southerners.  In addition, Fremont, if elected, wanted to admit Kansas into the Union as a free state, which enraged southerners even more.  Southerners were further provoked by speeches given by Fremont supporters that declared if Fremont won the election he would subjugate the South to freedom (The Daily Dispatch, Aug 8, pg. 3).'  Needless to say, Fremont did not win over southerners with his abolitionist rhetoric and this eventually led to his defeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fremont was successful in winning eleven states, but ultimately lost the election to the Democratic candidate James Buchanan.  Ultimately, with such an ardent stance against slavery, Fremont proved highly unsuccessful in winning southern votes.  The winner of the election, James Buchanan was a southern sympathizer, although from Pennsylvania, and thus was able to garner the support of the South.  The South rejoiced when Fremont fell to Buchanan, but their pleasure with the outcome soon waned as Buchanan proved himself to be an inadequate president."],"display_date":"November 4, 1856","search_date":"1856-11-04","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":70,"title":"James Buchanan Addresses the Senate\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-09-12","end_date":"1856-09-12","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In September of 1856, during the race for the presidency, James Buchanan addressed the Senate on the subject of slavery.

This sort of position simultaneously endeared Buchanan to Southerners who did not want northern interference' in their jurisdictions and to northern abolitionists by saying slavery should be abolished in the nation's capital.

This new bill declared Kansas a slave state and was passed by a vote of thirty three to twelve.  The bill only needed approval by the House of Representatives to be enacted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violence between the pro slavery forces and free soilers and abolitionists gained momentum in the summer of 1856 and the senate presumably was anxious to repress it before it escalated.  This bill would have been viewed as a huge victory for the South in the debate over slavery.  Southerners felt that Northerners attacked them because of slavery; the implementation of slavery in the territory of Kansas would have validated their belief in the institution.  As it turned out, slavery did not take root in the Kansas Territory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forces fought for and against slavery throughout the second half of 1856 in Kansas, Missouri and other nearby territories, but neither side was able to defeat the other and employ their own policy.  After the time known as Bleeding Kansas' ended, several attempts were made to admit Kansas into the Union.  Kansas eventually adopted a Free State constitution in 1859, but southern senators stalled its admission into the Union, enraged that Kansas would be declared a Free State.

Manifest destiny is the idea that it was God's will that the United States expand throughout the whole of the continent (though not by force) to spread liberty and democracy.  O'Sullivan's second use of the term, in the <em>New York Morning News</em> on February 27, 1845, was extremely influential.  With this use, he discussed what he believed was the right of the United States instead of the British to claim Oregon Country.  With the expansion of American territory inevitably came the disagreements as to whether or not expansion should include the institution of slavery, and where: after early 1846, Democrats enthusiastically adopted the phrase for their use.  The idea of manifest destiny was also used in many instances to justify displacement of the American Indians throughout the continent.The use of the term manifest destiny in propaganda and publications promoting westward expansion had long-term, lasting effects on the United States.  Manifest destiny was a major rationale behind the Mexican War of 1846-1848, after which Americans gained Alta California and Nuevo Mexico.  New industrial empires sprung up in the West, especially with the gold rush in the newly acquired California in 1849.  Once the U.S. had control of Oregon Country from the British, it was found to be as rich and fertile as imagined.  After the Civil War, the philosophy of manifest destiny helped to promote the westward movement of the population after the emancipation of slaves.  In some situations, manifest destiny is even discussed today, for some Canadians believe that the United States may still have the somewhat hidden goal of annexing Canadian land."],"display_date":"February 27, 1845","search_date":"1845-02-27","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":106,"title":"11th President James K.

President John Quincy Adams had the auspicious task of keeping both sides happy in a desperate attempt to avoid any kind of armed conflict.  The first of what would become many troubling incidents for both parties occurred on January 21st, 1827.  Friar Joaquin Aremas was a Catholic from Spain who had migrated to Mexico to convince the Mexican government to realign with its mother country, Spain.  While Friar Aremas could be seen as some meaningless radical (and most historians do), at the time this was seen in the eyes of many as a dangerous sign.  President Adams realized the urgency and quickly sent out a message that was disseminated to the nation at large via the newspapers.  In it, he claimed that No change had taken place in the amicable relations of the Mexicans with those of North America'.  Officer Vera Cruz echoed the President's sentiments claiming that the affairs of Mexico were prosperous'.  Friar Aremas was cast back into obscurity; Mexico never seriously considered his plan, but the thought of Mexico backed by a powerful European country had the potential to upset the entire global balance.   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This event was significant for it proved the inevitability of a war with Mexico.  Both sides were too deeply involved with one another's affairs.  As long as colonists lived so near the border, and as long as instigators like Aremas were around, problems would soon follow.  Relations became so bad that in late November Mier y Teran was sent by the Mexican government to leave Mexico City for the sole purpose to scout and assess the present danger of the border.  Teran reached San Antonio on March 1, 1828 traveling to San Felipe on April 27th and Nacogdoches on June 3rd.  His worrisome results added fuel to a fire that was lit by a Catholic friar in mid-January 1827.  Could American settlers try to take their territory like so many Indian tribes?

The bill was sent to the Whole House Committee where it would spend a great deal of time being debated and edited but never passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bill was important because it showed the increasing resistance to free blacks in the United States.  The free black was of little use to many Americans North and South because they could not be seen as reliable or hard working as the slave or they might harbinger delusions' of equality.  Irish and German immigrants saw that since blacks no longer constituted free labor they were now competing with these inferiors' for jobs in unskilled labor, which could be seen, in the eyes of the immigrants, as a hindrance to their well being.  The problem was most people did not know exactly what do with them, and where they fit on the social hierarchy but it was certainly not equal to any white man.  Gradual emancipation was becoming a topic of merit, but could they really survive in the land that oppressed them for so long.  To several people, blacks could be free just not here.  Many were so moved they had already serviced a ship, the brig Doris with Captain Matthews for Virginian free blacks willing to embrace this opportunity'.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this was not a majority opinion.  Some believed that slavery was serving a good, eradicating their natural savagery' and that a trip to Africa would be unsuitable for these newly civilized' blacks. Therefore, this petition was not completely supported by any one area.  Fear would not really play a role until after Nat Turner's rebellion and free blacks were seen as a catalyst towards revolt.  The main impetus was maintaining social superiority but the plan failed because of wealthy slave owners' hostility in the South to any discussion on the topic.  Though not speaking for the entire South, they were a substantial part of the higher social ladder, and therefore a force to be reckoned with.  Congress feared the backlash from irate plantation owners, infringing on property rights' struck severe Constitutional problems for some Congressmen.

The Senate was full of upper-class, property owning loaners, not debtors.  Their interest was not in helping the poor farmer in deep amounts of debt with a national plan, their interest was in making sure what they loaned was returned to them as quickly as possible.  Though they had elections to worry about, this bill was a demonstration of making an effort towards relieving bankruptcy and yet one they knew would turn out unsuccessful.  Also Senators had the luxury of a six-year term while House representatives had to worry about re-election every two years.  Therefore, it should come as no surprise that it was the Senate that brought this bill to an end.  Bankruptcy would become an issue prevalent throughout the nineteenth century. Debate sparked about the question of whether the penitentiary system was the most practical solution to solve debt problems since they could not earn money behind bars.

The paper compared this new development much to the progress or rapid improvement' being made in the field of science.  This paper was to be in the spirit of the foreign theological journals and review' of Europe.  Most of the articles would be taken from places like Great Britain and other Protestant areas of Europe.  This was seen as an extensive and liberal plan suited to all Orthodox sects of the Protestant church'.    &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On one hand, there are many positives from this movement.  It shows an emphasis on religion in the daily lives of American citizens.  This magazine movement was during the latter stages of the Second Great Awakening, where new denominations like Methodists and Baptists were springing up.  This magazine could be seen as a counter to these new religions and events by the Protestants to instill their time tested methods.  It gave ministers (as the Telegraph said) knowledge and zeal' in which to preach.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movement also demonstrates the White Anglo-Saxon Protestant nature still present throughout America.  Catholicism was never talked about in these magazines; Catholics from Ireland were faced with severe persecution from their new American brethren when they emigrated.  These hostilities were deeply engrained with the political culture of the time.  The Masons were a secret society of many elites and politicians whose closed meetings and rituals angered many.  The Anti-Masons started as a movement against the secrecy and supposed superiority of the Masons but also boasted a strong anti-Catholic rhetoric as well.  These playing on people's fears of otherness' started in New England where many of these immigrants first arrived but eventually spread into places farther South.  Therefore, one can see the paradoxical nature of religion in America during this time period.  This religious magazine stands for all the good and all the bad that the role of religion played in American's lives during the nineteenth century."],"display_date":"September 6, 1827","search_date":"1827-09-06","locations":[{"id":1272,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":252,"title":"John C.

The ten regiment bill called for increased funding to raise and outfit an additional ten regiments to fight Santa Anna's troops in the Mexican American War.  Congress intended this funding to last until the end of the war or for five years, whichever came sooner.  This demonstrates the relative numerical weakness of the American forces in comparison to the Mexican forces.  Although fewer US soldiers existed than Mexican soldiers, the American's possessed superior training, supplies, and leadership, as evidenced by the victory at Buena Vista.&lt;br /&gt;Although Congress eventually passed the measure, Calhoun received an inordinate amount of criticism for his allegedly unpatriotic actions.  Many critics mark this unfortunate event as the start of the decline of Calhoun's bid for the presidency.  Calhoun misread American public opinion at this time and on this subject, and chose to speak in opposition to a bill his highly patriotic constituency supported.  He neglected to take into account the high levels of patriotism present throughout the country in regard to the Mexican American War.  Although the North and the South disagreed on many issues related to race and slavery during this time period, their patriotic views in support of the War converged.

The First one expired indifferently in 1811, and the Second Bank was chartered five years later, in 1816. This new edition was meant to be an independent bank, a specie paying bank, a stead and cautious, not a speculative bank. But, it had an inauspicious start, with a case sent before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1819. This case, <em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em>, upheld the legality of the Second Bank of the United States. The Bank would quickly gain allies and enemies, and the Bank War was underway. The National Republicans sided with it and convinced the Bank's president, Nicholas Biddle, to ask Congress for its immediate re-charter, even though it would not expire for another four years. The bill passed both houses of Congress and came to President Andrew Jackson's desk. He had despised it from the outset, questioning its constitutionality. But, vetoing the bill would damage his attempt at re-election. On July 10, 1832, Jackson threw caution to the wind and vetoed the bill, sending it back to Congress with his suggestions. Even though a Bank may be convenient for the government, Jackson made his decision because some of the powers and privileges possessed by the existing Bank are unauthorized by the Constitution, subversive of the rights of the States, and dangerous to the liberties of the people. But, by this decision, had he sacrificed his personal ease, and, as his enemies think, put in jeopardy his re-election. Many people did disagree with Jackson's decision. Congress had debated the issue for much of the year. Daniel Webster argued that a continuance of the Bank was very necessary to the country. However, the greater side of the argument seemed to be the President's. He felt it was his duty to the American people to uphold the Constitution, as he saw it, so that's what he did.

They debated a new tariff. This act would be a close relation to the Tariff of 1828, which was benevolently called the Tariff of Abominations. The new bill was a protectionist tariff, attempting to protect local producers from foreign competitors by setting the tariff on imported goods, or using some other method to reduce importation. But, it would not protect those domestic producers evenly. It benefited the textile industries in the North by forcing people to buy more domestic products. At the same time, it hindered southern cotton farmers, because the English textile industry couldn't buy as much cotton.With the debate raging, several southerners were wary of the coming effects. One wrote that the passage of this act could lead to resistance and the dissolution of this glorious Union. At the time, this seemed like a drastic opinion, but it proved somewhat prophetically. On July 14, 1832, Andrew Jackson approved the bill that had passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The duties were to go in effect on March 3, 1833. The debate did not end with the passage of the tariff. The southern states, as expected, were upset; and South Carolina in particular would take a harsh line against the government, hinting at their initiation of a later secession from the Union. South Carolina set off the Nullification Crisis by declaring the tariff null and void in the winter of 1832. Most states did not agree with South Carolina's drastic action, but the issue of states' rights was laid on the table for the first time.

Jackson easily succeeded, becoming the first president to hail from a state other than Virginia or Massachusetts. This distinction can help symbolize the expansion of the United States during his eight years in office. Originally, the Democrats had not anticipated Jackson's running for a second term, but it became necessary because of the growing feud between Secretary of State Martin Van Buren and Vice-President John C. Calhoun. Despite some objections, Van Buren would take over as Jackson's running mate on the presidential ticket. The campaign was defined by the Bank War, the question of the Second Bank of the United States. This issue dominated the election so much that one newspaper wrote, The people of this country are at last invoked to decide whether they will have for President, Andrew Jackson, or the Bank of the United States. But, there were some other intriguing aspects to the election. It was both the first to have its candidates elected through party conventions and the first to include a legitimate third party, the Anti-Masons. William Wirt ran for that party, whose influence resided mostly in New York and Ohio. The other main party, in opposition with the Democrats, was the National Republicans, who ran two candidates, Kentucky Senator Henry Clay and Virginia Governor John Floyd. However, the election would be forever connected to the Second Bank of the United States. The incumbent Jackson believed the bank was unconstitutional and had failed to create a united currency. Earlier in 1832, he had actually vetoed the bill for re-chartering the Bank. The National Republicans hoped this issue would steal the election, with Jackson's harsh line taking away from his popularity. However, the President won handily, 219 electoral votes to 49 for Clay, 11 for Floyd, and 7 for Wirt. Van Buren would follow Jackson to the presidency four years later, but he would have to deal with Jackson's bank stance, which caused the economic Panic of 1837."],"display_date":"November 2, 1832","search_date":"1832-11-02","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":331,"title":"Jefferson Davis on Indian Removal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-04-14","end_date":"1856-04-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Secretary of War Jefferson Davis wrote to Governor James S.

Traditionally, representatives received and tabled antislavery prayers, or buried them in committee; the gag rule, however, prevented even this formality from taking place.  This was not a spontaneous development, but a response to repeated petitions from John Quincy Adams and others to abolish slavery in Washington, D.C.  The argument adopted by Southerners was that the existence of slavery was enshrined in the Constitution, and that there could be no legitimate way to entertain petitions for abolition.  Furthermore, to eliminate slavery in the capital would establish a spot, within the slaveholding States, which would be a city of refuge for runaway slaves,' according to the Globe.  By passing such a law you introduce the enemy into the very bosom of these two States [Maryland and Virginia], and afford him every opportunity to produce a servile insurrection... When slavery ceases to exist, under the laws of Virginia and Maryland, then, and not till then, ought it to be abolished in the District of Columbia.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Northern representatives were furious at the Southerners' attempt to force the passage of this overtly sectional legislation.  They would not accept that anti-slavery petitions were unconstitutional.'  The gag rule was undoubtedly a radical idea.  That the Southerners would advocate such an extreme measure to preserve slavery demonstrates the explosiveness of the slavery issue over a decade before the Civil War.  Southern Whigs promoted the measure aggressively and without compromise so as to make Southern Democrats feel less comfortable about their New York-born presidential candidate, Martin Van Buren.  This tactic led to more emphatic declarations of loyalty to slavery on both sides.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gag rule passed, in large part, because Van Buren put forward a toned-down version of the legislation that was acceptable to more representatives.  His support of the gag rule was politically expedient, as it helped bolster his popularity in the South.  But the controversy helped to further polarize the pro- and anti-slavery camps.  At the same time southern Whigs were attempting to show that Van Buren's lukewarm support for the gag rule constituted a betrayal of slavery, northern Whigs condemned the Little Magician for supporting the measure at all.  This internal contradiction was of lesser importance in 1836, since the Whigs planned to nominate several different candidates for the presidency.

The state banks, facing little regulation, freely loaned paper money to virtually anyone who asked for it.  A flurry of land speculation and inflation followed.  To curtail these alarming trends, Jackson issued the Species Circular on July 11, 1836.  The executive order meant that federal land could no longer be bought with paper money, but only with gold or silver.  In Jackson's view, this hard' money was the only currency that could be trusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issued by Secretary of Treasury Levi Woodbury, the Circular to Receivers of Public Money, and to the Deposite Banks' was meant to eliminate the frauds, speculations, and monopolies' that were fueled by an excess of easy credit from state banks.  The circular predicted that such transactions would have an evil influence' on the public interest and the national currency, and sought to contain the problem by ordering all deposit banks to refuse bank credits and paper money as payment for public lands beginning the 15th of August, 1836.  Since it was speculation that Jackson sought to end, purchases of less than 320 acres would be payable with bank notes up until December 15 if the purchaser could demonstrate that he intended to settle the land.  However, everyone would have to pay with specie following that date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the limitations imposed by the circular took effect, land speculation abruptly slowed.  After December 15, settlers were not even allowed to pay with good' paper money.  An Arkansas native explained in the Louisville Daily Journal that this measure, far from aiding the average settler, caused great harm; people in essence had to use their notes to buy specie at a premium from the banks, and in turn use the gold or silver to buy land.  When land sales dropped off, it meant state governments, especially in the West, lost income.  At the same time, higher interest rates in England were beginning to lower the price of cotton.

As such, his victory in the 1836 election was by no means inevitable; he was widely considered a compromising Yankee who could not be trusted to respect states' rights or slavery.  Southern whites already felt greatly threatened by the perceived expansion of Abolitionism in the North, as evidenced by their efforts to pass the first gag rule' on anti-slavery measures.  Mississippi's Woodville Republican asked, If Abolition continues to advance with giant strides, what will it do with a Northern President when the Southern vote is unwanted?

South Carolinians held a special grudge, thanks to his strong nationalistic stance during the Nullification Crisis of 1832.  Thus in some places, it hurt Van Buren to be considered the legacy of Andrew Jackson.  His status as a Northerner, of course, dampened his popularity throughout the South.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the election was close, Van Buren carried seven Southern states: Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Missouri.  Whig candidates William Henry Harrison and Hugh White carried Kentucky, Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee and Georgia White took the latter two states while Independent Willie Person Mangum took South Carolina.  In stark contrast to the election of 1832, in which Jackson won 79% of the slaveholding states' Electoral votes, Van Buren came away with a mere 53%.  Of the popular vote, he earned an unconvincing 50.9%.  The Whig strategy to prevent a Van Buren majority by running three different candidates with strong regional appeal very nearly succeeded.

He was quoted by the Mobile Commercial Record as saying: The General Government, to which the great trust is confided, of preserving inviolate the relations created among the States by the constitution, is especially bound to avoid, in its own action, any thing that may disturb them.  I would, therefore, call the special attention of Congress to the subject, and respectfully suggest the propriety of passing such a law as will prohibit, under severe penalties, the circulation in the southern States, through the mail, of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection.'  This idea was almost universally supported by Southern legislators, but John C. Calhoun and a few others remained dubious.  Even though Calhoun was a staunch advocate of slavery, it looked like an infringement upon states rights for the federal government to decide which publications the post office would be allowed to transmit.  Calhoun's position, while seeming rather paradoxical on the surface, was actually quite logical: if Congress claimed the power to restrict antislavery mailings in 1836, what would stop it from censoring proslavery mailings a few years down the road?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heated debate over the bill took place in June of 1836.  After failing to pass on the third reading, a June 27 issue of the Mobile Commercial Record attacked Southern Whigs as being responsible for its defeat.  The vote would have been 24 in favor and 20 against, as opposed to the 25 to 19 vote that killed the bill.  This bill then, which has been deemed so essential to the tranquility if not to the very safety, of the South, was lost partly in consequence of the Whig opposition from the slave holding section; Whatever then of agitation or of panic, or of mischief may arise from this defeat, let those 5 Whig Senators from the slave holding States share the responsibility.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fear of Southerners was very real.  In the first half of the 1830s, hundreds of thousands of anti-slavery publications descended from the North, which both terrified and infuriated Southerners.  When South Carolina-born abolitionist Angelina Grimk? published her Appeal to the Christian Women of the South, the pamphlet was burned in Charleston and its author forbidden from visiting her native city ever again. Southern efforts to restrict the circulation of such materials, therefore, made sense.  Still, Senators Webster, Clay, Calhoun and other influential senators were not ready to stomach such censorship.  States' rights, used so often to defend slavery, in this case worked against it."],"display_date":"June 8, 1836","search_date":"1836-06-08","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":536,"title":"Congress passes the Surplus Revenue Act\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1836-06-23","end_date":"1836-06-23","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["With the expansion of the United States in the 1830s came an inevitable influx of money from purchases of public land.  According to a Treasury Department report issued on February 1, 1836, the surplus amounted to about 30,000,000.  In 1833 Congress had passed a bill to distribute the surplus among the states, with the support of Andrew Jackson.  But in 1836 the fate of the surplus became a point of contention between Democrats and Whigs.  Jackson began to assert that its distribution would be unconstitutional.  Meanwhile, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster strongly supported distributing the surplus, and succeeded in passing legislation to that end in the Senate.  The House, however, would not pass the bill in its current form, citing constitutional bounds.  Whigs, of course, clamored for the measure in order to support internal improvements.  Edward B. Dudley made it a major campaign issue in his run for governor in North Carolina.  Finally, the proposed legislation was modified to diffuse the surplus in the form of deposits to be repaid by the states. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On June 23, 1836 the measure passed as part of the Act to regulate the deposites of the public money.'  The handling of the surplus was addressed in Section 13, which read: And be it further enacted, That the money which shall be in the Treasury of the U. States; reserving the sum of five millions of dollars, shall be deposited with the several States, in proportion to their respective representation in the Senate and the House of Representatives.'  The state governments would vote to accept the deposits, and within a year of their receipt, state banks would have to redeem the notes in specie.  Section 14 provided for the transfer to take place in four installments throughout 1836.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The requirement that the U.S. government be repaid in specie proved problematic.  After states accepted their share of the surplus, often using it to fund internal improvements, they found they did not have the hard' money to back up inflated bank notes.  Much of the wealth generated by land sales in the West was artificial, and by the end of 1836 it was clear that the states would be unable to repay the federal government in specie.  This would lead them to suspend specie payments, precipitating the Panic of 1837."],"display_date":"June 23, 1836","search_date":"1836-06-23","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":568,"title":"Indians and Kansas-Nebraska\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1854-02-15","end_date":"1854-02-15","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On Capitol Hill, Sen.

The parties spent much of their energy courting the South.

Van Buren, running on a platform which tried to appeal to southern interests had many active supporters in the South, including former President Andrew Jackson.  The South, however, would not back him strongly during the campaign and election, despite his denunciation of abolition and his declaration of friendship with the South.'  Many voters associated Van Buren with the nationwide economic troubles of the Panic of 1837 and the devotion of the people to Van Buren's predecessor Andrew Jackson had waned over time. &lt;br /&gt;While the election campaign did involve discussion of various issues, sectional and otherwise, it was marked especially by widespread personal attacks and appeals to emotion.  Robert Gunderson, describing the campaign, wrote that generated as it was by hard times and political hatreds, the great commotion of 1840 was not subject to rational or intellectual restraints.'  Van Buren's Whig opponents in the newspapers characterized the Democratic Party as undemocratic and uninterested in the concerns of the common man.  One paper described the Democrats as the deluded followers, the paid vassals and the Praetorian bands of power.'  On the other side ranged the unbought and unterrified friends and advocates of civil freedom.'  Whig partisans also made as much as possible of Van Buren's supposed distance from the people he governed.  The fact that Harrison was a soldier, and had been defending women and children from the Indians while Van Buren had been making money for himself in politics was also emphasized by the Whigs.  Harrison was the honest and brave soldier, the common man's president who lived in a log cabin, the image of a purer republicanism going back to the Revolution.  The southern Whigs, who had initially voted for Henry Clay at the national convention, were happy with Harrison, a Virginia native and southern ally.'

Their letter to Congress was very condescending to the blacks who they were trying to help.  They noted that despite the fact that in Africa they had had access to large tracts of land, fertile soil, and other rich natural resources, they had made no progress in the refinements of civilization'.  They hoped that by re-colonizing them in Africa, they would be able to convert more people on that continent from their gross and abject superstitions' to Christianity.  Other groups had similar ideas.  The American Society for the Return of Negroes to Africa was founded in Richmond in 1817, with a stated mission that was nearly the same. ","Congress examined the proposal thoroughly.  They decided that any proposed colony would have to be far away from American soil to have the intended effect of separating free blacks from the enslaved blacks, and from the free whites, with whom they can never be equal.  The point of this separation was to diffuse any conflicts that might erupt should the free blacks get frustrated with the injustice and turn to violence.  So if the land must be far away, where would it be, and how would the government obtain it?  Great Britain already had a colony for free blacks in Sierra Leone.  The Congress discussed sending free American blacks to that colony, as well as creating a new colony just for American freedmen.  A new colony would require a rather large monetary contribution from the United States government for the land on which to build the colony, and food until they were able to establish their own farms, as well as military protection for a long time before they could set up their own stable government.

ACS members tended to be Southerners and although they claimed to have the interest of free blacks in mind, declaring, we must go to them in the true spirit of benevolence, and not give over until they arouse themselves and be men,' they were actually largely motivated by self-interest. The members of the Society feared that increasing population of free blacks would organize revolts an destabilize the United States and members who were northerners were concerned that free blacks in the North would be willing to work for less money and would thus lower the wages of white workers. Additionally, in promoting the removal of blacks from the United States and their colonization in Liberia, the ACS was angling for the beginning of what they hoped would become an American empire in Africa. At their 1853 meeting, their address asserted, the interior [of Africa] has never been penetrated in any manner calculated to throw open its treasures or reveal its wonders to the gaze of the world; colonization has planted a footstep on the western coast, and opened a gateway through which the vast recesses of the interior may be reached and revealed.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the American Colonization Society professed to be interested the welfare of blacks, it was essentially an organization based on racism the end of slavery did not change its ideological outlook. Typical of its time period, despite being anti-slavery, the ACS still believed that blacks were inherently inferior to whites and did not advocate social or political equality of the races. Its mission and goal place their own racist views and self-interest before those of blacks. Even though many blacks were reluctant to leave the United States and those who left for Liberia were often unhappy, the ACS published propaganda to counter those views and attract recruits.

He received much criticism and praise for his confrontation of abolition.  Whig politics at the time were very two-sided, having to span the boundary between free states and slave states.  His speech to congress in February of 1839 gave his views on abolitionists and their pursuit.&lt;br /&gt;He identified three classes of people opposed to slavery.  The first, and most harmless according to Clay, was the class opposed to slavery by sentiment or philanthropy.  This class, he asserted, disliked the institution but would not upset the union or their own lives for the cause of abolition.  The second class he named the abolitionists.  This group he felt believed that the right of petition had been violated by congress and were more adamant to their cause, yet no more wanted to cause disunion to the nation.  The third and most dangerous class was the ultra-abolitionists.  &lt;br /&gt;Clay said, with them [ultra-abolitionists] the rights of property are nothing, the deficiency of the powers of the General Government is nothing; the acknowledgment and incontestable powers of the States are nothing; civil war, a dissolution of the Union, and the overthrow of a Government in which are concentrated the fondest hopes of the civilized world, are nothing.'&lt;br /&gt;Also in his speech, Clay addresses a concern on British emancipation of the West Indies.  He says this is unfair as the planters in the West Indies are not represented in British Parliament.  Clay drew a parallel between the ultra-abolitionists and the British parliament as that neither are anywhere near the world they seek to govern and change.&lt;br /&gt;An important clarification made by Clay over the policies of democrats and Whigs was that neither party were abolitionists.  He contests the necessity of abolition in Washington D.C.  &lt;br /&gt;Clay ended with predictions for the future of slavery.  He predicted that slavery would endure for at least 50-100 years, and after that within 150-200 years few vestiges of the black race will remain among our posterity.'

In some cases, US explorers tried to live alongside Native-Americans who called the West their home, but hostility from both peoples often caused conflict.  Americans embraced the mindset that not only was it acceptable, but it was even their duty to organize and civilize the Indian tribes, whom they viewed as not, in fact, an independent people, nor ought they to be so considered' (Calhoun).  On January 15, 1820, Secretary of War J. C. Calhoun wrote to Speaker of the House Clay of the progress' that had been made thus far in this endeavor.  &lt;br /&gt;The widely held view of the Indians as savages' was distorted by embellished tales about their violent acts, such as an account of murders in The Clarion and Tennessee Gazette.  In this specific article, the editor actually points out the exaggerated, incorrect information previously reported regarding members of the Seminole tribe who killed and injured some Tennessee men.  The updated account corrects the previously barbarous portrayal of the Indians, but nevertheless these facts, describing how a jailor shot the Indian through the body;loaded his pistol a second time and shot him through the head,' coincide with the harsh attitude of Americans toward the Indian tribes.    &lt;br /&gt;In theory, the migration of Native-Americans west of the Mississippi River was voluntary, but leaders of tribes were usually pressured or forced into signing treaties with the United States government.  Popular thought was that it was, in Calhoun's words, impossible, with their [Native-Americans'] customs, that they should exist as independent communities in the midst of civilized society;and our opinion, not theirs, ought to prevail;in measures intended for their civilization and happiness.'  Congress made appropriations of ten thousand dollars annually to aid in advancing Indian societies in the US.  An additional emphasis of the efforts to conform the Native-Americans was establishing schools, and Calhoun mentioned the Cherokee as a relatively civilized people because they had already launched two successful schools.  Congress' message was that the Indian tribes must be brought gradually under our authority and laws, or they will insensibly waste away in vice and misery (Calhoun);' due to Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal policy of the 1830s, virtually all were controlled by the Americans, and eventually more than 100,000 Native-Americans migrated to the West."],"display_date":"January 15, 1820","search_date":"1820-01-15","locations":[{"id":1272,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1197,"title":"Charles Pinckney and George Tucker Speak Against the Missouri Compromise\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1820-02-14","end_date":"1820-02-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["South Carolina Governor and member of the House of Representatives, Charles Pinckney had been one of the youngest delegates of the Constitutional Convention in 1789.  Pinckney remained a controversial political figure, due in part to his support of slavery.  In 1820, he reacted to the attempts of some Northern congressmen to ban slavery from the Missouri Compromise.  An example of the Northern position was demonstrated by Senator Harrison Gray Otis of Massachusetts.  He tended to focus on the wording of the Constitution and literal interpretations of the provisions for establishment of new states.  Otis claimed it should not be debatable because, the earliest exercise of your authority over the domain ceded to the US was manifested in a solemn protest against the introduction of slavery into it (Raleigh).'  Many other Northerners took a softer line on the issue, hoping to compromise and restrict slavery incompletely. &lt;br /&gt;Virginian George Tucker spoke before the House of Representatives on February 25, and his stance on slavery in Missouri aligned with Pinckney's.  Tucker claimed that to restrict slavery would lead to skewed proportions of blacks and whites in the population, pushing whites to abandon territories and human labor to decline in value.  In the interest of preserving the Union, Tucker said that the government cannot possibly restrict slavery, and the North was confusing political and moral rules to justify calling slavery evil.  &lt;br /&gt;In a defense of the sectional interests of the nation he claimed to be embodied in the Constitution, Pinckney argued in return that the federal government could not take away the Southern way of life nor their valuable property.  He went as far to say that slaves could be happier continuing to live an existence they were used to.

Representatives from all over the nation had an opinion on the Missouri issue. &lt;br /&gt;In February, 1819, Representative Tallmadge introduced an amendment providing for a gradual end to slavery in Missouri, but this was quickly rejected.

Liberally interpreting his ambiguous instructions, Jackson led his troops deep into areas of Florida under Spanish control, capturing two Spanish forts. Because Florida held the potential of becoming a new slave state, southern congressmen eagerly backed Jackson's plans.  In addition to securing greater protection for American settlements, the mission helped to expose the vulnerability of Spanish rule in Florida. Monroe and his secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, used that vulnerability to pressure Spain into selling Florida to the United States, and after ratification of the Adams-Onis treaty outlining the conditions of the purchase and drawing territorial boundaries for the remaining Spanish holdings in North America, the U.S. government purchased Florida in February of 1821 for five million U.S. dollars, all of which was paid directly to U.S. citizens with claims against the Spanish government.

Though runaway slaves viewed Florida as a place to find freedom, slave traders considered Florida an ideal place of business.  Although in 1808 the U.S. passed laws prohibiting the importation of African slaves, because Florida was still under Spanish rule and in combination with its abundance of coastline, slave traders brought African slaves into Florida and then smuggled them into Georgia to be sold to plantation owners.  The Florida slave trade continued even after the United States took control of Florida from the Spanish in 1821.

His presidency encompassed what came to be called the Era of Good Feelings.'  The largest political crisis Monroe faced while in office came toward the end of his first term, when the question of slavery shrouding the entrance of Missouri to the Union threatened to disrupt the legislative balance between North and South. Congress was able to keep the peace by negotiating a compromise in which Massachusetts allowed its northernmost counties to apply for admission to the Union as the new free state of Maine, while Missouri was to be admitted as a slaveholding state. The compromise also called for the prohibition of slavery in the western territories of the Louisiana Purchase above the 36/30' line.  In his second inaugural address, domestic concerns pertained mostly to westward expansion and race relations amongst whites and Native-Americans; however, he made no mention of the expansion of slavery or his opinion on the issue.  His presidency encompassed what came to be called the Era of Good Feelings.' ","One of his lasting achievements was the Monroe Doctrine, which became a major tenet of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere.   As evidenced in his second inaugural address, domestic concerns of expansion overlapped with concerns of foreign interference upon that expansion, which directly influenced Monroe's administration in developing what became popularly referred to as the Monroe Doctrine, sent to congress in December of 1823.  With the words and advice of John Quincy Adams, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, the doctrine aimed to warn European powers against seeking further colonization in North America, the bulk of which rhetoric was directed toward Russia's growing interest in acquiring California from the dissolving Spanish colonial land holdings. The message contained, in the first place, a clause directed against Russia: The American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers. Against intervention there was even a stronger protest: With the governments who have declared their independence and maintained it; we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any other manner their destiny, by any European power, in any other light than as a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States. The international news of the doctrine caused an immediate rise in the funds of the States in European markets and all projects of European intervention were at once abandoned.  In 1824 Russia made a treaty agreeing to claim no territory south of 54 degrees 40', and not to disturb or restrain citizens of the United States in any part of the Pacific Ocean.'

Beginning with the Battle of Contreras on August 19 and the Battle of Churubusco on August 20, the Americans suffered losses of less than a hundred men while the Mexicans had a five to one casualty count.  In these two decisive battles, the Americans captured several generals, took nearly eight hundred prisoners and a large quantity of ammunition and artillery, shattering the Mexican Army of the North.  These defeats laid an open road to Mexico City for Scott, who was within three miles of the city.  Communications relied on letters from correspondents and returning troops, and it was not uncommon for news to break weeks after the battles.  The correspondent wrote from Tacubaya on August 26 that about the 15th inst.

The battle of Contreras had thus begun. The correspondent went on to cover the details of that day and the great difficulties that Generals Smith and Riley undertook into the early morning of the 20th.  General Shield's command later caused the Mexican soldiers to fly in every direction... and [making] most excellent time in a race across the fields.  After the battle had ceased, they took stock of their spoils, and in the fort there were captured 22 pieces of artillery, mostly large size, a great number of pack mules... upwards of 1,500 prisoners, and of the enemy's dead, over 700 lay on the fields.  The Battle of Churubusco was the Mexican's fallback position, after their defeat at Contreras, where they regrouped.  The enemy was more than three times our number, besides his advantage of artillery and position, added to this he was stimulated by the fact that it was the last effort of resistance he could make...[but] after the contest had lasted about two hours, our troops had got into such position as to close with them at the point of bayonet, which decided the affair in our favor."],"display_date":"September 17, 1847","search_date":"1847-09-17","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":1759,"title":"Washington Learns that the Armistice Called Between America and Mexico Fails\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1847-09-06","end_date":"1847-09-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the evening of the 20th, a white flag came out from the city, and on the morning of August 21st, the two enemies called upon an armistice for peace negotiations.

Nicholas Trist, an able, firm, and truly patriotic man' was the chief representative of the American government during the peace negotiations, and was later known for his work on the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, to formally conclude a pact of peace with the defeated Mexico.  Alcorta, the Minister of War of the United States of Mexico wrote that with a view to avoid the further shedding of blood between the two great republic of this continent; the President ; accepts the proposition to enter into armistice.'  After some further communications, the Union printed the authentic copy of the draft that Mr. Trist had (with full authority from President Polk) negotiated.

The sixteen knights, clad in armor and flashing colors, paraded the streets of Baltimore before the event. Long lines of fancy barouches followed the men and their steeds. A brass band heralded the knights as they passed the judges' stand. Each knight had a preliminary ride, but then the contest began. At stake were a gold watch with chain and a pair of Smith & Wesson's improved revolvers, but the Knight of Hereford rode to win the honor of crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty.","Sir Hereford clipped eight of nine rings during his first three runs, but the riding was particularly strong in this tournament. In the fourth tiebreaking round, the three rings were a mere inch and a quarter wide. As he prepared for his run, Hereford tried to act cavalierly: a knight's demeanor reflected on himself, his county, and his state. The trumpets [blew] out a challenge, the drummer [gave] a scientific trill, and the Chief Marshall called out in a booming voice, Charge Sir Knight The heralds echoed, and Sir Hereford thundered down the 90 yard track. In full gallop, he poised his lance. He neatly clipped the first two rings, but just missed the third. The crowd cheered as the trumpets blared triumphantly. A pair of pages escorted the Knight past the judges. The ladies in the stand waved their handkerchiefs. It was not enough to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, but the joust was still a success for any knight who conducted himself with gallant bearing, majestic mien, and superior horsemanship.","After the Civil War, Maryland's image had deteriorated in the eyes of many southerners, who accused Marylanders of being submissionists to northern oppression. The joust became popular in southern Maryland because many Marylanders wanted to redeem their identity as southerners. In the 1890s, the journalist Hanson Hiss claimed that jousting may be ... the only remaining relic of that romantic and picturesque age which has furnished the bards of centuries with themes. Marylanders linked this romantic image of jousting with their image of the Old South, and through jousting, they renewed their southern identity. Many Maryland knights chose names like the Knight of the Lost Cause, the Knight of the Sunny South, and the Knight in Grey to show their sympathy for the plight of the southern states. Jousts strengthened ties to the South in other ways as well: this joust in Baltimore was used to raise money for yellow fever sufferers in the South."],"display_date":"September 5, 1878","search_date":"1878-09-05","locations":[{"id":6035,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"PRINCE GEORGES, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":8,"tag":"Arts/Leisure"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2062,"title":"The Washington Globe, addressing different views","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1837-01-10","end_date":"1837-01-10","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["One article had the headline, ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN D.C., the other article, CASH FOR 400 NEGROES, the year was 1837. On January 10, 1837, the issues of slavery and abolition were weighing heavy on the minds of many Americans. The House of Representatives had accepted petitions and memorials on January 9. One of those was from Representative Adams of Massachusetts. His petition was signed by one hundred and fifty women, wives, and daughters. The women, his immediate constituents, were praying for the abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia. The petition was objected to by Representative Glascock. Adams was shocked by the objection; he did not expect any hostility to his petition. It was written in respectful terms, by women, mothers, and daughters. Congress had been decided previously that petitions of this kind would be received but disposed of afterwards. Adams felt that Glascock's objection violated the decision of the House as well as his constituent's freedom of speech. Adams argued that his petition was from persons of the greatest respectability and should be treated with dignity. The two men continued to debate the issue of petitions but ultimately, this was an issue of slavery, one man trying to keep an abolition petition from being recognized and another fighting for the right to petition.

Edward Pessen writes about this distinction in How Different from Each Other Were the Antebellum North and South? He describes the different regions as two distinctive civilizations, the basic similarities within each of which transcended its internal differences.

He spoke to unite the country and reflect the significance of freedom.  Independence Day was newly designated since the county had only recently gained independence from Great Britain.  Francis Scott Key was aware of the magnitude of this celebration.  He started his speech by stating, The spectacle of a happy people, rejoicing in the thankfulness before God and the world for the blessing of civil liberty, is no vain pageant.  Key went on to speak of the duty of those assembled.  He called it a high and holy duty, stating We have opened the records of time, and read that bright page that proclaimed to the world the solemn purpose of the fathers of our country, and the sacred pledge they gave us for its fulfillment.  The pledge has been redeemed, the purpose is accomplished, and we are here, in the rich possession of what valor has won, and wisdom has preserved for us.  Key addressed the crowd with the hope of reminding citizens, in a time of turmoil, of the purpose and sacrifices of the fathers of our country.  The possession was won and the wisdom preserved, now it is the duty of the citizens to carry on the honor and mission of a free land, he stated. ","Key told of a fear that many Americans at that time derived from a clash between state's power and the power of the national government.  He urged everyone to take hope and courage from the past.  He was able to proclaim with pride, This is my own, my native land.  He ended his oration with the question, Is our country less loved, as it becomes more worthy of our love?    Francis Scott Key used profound and powerful words on the Fourth of July, 1831, to remind the country what the founding fathers fought so hard to obtain, freedom.  ","The oration given by Francis Scott Key was an optimistic attempt to rally citizens on the glorious celebration of the nation's birth.  However, the country was already divided over the issue of slavery.  Key was unaware of the events that would unfold in the remainder of 1831. Nat Turner's infamous rebellion was initially planned for the same day, July 4 1831, but was delayed.  In this same year, William Lloyd Garrison's newspaper, <em>The Liberator,</em> would begin contributing to polarization.  Key described the country as deserving love.  However, at this time the nation was divided.  Donald, Baker, and Holt describe the development of Southernism.  In their book, <em>The Civil War and Reconstruction</em>, they quote Alexander Stephens as saying, The South is my home- my fatherland.  Southerners held their region in the highest esteem and gave it their loyalty first and foremost.  This division, that Key struggled to overcome in his 1831 speech pointed towards the Civil War.

Therefore, this trip to Washington was a thrill for him. After registering at the Gadsby's Hotel in Washington, Rawlins journeyed down to the capital.  He entered the Rotunda, immediately drawn to four large hanging pictures.  The subjects included, The Declaration of Independence, The Surrender of Cornwallis (1781), The Resignation of Washington (1783), and the Surrender of Burgoyne (1772).  These were so powerful that Rawlins reflected in his journal, They bear such internal evidence of truth that the beholder is almost constrained to forget everything else in looking at them.  A bronze statute of Jefferson, seems to cause a thrill of admiration.  Next he ventured into the Senate.  Again the details of the splendid room stuck his attention.

The Declaration was kept in a mahogany case in the State Department.  Already, some of the signatures were almost illegible due to fading.  The parchment bore evidence of being rolled up tightly.  Viewing documents of such significance sent a chill through Mr. Rawlins body. After viewing these historic documents he ventured to the John Quincy Adams' house, there he presented a letter from Mr. Cranch.  It was shocking how old Adams looked, his head almost entirely bald.  The little hair he did possess was silvery in color.  Afraid of staying too long, Rawlins quickly left.  He continued his day with a visit to the residence of Henry Clay, again to deliver a letter.  This visit delighted Rawlins, as Clay was dignified yet cordial.  His smile was peculiarly placid. Clay was tall and slender, with thin grey hair, small eyes, and a wide mouth, making him appear to possess a constant smile.  As if visiting Adams and Clay was not enough for one day, Rawlins also met with John Calhoun in the Senate.  He ended this day of activity with an evening of feasting at Judge Cranch's.

Henry Clay was John Quincy Adam's Secretary of State during his tenure as President.  As President, Adams envisioned a strong central government.  This only worsened tensions with the South.

Ann was his pride and joy, and of all his children she was his greatest comfort. She was frank, gay, and warm hearted. Ann married a very rich man and lived on a plantation adjourning Clay's.

He was the founder of the Whig Party, in opposition of Andrew Jackson. Kevin Hardwick and Warren Hofstra describe Clay in their book, New Histories of the Old Dominion, Virginia Reconsidered, as a man who brought to the political stage the very qualities women did on the domestic one- moral virtue, love of harmony, and the willingness to compromise. They go on to say that women were endeared to him. Perhaps this affection, passion, and love of harmony are in part a reaction the great loss of his dear Ann.

He had always desired to see the city. The city was the object of greatest curiosity, fascinating the Bishop with its rich history. He stood in awe before a portrait of George Washington. The Declaration of Independence proved to be a most impressive scene, the picture fills every American heart with American feelings and memory carries him back to the time when in solemn conclave this noble band proclaimed to the world 'Liberty or Death. One could look at the Declaration for a long time and see new beauty in it each moment. Bishop Whipple was swept away in the beauty of the capital. ","However, some sights in Washington caused the New York native to grow frustrated with the current political situation. The House of Representatives particularly disturbed him. The charm of honor is lost, and these men having high sounding titles are not only men in form, but less than men in mind in many cases. Never have I seen as large a body of men who were called great men who came as far short from deserving the title. Such a lack of dignity, such a lack of courtesy, of politeness, of common decency can seldom be seen in a body of men who are law makers. He continued to rant that the law makers were actually the law breakers. Bishop Whipple was so disgusted with the Congress that he described them as beasts. Despite the beauty of the Capital, he left discouraged. There are very few men of fine talent in the House and when you leave the House and see the noble, calm, and kind faces exhibited in Trumbull's picture of the first Congress you feel sad at the difference. Despite his shame with the House, he was proud of the Senate and spoke of the joy he felt upon seeing John Q. Adams. As opposed to the beasts of the House, he described the Senators as men with mind and character. He was happy and proud to see such men ruling over the country. ","Bishop is extreme in his hate for the House and love for the Senate. He was obviously very interested in the politics of the polarized and divided country. In the introduction to his diary, Whipple calls himself a rational abolitionist. In 1844, the Abolitionist's movement was very strong in the North. This made the divide between North and South even more pronounced. Stanley Harrold writes in his book, <em>The Abolitionists and the South, 1831-1861</em>, about the growing white and black abolitionist's movement during this time. Garrisonians were fighting for the freedom of enslaved blacks across the South. Bishop was originally from the North and agreed with the Garrisonians. He was one of the many men joining forces with the movement that would continue to escalade during the Civil War."],"display_date":"April 30, 1844","search_date":"1844-04-30","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2070,"title":"The Wonderful Invention\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1844-05-01","end_date":"1844-05-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On his first and only visit to Washington, Bishop Whipple saw many new and exciting things. He marveled at the beauty of the city and was inspired by the men who fought to establish both the great nation. However, on the afternoon of May 1, 1844, another new and exciting sight fascinated Whipple. The wonder of wonders was Professor Morse's electrical telegraph. Through the electrical telegraph, information was transmitted with almost the rapidity of thought. Railroad cars left with information of a nomination, for example, at the same time as the telegraph. However, the news transported via the telegraph was received one hour and a half before the cars arrived. The machine was simple and plain. Professor Morse had been working on it for 12 years. He gave Bishop Whipple a specimen of the writing as well as an explanation of the work. He was also able to hold communication with the man at the other end of the route. Bishop Whipple said he would never again doubt the extent of man's inventive powers. Wonderful, it is just wonderful He wrote of his time in Washington, There is much to please the eye, much novel and curious to investigate, and while I live I shall ever remember with pleasure my visit to Washington.","The invention of the telegraph, which so amazed Bishop Whipple, was a development that transformed the nation from in the 1800s. According to Tomas Nonnenmacher, writing in <em>The Journal of Economic History</em>, the telegraph industry began as a single monopoly patent and grew into a national monopoly. Nonnenmacher pointed out the significance of the telegraph in the development of technology: prior to the telegraph people relied on the Pony Express, homing pigeons, and the railroads. The invention spurred growth in many markets across the country, reducing information costs between firms and making news quickly transmittable over long distances.

Brown knew he needed to convey to the statesmen gathered that the division of Florida territory into east and west partitions, and the prolonging of the territorial phase therein, was both inadmissible and undemocratic. Brown, speaking for the Committee on the Territories, implored the House to strike down Bill H.R. No. 431. He began by appealing to the American ideal of self-government, a tactic that should carried some weight in front of a Congress who still vividly remembered the American Revolution. By 1844, the territorial-government phase in Florida had dragged on for 23 years. As such, its citizens had no formal political rights in Washington outside of a single delegate. Self-government was the maxim of America...that high privilege, the right of all men; Florida could no longer be denied participation while being subject to the supreme and despotic rule of those in Washington. Brown sounded much like Thomas Paine that day, and everyone in the room could relate to his words.","Brown then moved to describe the people of Florida as freedmen whose bosoms...heave with all the same impulses of liberty which mark the character of their fellow citizens. To such a population, the 23 years of absolute dependence had been degrading and injurious. The substance of his argument then became clear: Florida's entrance into the Union would serve mutual interests by relieving the federal government of the responsibility, expense, and trouble of maintaining the territory, while Florida would finally obtain formal political rights. In addition, the expedited admission of Florida would coincide with that of Iowa, maintaining the equilibrium of free and slave states. Brown concluded by again asking Congress to throw out Bill No. 431.","A.V. Brown's speech highlighted several divisive issues. The idea of a separate East and West Florida divided Floridians throughout the territorial phase. Not only was there physical and psychological separation between the two areas due to Florida's vast size, but divisionists argued that the cost of running a single state would be too high. They argued to delay the state-forming process, let the population increase, and then divide into two smaller territories. Unionists argued for Home rule, autonomy, and the benefits, such as education grants, that statehood would bring. David Levy Yulee, the most influential figure in Florida's antebellum history, backed the unionists and advocated for a United Florida. He served from 1841 to 1845 as the territorial delegate to Congress, leading Florida to statehood, and was subsequently elected as the first Jewish senator in U.S. history.","The entrance of Florida as a slave state, to balance the Union, was the substantive crux of the positions of Brown and Levy. Slave labor was essential to Florida's economic development; planters had poured in from the lower South after Spanish cession through the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1821 to establish cotton plantations in middle and western Florida, around Tallahassee. Just as with Maine, Missouri, and other territories admitted during the period, politicians sought to maintain a tenuous balance of power. Admission of Florida became more attractive as the application for statehood of a free territory, Iowa, appeared on the horizon and came up in 1846. Less than a year after Brown's speech, on March 3, 1845, Florida became the twenty seventh state of the Union."],"display_date":"June 17, 1844","search_date":"1844-06-17","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2798,"title":"Jackson&#39;s Support for Indian Removal\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1830-12-08","end_date":"1830-12-08","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["President Andrew Jackson fought bravely against the Indians in numerous wars before becoming president in 1828. President Jackson was a strong opponent of Indian tribes. On May 28, 1830, President Jackson signed into law the Indian Removal Act. Congress passed the treaty in order to relocate the Indian tribes living east of the Mississippi River to lands in the west. Although, the act did not order the removal of the Indians, it did allow the president to negotiate land by exchanging treaties with tribes living within the boundaries of the states. ","President Jackson's first annual message to Congress in December gave him great pleasure to announce to Congress that the Removal Act was approaching to a happy consummation. He reported that two important tribes had accepted the provisions made for their removal at the last session of Congress and believed that the two tribe's examples would induce the remaining tribes to seek the same obvious advantages. President Jackson was supportive of a speedy removal and he felt it was important not only to the United States but to the Indians themselves. According to Jackson, moving the Indians would separate them from immediate contact with settlements of whites, free them from the power of the States, enable them to pursue happiness in their own way, and would stop their slow extinction. ","President Jackson told Congress that he felt the act was fair because a fair exchange of land was being granted and because the General Government proposed to pay the whole expense of the red man's removal and settlement... In his closing statements, President Jackson hoped that all good citizens, especially those that felt the Indians were being oppressed by the subjection to the laws of the States, would unite, help influence and enforce a speedy removal for the better of both the red men and white Americans. The Removal Act would benefit white settlement and allow the country's citizens to inhabit up and down the eastern coast. This included certain southern states such as Georgia and Florida, which was recently acquired from the Spanish. Most white Americans supported the Removal Act, especially southerners who were eager to expand southward. Expansion south would be good for the country and the future of the country's economy with the later introduction of cotton production in the south. Yet, there was still significant opposition to the act. Some of the people that opposed the act were Christian missionaries. Even though there was opposition to Jackson's view of the Removal Act, those who were opposed were not able to stop Jackson and the nation from removing the Indians as fast as possible.

The late Townsend caused uproar in the county with his proposal being that all of his slaves were liberated upon his death, about 50 in total, and each deserved sections of land and other forms of property. Townsend also mandated that if any lawful objection arose, the slaves belonged to his nephew, Jeremiah Townsend, who was supposed to accept them for hire for one cent per year.

Groesbeck of Ohio took the floor to argue in support of the recent capture of filibusterer, General William Walker. The speech served as a rebuttal to objections raised by Representative Keitt of South Carolina and Representative Stephens of Georgia.","Representatives Keitt and Stephens argued that the seizure of Walker and his company from Nicaragua was illegal. For these two Congressmen, the United States had violated jurisdiction zones established by the “law of 1818” during Walker’s seizure. In defense of the US forces that captured Walker, Representative Groesbeck focused his speech on the theme that “the sea is no sanctuary for crime.” He stated that since Walker and his company were American citizens, “the duty of this Government [was] to keep the peace with all other nations; and to break up combinations of its own citizens who have actually started upon expeditions to violate the peace of other nations.” This being said, Representative Groesbeck saw nothing wrong with the actions the US government took to apprehend Walker and his company: “He [the commander of the US Navy] had the right to cross the line of the marine league from our shore; he had the right to pursue this expedition, which was being <em>carried on</em> across the Gulf; and he had the right, with the consent of Nicaragua, to enter within her jurisdiction.” Simply put, General Walker and his company were rightfully and legally seized and detained by the US government.","William Walker was a man of many skills. Despite his medical education and experience in journalism, he is best remembered as a filibusterer. Walker’s first filibuster occurred in 1853 in Sonora, Mexico. The success of this filibuster prompted Walker to pursue Nicaragua a few years later.","The US Department of State acknowledges that filibustering-the militaristic actions of private citizens in a foreign land-was common in the years between the Mexican War and Civil War. Like Walker, most filibusterers were southern men hoping that the acquisition of new territory in Central America would ensure the expansion and survival of slavery. For this reason, as historian James McPherson wrote, “While much of the northern press condemned Walker as a pirate, southern newspapers praised him as engaged in a ‘noble cause.’” These conflicting perceptions of Walker’s actions created fierce tension in Washington.","When Walker and his company returned to Nicaragua in 1857, the US reacted. Historian Amy Greenberg wrote on this matter, “In May 1857 Walker surrendered to the commander of the United States navy after falling to the combined pressure of a Central American army, Great Britain, and threatened American shipping interest.” As evident in Rep. Groesbeck’s speech, there was a lot of controversy concerning Walker’s seizure. This contention between southerners and northerners in regards to the US actions was, in the end, pointless.

As Congress waited for his speech, Henderson prepared to explain why the addition of Texas would be in the best interest of the country, as well as his constituents. The motives Henderson gave Congress in support of his opinion were very diplomatic in nature, and effectively called on the language of the Constitution.

Merk said that northern abolitionists, such as Benjamin Lundy, maintained that the entire process of migration, defiance of Mexican law, and revolution, had been a southern conspiracy to extend the area of slavery.

Henderson wanted to represent his constituents well, which meant that he should help them achieve more land to expand and develop into farms and plantations.

The Homestead Act eventually gave approximately 160 acres of undeveloped land in the west to any man of twenty one years, on the condition that he must build a house of 12 x 14 feet and live on the property for five years.  This would not be a problem for people to fulfill who are coming looking for a life on the frontier.  Albert G. Brown, when he gave this speech on April 28, 1852, was a Senator from the state of Mississippi.  He was a democrat, and believed that the frontier should be settled.  As the Homestead Bill came to the forefront of the Congressional debate, he felt it was his duty as a Mississippian and a Senator to stand up for what he thought would benefit his constituents, the South, and the country as a whole.  People were afraid that this would bring in an influx of foreign immigrants, but he put that opinion down, and turned it around to seem as a beneficial piece of legislation for the North, which immigrants already overpopulate.  Brown though that the Homestead Bill would eventually spread out the immigration from foreign countries, and alleviate the immigration problems in the North.  "," Brown was representing his constituency through supporting the Homestead Bill, because his people of Mississippi would be some of the first to take advantage of free, fertile land in the west.  Fred Shannon studied this bill, which was not ratified until 1862, and marked a contrast between what Brown claimed, and what the rest of the South believed would happen if the legislation passed.  Shannon states that southerners are those persons who are supposed to have been the most bitter against the homestead legislation.  The rest of the South took the opposite view on the merits of increased immigration into the South, and needless to say, theywere not very cordial. The South, in the 1850s, was a place of white social dominance and plantation slavery. The white dominance spanned across race lines and continued to affect the relations with different nationalities.  The stubbornness of the South to realize the massive amount of land that was at their disposal led to the reluctancy of the lawmakers to ratify the bill."],"display_date":"April 28, 1852","search_date":"1852-04-28","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3552,"title":"Support for Jackson \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1819-01-01","end_date":"1819-02-28","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In March of 1818, Jackson invaded Florida, brought down Fort Negro, and seized parts of Florida, which was under Spanish control. Jackson's actions caused international repercussions. Spain protested the invasion, which led to the halt of negotiations to buy Spanish Florida. The invasion, also, led Britain to protest the execution of two of its subjects who had never entered the United State territory, and led Congress to hold hearings to discuss the irregularities of the Ambrister and Arbuthnot trials and to decide what to do about Jackson's actions. ","Representative Cobb of Georgia introduced resolutions condemning Jackson's actions in the House in 1819. Shortly after, Representative Tallmadge gave a speech, as well, on the Seminole War, where he showed his support for Jackson's actions and his opposition for the resolutions.

News of the debate on the resolutions and the outcome in the House of Representatives were in newspapers all over the United States letting everyone know, even the settlers in Florida, what they would anticipate. In addition, the fact that the resolutions failed to pass was important to history because it meant that tensions between the Seminoles and white settlers would only increase. Shortly after, the Indians began to retaliate and attack white settlers in Florida and Georgia. ","If the resolutions would have gained more support and passed, it was possible that the continuation of the Seminole Wars might not have occurred or would have occurred at a different time changing history, as we know it.

The years leading up to the affair were full of bargains, compromises, and violent encounters that transcended both racial and societal lines. On January 7, 1847, many newspapers distributed articles focusing on the ongoing war with Mexico. The dispute increased social and political unrest back east, and the decision of whether or not to allow slavery in the new lands previously occupied by Mexicans was at or near the top of the agenda. In an attempt to bolster and create a harmonious atmosphere in the nation's capital, the news publication The National Era ran an article proclaiming the importance of order and abstinence from violence in the District at such a perilous time. The most threatening concern expressed in the article was the importance of keeping the city running smoothly and peacefully, despite widespread domestic turmoil. The citizens of Washington felt this was vital because visiting foreign diplomats saw Washington as a picture or representation of the nation as a whole. Therefore, it was absolutely necessary to maintain a peaceful atmosphere in the city in order to secure positive foreign relations. After all, if anarchy existed in the city of Washington, then visiting foreign diplomats would be less inclined to trade or do business and would also leave with a poor impression of Americans and republican liberty in general. The gradual emergence of a world economy built upon trading was fundamental to the existence of both the North and South. This futuristic ideal economy requires, at the very least, peaceful conditions back in Washington so as to promote the kind of city-on-a-hill atmosphere that will attract foreign support. Richmond for example, saw an increase in urban population and a rise of new professions such as prostitution - which could yield a livable economic income at the time. After further examination, Joshua Rothman pointed out that resources were scarce and consequently, prostitutes constantly assaulted one another in public. If upon arrival foreign ambassadors or diplomats were greeted with a scene similar to the picture Rothman paints of Richmond, then their view of Washington would no doubt be negative, and therefore detrimental to the reputation, accountability, and future existence of the nation as a whole."],"display_date":"January 7, 1847","search_date":"1847-01-07","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3700,"title":"Twelve Years a Slave\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-02","end_date":"1853-01-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The memoirs of Solomon Northup vividly portrayed the descent of a former New York freedman into the harsh system of slavery faced by many African Americans living in the antebellum South. Few people probably recalled January 4, 1853, as a significant day in the history of the United States. However, on this day a very important meeting was being held in the small town of Marksville, Louisiana, and the fate of one man was changed forever. For this day marked the release of Solomon Northup from years of involuntary servitude after being deceived and forced into slavery against his will while visiting the city of Washington.Solomon was not the first slave, nor the last, to be set free from the chains of slavery. What makes his story stand out, however, is that he was not born a slave; he had worked various jobs throughout his lifetime, always looking to better the lives of his family. It was this desire to provide a better life for his family that led him to take a job offer that would forever change his life. While working in Saratoga Springs, New York, Solomon met two white men named Merrill Brown and Abram Hamilton who offered Northup a job providing musical entertainment for the circus. They said the circus was currently located in Washington, D.C., but would be traveling back North; Solomon agreed to take the trip.  Although free blacks traveling through areas where slavery was legal could acquire papers as proof of freedom, documentation was not always a guarantee of safety.  In Washington, Solomon was captured at a bar, presumably drugged, and woke up a few days later, ill from his poisoning, alone in the darkness of a basement in chains.  He had been robbed of his documents, money, and ultimately his freedom. Slave traders used a variety of tactics to illegally enslave freedmen, whether by force or physical violence, or, as in Solomon's case, by tricking, drugging, and other deceitful means.  At the threat of death, Solomon was silenced and shipped to Louisiana where he spent twelve years doing hard labor. In the novel Soul by Soul by Walter Johnson, he reiterates this harsh reality by stating that, none of these stolen people could have been sold if their histories were known, so they were sold with new ones. Although Mr. Northup sought to bring his captors to trial, they were never prosecuted and he mysteriously disappeared. To this day, Solomon's burial site has not been identified and it is still not known whether or not he was killed, re-captured, or died of natural causes. Walter Johnson best describes Northup's experience: despite the fact that he was able to achieve his restitution of freedom, he met the same end as many African Americans from that time; unexplainable, undocumented, and seemingly unnoticed disappearance."],"display_date":"January 2, 1853 - January 4, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3701,"title":"Gold deposits within Washington\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-03-05","end_date":"1859-03-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gold What could be more illustrious to read about during the mid nineteenth century than gold? On March 9, 1859, the Farmer's Cabinet published an article briefly summarizing one man's visit to the sub-treasury gold reserve in Washington, D.C. In a seemingly obvious attempt to bolster national comfort and ease economic pessimist, the lure of gold and more importantly a surplus of gold available in the sub-treasury gave the reader the feeling that though times seemed bleak, there was enough gold in this town to support half the world for life. The Panic of 1857 was a sudden downturn in the economy caused by, among other things, the decision of British investors to remove funds from U.S. banks for fear of economic instability. Beginning in 1848, the California Gold Rush ushered in millions of dollars in gold to many different treasury deposits such as the one located in the city of Washington. Many news outlets following the Panic chose to run stories such as this one to bring about a feeling of national economic security that would ease investors.The author described the sight of a piece of golden cheese worth nearly a quarter of a million U.S. dollars. As the Gold Rush progressed and the rich got richer, local banks and gold dealers issued banknotes in exchange for gold, private mints created private gold coins, and gold was sent by California banks to U.S. national banks in exchange for national paper currency to be used in the thriving California financial system.   Herbert Brayer even went as far as to say that overnight California became the Mecca of America, shipping assets and wealth domestically as well as across the globe. The ramifications of the discovery of gold in California were incredible: towns and cities were chartered, a state constitutional convention was convened, a state constitution written, elections held, and representatives were sent to Washington, D.C. to negotiate the admission of California as a state.The brightest light shed from the account is that which is seen at the Sub-Treasury in Washington where the author describes the everything-proof bunker, which is filled on all sides with Solid Bars of gold and silver. The author concludes his journey in a very calculating way, forcing the reader to step forth from this cave of wealth and back to the real world. Though the sight of the illustrious gold was gone, the lasting vision of available security and wealth illustrated by the author and Brayer's assessment remains engraved in the readers mind forever. One could even make the argument that booster articles like this one were the reason for the sharp economic recovery that followed the Panic of 1857."],"display_date":"March 5, 1859","search_date":"1859-03-05","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3702,"title":"Prospectus for 1850\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-12-13","end_date":"1849-12-13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["During the antebellum period newspapers frequently published editorials that prophesized the events to come. These special prospectuses gave readers a direct insight into the minds of the editors by outlining their principles and beliefs. The National Era was a weekly abolitionist newspaper and the editor of the paper, Mr. Bailey, was interested in publishing literary ideas as well as developments and changes taking place during this period of history.Many of these prophecies did indeed come true as illustrated by one of Mr. Bailey's arguments, which essentially stated that federal legislation ought to be amended so as to place a limit on the President's time in office. The ratifications of the twenty-second amendment ratified on February 27, 1951, provided that, No person shall be elected to the office of President of the United States more than twice. Therefore, Bailey's prediction proved to be valid, despite being a hundred years overdue. In a way, many of Bailey's predictions proved to be more valid than the speculations from Edward Bellamy's famous work Looking backward: 2000-1887. For example, Bellamy predicts cheaper costs for education in the years to come for public schools, when in fact tuition rates and student debts have been gradually increasing over time. Though many of the penny press' so called prospectuses did shed some insight on the future to come, they also had an ambivalent side with predictions so vague that they easily could have some aspects of truth.

Sandford, Chief Justice Roger Taney delivered the opinion of the court, concluding that people of African decent, whether or not they were bound by slavery or free, could never become citizens of the United States and furthermore, that Congress had no right to create or administer territories. It was also the opinion of the Court that the Constitution could be interpreted to say that Congress shall make no law depriving a man of his property, just as it states that Congress shall make no law in a territory respecting the establishment of religion or abridging the freedom of speech or press. In an article published on March 12, 1857, The National Era ran an explanatory article breaking down the case and illustrating its ramifications.The article pointed out that, with the Dred Scott ruling, an African American could never become a citizen of the United States. More importantly, if the African American in question was already free, then that person was now extremely vulnerable. If he or she were the victim of the ever-increasing practice of kidnapping free blacks and selling them back into slavery as with Solomon Northup, a freeborn person of color, then that person would have no means to pursue any kind of defense in their name. Though it was certainly not the only account of its kind, Northup's story began in New York where he was lured with tales of lucrative labor opportunities to Washington, D.C. There, he was drugged, threatened with death if he told anyone the truth about his true identity, and put on a boat bound for New Orleans where he would work as a slave for almost twelve years. Upon reviewing Northup's memoirs, Walter Johnson concluded Northup's account centered on a single question: who can be trusted? The author of the article would obviously agree with Johnson's assessment of Northup's dilemma: in a world where one man can own another man and have this action protected by the rights of property, who can be trusted?"],"display_date":"March 12, 1857","search_date":"1857-03-12","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":14,"tag":"Church/Religious-Activity"},{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":3705,"title":"Washington Journalists\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1855-01-01","end_date":"1855-01-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["With political and social temperatures running high in the winter of 1855, many journalists turned to debates concerning the acquisition of new lands, but this time outside of the modern day contiguous United States. Many rumors circulated about secret deals with foreign countries in exchange for economic and Republican support. One particular rumor published in an article from the Farmer's Cabinet concerned the possibility of a United States acquisition of all Nicaraguan lands in exchange for help establishing a firm and stable government. The authors pre-disposition against the British was quite apparent as the author went so far as to blame them for creating a treaty with Nicaragua to debunk the United States' plans for expansion into Latin America. This geopolitical chess game is not an unfamiliar scene in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. There were many occasions when it was rumored that Washington had already worked out plans with a foreign nation only to discover later that such a possibility could never exist. Only a few weeks after this article was published, the Panama Railway opened, becoming the first railway to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The influence of articles like the one from the Farmer's Cabinet helped to keep Washington in check. Furthermore, without discussion of the possibilities of expanding the national boundaries, it would be nearly impossible for a democratic government to get enough sources of information to make a clear and rational decision on the proper course of action. One cannot ignore the fact that at this time there was no guarantee of journalistic integrity.

He expressed his disgust for the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and its architect, Nicholas Trist. This letter comes near the end of Webster's career, and the letter revealed that fatigue from a long career in politics had begun to set in. Though he was clearly disgusted over imperialist actions taken by the United States in the West, which upset the delicate balance between free and slave states, his will and conviction appeared to be weakening.Merely six days later, the Senate ratified the treaty and America gained five hundred twenty-five thousand square miles of territory at a net cost of just under twenty million U.S. dollars. Daniel Webster had every right to be skeptical of the suspicious circumstances that surrounded the acquisition of the formerly Mexican lands. Trist negotiated the treaty without President Polk's prior consent, but Polk later agreed to the treaty and sent it to Congress to be ratified. Finally, in May of 1848, Mexican officials agreed to the terms, and the war was officially over. Richard Winders, a historian and former Curator for the Alamo, even went as far as to make the point that the United States' War with Mexico doomed the two great parties of the era by forcing their associates to take sides on the issue of slavery in newly acquired territories and indirectly on the future of the institution of slavery itself. In hindsight, Webster's fear of instability stemming from the new lands was correct, but at the time, the majority of Congress disagreed and Webster settled for peace, despite his unwavering certainty that it would be short lived.

This person was no established politician providing aid for victims of the Irish Potato Famine; instead, he was a small five-year-old boy named Joseph Klemm. When Joseph's mother read him one disturbing account from Ireland, his first instinct was to run and get his moneybox. After returning with it, Joseph informed his mom that he was going to carry his money to the man in charge of collecting donations to send to damaged families in Ireland so that his money could be used to feed and clothe the little boys in Ireland. The story of little Joseph is priceless, despite its obvious intention of boosting public awareness and aid to the devastated country. The boy took all of his savings, one hundred and three cents, and gave it all away with the best intentions. The author described in detail Joseph's sparkling eyes, claiming that they showed the workings of a truly generous heart. The author of the article felt that this story was an important account to convey to the public, declaring that such acts deserve to be noticed and commended. He also observed another little boy being entertained by the same story, read by his father just like little Joseph, the boy asked if he too could give his money away to help those in foreign lands.Though relief aid was vital and absolutely necessary for reconstructing the Irish economy, there were numerous disadvantageous circumstances that arose, even with massive amounts of foreign funds pouring in. L. P. Curtis' incumbered wealth illustrates some of these problems. Curtis states that both landlords and tenants depended on an elaborate and secretive system of short and long-term goals. Furthermore, in the post famine period, after the rural economy had become completely monetized, virtually every tenant farmer owed money to someone at one time or another. Despite these shortcomings, it was still acceptable to feel the way Joseph and the other little boy did during such a crisis. After all, it was benevolent acts like these that built up America's character in the eyes of nations worldwide.

The sixteen knights, clad in armor and flashing colors, paraded the streets of Baltimore before the event. Long lines of fancy barouches followed the men and their steeds. A brass band heralded the knights as they passed the judges' stand. Each knight had a preliminary ride, but then the contest began. At stake were a gold watch with chain and a pair of Smith & Wesson's improved revolvers, but the Knight of Hereford rode to win the honor of crowning the Queen of Love and Beauty.","Sir Hereford clipped eight of nine rings during his first three runs, but the riding was particularly strong in this tournament. In the fourth tiebreaking round, the three rings were a mere inch and a quarter wide. As he prepared for his run, Hereford tried to act cavalierly: a knight's demeanor reflected on himself, his county, and his state. The trumpets [blew] out a challenge, the drummer [gave] a scientific trill, and the Chief Marshall called out in a booming voice, Charge Sir Knight The heralds echoed, and Sir Hereford thundered down the 90 yard track. In full gallop, he poised his lance. He neatly clipped the first two rings, but just missed the third. The crowd cheered as the trumpets blared triumphantly. A pair of pages escorted the Knight past the judges. The ladies in the stand waved their handkerchiefs. It was not enough to crown the Queen of Love and Beauty, but the joust was still a success for any knight who conducted himself with gallant bearing, majestic mien, and superior horsemanship.","After the Civil War, Maryland's image had deteriorated in the eyes of many southerners, who accused Marylanders of being submissionists to northern oppression. The joust became popular in southern Maryland because many Marylanders wanted to redeem their identity as southerners. In the 1890s, the journalist Hanson Hiss claimed that jousting may be ... the only remaining relic of that romantic and picturesque age which has furnished the bards of centuries with themes. Marylanders linked this romantic image of jousting with their image of the Old South, and through jousting, they renewed their southern identity. Many Maryland knights chose names like the Knight of the Lost Cause, the Knight of the Sunny South, and the Knight in Grey to show their sympathy for the plight of the southern states.

Daniel's master, J. Berry, understood that \"he is hired in Washington City by his free relatives, or he may be at some of the fisheries.\" An extremely detailed description of Daniel followed stating that he was \"about 16 years of age, 5 feet high, very bright mulatto, slender made and delicate features, high cheek bones, long bushy hair, and light eyes.\" Such a description, his master thought, would ensure that he would \"get him again.\" ","Federal law and the United States Constitution required the return of runaway slaves. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was hardly enforced and northerners did not help in retrieving runaways. Because of this the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 made any official who did not detain a slave accountable to a fine, and officials had a duty to arrest suspected runaways. This law hit a blow to abolitionists, who protested it. Berry's decision to solicit the help of the readers of the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> could indicate northern resentment of the new Fugitive Slave Law. Berry could not trust that his slave would be returned by federal law alone and hoped to receive greater aid in his slave's capture.","Runaway slaves reduced productivity, cost their masters money (in rewards as well as other fees such as detaining the slave), and took away their masters' time. Offering 100 dollars as well as repeatedly posting the ad for six days (May 2-7) shows just how valuable this young slave was to Berry. Interestingly, the price for the capture of Daniel was only 100 dollars if caught out of state but would drop to 50 dollars in the District of Columbia and further to 25 dollars if caught in the master's county.

His departure invoked many of the religious passages in her diary as she used religion as a comfort and a way to calm her fears. Bond often prayed to God in that she \"may not be entirely cut off from [her] husband,\" and that \"the cruel enemy may be driven from our soil.\" Her prayers to \"put a stop shortly to this miserable war\" were her comfort, and God, she believed, would answer those prayers.  Religious belief was how Bond coped, and she held her beliefs close. Even through illness, which was common throughout her diary, Bond remained religious.  Sickness fell to Bond and almost all around her but she \"believe[d] [she was] perfectly resigned to God's Will...as though He will spare [her]...but if it is God's wish to take [her], He knows best.\" ","The effects of the Second Great Awakening could still be seen 30 years later.

Hill states in the <em>Encyclopedia of Religion,</em> \"Evangelicalism crossed the lines of time...because it so easily expressed the protest and hopes of ordinary people.\" Protestant religion was an especially important factor in antebellum culture and religion was, as historian Randall Miller states, \"at the center of the American Civil War experience.\" ","The Protestant Baptist religion was very popular among white women like Bond.

According to Miller, \"Americans believed God was on the side of those who were right with Him,\" and Bond believed he was with her.  In order to live a good life, Protestants like Bond tried their best to follow the teachings of their savior. Prayer was her salvation from the horrors of war and illness, and she believed God would reward her in the afterlife. On August 34, 1863, Bond prayed, \"Oh, I do pray the good Lord will grant me this prayer-that I once more may visit the place of my nativity.\" She arrived home, in Maryland on January 2, 1866 and died shortly after.

According to an article in the New York Times, \"we regard the acquisition of Cuba by the United States as a measure of very highest importance to the well-being of its inhabitants, -to the safety and strength of our own country, -and to the best interests of all mankind.\" Lawrence O'Bryan Branch was a member of the House of Representatives during the 1850s. He wrote a letter to a member of his family telling them about a report he was preparing on the acquisition of Cuba. \"The President in his message asked Congress to place at his disposal a sum of money to be used at his discretion as part payment in advance to the Spanish Government for the Island. I approve that mode.\"  ","America had many reasons for its interest in purchasing Cuba. According to The Hispanic American Historical Review, \"development of trade, increasing investments, growth of an American colony in Cuba, southern imperialism, the independence movement in Latin America, and Spain's weakness were the principal reasons for American interest in the island.\" However, there was opposition to the acquisition of the island. According to Branch, both \"Black Republicans and many of the Fire-eaters\" opposed his bill, and \"between the two classes my bill to carry out the recommendation of the President as in a fair way to fail.\" Many people wondered if it was the United States' business as to what was going on in other countries. According to the New York Times, \"there is nothing to forbid our wishing for such results as the welfare of our fellow men requires.\" This is true. There was nothing stopping the United States from \"wishing\" something to happen, but many were worried about America taking a more drastic and violent approach. The New York Times responded, \"we do not advocate, nor would we excuse, the violent seizure of Cuba by our Government, nor its acquisition by any means upon which the stain of injustice could possibly rest. We would never countenance the commencement of a war with Spain.\" However, the Times was not the best at predicting the future.

This crisis was the passage of the Nullification Ordinances by the South Carolina State Assembly in November of 1832.  The unity and survival of the nation depended upon President Andrew Jackson's response.  On December 10, 1832, President Jackson presented his response to the Congress, arguing that the justification for state nullification of federal laws was misguided, unconstitutional, and treasonous to the country.   Jackson began his proclamation by outlining the reasons and reservations that led South Carolina to pass the ordinance; their major concerns were the tariffs of May 29, 1828 and June 14, 1832.  South Carolina believed these measures were unfair and didn't fall within the constitutional power of Congress to raise revenue; they proclaimed the laws null and void and threatened succession.  In his address, Jackson showed that the doctrine of nullification was \"incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which It was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed.\"   First, he posited that South Carolina's objections based on stated powers and fairness were misguided and incorrect because the Constitution gave Congress the \"discretionary power\" to raise revenue by taxation.  Next, Jackson argued the Constitution joined the states into a single nation, and \"in becoming parts of a nation...they surrender many of their essential parts of sovereignty.\"  Thus, secession was wholly unconstitutional because it is an affront to national authority.  Finally, Jackson warned the people of South Carolina, who he believed were tricked into nullification by political and social leaders, that any action of \"disunion, by force, is treason.\"  He made an emotional appeal for these people to see the error of their position.  His address ends with a hope that the nation will survive and be reconciled by reasonableness and harmony, but also an assurance that it will be reconciled by force, if necessary.  ","    President's Jackson's speech came at a crucial time during his presidency; he had just been elected to a second term, but already his popular and political support was flagging.  But, according to historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Jackson's handling of the nullification crisis and his resolve to ensure the survival of the union, both evident in the December speech, gained him temporary \"popular acclaim,\" making him the \"country's hero.\"  Jackson, a shrewd political, turned his new popularity into a political weapon to further the other policies of his administration, most notably his continued war against the Bank of the United States.  Jackson's speech and eventual handling of the nullification crisis were viewed, by the majority of the nation, as the actions of a strong leader dedicated to the nation and its survival; he used this renewed trust to further the political goals of his presidency.

To Mrs. Virginia Clay, wife of Senator Clement Clay of Alabama, the fifty-five year old Houston was a \"Senatorial Hercules\" and a \"roughish old hero\".  In her book, <em>A Belle of the 50's</em>, Mrs. Clay explains Houston's whittling habit saying that \"a seemingly inexhaustible supply of soft wood was always kept in his desk [in the Senate] and out of it he whittled stars and hearts and other fanciful shapes.\"  One day, she received an envelope while she watched in the gallery of the Senate and \"within a tiny, shiny, freshly whittled wooden heart, on which the roguish old hero had inscribed, 'Lady I send thee my heart Sam Houston'\" (99).  She further mentioned his youthful nature as she explained that \"nothing amused him more than to reduce to a confused silence those who surrounded him, by suddenly addressing them in all sorts of unknown words\" in a number of Indian dialects (100).  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Sam Houston to Mrs. Clay she found in his attire as \"he wore a leopard-skin vest, with a voluminous scarlet neck-tie, and over his bushy grey locks rested an immense sombrero... wrapped around his broad shoulders he wore a gaily coloured Mexican <em>serape</em>, in which scarlet predominated\" (98- 99). ","Numerous reasons explain why Sam Houston would wear a serape as Marion Wisehart in <em>Sam Houston: American Giant</em> wrote, \"Senator Houston wore a bright Mexican serape to protect his back and chest from drafts\" (497).  Or perhaps with the time he spent near Mexico, Senator Houston became more comfortable in that clothing style.  Regardless, the same man that Mrs. Clay describes seems very different than the General who led an army of Texans to victory at San Jacinto.  Sam Houston acted as statesman, politician, and soldier.  He fought in the War of 1812, governed Tennessee and later Texas as Governor of two different states, became elected twice as the President of the Republic of Texas, and worked as a Senator for Texas fighting against succession (though a slaveowner himself).  Wisehart describes another aspect of Houston as \"he could talk extemporaneously for two or three hours and hold his audience in thrall.  After sleeping all night on the cold, damp ground, he could sit on a log and write powerful appeals to stimulate patriotic ardor or eloquent petitions in his own defense\" (vii).  As explained in <em>The Autobiography of Sam Houston,</em> \"It is of such violent contrasts that an epic figure is made\" (xv).  The diversity in the behavior of Sam Houston can not be separated.  Sam Houston the whittler is the same man as President Sam Houston.

Dillard, the Charlottesville philanthropist affiliated with the efforts to fund and improve black education in America, Dr. Carter G. Woodson wrote of a recent loss of staff on the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History due to the efforts of Anson Phelps Stokes, Thomas Jesse Jones and others.  Considered by Woodson as the \"promoters of the Negro Encyclopedia,\" Stokes and Jones, among others played the role of conspirators against the Association's production of the \"Encyclopedia Africana\" in Woodson's depiction.  Dr. Woodson claimed that these men, \"devoted to Negro control,\" were responsible for stealing his former employee and recruiting him to destroy the efforts of the Association.  Woodson wrote, \"they hope to divide the Negroes in their attitude toward what we are doing.\"  With this letter, he hoped to gauge Dillard's stance on the issue and push him to choose a group to support.","            The first battle in this outright publishing war actually occurred a few years earlier, when the April 27, 1931 Phelps Stokes Fund meeting spawned the \"Encyclopedia of the Negro\" project.  The announcement of this Stokes-Jones supported encyclopedia hit Woodson hard, who had been working on his own encyclopedia of the same subject matter for a decade by that time.  It also spurred Woodson to engage in public battles with these two men and their associates in interviews and through correspondence, like the letter he sent to Dr. Dillard.  After having already announced the work of the Association to compile and publish an \"Encyclopedia Africana\" in 1921, Woodson believed that Stokes and Jones aimed to publish a story of the Negro \"as the white man wants and is willing to pay for.\"  For Woodson, the duplication of a work that his organization had already compiled extensive data for proved that the \"promoters of the Negro Encyclopedia\" acted as enemies of blacks in America and not friends.  He addressed this idea in earlier correspondence with the council overseeing the \"Encyclopedia of the Negro.\"  In a 1932 letter, he asked the promoters of the encyclopedia either to furnish his association with a small sum of money to finish their own work or to use their funds to fix other problems facing the black American.  Woodson also suggested the appointment of an officer from the Stokes-Jones council to review the efforts of both sides and assess the inventory and progress of each project.  The Stokes-Jones camp declined to adapt either suggestion to the activities of their fund and the battle waged on throughout the years.","            Carter G. Woodson believed that the education of blacks needed changes to reverse the effects of a black inferiority complex.  Woodson wanted an organic education for blacks that came out of their history and experiences, and not from outside influences.  This desire for truth and authority in retelling the story of the black American to the world guided Woodson's scholarly endeavors.  This same desire pushed him to question the motives of Stokes and Jones, as well as their associates.  Believing education steeped in the black experience and the \"true\" history of the race to be crucial to the development of the black American, Woodson could not reconcile the white leadership of the Stokes-Jones project with their supposed aims of providing blacks with a document for their race.  According to Woodson, \"Negroes must be led to solve their own problems and thus carve out their own future,\" and if the promoters of the Encyclopedia of the Negro declined to aid this plan, then they proved themselves as negative influences on the movement to improve black education.  Carter G. Woodson wanted to help blacks help themselves by providing them with their own history and achievements to share with the world.  The \"Encyclopedia Africana\" represented an outlet to provide that scientific and historical information for people, and to Woodson, other efforts towards creating a similar work that ignored his aims lacked authority and validity.","Citatio"],"display_date":"April 27, 1931 - December 23, 1936","search_date":"1934-02-23","locations":[{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":61,"tag":"encyclopedia"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"}],"course":{"name":"Race and Politics of Reconciliation","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":19,"school_id":1}},{"id":4464,"title":"Edward Everett Extolls Civilizing Liberia\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1853-01-18","end_date":"1853-01-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"Y","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["At the thirty-sixth annual meeting of the American Colonization Society (ACS), the main concern for US Secretary of State Edward Everett was whether it was possible to maintain a civilization in Africa and whether or not the ACS was successful in attempting it.  In his speech, Everett discussed the reasons for the ACS, such as stopping the slave trade, and discusses their inspirations which include the spread of Christianity and American ideals.","Historian Irving H. Bartlett regarded Everett as \"conventional among Americans outside of the South\" in his views on slavery.  He knew that slavery was an \"unfortunate institution,\" but that it was protected by the Constitution.  This made Everett a relatively neutral party in assessing the accomplishments of the ACS.  Everett showed that the ACS had succeeded in its original goal which was to stop the slave trade.  He said that many other civilizations had attempted to stop the trade, but the ACS had actually done it by giving slaves that were on captured slave ships a place to settle and possibly assist them in finding their original homes. ","He later talked about the many reasons civilizing Africa had been a failure and why the ACS would correct this failure with their plans.  Everett believed that the white man could not civilize Africa because disease and cultural and environmental differences in Africa would not allow it. He went on to say that with all of the natural endowments of Africa, it had to be civilized because it was a waste of such a fertile continent. The argument of many of the critics of the ACS was that Africans were too inferior to Europeans to be civilized.  Everett said that this was not entirely true, and cited the example of the Egyptians and of many intelligent Africans who had been given appropriate education. Everett argued that if the lower classes of white men were compared with the African race then the superiority of whites may not be so apparent.  He compared the accomplishments in Liberia by the colony set up by the ACS to that of the first colonies in America such as Jamestown and Plymouth.  In Liberia they had already established a Constitution of organized republican government, courts, schools, communication to the interior, agriculture, and most importantly churches.  These accomplishments outstripped those by the first colonies of America in their first twenty-five years.","One of the main arguments by Everett was that Christianity guided the Africans into civilization and by the African Americans teaching the natives Christianity all will be civilized.  He said that the \"blessings of the Christians\" can be shown to Africa through the newly established colonies.  He thought that the influence of \"pure, unselfish, Christian love\" was the only influence that could never fail and that this alone civilized the world. Everett liked the idea of the spread of the Christian and American ideals to Africa more than the civilization of the Native Africans."],"display_date":"January 18, 1853","search_date":"1853-01-18","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":15,"tag":"Race-Relations"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":18,"school_id":3}},{"id":4465,"title":"Smilin&#39; Schuyler Rails Against The Laws of Kansas\n","course_id":18,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-06-21","end_date":"1856-06-21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1850, the Midwest remained largely undeveloped and in the eyes of many New Englanders it seemed a very profitable proposition.

However, in the months following the end of the Mexican-American War in 1848, the proposal reasserted itself as the federal government and its responsibilities expanded enormously.  As a result, in the second session of the 30th Congress on March 3, 1849, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed the \"Act to establish the Home Department, and to provide for the Treasury Department an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.\"  Amongst the numerous duties allocated to the Secretary of the Interior, such as the supervision of the General Land Office, the distribution of the decennial national census, and the organization of U.S. metal mines, the act notably assigned \"the supervisory and appellate powers now exercised by the Secretary of the War Department, in relation to all the acts of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\" to the new Secretary of the Interior as well.","Judging by appearances, the Department of the Interior as outlined in the 1849 act seemed like more of a depository of offices from other executive departments with which they had little to do anymore, as the first Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing noted in his 1849 report.  Nevertheless, the act highlighted an important transition in the U.S. federal government's attitude towards Indians, most of whom had been removed to west of the Mississippi River a decade prior if not earlier.  In fact, prior to this statute the Commissioner of Indian Affairs operated under the supervisory powers of the Secretary of War, clearly indicating the combative attitude that was presumed necessary when interacting with any Indian tribe.  However, by 1849 the \"Indian problem\" that had struck fear in so many Americans' hearts during the thirty years earlier now appeared relatively innocuous; indeed, as prominent American Indian historian Wilcomb E. Washburn observed, with the immense tracts of land that Mexico surrendered in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo \"the duties performed by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs were bound to increase\" but they were to be \"more oriented to peaceful pursuits than to warlike ones.\"  The preceding rationale - which was originally espoused by Treasury Secretary Robert J. Walker in 1848 - effectively encouraged white Americans to turn their eyes toward 'civilizing' the Indian by introducing an agriculturally-based lifestyle which would eventually aid white expansion onto Indian grounds across the Southwest and the Plain States.  Thus, as white America continued its march westward under the guise of Manifest Destiny, the American Indian began to be perceived as less of a military threat and more of land resource to be manipulated."],"display_date":"March 3, 1849","search_date":"1849-03-03","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: The Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":17,"school_id":2}},{"id":4632,"title":"Sumner-Brooks Affair","course_id":23,"status":"P","start_date":"1856-05-22","end_date":"1856-05-22","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner sat as his desk in the nearly empty Chamber of the United States Senate on May 22, 1856. He had recently given a speech called “The Crime Against Kansas” on abolishing slavery in the United States. The speech described atrocities occurring in Kansas at the time. There pro-slavery border ruffians from Missouri crossed into Kansas and attacked anti-slavery settlers. Senator Sumner specifically mentioned Senator Andrew Butler, of South Carolina in the speech because of his involvement with the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Butler’s nephew, Congressman Preston Brooks, who had taken the speech particularly personally, entered the Senate Chamber. He proceeded to attack Senator Sumner with a walking stick. Brooks, who was accompanied at the time by Congressman Laurence Keitt of South Carolina and Congressman Henry Edmundson of Virginia, assaulted Sumner “with a considerable amount of violence.\" Sumner was struck with “numerous blows on and about the head with a walking stick which cut his head.\" Brooks hit Sumner so hard with the cane that part of the cane shattered. When other senators attempted to intervene and assist Senator Sumner, they were blocked by Congressman Keitt, who was wielding a pistol and shouting.","The attack was brutal, and Senator Sumner did not make another public appearance after the attack until November 5, 1856. Sumner did not return to the Senate for three years, but was repeatedly reelected by the Massachusetts General Court.

It was common for physical altercations to occur on the frontier in the Kansas area between anti-slavery and pro-slavery settlers, but a physical exchange in the Senate Chamber did not happen often. The fact that such a violent attack was not regarded as much more than retribution for something said in a speech by Senator Sumner exemplified how the conflict between pro-slavery and anti-slavery partisans was increasingly escalating into violence during the 1850s. Northerners and Southerners obviously reacted to the incident differently. Many Southerners viewed Brooks’s ations as manly and honorable because he was standing up not just for his family, but also his state, section, and slavery. However, in the North physicality and violence were increasingly at odds with ideals of manhood among the middle classes, and many northerners to viewed the caning of Sumner by Brooks as a barbaric assault, not just on Sumner himself, but on the fabric of American democracy.

By the 1850s there was a full out war of words in both chambers of Congress as each side was becoming increasingly uncompromising in their cause. These tensions had been creeping across the country at an extremely fast rate throughout the nineteenth century, and by 1856 violence over the issue was something that occurred more often. The peak of these violent acts began in 1855, as proslavery and antislavery forces violently confronted one another in the newly formed territory of Kansas.","This Border War, called Bleeding Kansas by many living at the time, conveys the desperation of both sides; many Northerners wished to keep slavery from spreading, and many Southerners hoped slavery would continue for years. Violent outbreaks in the Kansas territory made it clear to everyone that the issue of slavery was not one that would be decided by a piece of paper signed by men in Washington D.C. People in the North saw the violence committed by these anti-abolitionists as vile and disgusting, while those in the South saw this as their last, viable option. The halls of Congress soon became another front in this war as politicians took up the argument of their counterparts. Charles Sumner, Senator from Massachusetts, had always proved his abilities as an orator and leader. He chose to use his talents to convey the sheer atrocity being committed by slaveholding Southerners. On May 19 and again on the 20<sup>th</sup>, Sumner stood in front of his fellow Senators and made his case against the Kansas-Nebraska Act. He began with soaring rhetoric criticizing the bill on a legal level; however, matters soon turned personal. As he stood in the front of the dozens of other Senators, Charles Sumner openly mocked the main authors of the bill, Senator Stephen A. Douglas and Representative Andrew Butler of South Carolina. Using the same skills that made him a revered abolitionist in Massachusetts, Sumner embarrassed these two men. Sumner talked about how Douglas was a “noisome, squat, and nameless animal” and that he was “not a proper model for an American senator.” These words drew cheers and chuckles from Northerners, while Southerners looked at Sumner as though he had just spat in their faces. Sumner continued, and became even more personal when he began to talk about Butler. He accused Butler of having “a mistress, who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight – I mean, the harlot, Slavery.” Northerners went wild, as did the Southerners, for obvious different reasons. Sumner continued to batter the elder statesman as he mocked his speech and physical mannerisms, which had been greatly affected by a stroke Butler had suffered from. By the time the session that day had ended, Sumner’s speech had roused support from many of his fellow Northerners and complete resentment from many others. News traveled fast about this speech, but no one thought it would take the turn it did.","Two days following the attack, Charles Sumner was busy doing paperwork in an almost empty Senate Chamber. Unbeknownst to him, Rep. Butler’s nephew, Representative Preston Brooks entered the chamber. He approached Sumner, along with Laurence Keitt and Henry A. Edmundson. Sumner stopped writing and gave his attention to the three men before him. Sumner measured up the men in front of him, and before he had the chance to say anything, Preston Brooks began. He politely informed Sumner that he had read his speech two times, and that it was “a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine.” Sumner, realizing the severity of the situation stood up to speak with Brooks. As Sumner began to rise out of his chair, Brooks lifted his thick gutta-percha cane with a gold head. He raised the cane and brought it down with such a force that Sumner was immediately knocked to the floor. Blood splattered everywhere, and Brooks continued to beat the unarmed Senator. Sumner attempted to find shelter under the desk, but Brooks, in such a rage, was able to rip the bolted desk out of the floor. He continued to assault the Senator, who by this time had been blinded by his own blood and was near unconsciousness. Slowly and painfully, Sumner made his way up the aisle in the chamber, with Brooks following him the whole way, beating him the whole way, until breaking his cane over Sumner’s head. As Sumner lay unconscious, other Senators ran over to help him, and Butler, as casually as he had entered the building, left."],"display_date":"May 19, 1856 - May 22, 1856","search_date":"1856-05-20","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":193,"tag":"Abolitionism"},{"id":200,"tag":"Bleeding Kansas"},{"id":201,"tag":"Brooks-Sumner Fight"},{"id":244,"tag":"Violence"}],"course":{"name":"The Abolitionists and American Society","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":23,"school_id":11}},{"id":4689,"title":"Subcommittee formed to better manage aliens.","course_id":26,"status":"P","start_date":"5/24/81","end_date":"5/24/81","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The fourth wave of immigration to the United States, created by the Immigration Act of 1965, was due to the economic situations of émigrés.

Moreover, since the 1960s, it had been seen by the U.S. that levels of immigration, both legal and illegal, were unsustainable.","The government established a joint sub-committee headed by Senator Alan K. Simpson. Congress organized the panel to come forth with a program to be forwarded for approval to Reagan – with the goal of improving the laws on immigration. Simpson was particularly concerned with the U.S.’s main immigration policy at the time, based on family reunification which allowed unlimited numbers of relatives to enter the country.","The sub-committee also pushed for harsher penalties concerning employers hiring illegal immigrants and put forth the idea of naturalizing aliens who have resided in the U.S. for five years. The committee was well timed, as Regan was to meet Mexican President José López Portillo within a month.

As historian Robert Edsel has shown, Hitler appointed staff members to museums across Europe before the invasions even began to start making lists of all the items in which they would steal throughout the war. When the Allies learned of the Nazi art plunder, the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program was established to locate and return as many works as possible to their original locations. Nicknamed the “Monuments Men,” the group consisted of approximately 350 men and women who were museum directors, curators, and art historians who volunteered for service in the U.S. Army to attempt to protect the works of art stolen by the Nazis. Joined by passionate curators and directors at the prominent European museums such as Rose Valland, curator of the Louvre museum, the Monuments Men were able to obtain confidential traces to the locations of the Nazis’ hiding places. Art treasures were recovered from mines, trains, and other storage sites where they were waiting to be transported to Germany and destined for residency in the Fuhrermuseum.

Alan Riding wrote “Reagan Impact Felt in Central America” as a broad overview of the actions and reactions that happened in the region due to anticipated changes in United States policy. This reporter had credibility on the subject of U.S.-Central American relations because it was his journalistic specialty from 1970-1989.","Alan Riding reported in the article that the Guatemalans greatly anticipated Reagan coming to power “The conservative Government and private sector in Guatemala, which had been strongly critical of President Carter’s human rights campaign, were delighted by his defeat and seemed hopeful of resumed American military assistance to help combat leftist guerrillas.”","The historical context leading up to this involved official policy from the previous administration.","In 1977 President Jimmy Carter ordered a human rights report on the actions of the Guatemalan military. What the study found was later confirmed by the United Nations Commission for Historical Clarification. The Guatemalan military was responsible for 93% of the human rights violations committed during the war, the guerrillas for 3%. The Guatemalan government reacted to these negative findings by refusing United States military aid.","Reagan immediately voiced his support for funding Guatemala once again in his first presidential news conference. He stated: “You can [not] turn away from some country because here and there they do not totally agree with our concept of human rights.”  Public opinion at the time about United States involvement in Central American Civil Wars is hard to gauge. While some, like former Peace Corp volunteer John Elder actively participated in the process of bringing Guatemalan refugees to the United States, most Americans remained inactive. The United States Military’s involvement was mostly logistical, so the violence did not have a direct effect on American citizens. Our aid to Guatemala did not cause the same public out rage that Vietnam did because few Americans died. The reinstatement of funding was a political success from Reagan’s point of view and by 1983, most of the Guatemalan countryside was subdued. This episode correctly previewed the situation in Central America and the changes that Ronald Reagan's administration would bring to US policy for that region."," "],"display_date":"November 16, 1980","search_date":"1980-11-16","locations":[{"id":40259,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":39105,"lat":40.6916304076,"lng":-74.0035386433,"zoom":11,"place":"New York, New York"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":293,"tag":"Ronald Reagan"},{"id":294,"tag":"Containment"},{"id":295,"tag":"International Relations"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":26,"school_id":3}},{"id":4794,"title":"Charles Hudson Speaks Against the Annexation of Texas","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1845-01-20","end_date":"1845-12-29","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In the fierce debate over the annexation of Texas, Charles Hudson, took the floor of the House of Representatives in hopes of preventing the admission of Texas to the Union.  A Whig member of the House of Representatives, representing Massachusetts, as well as a Universalist minister, Hudson emphasized the selfish motives of the Southern advocates for annexation.","The admission of Texas to the Union would have been to the South’s advantage, as many Texas citizens were southerner’s who had migrated there with their slaves, and would therefore result in another slave state, as discussed by scholar, Jesse Macy.  This would have then given the South greater representation in Congress.  As a citizen of Massachusetts, Hudson opposed the annexation of Texas because Northern states would have been overruled by the South in Congress.  Hudson’s opposition was further cemented through his political affiliation as a Whig, as the Whig Party was a party dominated by the North, and therefore opposed to the annexation of Texas and expansion of slavery.  Further, Massachusetts was specifically against annexation as it was a hotbed of resistance to the annexation, led by Whigs as discussed by scholar Kinley J. Brauer.  Whigs were also apprehensive about the possibility of war with Mexico.","The South was not keen to point out how advantageous the annexation of Texas would be to the furtherance of their interests and the continuity of slavery, but rather attempted to persuade the North that the annexation of Texas would work to preserve the Union and expand Northern industry.  Hudson addressed this as he discussed the argument made by Southern Congressmen that “the commercial advantages to be derived from a connexion [sic] with Texas would be immensely great.”  Hudson quickly saw through the possible advantages of acquiring Texas for the North, as he points out that “the very annexationists, those new-born friends of Northern manufacturers, have been constantly in the habit of assailing manufacturers.”","Besides these attempts to persuade the North that annexing Texas was in its best interest, Hudson stated that the House of Representatives received little information on why they should annex Texas.  Congress only received threats that it was important to annex Texas, because if not the South may secede as they had more to gain through affiliation with Texas than with the North.  This can be observed, according to Hudson in Mr. C. J. Ingersoll’s opening of the debate on the admission of Texas as he stated “that he should offer no argument in favor of the measure, till he should hear it assailed!”  Further, Hudson pointed out that during meetings regarding the annexation of Texas throughout the South, “annexation or dissolution were the only alternatives presented.”","Hudson quickly dismissed these arguments as he argued that the annexation of Texas “is a device, got up by Messrs. Upshur and Calhoun, to place slavery on a more permanent foundation, and to give the South a balance [of] power.”  Texas would be annexed in “an attempt, in one part of the Union, to build itself up at the expense of another.”  He wanted to argue that the annexation of Texas could also have possibly led to war, and a great accumulation of debt, and would not have provided any of the advantages that the Southerners discussed.  In essence, the annexation of Texas would tear the Union apart, as “the admission of Texas into the Union would sow the seeds of discontent and alienation and do more to jeorpard[ize] the peace and endanger the perpetuity of the Union.”","Regardless of the problems Texas potentially caused the Union, Congressmen such as Hudson were succumbed to defeat, as Texas was annexed to the Union in 1845."],"display_date":"January 20, 1845 - December 29, 1845","search_date":"1845-07-10","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":34,"tag":"Crime/Violence, Economy, Law, Slavery, Urban Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":37,"school_id":3}},{"id":4976,"title":"Calhoun Foreshadows Two Nations","course_id":37,"status":"P","start_date":"1832-02-06","end_date":"1832-02-06","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 6, 1837, John C.

Or at least one of his 12 original Constitutional amendments had been resuscitated. With near unanimity (Senate: 99-0; House: 414-3) Congress showed its support for the Twenty-Seventh Amendment on May 20,1992. The Amendment prohibits adjustments to Congressional salaries from taking effect before an election intercedes. Yet the vote was largely meaningless, as earlier in the month Michigan had become the thirty-eighth state to ratify the proposal – thus giving it the three-quarters proportion needed to amend the Constitution. Six states originally ratified the proposal between 1789 and 1791; Ohio became the seventh in 1873. Only one other state (Wyoming, in 1978) would endorse it before a legislative aide in Texas named Gregory Watson stumbled across the amendment in 1982 and initiated a campaign for its revival. By 1988, a total of 25 states had ratified Madison's motion.","But had the 203 years between its proposal and ultimate adoption rendered the earliest states' approval invalid? No, according to Don Wilson, Archivist of the United States, who certified the Amendment's validity six days prior to the vote in Congress. (It has become practice recently for proposals to contain a sunset clause – typically seven years – but this was not the case with Madison's amendments.) And thus it became law. Although why – after having lain dormant for two centuries – should this proposal suddenly take on such importance?","There is a theory as to how “structural” amendments such as the Twenty-Seventh arise. An event triggers widespread awareness of a problem with how government works. In response, a coalition forms that amends the Constitution to resolve the problem. In 1989, Congress implemented pay raises that saw Senate salaries increase 14 percent – and House salaries go up 40 percent – by 1991. Over this same time frame, public confidence in Congress fell significantly. There was little public appetite for Congressional pay increases in the face of growing perceptions of arrogance and allegations of corruption against some members of Congress. It is no surprise then that the elections of 1990 and 1992 revealed strong anti-incumbent sentiments amongst the electorate. Combined with Watson's drive, this led 15 states (including the linchpin, Michigan) to endorse the resolution between 1989 and 1992, as a means of restoring some legitimacy to the governing institutions in the public’s eye. It is also why when Congress backed the resolution on May 20 – given it had no legal impact – the vote was seen as largely political.","The Twenty-Seventh Amendment has been described as amendment by “stealth,” given the lengthy delay between proposal and ratification. Nevertheless, it is an example of the tradition of using the constitution to correct a structural problem of government, one even the Founding Fathers recognized as an issue. “James Madison saw something wrong with members of Congress increasing their own salaries, unchecked by their constituencies...

In her diary, Caroline documented her day-to-day life and travels, as well as her dreams, passions, and concerns.   After the Panic of 1837 left her father bankrupt, Caroline set out to do what she could to aid her family’s troubled situation.  As a young woman of only twenty years, Caroline began teaching at Miss English’s school in Georgetown, D.C.  On her second day at the school, a young slave girl named Christie came up and asked her for a lesson. ","After thirty minutes or so of reading and history lessons, Christie admitted she feared she would never be free.  Caroline replied “The whites must be servants of God Christie—and you are very happy now.”  The conversation continued for some time as Christie and Caroline discussed God’s plan and the reasons why blacks could not all be free at once, “… it is because few of you are wise enough, and good enough to be trusted with liberty.”  Caroline cited various biblical passages referencing the important, and sometimes trying, relationship between servant and master.  She concluded her entry with ruminations over her homesickness, as well as her hope that God would unveil her fate and intended duty in the world. ","It may seem odd that Caroline, who was deeply grounded in her religious faith as a Unitarian, spoke out against the abolition of slavery.  This anti-abolitionist attitude, however, prevailed in the early 1840s throughout most of the North.  In Caroline’s hometown of Boston, only seven years prior to this entry’s inscription, William Lloyd Garrison, the editor of the abolitionist newspaper <em>The Liberator </em>was dragged through the streets and almost hung by an anti-abolitionist mob until he was rescued by local law enforcement.  To many, slavery was an institution that seemed remote and irrelevant in day-to-day life.  Abolitionists also posed a direct challenge to the local elites in cities nationwide, challenging the status quo and threatening to empower not only the enslaved, but free blacks and women as well. It was also a system which had stimulated the growth of northern business, the very industry that Caroline’s father worked in as a merchant in Boston.  Caroline’s attitudes toward abolitionism were no doubt shaped by the prevailing attitudes of the time as well as her upbringing as a wealthy merchant’s daughter in New England. "],"display_date":"September 11, 1842","search_date":"1842-09-11","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":193,"tag":"Abolitionism"},{"id":142,"tag":"african americans"},{"id":79,"tag":"Religion"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5072,"title":"The Single Inaugural Address of President Zachary Taylor","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1849-12-04","end_date":"1849-12-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["President Zachary Taylor's only inaugural address of the year 1849 is, at first glance, a rather typical political address from a rather typical president.

He also talks about the strong relationship the United States has with other nations and how he believes in strengthening and maintaining those friendships, especially towards France, with whom they had had a minor altercation. Taylor says he has “scrupulously avoided any interference in the wars and contentions which have recently distracted Europe.” This was demonstrated in the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty signed by the United States and Great Britain.","President Taylor believed in a strong government banking system and wanted to express that the federal government should encourage agriculture, commerce and manufacturing.","Taylor's short term was dominated by the issue of slavery. Although a southern war hero who owned slaves, Taylor felt he needed to take a moderate issue on slavery. Although, he did not mince his words when talking about hanging anyone who broke the law. However, slavery does not appear as an issue in his address. The only way it comes up is when he mentions that people have been buying American-made boats in Brazil and using them for the slave trade. The idea behind The Compromise of 1850 was formulated during Taylor's time in office, yet he died while it was being debated.","Taylor was not a very effective president himself and most of the men he appointed were not very competent and effective either. Taylor, although running and winning as a Whig, did not completely suscribe to the Whig ideals and was not inclined to be a follower or puppet of the Whig Congress majority and it was that, combined with his own and his administration's effectiveness that caused his short presidency to be remembered mostly for his unusual death."],"display_date":"December 4, 1849","search_date":"1849-12-04","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":743,"tag":"Compromise of 1850"},{"id":742,"tag":"Inaugural Address"},{"id":741,"tag":"Taylor"},{"id":740,"tag":"President"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"}],"course":{"name":"America, 1820-1890 (2010)","school":"Furman University","course_id":43,"school_id":4}},{"id":5083,"title":"Whigs: Nationalism &amp; Publication","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1846-06-01","end_date":"1846-06-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Although the Whig Party was already in trouble by the late 1840s, they remained vocal on a host of issues through print publications, such as <em>The American Whig Review.</em> One particular article of interest was written in June of 1846 and dealt with “Supply and demand,” which the author believed “must ever be the governing rule of prices.” The article also discussed how speculation ruins the equilibrium of the market. Interestingly, Whigs on the whole favored protective tariffs, which arguably interfere with the free market and supply-demand processes.","In the <em>Review</em>, the role of government was also discussed; building upon the Hamiltonian nationalist tradition, the Whigs largely argued against nullification. Daniel Webster’s performance in his debates with Robert Y. Hayne was applauded by the journal.

As such, especially in Washington DC, there has always been a battle between local identity and the identity of a nation. This was evidenced especially by Arthur Singleton, who ended up traveling across the United States and wrote predominantly about the growing identity of the new country. In his 1816 letter to his brother he captured his feelings about America, exclaiming “How enobling to be the feelings of an American president, to stand upon Capitol-Hill, and to cast his thoughts northward, and southward, and westward, over our vast and free continent, and to reflect that he is the chosen monarch of all he surveys, and whose right there is none to dispute.” His thoughts convey a sense of awe towards American national identity and seek to glorify its various institutions of law and governance.","Singleton uses a fairly constant and glorifying tone to describe America by stating so much as simple facts in a grandiose way. He writes that “The Federal City is nearly equidistant from the northern and southern extremities of the confederacy, from the cold Saint Croix, to the warm Sabine... yet is there but one vast expanse, one peopled tract, over which delegated parental domination extends.” He expresses physical facts in such a way and at such a time that he shows that he, at least, looks up to the state and sees it as something glorious and magnificent. Further, he showcases not only a form of nationalism, but a distinct one. Singleton writes disapprovingly about two times when George Washington met Congress – first, “it is said, he went on foot, in a plain domestic suit” and “the second year, he went in a costly foreign velvet dress.” The implication is that there is prominent European influence on America or that American culture is changing as a result of its rising prosperity. Further, the simplest explanation for Singleton’s discontent with Washington adopting European customs is the idea that America is somehow superior or “freer” than other states, which is supported throughout the text via the heavy use of simile.","This heavy emphasis on nationalism was not confined to Washington DC, however. Bart Bonikowsky explains that “Partisan conflict abated considerably in the [early] ... 19th century, giving way once again to a shared “national feeling”. As would be the case time and again throughout American history, the population was united by military conflict. The War of 1812 brought Americans together military service, [and] created animosities toward the British that matched those that had existed against the French.” Thus, the War of 1812 may have been one cause of the immense love for his country that Singleton writes about. This seems to make sense, especially given the fact that he wrote his letter just one year after the war of 1812 ended – the right time at which not only to capture the feeling of animosity towards the British during the war that persisted but to capture feelings of pride for America as a strong force.  As such, nationalism was strong in the years following the war and contributed to a self-image of greatness."],"display_date":"January 17, 1800 - September 15, 1816","search_date":"1808-05-17","locations":[{"id":15677,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":787,"tag":"Urban Life"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5105,"title":"Sexism in Washington DC in the Early 1800’s","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"1800-02-05","end_date":"1816-10-05","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Sexism has always been a significant problem throughout America’s history, and while much of it has been directly targeting women, it permeates through language used by Americans. This is shown by Arthur Singleton’s letter from Washington DC in 1816, where he makes the comment that “I bless myself, that this country is not subject to Gynæcocracy; that, by our Salique law, no woman is eligible to our presidency.” This functions as an assertment of the “traditional” belief that women are not eligible to have the same rights, dignities, and so on as men.","Yet Singleton’s defense of his statement sounds more like providing excuses rather than a justification for his belief, and he provides said excuses in a number of ways. First, he looks to the Bible – which says that “the women should look to the man for counsel,” and to a few historical examples which may not be enough to prove or disprove his point – he just says that there have been few great queens, but he never directly denies that there have been great queens in the past. Further, the majority of his attempted justifications for his statement involve masked assertions – such as the idea that “legislation... is too weighty for the sensitive fibres of the female mind.” or that “woman should rule, not indeed in civil jurisdiction, which would unsphere her, but in her vast natural province.” As such, Singleton conveys the social beliefs of the time, which rest upon not fact but prejudice.","Yet these beliefs were not limited to Washington DC; they existed throughout society, and to a great magnitude. As Kathryn S. Hahn explains, not only were women seen as incompetent, they were seen as foreign, saying “Women were used to hiding aspects of their lives that made them uniquely feminine. They hid such things as pregnancy, because it was different from men, and men were the norm in society. If they did not hide the differences they were... considered insane.” This passage gives the effect of such prejudice as carried out by society especially during the 1800’s – that the idea that femininity was foreign and associated with incompetence in “male roles” was apparent throughout society. As such, women were constantly discriminated against both directly and indirectly, with horrible consequences resulting from society’s mindset."],"display_date":"February 5, 1800 - October 5, 1816","search_date":"1808-06-06","locations":[{"id":15677,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":787,"tag":"Urban Life"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"},{"id":788,"tag":"Sexism"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":50,"school_id":40}},{"id":5109,"title":"French women's impression of American race relations","course_id":50,"status":"P","start_date":"11/11/18","end_date":"5/1/19","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Comtesse Madeleine de Bryas and her sister Jacqueline were born, raised and cultured in Paris.  During 1918, the two sisters were in the United States for six months to raise funds for the “American Committee for Devastated France”  by giving speeches. While they travelled shore to shore by train they liked America and the American people they met.  They had wonderful comments about American society and especially about American women.  In their book they gave their impressions of America by comparing American culture and fashion to French. Of course, they had positive impressions of America and especially the hospitality and generosity of the American people.  The sisters traveled across America from New York to St. Louis to San Francisco and the Puget Sound before their return east to Washington, D.C.","One of the observations the two French sisters had was in Washington, D.C. They both came across an American soldier who came up to them and introduced himself to them.  He asked them where they were from, and they said they were French from Paris.  The soldier had the most respectful manner towards them.  The two sisters had the same manners towards the American soldier.  While they were getting to know the young soldier they became extremely interested in the “negro” question.  They knew that life was hard for them, especially for African American women. The soldier admitted that some of the laws America had must not be fair to the French, but that was how things were here.  The sisters understood that, but they still felt bad about it.","By World War I, the military forces had a source of black pride.  Black educators, clergymen, and after a while the press referred to them as Negro heroes of America’s past wars. After the Civil War, the U.S Army kept four Negro regiments.  These units integrated veterans of the civil war and the frontier Indian fighting regiments.  Retired sergeants became appreciated traditional leaders in their communities. This history set a foundation for the African American support and connection in America’s future wars.  In 1917, the United States went to World War I under the slogan “Make the World Safe for Democracy.” In a week after the U.S went to war, the War Department stopped accepting black volunteers because colored army quotas were filled.  No black men were allowed in the Marines, Coast Guard or Air Force.  They were only allowed in the Navy and then only as mess men.  More than 2,000,000 blacks registered for the war and only thirty one percent were accepted to twenty six percent of the white men.  African Americans then comprised ten percent of the population.  World War I was to represent a change in African American history.

The debate over the chemical’s risks and therapeutic possibilities led to Senate subcommittee hearings on its use. Acid, as LSD is commonly called, had been sensationalized by mass media publications and, although in its early years it had been extensively and responsibly studied by medical professionals, the effects of such a powerful chemical remained unclear. Psychologist Timothy Leary was one of the most prominent advocates of LSD, arguing that his medical research of LSD had shown tremendous therapeutic possibilities. However, many Americans remained suspicious of the chemical’s powerful nature. Chairman Thomas Dodd, a conservative Democrat from Connecticut, called for quick measures to stamp out the rapid spread of LSD among America’s youth generation.","In order to gain a better understanding of LSD’s implications, Senator Dodd convened subcommittee hearings on recreational drug use among America’s youth. Leary was one of many expert witnesses called to testify. In his testimony, he asserted that “the challenge of the psychedelic chemicals is not just how to control them, but how to use them,” emphasizing the need for further investigation of LSD rather than complete prohibition. Leary also claimed that LSD and many other psychedelic drugs were not dangerous if used wisely and with precautions.","However, his opinion endured aggressive questioning by Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who criticized Leary’s testimony as “general hyperbole.” Additionally, the subcommittee chairman cited an earlier testimony by another doctor who argued that LSD encouraged homicidal tendencies and destructive behavior. Leary continued his attempts to placate the committee and remove LSD’s negative associations. When Kennedy asked if LSD usage was “extremely dangerous,” Leary replied, “Sir, the motor car is dangerous if used improperly… Human stupidity and ignorance is the only danger human beings face in this world.” Leary’s testimony urged for some type of licensing that would require LSD users to be highly trained, much like a pilot’s license, so that responsible adults could use LSD “for serious purposes, such as spiritual growth, pursuit of knowledge, or their own personal development.” He also noted that without such licensing, Americans faced “another era of prohibition” that would create a new group of college-educated white-collar criminals. In a later autobiographical work, Leary would claim that Kennedy’s bullying presence was merely an attempt “to gain respectability points by lynching me!”","Leary was one of many experts who testified at the 1966 subcommittee hearings, which showed both ardent support and uncompromising opposition to LSD. Its testimonies marked the conflict between medical professionals, intellectuals, and government officials who struggled to agree on LSD’s meaning as well its regulation. The hearings also embodied the highly politicized atmosphere of the 1960s, which had conservative politicians utilizing acid as a scapegoat and to suppress radicalism among America’s younger generations. Just several months after the subcommittee hearings, LSD was banned in California. By October 1968, possession of LSD was banned federally in the United States with the passage of the Staggers-Dodd Bill, marking a tremendous step towards the “War On Drugs” campaign that would arise in the 1970s."],"display_date":"May 1966","search_date":"1966-05-16","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1008,"tag":"Counterculture"},{"id":1007,"tag":"Drug Culture"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"US Since 1945","school":"Juniata College","course_id":69,"school_id":3}},{"id":5260,"title":"Kennedy Hears from a Worried Soviet Premier","course_id":69,"status":"P","start_date":"10/26/62","end_date":"10/27/62","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Between 6:00 and 9:00 PM on the night of Friday October 26, 1962, the tenth day of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the members of President John F.

Everett Koop, charged with writing a detailed report on AIDS for the American people, described the development of AIDS in the US, “AIDS entered the consciousness of the public health service very quietly, very gradually, and with no fanfare at all.”  Even Surgeon General Koop found himself cut off from the deliberations for the first five years of the epidemic. President Reagan’s advisors shielded and isolated the president from the AIDS epidemic.  These individuals kept AIDS at the bottom of the presidential agenda because they felt there was nothing the government could do. However, Roger Higgs argues that the AIDS epidemic brought “greater openness” in public discourse in due time.","Negative stigmatism made it difficult for Koop to approach presidential advisors even after it was proven that it could be transmitted outside of homosexual acts.  The initial term for the epidemic was Gay-Related Immune Deficiency or GRID, in reference to the largest initial group of individuals to experience the disease.  Research proved that it was also transmissible through blood transfusion and heterosexual sex and the name was changed to Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS in 1982.  Despite the lingering social stigma, Koop remembered that the “the first public health priority…stop further transmission.”","The Reagan administration dealt with the crisis in a lackadaisical fashion and restricted Surgeon General Koop from obtaining information.

The black and white or sepia pictures display dirty children, tired mothers or men hard at work. Every one was broke and tired. This era, known as The Great Depression, lasted from 1929 through the advent of the Second World War. This was a time of struggle for people from all walks of life. Even people from white-collar fields, such as lawyers, librarians and teachers were unable to provide for their families. The New Deal program <em>The U.S Works Projects Administration</em> (WPA)felt that there was a more productive way to use the unique skill set that these people brought with them than put them to work on the construction crews created across the nation. The resulting effort was <em>The U.S Works Projects Administration Federal Writers’ Project and Historical Records Survey.</em>","This project was the result of several meetings that took place in 1934 between Jacob Baker, the assistant to the chief of the Civil Works Administration and his assistant, Katherine Kellock. The <em>Works Project Administration </em>ultimately created four appendages to protect and sustain the arts: the <em>Federal Writers' Project</em>, <em>the Art Project</em>, the <em>Theater Project</em>, and the <em>Music Project</em>.","By 1935, <em>The Federal Writers Project </em>was up and running. The main goal of this project was to create a series of guidebooks and local histories. Championed by Kellock, The <em>American Guide Series</em> and “<em>America Eats</em>”were a result of this project. Other collections include the narratives of former slaves as well as celebrations of local culture and art. Even though these projects collected invaluable history, one of the many issues the faced was the collection and intake process. In addition, there were many bureaucratic hurdles that could not be resolved.","Many in Congress felt that the money used to fund the many WPA writers and art programs could be used elsewhere. With the impending threat of war, many Congressmen were intent on diverting those funds to the defense budget. Before the program was terminated in 1939,<em> The Federal</em> <em>Writers Project </em>compiled an impressive collection of pamphlets, books radio scripts and transcripts. These histories are stored in many places on the Internet such as The American Memory Collection."],"display_date":"1934 - 1939","search_date":"1936-12-31","locations":[{"id":22390,"lat":40.7455449451,"lng":-84.936600608,"zoom":10,"place":"Adams, Indiana"},{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1220,"tag":"Federal Writers' Project"},{"id":1084,"tag":"The New Deal"},{"id":620,"tag":"Franklin D.

The news magazine, <em>The Nation</em>, wrote an article covering the details that led up to the scandal and it's aftermath. The Teapot Dome scandal took center stage in the United States with some very influential key players. U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Albert B. Fall and Edward L. Doheny, an oil millionaire, were charged with conspiracy and bribery.","On November 22, 1923, the former Secretary of the Interior, Albert B. Fall, and the proprietor of government oil leases, Edward L. Doheny, faced a jury on charges of conspiracy to defraud the government. The 1923 case brought before the D.C. court was the criminal aspect of the case. The civil portion of the case had been brought before a District of Columbia court three years earlier. The United States government had filed the civil case to terminate the leases held by Doheny. The government had won the suit in both lower courts, however, the case had been appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. Many of the facts in this criminal case had been established in the civil case, which had been investigated by Senator J. Walsh. On the 22<sup>nd</sup> of November 1923, the jury had to consider a variety of evidence and decide if there was any connection between Albert B. Fall and Edward L. Doheny, and whether there was any illegal action between the two defendants.","On November 30, 1921, Edward L. Doheny arrived in Washington holding a black bag filled with a $100,000.00 in cash, given to him by his father. According to records, the bag was give to Secretary of the Interior, who, at the time, was Albert B. Fall, who controlled the naval oil reserves. In the exchange, according to Doheny's father, a note from Fall for receipt of the money was provided.","Rumors began two years after the exchange. Amazingly, Fall's run-down ranch began changing and ten years of unpaid taxes were suddenly paid. Fall insisted he borrowed the money from a friend, who denied the accusations. Later, Doheny addmitted that he was the money source. Before Doheny and Fall exchanged the little black bag, they shared a hotel several months prior. At this meeting, they discussed a possible project involving the construction of storage tanks in Hawaii. Doheny, through his Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company, were given contracts for the construction of the tanks that would hold 1,500,000 barrels of navy oil. Doheny would be paid for this with oil. Oil that was royalties to the Navy from drillers on the oil reserves of the mountain known as Teapot Dome. Unfortunately, the Navy was not receiving enough in royalties to pay Doheny. So, on December 11, 1922, a contract was awarded to Doheny, giving him drilling rights to 32,000 acre Elks Hill naval oil reserves.","The Teapot Dome scandal was a major corruption case during Warren Harding's administration. In 1921 Warren Harding ordered oil reserves controlled by the navy, transferred to the Department of the Interior. At that time, Albert B. Fall was the Secretary of the Interior, and had awarded the no-bid contract to Edward L. Doheny. Surprisingly, this was not against the law, however, the money and receiving of gifts was. The United States Senate investigation found the Fall had received compensation of approximately $400,000.00 over the past few years from Doheny and another oil millionaire, Harry Sinclair. Ultimately, on June 30, 1924, Fall was convicted of conspiracy and accepting bribes, he was sentenced to one year in prison and a $100,000.000 fine. Doheny was convicted for giving a bribe. Fall, Sinclair, and Doheny were all convicted of trying to defraud the government. The United States Supreme Court ruled that the contracts were illegal and ordered the president to cancel the leases. This scandal will forever be a black eye for the Harding administration, and is one of the biggest corruption scandals in American history."," "],"display_date":"November 22,

drafted the <em>Keating-Owen Child Labor Act of 1916</em> as a means to regulate youth labor.  This Act was named for its sponsors, Democratic Representatives Edward Keating and Robert Latham Owen.  The Act prohibited the shipment or delivery for shipment for interstate or foreign sale of any goods or services that were produced by laborers under the age of 14 in a factory, shop or cannery and under the age of 16 in a mine.  Also, child laborers under 16 years old could only work from 6am to 7pm and not for more than eight hours a day and not more than six days a week.","The Act specified that the U.S. Attorney General, the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Labor would convene a board to publish from time to time uniform rules and regulations to comply with this Act.  To enforce this Act, the Secretary of Labor would assign inspectors to perform inspections of workplaces that produce goods for commerce.  These inspectors would have the authority to make unannounced visits and would be given full access to the facility in question.   Anyone found in violation of this Act or who makes false statements or produces false evidence would be subject to fine and/or imprisonment.","By the early 1900s, census figures estimated that nearly two million children were employed in manufacturing, agriculture, mines, and stores and on city streets.  Most of these workers were under age 14.  They were typically the sons and daughters of poor immigrants helping to support their families.  Children working in factories, mines, mills and on farms were usually subjected to harsh working conditions.  They worked for twelve or more hours a day, and usually seven days a week.  Injuries and illnesses were very common.  Playtime and school were nonexistent for these youngsters.","The issue of child labor had become a concern to many Progressive reformers.  A group of reformers founded the National Labor Committee in 1904.  Their goal was to collect evidence to document the conditions faced by these young workers.  They hired investigators, such as Lewis Hine, to gather this information.","Hine interviewed and photographed countless young child laborers around the country.  He often had to hide his camera and even sneak into the work places to get his shots.  His photographs were very compelling.  The photographic evidence as well as his interviews brought much attention to the overwhelming facts of this very real problem.  Hine’s photographs and interviews were used to enlighten Congress to the fact that legislation needed to be introduced to ban the unsafe child labor practices.","Congress had hoped the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act could achieve their objective to rid the industrial market of immoral child labor practices.  This was not to be.  The Supreme Court ruled in Hammer vs. Dagenhart that the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act was unconstitutional in 1918.  They found that Congress could not regulate interstate commerce above the states’ right to regulate local trade as stated in the 10th amendment of the U.S. Constitution.  This was a big blow to Congress, the Progressive reformers and Lewis Hine.  They all had worked very hard to bring an end to an appalling American reality.","They would all have to wait to finally see real regulation of child labor practices in the U.S. until the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.  This Act successfully survived through Supreme Court challenges and even led to the reversal of Hammer vs. Dagenhart in 1941.  The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is still law today."],"display_date":"September 1, 1916","search_date":"1916-09-01","locations":[{"id":17283,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of

Great War in Europe had already lasted much longer than anticipated by the early months of 1917. Despite a long-standing precedent of neutrality in the face of foreign conflict, the United States steeled itself for the possibility of war. On February 26, 1917, the <em>New York Times</em> ran an article entitled \"Suffragist Pledge Aid to the Nation\" covering the National American Woman Suffrage Association’s pledge to aid in the war effort if the U.S. became involved in the conflict overseas. The Suffrage Association had met the day before in Washington, D.C. and had drafted a letter to President Woodrow Wilson promising the services of two million suffragists.","The <em>New York Times</em> cited the contents of the letter, which expressed the suffragists’ belief that \"the settlement of international difficulties by bloodshed is unworthy of the twentieth century\" [1]. However, despite their opposition to the war, the suffragists would remain loyal to the U.S. government and fulfill their civic duty to support the soldiers and the war effort. In anticipation that the U.S. might enter the war, the Suffrage Association planned to form a committee of representatives from each suffragist organization to ready them for war work, such as collecting rations and medical supplies. Additionally, the <em>Times</em> reported that a new bureau would coordinate the placement of women in the positions left empty by men shipped out to fight.","The suffragists’ letter to President Wilson made clear that they had \"no intention of laying aside [their] constructive, forward work\" to obtain voting rights for the female citizens of the United States [1]. At the same time the suffragists were pledging their loyalty to the nation, they were also planning a demonstration at the White House the following Sunday. According to the <em>Times</em> article, women from all over the country would rally together in support of a constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote. At the same meeting that produced the letter to President Wilson, the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage raised $12,500 in support of the demonstration outside of his offices. Later the same week, the Woman’s Party and the Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage would be merged following another convention in Washington, D.C.","The <em>New York Times</em> article highlights some of the paradoxes of the time period in which it was published. Women were told to be prepared to fill men’s positions on the home front while the men were fighting overseas, and yet were not accorded the same rights as those men. They were encouraged to be loyal to the U.S. government, but had no say in choosing that government. During this time period, women were expected to be patriotic and functional, but not political or radical. Opponents to women’s suffrage frequently made comparisons between the suffragist movement and socialism, implying that the two were irretrievably intertwined. However, during World War One, suffragists rationed food, volunteered for the Red Cross, and worked in factories that produced munitions [2]. Their continued loyalty and patriotism deflated arguments that voting rights for women opened the doorway for radical socialist pacifism.","Ironically, suffragist actions to support the war effort fulfilled the female Red Cross volunteer ideal presented in pro-war propaganda. Organizations such as the National American Woman’s Suffrage Association featured in the <em>New York Times</em> article tried to prove women’s \"fitness for suffrage and equal citizenship rights by loyally supporting the government’s military preparedness and war policies\" [3]. Through the patriotic efforts of suffragists during World War I, American citizens came to accept that women were entitled to equal voting rights. Their ability to step in and keep the country functioning while a large portion of the male population fought valiantly overseas proved that suffragists were loyal to the United States of America and sought to be further enabled to participate in the country’s government."," ","[1] \"Suffragists Pledge Aid to the Nation.

As a result, they were captivated by its spread.  Each individual country hoped it would be spared and that distance from the initial outbreak would suffice as protection.  Americans watched as the disease originated in India and quickly spread to Egypt.  From there, the disease alarmingly spread to the Mediterranean, beginning European infection with Italy and eventually France. By September, 1865 newspapers viewed the disease’s spread to England to be inevitable.  This left the Atlantic as the United States’ only defense.  However, distance only prolonged American’s fears. It did not protect cities such as Washington D.C. from cholera’s inevitable arrival.  As the Daily National Republican stated, “We feel sure, however, that if the cholera comes this way, no quarantine, no dententions, no fumigation, no lines of demarcations will keep it out.”  The one bastion of American hope remained very similar to that experienced in previous outbreaks.  The reports dispersing from Cairo claimed cholera only affected “those who live in close, confined quarters” with “no drainage” and most importantly “general bad living”.  Those who drank, were prone to excess, and morally depraved were viewed as the only ones susceptible.","With these signs abroad Americans personified cholera as a malign evil and sought preemptive preparation as the cure to this disease.  In a poem from 1831 republished in an edition of the Daily National Republican, the disease was named a “pale white horse” spreading misery and death throughout the land.  Strategies included cleaning of both physical and moral garbage.  The main sources of information in 1865 were reports coming from afflicted nations and Europe.  United States papers took these claims as truth and reprinted them for their readers.  Overall, 1865 marked a tenuous time for Washington D.C. residents and other Americans as they were forced to watch cholera spread without halt, inevitably heading towards their shores."],"display_date":"September 1985","search_date":"1985-09-15","locations":[{"id":40259,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":1316,"tag":"washington d.c."},{"id":1315,"tag":"cholera"}],"course":{"name":"Nineteenth Century Urban Epidemics","school":"Furman University","course_id":82,"school_id":4}},{"id":5483,"title":"Professor Morse's Electric Telegraph - A review of the operation of the technology as well as the impact it had on the control and difusion of information.","course_id":85,"status":"P","start_date":"1842-08-01","end_date":"1842-08-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Alfred Vail waited for the message to arrive on the wire. His superior, Mr. Morse, had prepared the paper, and was about to send the message from the Supreme Court in Washington D.C.","The demonstration that was about to be undertaken was one that would introduce to America the ability to send a message via the new electrical telegraph. In August 1842, the <em>Tribune</em> described the operation of the telegraph and subsequent transmission of information via the electrical currents that made the communication possible.","The <em>Tribune </em>proposed that a person in Washington that wished to communicate to a second individual located in New York could do so in nearly an instant. The telegraph machine would utilize a signaling alphabet, called Morse Code, to send a series dots and dashes that could be converted to a message made up of Roman Letters. The receiving machine would then write the incoming message with a stylus, in dots and dashes; onto paper that was strapped to the cylinder on the machine. This was made possible by electrical cables that connected the sending and receiving machines and allowed them to exchange bursts of electric current that were controlled by electrified magnets on each machine.","Before the telegraph, there would be a distinct lag in the time between when an event would occur in one city and would be reported in the newspaper in another. During this era it was possible that days would go by in certain towns and cities where the local newspaper would report the following; “No news, No News and None is expected”? The telegraph now provided the potential of making news and other information available at an instant in all corners of the country. Harold Adams Innis, a communications theorist, pointed out that the telegraph removed a specific bias in the control and diffusion of the news. The most important information was always likely to be available in large urban centers but then was simply repeated or re-distributed to the cities and towns that dotted the periphery of these central areas. This fact was very important at the time as the core political authorities at the time were empowered by the fact that controlling information distribution at the center allowed them to completely monopolize the information that was diffused to the small towns and rural areas beyond the geographic centers. Once political control was exercised over the central news sources in the urban areas, the ability to change, twist, spin or misrepresent information further empowered the politicians and monopolies of the press.","The advent of the telegraph, and the ability to transmit a message at nearly 300,000 miles per second turned this experimental machine into much more than just a mysterious object filled with electricity. The telegraph had officially leveled the playing field and marked a turning point for the control over information. This loss of control at the political urban center allowed the regional daily press to escape and become independent. No more was it possible for the state capital or other political center to dominate the news. Now it would be possible to transmit a newspaper message or a portion of a presidential speech in minutes to everyone, enabling more local analysis of information that reflected the thoughts and ideologies of local inhabitants.","The <em>Tribune </em>also clearly posited other fears that many had in relation to the telegraph technology at this time. If the government did not seize the opportunity to control and manage the Telegraph, private industry would use it to bring competition, or even an end, to the Post Office and Pony Express. What was not realized at the time is that the power had already shifted and the birth of “Electric Media” had changed the playing field."],"display_date":"August 1842","search_date":"1842-08-16","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1365,"tag":"Telecommunication"},{"id":1362,"tag":"Telegraph"},{"id":1363,"tag":"Diffusion of Information"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":85,"school_id":43}},{"id":5495,"title":"Abraham Lincoln’s view on James K.

This act made it illegal for someone to obtain, distribute, or possess information relating to the national defense of the United States, her dependents, or those under her control or jurisdiction. The act also made it illegal to aid, conspire, or share any information or documents relating to national defense. Punishment for these crimes included a fine not to exceed $10,000 and/or a two year prison sentence. The Espionage Act also made it illegal to make false statements or otherwise interfere with military operation, including but not limited to causing any type of disloyalty, mutiny, promoting insubordination, or refusal of duty, and willingly obstructing recruitment. Punishment for these crimes carried a fine not to exceed $10,000 and/or twenty years in prison.  The act even extended to those that conspired with a group, but did not participate, and those that failed to report someone that was suspected of any of these crimes. These crimes carried the same punishment as those previously mentioned.","Within the first few months of the Espionage Act, roughly nine hundred people were imprisoned. Public figures such as Eugene V. Debs, Philip Randolph, and Emma Goldman were imprisoned under the act for various crimes. Many were imprisoned for speaking out against the act and for criticizing whether or not it violated the First Amendment. Arrests and imprisonments even included conscientious objectors to World War I, with four-hundred fifty being imprisoned.  <em>The Masses,</em> a socialist journal, was not immune to suspicions either. In 1918, authorities claimed that some of its articles and cartoons undermined the United States’ war effort. Legal action eventually forced the journal to stop publication. Then attorney general A. Mitchell Palmer and his assistant, J. Edgar Hoover, used the Espionage Act and Sedition Act, passed the year before, to deport immigrants that were believed to be involved in left-wing politics. In total, two-hundred forty-five people were deported, primarily to Russia. These policies and deportations continued during the Red Scare of 1919-1920, when nearly fifteen-hundred people were arrested for what was viewed as disloyalty.","Citations:"],"display_date":1917,"search_date":"1917-07-02","locations":[{"id":17283,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1111,"tag":"World War I"},{"id":1193,"tag":"J.

By 1957, just a teenager’s birth away from the end of the world’s largest and grandest war, the Suez Crisis prompted a reaction against communism.","Eisenhower explained how “Russia’s rulers have long sought to dominate the Middle East.” This was true with the Czars and it was true with the Bolsheviks. The Czars’ conflicts happened at around the same time as the Puritan witch hunts in the New World. This tale was described in Arthur Miller’s <em>The Crucible</em>, a play which mirrored the Communist witch hunts during the McCarthy-led Red Scare. Just like in Salem centuries before, American aggrandizers executed baseless attacks to further their own power, leaving the victims helpless and, more often than not, dead.","As Eisenhower discussed power politics between the United States and the Soviet Union, so too did Americans play games of political chicken with each other. During the televised Army-McCarthy hearings, the Wisconsin senator used bullying tactics, reckless dishonesty, and a willingness to do and say anything in order to grow in power. His tastelessness knew no bounds, so much so that at one point an individual asked McCarthy, “Have you no decency, sir?”","Eisenhower also discussed the religious significance of the region around the Suez Canal. As Eisenhower mentioned the word “Christianity,” no doubt millions of dollars’ worth of money were being printed and minted with the words “In God We Trust”. This recent addition, along with the new inclusion of “Under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance, was only a way to fight back against the “godlessness” of the Soviet Union.","The world changed during Eisenhower’s reign. Never before had a single weapon been able to wipe a city off the map. Never before had American women been given so much freedom only to have it taken away once the boys returned from war. Never before had peaceful demonstrations – bus boycotts, of all things – rocked the concepts of segregation and American racism to their very cores.","In his speech Eisenhower mentioned “the subjugation of Hungary by naked armed force”, yet he did not mention the Little Rock Nine – the group of students that had to be led into an integrated school by the 101<sup>st</sup> Airborne. Foreign militaries were not the only ones marching across their own lands.","The United States did not hold the Arabs in high regard. They were described as lacking “a modern social system, a flourishing economic life, and a democratic political structure” and were thus “vulnerable to communistic exploitation”. But more important than the containment of Communism was the control of oil – not for the United States directly, but for the European components of NATO. One can surmise that should Europe lose Arabian oil, the Marshall Plan would crumble and, bit by bit, country by country, the democratic western powers would turn to the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact for help. If this had happened, the United States would be completely alone in a two-front war: it would have to fight the Cold War in Europe and the social war within its own boundaries."],"display_date":"January 5, 1957","search_date":"1957-01-05","locations":[{"id":28396,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":1516,"tag":"Eisenhower"},{"id":1517,"tag":"USSR"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5600,"title":"Muhammad Ali: How One Man's Dissent Illustrates the Story of the American Opposition of the Vietnam War","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/67","end_date":"12/31/67","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["During the Cold War, the Vietnam War was probably considered one of America's more unnecessary and counterproductive ideas to stop the spreading of Communism. As the American government continued the war with little thought to whom it effected on both sides of the spectrum many people both Black and White, poor and rich and overall different came together as one to protest the continuation of a war that was causing nothing but trouble. Draft calls were going strong, racial tension was still an issue and nobody was sure of what kind of future the next day would bring. So how did the Vietnam War resistance movement affect the war and the American people? In result of this war, the American people found renowned courage and power in its younger generation yet forced them to come face to face with uncomfortable yet very real issues that neither the government nor its people were ready to resolve.","In 1967, Muhammad Ali, formerly known as Cassius Clay, refused the draft induction into the Vietnam War and was charged with draft evasion, with the threat of facing prison time. His defiance against the Selective Services included his position as a minister in the Muslim religion, which he believe gave him the exemption from war as a clergyman and claiming himself as a victim of racial discrimination within his own country. While both of these reasons were dismissed in court, Ali had already made up his mind that whether he was legally justified or not he would not serve in the army. The author, Tom Wicker, dismisses Ali as one man who does not pose a problem to the approval or disapproval of the draft let alone the entire war. In reality the fact that one famous man gained national attention for his opposition to the Vietnam draft only zoomed in on a problem that was plaguing the nation, particularly its younger generation. However, Wicker does point out a valid concern and question for the American people and its government and that is if one man feels this way then what would happen if hundreds of thousands of other young people decide to not only disagree with the draft but refuse to be drafted themselves? If that many male dissenters decided to refrain from joining the army what would happen to a country entrenched in democratic ideals rolled in the belief of rights and freedom? As Wicker indicates it is one thing when the American government attempts to imprison one dissenter but what about hundreds of thousands? To do something of such extremity, would put the United States at a hypocritical angle and turn them into the very Communist they so very much opposed. And while Wicker does not believe the famous boxer was trying to spark an uprise, it is obvious that Muhammad Ali as a young Black man, was the embodiment of whom was against the draft and why they were against it.","While Ali was no college student, a large portion of the Vietnam dissenters consisted of college students and young people, who unlike their parents in WWII who believed in the defeat of the Nazis for the greater good of the U.S., saw the Vietnam War as gruesome and an atrocious assault that involved the sacrifice of their lives and freedom including the slaughter of innocent Vietnamese peasants. How could these young people not feel threatened at this point by their own government when the average age of soldiers being sent to Vietnam was 19? So as the war dragged on and more people lost their lives, Americans began losing patience with a war they felt would forever drag on and a government who were showing no sign of stopping. As the war raged on so did the radicalism of the anti-war, anti-draft Vietnam movement. Students began their protests in college campuses and soon enough various campuses across the nation were hosts key events such as the March 24, 1965 “T-Day” where the University of Michigan hosted lectures and seminars opposing the war in Vietnam with more than 3,000 people in attendance. Young people were turning their college campuses into a type of college government because they understood that the outcome or even lengthening of this war would effect their futures directly and graduation dates meant a direct ticket to Vietnam. After the national “T-Day” came the Antiwar March to Washington D.C. on April 15th of the same year. While the 25,000 protestors consisted of professors, clergy, and peace organizations it was the college students and young people who dominated the scene. This movement was more than today's stereotype of hippies in communes; these were protestors who came from middle class suburbs, with parents who were professionals. They were resisters who viewed the war with a morality derived from earlier movements and understood the professional and political moves they made were never to be made thoughtlessly. In other words they used their education and where they derived said education to their advantage.","Among these students and young people were Black organizations and peoples as part of the anti-draft and anti-war movement, however their reasoning was completely different than that of their fellow White protestors. When Muhammad Ali resisted the draft, African-Americans paid close attention to just how the government would handle a famous Black celebrity during a time where racial tension was still an unfortunate factor in the U.S. When Ali boldly exclaimed “No Viet Cong ever called me a nigger,” these words demonstrated the emotions and anger many Black men felt towards the American government. Why fight for a country that still treated them as second class citizens? As the boxing authorities stripped him of his titles further anger towards what Blacks believed to be a racist motive became fuel for the war opposition. Ali became motivation for many Black Americans who were not already involved in the movement to do something not only about the war but the racism and discrimination that plagued them. One of the more startling effects of discrimination during Vietnam were the disproportionate percentages of just whom was being sent off to war and what positions they were being put in. For Americans with higher education levels they had a better chance of receiving office jobs compared to the 80 percent of ground troops which consisted of lower class or minority peoples meaning African Americans would get the short end of the stick. More Black troops were being sent into more dangerous areas than their White counterparts taking their opposition of the war to a different level. This level consisted with Black males fighting for their gender roles as a minority in a world ruled by Whites while dealing with the Selective Services forcing their own people to fight and stand up for a country that would never stand up for them.","A vast majority (including the protestors of that time) believe this specific movement to be part of the reason for the end of the war. This theory has been a particularly controversial one and while the Vietnam War resistance was not the first, it did make a significant impact according to Stephen Kohn who credits the protestors with collapsing the Selective Service's draft system. It is also believed that while the resistance and the war raged on together, many war decisions were taken into account thanks to the peace movement. For example the antiwar movement played a role in the decision to not bomb North Vietnam during the Johnson administration. The movement might have also played an unseen role on the attitudes of protestors and how policymakers reacted to those attitudes with the Kuwait War in the 90's. There was conflict over how the U.S. should handle aggression towards the people of Kuwait and during the Kuwait antiwar movement, many old slogans from the Vietnam War were resurrected such as “Make Love, Not War.”20 Between the antiwar and anti-draft movement, thousands of men who burned their draft cards and the public dissent of one famous Black man the closing of the Vietnam War was possibly brought closer. They might have also all been a part of an indirect influence for future generations that protest America's wars and inevitably teach the American government that it is far better to have the approval of their people than to win the war under opposition."],"display_date":1967,"search_date":"1967-07-02","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":291,"tag":"Cold War"},{"id":1478,"tag":"Draft"},{"id":1554,"tag":"Vietnam War"},{"id":1555,"tag":"Anti Draft"},{"id":1556,"tag":"Anti War"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5601,"title":"The “Me” Generation: How Shirley Chisholm, Harvey Milk and the Weathermen Fought Against the 1970's Fantasy of Perfection","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The 1970's became fertile ground for public outrage and violence against the American establishment due to national economic stress, assassinations of public figures, the Vietnam War, and other political scandals. By the 70's it seemed to a significant amount of Americans, that what the government wanted to portray and what they were realistically taking care of were two very different truths. What the U.S. wanted American society to consist of were upper middle class or rich white individuals (preferably male) with conservative, Judeo-Christian beliefs. That these people would pray and worship a God that often times were one and the same as the American government. The ideology of the American mentality included not just a warped view of a uniquely American religious stance, but a stance where all Americans should be the same and think the alike. Where there was no poverty, no back talking or disagreeing with the government and everybody was heterosexual with one wife and their 2.5 children living in suburbia. And if in fact, “those” types of people did exist Americans should do everything in their power to either push them aside or make them disappear completely. The American government did not want or feel that they needed blacks with opinions let alone a black woman making her way through Congress. America only saw the “sin” in the power that the gay community and its leaders held in California. And when America was tired of minorities of all kinds, it was looking towards a vibrant, educated white youth to carry the torch, what they got instead were empowered white kids enraged by a government unwilling to pull out of Vietnam. While America was working hard towards a “Me” generation where the majority's problems did not matter and a fantasy of “what ifs” was put in its place, there were several, gutsy individuals and groups desperately trying to break that mold.","In 1972, Shirley Chisholm, the ultimate physical symbol fighting against the ideals of a “Me” generation, became the first African-American woman running as part of a major-party candidacy for the Democratic ticket and nomination of President of the United States. In the 1970's, America was overflowing with an ignorance towards racial divides although physical, up close and sometimes violent proof stated the opposite that things in fact were not alright. Her running came during a time where racial tension was high and what was considered an equal and fair opportunity for all held different feelings and definitions for both blacks and whites. The backdrop of her run was politically marked by examples of attempted equality like the Voting Rights Act which created an effort to integrate race relations in the South and outlaw voting discrimination against African-Americans and the Civil Rights Act which outlawed major discrimination against minorities. But what the United States wanted to project and achieve was not the social reality of what seemed to be a very bleak existence of blacks dealing with unemployment rates three times higher than whites and black anger increasing with the establishment of black militant organizations such as the Black Panther Party. Her very physical being, went against what made the American government and a dominating white society comfortable. She was a woman and she was black, to put both of those “concepts” together was a whole complex and intense conundrum for the American people to deal with. On the one hand she explains how entering into Congress for the first time, the white Congressmen had never had a black woman enter into their political platform and she was automatically shunned. On the other, even among black groups and the black community she was shun due to black men being intimidated and threatened by the fact that she was a woman. To bring that together and give her an intelligent mind and voice to state what was wrong with American society and give her a national platform on which to speak, broke the mold of a society with a “it's all about me” mentality to realize there was great unjust among blacks and sometimes equal discrimination against women. So what she needed black Americans to do, especially black women, in such a time of confusion and hardships was to go against the grain as she had done and use their power to fight not physically or violently but to use what many whites dreaded...their vote. She brought to the forefront what was not being said in Congress, that over 50% of the nation's budget (her estimate was 75%) was being used on a foreign, immoral war yet the true war raged on domestically with a nation divided amongst itself.","Unlike Shirley Chisholm, who was a more obvious example for minority groups that made white people uncomfortable, was the less obvious Harvey Milk. At first glance he is who the American government and society wanted to continue to uplift. He was a financially comfortable, white male, a veteran from the U.S. navy, running his own business in a middle class neighborhood. However his ideals and sexuality both directly and indirectly did not line up with what society was supposed to be like. Harvey Milk was a gay man which in and of itself went against the traditional Judeo-Christian idealism of America. To make matters worse, he was also the first openly gay politician in San Francisco which also went against what American society. What society wanted and expected was if a person was indeed gay, he or she should keep it themselves because to be gay in the 1970's was taboo and illegal. In the backdrop of the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York which set off the modern, openly gay liberation movement, Harvey Milk would become a main leader in San Francisco's newly gay political community. But America did not want to deal with gay people they in fact wanted to get rid of them with political bills such as Proposition 6, which was a state wide gesture that allowed the firing of any teacher in public schools who was gay and any other public school faculty that was pro-gay. Milk fought against such openly discriminative political documents but wanted to make it clear that while he fought for gays, lesbians and transgendered/transsexual peoples, his political fight was for all peoples who were considered minorities and were underrepresented in San Francisco. He said what so many Americans at the time were afraid to speak of which was the realization that gays walked among them and no, they did not have signs written on their foreheads to let others know of their whereabouts, so the American people needed to learn to have respect and tolerance for all no matter who they came across. Milk's perfect example of the political and religious agenda set against gay Americans came in an interview where he said that he understood who he was up against but that the “white, wealthy, non-gay establishment would have to deal with him; that is truly an incredible and powerful position to be in.” Harvey Milk and his political position would not allow an ignorant mentality to continue to place its hold over the minds of the American people but wanted instead to change what Americans felt so uncomfortable with concerning gays in the first place. Although he was assassinated in 1978 by another San Francisco city supervisor, Dan White, his ideals would leave a permanent mark in California, especially in the San Francisco area. This mark would go on to change the political ideals, when a decade after Milk's assassination, a poll would show that San Francisco's gay community felt that they had a “moderate amount” or “a lot” of influence over local government compared to only 48% of the straight respondents who believed the same sentiment. And only two years prior to that poll, a gay San Francisco columnist wrote, “Politicians can be destroyed by the gay vote. As long as we keep our vote, they're going to kiss our ass for a long time.”","Probably the most confusing to the American government and public was the formation of the Weather Underground also known as the Weathermen. They were a part of the anti-draft and anti-war movement of the late 60's to mid 70's with extremist views that believed in “bringing the war home” by bombing banks and government buildings. Their ultimate goal was to overtake and overthrow the U.S. government due to their refusal to pull out of the Vietnam War and their abuse towards blacks. What made them so confusing to the American public was because of what they stood for due to who they were. They were not black like Shirley Chisholm nor were they gay (for the most part, not including their sexual experimentation with the same sex during orgies) like Harvey Milk, trying to organize a type of LGBT rights organization. These were mainly upper middle class college students with rich parents (some of those parents were even local politicians) who basically had the world at their feet and if they wanted to live a comfortable lifestyle, they could very well do so. There only real issue was being drafted into the Vietnam War but even if that happened with the connections and the money there parents had they were more than likely to gain “cushy” jobs that did not require front line action. Unlike their poorer, black, Hispanic, and Asian counterparts who constituted more than 80% of American ground troops. So what was there problem? They had everything they wanted and they were everything that the U.S. wanted to portray their young people as. The U.S. did not want to deal with underprivileged, ethnic youths, but who they wanted ended up being the kind of people that constituted the Weathermen. As President Nixon continued to ignore the peoples cry that the conflict in Vietnam was immoral and unjust, the Weathermen, once a non-violent group who took after the teachings of peaceful demonstrations from Martin Luther King Jr. were now taking after the Black Panther Party, sharing in their anger and setting up recruitment just like them and even supporting them by endorsing them to the mass public. Their point was not to do the complete opposite of what was expected of these young white kids just for the sake of rebelling but because this white ideology was destroying the nation. They were going to side with the black community and they refused to allow their privileges as whites to add to the problem in America anymore. It was hard for Americans to understand the terrorist actions of other Americans bombing their own buildings but the message behind these attacks were not just for the sake of blowing up a building it was to get people in the U.S. to realize that this was not just a foreign war that did not effect them unless they were drafted, but that if they refused to stop the war then indeed it did effect them because they were part of the problem. And the problem was very much real no matter how much Americans wanted to ignore it with companies such as Dow Chemical, for example, using technological and chemical warfare like napalm, used to kill innocent and impoverished Vietnamese. Or the U.S. government breaking and entering into one of the leaders of the Black Panthers home, Fred Hampton, and assassinating him in his bed while he slept. These were kids who were angry with what their white government was doing both to its own people and internationally; kids who were willing to recruit white youth to join in, taking down what many would say as their “own” people (other whites). The Weathermen were trying to put the issue of what was going on in the faces of Americans first by peaceful marches and when the problem only escalated domestically and internationally, they felt they had no choice but to show them a tiny part of the violence occurring in Vietnam by turning to domestic terrorism. The acts they committed were only a physical embodiment of their ideals which as one of the faces of the Weathermen, Bernardine Dohrn stated, “I believe that there will come a day when white people will have to make uncomfortable decisions and learn to side with the Vietnamese and Black people.”","The United States in the 1970's has been argued to be a “Me” generation and while it did strive hard to get there and in many ways and areas of the country it was, there was a much stronger argument for all of the things that went wrong. As the nation continued on a one noted idea of what it wanted to be and portray to what they believed to be a corrupt world, the American people were becoming excessively bothered by a communism induced paranoia the country held. Since that was its main focus everything and everyone else fell by the wayside. What the people needed was stronger leadership and a sense of an empathetic community so that all might understand each other and gain an equal political foothold. So people with a voice, whether they had extreme views like the Weathermen or more subdued ways to fight like Shirley Chisholm and Harvey Milk rose to power not because they were trying to divide or disrupt the country as many thought (including the government) but to stop the advancement of a country that had let its people down and were allowing them to believe, on top of all the problems they had, that they were a perfect society at the center of a very inferior world."," "],"display_date":1970,"search_date":"1970-07-02","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":34924,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"}],"tags":[{"id":546,"tag":"Homosexuality"},{"id":3,"tag":"African-Americans"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":1556,"tag":"Anti War"},{"id":1554,"tag":"Vietnam War"},{"id":1557,"tag":"Terrorism"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5603,"title":"The 1970s Through Film","course_id":88,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/70","end_date":"12/31/79","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The 1970’s were a tumultuous time in American history. Movements regarding the war in Vietnam, civil rights, and gay rights escalated as the United States entrenched itself in economic crises and political divisions. As these movements gained momentum, the political system as well as the prevailing social notions of the time attempted to quash any semblance of progressive thinking until the end of the decade. Three documentaries about the time - <em>The Weather Underground, Chisholm ’72,</em> and <em>The Times of Harvey Milk </em>- focus on the major political voices of the 1970s and how they were confronted, spurned, or ignored. By analyzing these three works, it can be deduced that the 70s were a period of social and political growth and examination in the youth and minority populations that the older generation of society was attempting to supplant with traditional Cold War values.","By 1970, the war in Vietnam had escalated and Nixon’s campaign of “Vietnamization” had begun. Under Nixon, the Vietnam War saw an increase in strategic bombings of supposed communist strongholds and the “incursion” into Cambodia with 25,000 U.S. and South Vietnamese troops. This increased activity in Indochina prompted a growth in the anti-war movement, which had already gained considerable momentum. Students for a Democratic Society - the major student body anti-war organization during the Vietnam War - was already at 300,000 members and growing. Privileged college students began to rebel over war crimes committed by the government under their pretext of protecting the world from communism.","The 2002 film <em>The Weather Underground</em> focused on the exploits of the Weathermen, a domestic insurgent agency formed in the summer of 1969. They were the militant arm of the SDS and sought to overthrow the United States government on account of the civilian casualties in Vietnam. With the slogan “Bring the War Home,” the thirty-odd Weathermen wanted to instill fear in the government that was controlled by, what they perceived, as old, corrupt politicians from an irrelevant, bygone generation. Nixon responded to this radical minority with reciprocal contempt. After the Greenwich Townhouse Explosion in May 1970, the Weathermen went underground and started a strategic bombing campaign, all the while being pursued by the FBI. After the war ended and many Weathermen came out of hiding, few went to prison on the account of the FBI’s illegal actions to track them down in the first place. Simultaneously, vice president Spiro Agnew denounced the anti-war protesters as “traitors, thieves and perverts.” It seemed the administration’s decision to marginalize the movement had adverse effects as the Weathermen’s coordinated bombings of government buildings skyrocketed until the end of the war in ’75. These practices, coupled with the release of the Pentagon Papers in ‘71, sewed seeds of distrust and frustration with how the government was conducting business not only in Vietnam, but also within the system itself. The prevailing Cold War policy of containment propagated in the 1950s and 1960s had permeated society as well as foreign policy. It was finally met with resistance in the 1970s to the dismay of Washington, and thus they made every attempt to stamp it out.","Like the Weathermen, the campaigning of Shirley Chisholm in the 1972 election was an indicator of a changing sociopolitical climate, but unlike the Weathermen, forces within the movement itself halted its momentum. The 2004 film <em>Chisholm ’72: Unbought & Unbossed</em> illustrated exactly how the Democratic Party was operating during the 1972 election and how massive and divided the party –and society - was against such a unified political platform as the Republicans’. Chisholm herself ran for the rights of women and African Americans but also for a withdrawal from Vietnam and the resolution of the busing integration controversy. However, her gender mixed with the color of her skin greatly hampered her support base as the male-dominated Black Panther party was reluctant to back her, as well as the feminist movement, which generally marginalized the voices of black women. By the time of the democratic nomination, all of Chisholm’s supporters in Congress like Ron Dellums ended up supporting George McGovern of South Dakota for the nomination. The 70s were showing signs of progressive, liberal attitudes, but were being hampered all the way by the established government. Nixon simply appealed to those sick of the costly New Deal social programs and won a landslide victory with 61 percent of the popular vote. It seems like all would be lost in terms of progressive ideals in the 1970s, but as the decade wore on and Nixon was impeached and resigned, people began to think that the established order could be openly challenged without severe repercussions.","Enter Harvey Milk: district 5 Supervisor of San Francisco in 1978. In the documentary <em>The Times of Harvey Milk</em>, Milk’s exploits and contributions to the San Francisco gay community are revealed, along with the events that precipitated his assassination, and the subsequent outrage over the verdict of his killer. Reflecting the desperation of fellow supervisor Dan White who murdered both Milk and San Francisco mayor George Moscone, the established sociopolitical system of the United States by 1978 was buckling under the increasing momentum of liberal views and progressive ideals. Milk was one of many activists who were fighting tooth and nail for moral, social, and political equality. One of the major planks of the Democratic Party in the 1976 election was advocating of equal rights groups. President Carter publicly endorsed gay rights, which would have been impossible even earlier that decade. However, Milk and other activists’ primary opponent during this transitional period were evangelical fundamentalists who were still clinging to the old Cold War system of control. Milk’s crowning moment as Supervisor was his opposing of California Proposition 6, or the Briggs Initiative, which would ban gays and lesbians from working in public schools. Milk was able to rally public support against the bill and even get open support from prominent politicians like Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. The main indicator for the closing of the decade, however, is Milk’s assassination itself. For a gay man to be put into a position of such power within the city of San Francisco, the people had to have been open to radical changes in infrastructure. Unfortunately, the last years of a dying system seem to be the most chaotic. In this case, Christian fundamentalism had a major resurgence, as people were fearful of the state of the established order. It was this resurgence that opposed Harvey Milk and went leniently on his killer Dan White, but the subsequent widespread outrage over the court verdict showed that they were becoming a shrinking minority.","Was the 70s characterized by repression and disengagement? Some would argue that it is, but the strength in the progressive organizations paved the way for an unprecedented amount of liberal thinking so far seen in the Cold War. The documentaries <em>The Weather Underground</em>, <em>Chisholm ’72</em>, and <em>The Times of Harvey Milk</em>, showed a decade in transition, a transition hampered heavily by a system of political and societal control refined over thirty years of Cold War conflict. If that system had not been so heavily entrenched in the minds of America’s older citizens at that time, the 70s would have been a period of growth instead of repression and turmoil"],"display_date":"1970 - 1979","search_date":"1974-12-31","locations":[{"id":34924,"lat":37.7029266937,"lng":-123.005394924,"zoom":11,"place":"San Francisco, California"},{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"},{"id":34445,"lat":41.8399513458,"lng":-87.8166666032,"zoom":9,"place":"Cook, Illinois"}],"tags":[{"id":1554,"tag":"Vietnam War"},{"id":1560,"tag":"The 1970s"},{"id":1561,"tag":"1972 Election"}],"course":{"name":"United States Since 1945","school":"Rollins College","course_id":88,"school_id":5}},{"id":5624,"title":"Prohibition and the Whiskey Rebellion","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"1/16/20","end_date":"1/16/20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 13, 1927, the <em>New York Times</em> published an article entitled “Wet and Dry Talk Heard in 1791: Arguments Used in the Whisky Rebellion Crisis Are Like Today’s,” which sought to highlight similarities between the 1790s Whiskey Rebellion and the events of Prohibition in the 1920s. Much like the events of the Whiskey Rebellion, the period of Prohibition caused citizens to actively protest the new law, disregard the authority of enforcement officers, and become concerned about the legitimacy of the newly enacted law. Prohibition was enacted on January 16, 1920, following the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America [1]. Prohibition defined the manufacturing, sale, and transportation of alcohol to be illegal. This significant change in national law came about at the beginning of the “Roaring Twenties,” further complicating the Americans’ already challenging lives. The government’s efforts to ban manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcohol nationwide caused an enormous number of Americans to take part in the illegal smuggling and transport of the product.","The Whiskey Rebellion came about in 1791 following a proposal made to Congress by Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton, in which he requested that whiskey be taxed by the United States government [2]. This law was proposed to help pay down the national debt, which the government owed to bondholders, as well as to decrease excess consumption of alcohol by Americans [3]. Whiskey in the 1790s, much like alcohol in general in the 1920s, was used as a means for relaxing and celebrating overcoming the difficulties of life. The taxation of whiskey caused opponents to question the intentions of the U.S. government, and oppose enforcement of the tax. Americans had recently fought the American Revolution, in part due to taxes imposed by Great Britain, and were now questioning why it was required that the tax on whiskey be honored[4]. As with Prohibition, concern of the new amendment’s legality led to great disregard of the authority of Congress in regions such as western Pennsylvania, where much of the whiskey was produced.","Enforcement of the tax was comparable to that of the enforcement of Prohibition.  Enforcement officers were deployed to help ensure that the tax was being honored, and that Americans were not refusing to pay.  The <em>New York Times</em> article from 1927 argued that the task of both the collectors of 1791 and the enforcement agents of 1920 were “equally dangerous and unprofitable” [5]. Both enforcement services were vastly disregard by citizens, and in some cases mistreated.  Despite the official title as “law enforcement” officers, Prohibition agents and other public officials often took part in the movement and use of alcohol during the course of prohibition, while tax collectors during the Whiskey Rebellion were sometimes tarred and feathered [6].","Both laws encouraged large numbers of Americans to disregard and violate them [7]. Publications produced during the time of Prohibition claimed that the popular response to Prohibition in the 1920s was similar to some Americans behavior in the 1790s, that the congressmen had “consulted dusty files” to support their theory [8]. The impact that the Eighteenth Amendment had on the United States can be seen as extremely devastating. As with many laws, supporters were faced with violators and resistance groups. Establishments such as “speakeasies” were underground drinking locations where citizens and even some public officials during the Prohibition Era would congregate to relax and enjoy alcoholic beverages.  The underground drinking establishments were being supplied by multiple illegal transporting groups, causing alcohol to be illegally imported across the border from neighboring countries such as Canada [9]. Public officials were often in attendance, presenting a degree of corruption in the law’s enforcement.","The tax on whiskey was eventually in repealed after 1800, following years of resistance by the American people.  Prohibition, following a similar route, was ultimately ended through the result of the 1933 ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment, which both repealed the Eighteenth Amendment and placed alcohol laws in the hands of the states [10]."," ","[1] “Prohibition in the United States,” <em>1920-30.com </em>http://www.1920-30.com/prohibition/ (accessed 24 Oct. 2012)","[2] “Insurrection in Western Pennsylvania: The Whiskey Rebellion,” <em>Papers of the War Department</em> http://wardepartmentpapers.org/blog/?p=285 (accessed 24 Oct. 2012)","[3] <em>New York Times, </em>“Wet and Dry Talk Heard in 1791: Arguments Used in the “Whisky Rebellion Crisis Are Like Today’s,” 13 Feb. 1927, pg. 5","[4] “Insurrection in Western Pennsylvania: The Whiskey Rebellion”","[5] “Wet and Dry Talk Heard in 1791\"","[6] <em>Ibid</em>.","[7] <em>Ibid</em>.","[8] <em>Ibid</em>.","[9] “Prohibition in the United States”","[10] <em>Ibid</em>."],"display_date":"January 16, 1920","search_date":"1920-01-16","locations":[{"id":21755,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":111,"tag":"Prohibition"},{"id":1587,"tag":"Whiskey Rebellion"}],"course":{"name":"America From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":94,"school_id":43}},{"id":5625,"title":"The Wagner Act","course_id":94,"status":"P","start_date":"7/5/35","end_date":"7/5/35","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The Wagner Act had great impact on industrial relations as the first part of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The National Labor Relations Act was created out of the necessity and demand for new foundations of authority and new forms of participation in the political dimension and legalization of industrial life [1]. This statement supports the idea that people are the key to industry and they must be recognized and respected.  Industry must also have clear boundaries that control the behavior of employers and employees in an industrial environment. The National Labor Relations Act consists of three statues enacted by Congress at twelve year intervals: the Wagner Act of 1935 (officially titled the National Labor Relations Act), the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 (officially the Labor-Management Relations Act), and the Landrum-Griffin Act of 1959 (the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act). Since the Taft-Hartley Act and the Landrum-Griffin Act were addendums to the Wagner Act it is correct to refer to the entire act as the \"National Labor Relations Act\" or the \"Labor Act.\" This analysis will focus on the Wagner Act [2].","Before the Wagner Act relations between workers and employers were combative and unsure. The \"Conspiracy Doctrine\" was created as a spurious attempt at making unions illegal by arguing that they created a hostile environment and harmed the rights of employers. Trade unions had more than 200,000 members at a time when hand crafted work was being replaced by better machines and unskilled laborers. Short lived organizations faded quickly like the Knights of Labor and National Union Labor. The American Federation of Labor had taken some critical steps in trying to create better relations but the brutality, strikes and many other tactics remained an ongoing issue.","The government began its process to change some of these issues by passing anti-trust laws such as the Sherman Anti-trust Act and the Clayton Act which contains the embodiment of the law of unlawful restraint and monopolies [3]. President Wilson created a tripartite War Labor Conference that had guiding principles of prohibiting strikes and lockouts and recognizing the rights of the workers to organize in trade unions and to bargain collectively. President Franklin D. Roosevelt took an even more innovative approach with the National Recovery Industrial Act which was designed to get people back to work during the Great Depression. Section 7 (a) was key  to the Wagner Act because it expressed the right of workers to join unions and collective bargain which relaxed the anti-trust laws.","The Wagner Act is organized into subsections entitled: Findings and Policy, National Labor Relations Board, Representatives and Elections, Rights of Employees, Prevention of Unfair Labor Practices and Investigative Powers. The subsection \"Finding and Policy\" clearly promotes commerce and the flow of commerce as in protecting commerce from any harm caused by poor labor relations or unfair labor practices. This section also identifies the need for quality bargaining and encourages the adjudication of friendly disputes. This section also defines terms such as commerce, labor organization, employee and so on [4].","The remaining subsections address the National Labor Relations Board and how it is set up including how many members, how long they serve on the board, salary, appointment and reappointment and hierarchy of the board. The sections and subsections also focus on things employers cannot do such as interfere, discriminating against, restraining, coercing employees or refuse to bargain collectively with employees.","Historian James McGregor Burns said,\" the Wagner Act was the most radical legislation passed during the New Deal, in the sense that it altered the nations politics by vesting massive economic power in organized labor\" [5]. The major polices of the Wagner Act are unfair labor practices, representation elections and related policies. The Wagner Act contains many broad passages but the heart of the message is for the rights of the employee.","The Slogan, \"Let Collective Bargaining Become an Instrument of industrial Peace,\" is a message that supports the idea that the Wagner Act is a revolutionary way of thinking that is not concerned with the legal status but the area of unfair labor practices. The functionality of the Wagner Act is to create conditions for bargaining and formalized agreement [6]. These labor relations have been as important to many in our history as emancipation was to the slave community because it addresses the exploitation of the worker. The labor legislation during the time of the New Deal was revolutionary and it opened doors for a better foundation for labor relations that became a turning point in industrial life as it set new standards for communication and expectations for industrial work. These expectations include (1) drastically limiting the power of the employer to oppose union membership by propaganda, intimidation or discrimination of union members; (2) established machinery for selection by employees of union leaders of their own choosing; (3) proclaimed collective bargaining the preferred road to industrial peace [7]."," ","[1] Philip Selznick<em>, </em><em>Law, Society, and Industrial Justice,</em> 1969, 137-140.","[2] Frank W.

Jefferson served two terms as President of the United States from 1801-1809. He will always be remembered as the principal author to the Declaration of Independence. On October 26, 1826, at the Columbian College in Washington D.C., Jefferson’s eulogy was delivered by a member of the senior class. John W. James writes, “He whom we mourn, was surpassing great; great in intellect; great in stores of knowledge; great in the highest offices a nation could bestow; great throughout his life.”  Jefferson’s political impact certainly resonated throughout the entire nation. He sparked the greatest expansion westward as he was responsible for the Louisiana Purchase. Jefferson, however, passed away on the day the country celebrated their independence.  James explained, “He whom, on the <em>Fourth of July, </em>no one could forget; who fondly hoped was then uniting in the rejoicings of his country, was indeed but hovering over the earth, ready to take his flight to an eternal rest.”","Jefferson, like many white male citizens, enjoyed the freedoms in the early periods of the nineteenth century. He did not live long enough to see his country torn apart by the issue of slavery. Unfortunately, as author James McPherson explains, “Jefferson’s empire for Liberty had become mostly an empire for slavery. Territorial acquisitions since the Revolution had added slave states of Louisiana, Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, and Texas to the republic.” This became the great contradiction of the United States. A country engrained in democratic principles and equality did not preach and practice those principles. John O’Neal, member of <em>Junebug Productions, </em>examines, “The only social system that is more ubiquitous than racism is that which supports and gives definition to the system of male privilege that has come to be called ‘The Patriarchy.” Jefferson, a slave owner himself, contemplated his positioning on slavery. He opposed slavery yet owned slaves. Intentionally or unintentionally, Jefferson’s westward expansion and disposition towards slavery contributed to the racial atmosphere of the United States. As the founding fathers passed away, we remembered them as martyrs and often forgot the flaws of their character. Consequently, the same founding fathers that drafted the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution greatly contradicted the principles they had written in their attitudes towards slavery. Thomas Jefferson was no exception to this example and his impact, whether negative or positive, is forever lasting."],"display_date":"October 4, 1826","search_date":"1826-10-04","locations":[{"id":1272,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":506,"tag":"Thomas Jefferson"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":411,"tag":"Westward Expansion"},{"id":1585,"tag":"Louisiana Purchase"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5679,"title":"<strong>Top Dog at the White House</strong>","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"3/5/21","end_date":"3/5/21","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Though there were many presidential pets before him, Laddie Boy was the first celebrity White House pet.  Few people realize that Laddie Boy, President Warren G.

The Institution opened in Washington, DC in 1855 as the “Government Hospital for the Insane”. A prominent leader in the mental health field, Dorthea Dix, lobbied for the construction of the facility and founded the facility with the goal of providing the \"most humane care and enlightened curative treatment of the insane of the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia.” Before this, many of the patients that could be considered “insane” were simply put in jail and were not receiving the care they needed. The name of the facility was later changed to Saint Elizabeth’s in 1916 because it temporarily provided medical care for wounded soldiers during the Civil War and those that were being treated were reluctant to tell people that they were being cared for at a mental institution. Instead they used the name of the colonial area the hospital was originally built on, Saint Elizabeth’s. Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was the first government-run mental institution in the country and was one of the largest mental institutions in the country. The hospital was a pioneer in mental health care at the time of its existence. At its prime in the 1940’s, Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was home to over 7,000 patients.","Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital now operates with a small fraction of that number of patients, largely due to a certain historical event, the Community Mental Health Act of 1963. This Act, fully titled the “Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963,” promoted community-based health care and provided federal funding for such facilities. One of the main purposes of this act to was provide government assistance “in improving mental health through grants for construction of community mental health centers.” The government began to fund the construction of outpatient facilities in order to allow mental patients to live more normal lives. Prior to this, mental hospitals were what Erving Goffman would consider “total institutions,” meaning that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was a place in which all of the patients’ activities took place with a large group of others on a schedule, which shut the patients off from the rest of society. This act led to a considerable amount of deinstitutionalization all over the country. The total number of mentally ill patients that were institutionalized went from 650,000 in 1955 to less than 150,000 in 1983. The act, in conjunction with the quickly deteriorating living conditions at the hospital, meant that Saint Elizabeth’s Hospital was no exception.  With the passage of the Community Mental Health Act of 1963, more patients opted for outpatient care and the number of patients at the hospital steadily declined."],"display_date":"October 31, 1963","search_date":"1963-10-31","locations":[{"id":31495,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":100,"tag":"Medicine"},{"id":1654,"tag":"Hospital"},{"id":1655,"tag":"Space"},{"id":267,"tag":"Health"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"}],"course":{"name":"Making the Modern Hospital","school":"Vanderbilt University","course_id":107,"school_id":60}},{"id":5682,"title":"St. Elizabeth's: From 'Asylum' to 'Hospital'","course_id":107,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/11","end_date":"12/31/16","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In 1911, a committee comprised of six representatives appointed by the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Attorney General, the Commissioners of the District of The Board of Visitors of the Government, and the Secretary of the Interior were chosen to assess the needs of the Government Hospital for the Insane.  Within the report that was submitted to the Secretary of the Interior, there was an initiative to “eliminate the word ‘insane’” from the name of the institution—citing the reminder of the institution’s purpose as “extremely disagreeable.” Within five years, the official name change became a reality.","The committee failed, however, to specify to what name the hospital should be changed.  Through analysis of other accounts of the institution’s history, it can be determined that the origins of the name St. Elizabeths occurred during the Civil War, when Congress authorized use of the hospital for the care of the sick and wounded soldiers of the Union Army.  The wounded Union soldiers treated at the hospital during the war were reluctant to write to their families that they were being treated in the Government Hospital for the Insane and instead chose to refer to the hospital as St. Elizabeth’s, after the name of the land the hospital was built upon, in order to avoid the stigma of an insane asylum.","The soldiers in St. Elizabeth’s are an early example of reframing a place or word in order to circumvent cultural assumptions of mentally ill individuals and asylums.  Examples of this can be seen today in movements such as Spread the Word to End the Word, a movement to stop the use of the word “retarded” in everyday speech, in order to avoid stigmas that are associated with mentally disabled individuals and allow others to see them as functioning members of society.","As stated by Goffman, a byproduct of a total institution such as an asylum is the stigmatization of “inmates,” among other consequences such as loss of individual liberties. The Civil War soldiers being treated at the Government Hospital for the Insane for battle wounds were aware of the social stigmatization of asylums and were reluctant to admit to being treated there, regardless of the reason.  Although the understanding of mental illness was becoming more factual at that time, society’s perceptions of insane asylums were filled will incurable monsters—not just individuals with different needs than the rest of society, as people with disabilities are seen today.  The soldiers avoided using the hospital’s true name in order to keep their families from worrying that war had changed them from heroes fighting for the Union into people that needed to be isolated from society.","Though the reasoning behind the exact name change is unclear, by renaming the hospital St. Elizabeth’s—a neutral, assumption-free title—as opposed to the Government Hospital for the Insane, it helped to remove some of the stigma of an insane asylum.  By characterizing it as simply a hospital, Congress re-framed the place as one of healing and care for those affected mentally in the process of serving their country instead of as a total institution—framing not only the hospital itself, but mental illness in general, in a more positive light."," "],"display_date":"1911 -

The National Advisory Council on Indian Education created this report in 1976 in Washington, D.C. The president of the United States appointed this council in order to assist the 570 native groups affected by the regulations of the Indian educational system. The council comprised of Americans who observed and worked with the native groups. Observations of the council members “revealed that much remains to be done before adequate and equal educational opportunities can be achieved by the Indian people.” The annual report stated that for the Indian people, Indian Education “is a method of teaching that revives an appreciation for Indian heritage and generates a positive self-image so that one accepts and understands the environment and social conditions surrounding him.” This appreciation of Indian heritage and positive self-image was lost many years ago when the American government first intruded onto Indian territories. The council addressed this loss in the report to Congress by stating that the American Indians’ 200 years experience under an authoritarian paternal relationship with the Federal Government has “clearly demonstrated that paternalism is alien to liberty and freedom.”","The Third Annual Report to the Congress of the United States clearly showed how the government progressed and improved upon the Indian Educational System. Historian David Adams exposed that the government originally created the Indian Educational System to civilize the natives, because the natives were believed to be savages. The school system intended to provide the natives with an education that would habituate them to the customs and advantages of a civilized life. The government tried to manipulate the natives into becoming exactly like American citizens, regardless of their heritage, religion, traditions, or tribal affiliations. The government believed that since the native ways of life were different than the traditional American lifestyle, the natives must be less civilized than American citizens. The government most recently formed educational policies regarding Indian Education with goals to respect the wishes and the desires of natives so that the natives may design and manage their own educational programs according to the tribal level. The United States government has allowed the natives to incorporate their own values, beliefs, and culture into the natives’ educational system instead of strictly regulating every aspect of native life. In reality, there has never truly been an American Educational system prior to modern-day; the faux system was based on the standard methods and systems of the non-Indian society and a process by which the government has tried to teach the natives how to become like the white man."],"display_date":1976,"search_date":"1976-07-01","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":21,"tag":"Race Relations"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":6,"tag":"Education"},{"id":19,"tag":"Native-Americans"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":106,"school_id":10}},{"id":5703,"title":"A Defensive Policy Unheeded","course_id":106,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/40","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","Very infrequently do presidential policies go unnoticed around the world, and especially not so within the United States itself.  However, during the greater part of the Second World War, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s positions on racial issues in the workplace were heard and often times not upheld.  Black workers were barred from facilities producing wartime goods throughout the country.  Munitions, Jeeps, planes, tanks, and “Deuce and a Half,” tracked vehicles were being turned out left and right in the effort to equip the massive numbers of U.S. soldiers on the battlefield around the world.  Many in history have called these workers at home the “Second Front,” of World War Two, the people that made victory possible through mechanization.","In many instances black workers were barred from working in certain positions in industry, and in others, locked out of facilities altogether.  Roosevelt in his great forethought made it government policy to allow a man of any race, religion, or ethnicity to work wherever possible if they had the skill set required.  Even though Roosevelt set up these conditions, many large defense contractors turned a blind eye and proceeded as they had for years.  Dock workers were going on strike for fair wages and work conditions, black men were discharged from work and the result in many instances was the entire black workforce walking out during business hours.  Sadly, much of his buttressing on racial problems in the workplace did little in the way of governmental bodies.","Roosevelt saw the racial lockout and weakness of the unions to govern grossly upsetting, and went about contacting his staff to spread the practice of equality.  In a memorandum addressed to William S. Knudsen (Ford Motor Company, and GMC) and Sidney Hillman (head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America), Roosevelt expressed his opinion on the matter rather flatly.  “ [The] discrimination against Negro workers has been nation-wide…[they] are being turned from the gates of industry on specifications entirely unrelated to efficiency and productivity…this situation is a matter of grave national importance, and immediate steps must be taken to deal with it effectively.”  Roosevelt goes on to state that “Every available source of labor capable of production defense materials must be tapped in the present emergency.”  He saw the discrimination for what it is: an uneducated and backwards, racist sentiment left over from the previous century.  He urged unions and labor leaders like Knudsen and Hillman to take into account the huge numbers of skilled black workers to increase war-time productivity.","Of course, this did not guarantee success, nor did his Roosevelt’s words fall only on discerning ears.  Many times the policies of different workplaces caused racial tension and strikes throughout the country.  In Mobile, Alabama, one of the South’s biggest shipyards and transportation hubs, more than a few strikes crippled production.  For instance, the Mobile Pulley Works was halted in August of 1942 over racial discrimination.  Eighty percent of the workers of the Mobile Pulley Works were black laborers.  During August, several black workers were discharged from work for varying small incidents.  The main incident in question was that of the Financial Secretary of the local “colored” union was fired.  The unnamed Fin. Sec. was off work for three days following a death in his immediate family, and upon returning to work he was told that he must leave, and would not receive his job returned.  This ended up putting his family on the street within days of loosing said position.  The day he was fired, the story circulated throughout the Works and caused an uproar that ended up with all the black workers leaving work to strike at the gates.  In effect, the lack of workers caused much strife in the production of war materials.  The Mobile Pulley Works created pulleys, winches for Jeeps, gears for war machinery, but also produced a number of artillery pieces and artillery rounds themselves…so it is easily seen just how needed their business was during WW2.  In the end, the Work’s unions were able to settle with the business and put its men back to work for the war effort…of course, this strike would likely never had happened if Roosevelt’s policies were actually observed without question.","Many laws and policies have been challenged in the course of the United States’ existence.  From slavery, education, and work, all the way up to social issues and tearing down barriers with the outside world.  It is quite disconcerting to know that a man so responsible for this nation’s continued being was heard and not observed. Of course, such is the way of social, political, and racial advancement in the world today; we must take strides to make better the future for others."],"display_date":"1940 - 1945","search_date":"1942-12-31","locations":[{"id":25458,"lat":33.5543155862,"lng":-86.8964933862,"zoom":9,"place":"Jefferson, Alabama"},{"id":25291,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1684,"tag":"Unions"},{"id":1683,"tag":"Black Workers"},{"id":1682,"tag":"Roosevelt"},{"id":960,"tag":"Labor Unions"},{"id":1667,"tag":"Discrimination"},{"id":620,"tag":"Franklin D.

The World Wide Web, as it was referred to in the official document was a global, networked computer information system.  The World Wide Web project provided a collaborative system that consisted of an independent hardware and software system that was made out of virtual platforms and a physical location. The document also states that the project included numerous topics, such as technical design notes, live status information, and educational materials. The information in the CERN document made it clear that the scientists that created this system would accept no responsibility for any problems that users might have with the product. This was put in the document for the protection of CERN and so they could not be held liable or sued for any software malfunctions. The intention of CERN was to help further the compatibility of the computer and its supported collaboration. The information on the World Wide Web is presented to the user as a web of interlinked documents. Users can have access to information to the World Wide Web through a group of hypertext models. The great thing about the World Wide Web was that is was independently networked and the information was independently formatted to make it easy for the users to handle.","The purpose of the World Wide Web was to make it easier for users to gain information on a subject by creating something called the “information superhighway”. The “information superhighway” was a purposed centralized, government-sponsored broadband network that would deliver video from television stations and other sources of media. The initial audience for this system was anyone who had access to a computer that was compatible with the World Wide Web.  The main purpose of the World Wide Web was to allow the people using the system to create different domains which in return would allow them to have access to information that other users have in their domains; essentially it allowed the users to share information with each other wirelessly. What many failed to realize was that the World Wide Web had been around for over twenty years, dating back to 1969. It was believed that when it first came to fruition that the early system was going to be used for informational purposes only. The initial targeted group of users was military workers. It was for them to be able to share information with each other through a series of computer databases. This would have helped them in regards to international information sparing with the other countries. Unfortunately, those who started to create this technology did not think of the long term effects of the product. They did take into account that there would be some complications.","There was a lot of pressure on the scientists responsible for creating such a breakthrough technology and having it work correctly. What many do not know is that they were met with immediate demands by the funders. The amount of responsibility the scientists had became a burden to them due to the amount of pressure that came with inventing a system where multiple users to have access at the same time. With such creations of the floppy disk and microprocessor being developed in 1971, it was critical that these scientist invented a new technology that would help change American society.  The world was changing around the time of this invention with  people were getting smarter and wanting more, and with the creation of the computer, people wanted more out of the technology. During the early years of the project the biggest problem was making sure that the all of the problems with the World Wide Web were fixed that were found early on.","By the end of 1979, the frame work was complete for the Internet, but they were unsure whether or not it should be accessible to the public due to some of the problems with the hard and software. By 1993, the problems with the system were fixed to a point where the funders wanted to make it access to people in a public domain. This was great news to the public ,who for years were ready to experience this system. The times were changing with new technology being invented and with new ways to talk to each other people were excited to hear that there was this invention called the “World Wide Web”. People wanted to be able to share their ideas with one another through a wireless server and this was the perfect material for it at the time. To be able to have a domain (a place where one could share their ideas on a topic or forum) made it that more important for people to have.","Looking back to where technology was twenty years ago and where technology is now really makes it obvious that the invention of the World Wide Web changed the landscape of American society. Twenty years ago, people would have to talk to each other via a telephone and through a computer or go to a library to do research. None of this would be possible if it was for CERN officially put The World Wide Web into public domain on April 30, 1993. The World Wide Web was the beginning of a new age of technology.

In 1864, the first postal car was constructed and operated in the United States and was first placed on the lines of the railroads connecting New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Once railway mail service had begun, the cars were equipped primarily to sort and distribute mail. At that time there was an increasing demand by the public for improved postal facilities.  The U.S postal service was increasingly becoming more demanding which meant that the post office’s so called \"Traveling Post offices\" were also becoming more rigorous, which hindered the travel of the public because of the high need for the railways. The importance of the traveling railway post office was stated in a testimony given before a U.S. Senate committee in April of 1873. The document stated that the government in the City of New York was forced to use three or four large warehouses to do the postal distribution instead of using the railways. The reasoning for the push to use warehouses rather than mail car service was because the USPS was not providing enough money to the railways to cover the costs of labor and it was making scheduling passenger cars difficult. However the U.S. Postal Service responded that the elimination of the railway transportation would end up turning the delivery of mail into a difficult project because no one would ever be able to deliver a sufficient amount mail and there would be a very high delay[BS1] . It then became evident that the postal car service was not only important, but the continuance of it would develop the railroad lines of communication between towns and businesses. Communication is a vital aspect in business interests of the country.","There was great controversy between the railroads and the U.S Post Office Department in respect to the performance of the postal car service. A letter was written to the lawyer of the railroad managers, Isaac Hinkley Esq., in regards to the Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, from David A. Wells, the postal service representative, gave a brief analysis of the controversy and nature of this particular issue. The letter explained that this was not a situation in which the public had taken much interest; in fact the case showed that the public did not care about how the mail was distributed unless it affected their mail deliveries  This case never got the attention of the public because there were no delays in mail service nor did delivery stop.","With the conclusion of the letter it was stated that the federal government was required by the constitution to make just compensation for private property of every description taken for public uses. Second they were making a statement that the postal car was not and will never be a freight car and the services performed by the workers were completely different and they were intended to be for two totally separate things. Third was that a postal car and the service that was required of it is as near as possible an express car. Forth, the compensation that was paid by the post office department was entirely inadequate. The people who were working for the postal service did not think that they were treated fairly nor did they feel that moving mail to a warehouse and having it distributed by a mail carrier was going to be sufficient.","The rebuttal to the letter came shortly after and was written by the railway managers. They were completely appalled that the postal service had absolutely no idea how much it actually costs to maintain additional non passenger cars along with maintenance on roads and railways that were owned by private companies. With all of the hard work that the railroad workers put in to maintain these things they also were not being compensated for the job that they were doing either. They felt that the government was not supporting the railway nor were they receiving funds for the day to day upkeep.","The railroad industry was meant to stimulate the economy and it did in fact have some success and it also created new links within the country. Just like the mail cars that were used it was also used to carry manufactured goods, raw materials and farming goods. They also helped other industries thrive so it goes without saying that over the past 200 years the railroad has created change equivalent to that over the past several millennia.  In April of 1971, the railway started to stop the delivery of mail on some railways and by 2004 all delivery has ceased completely. Just like other technologies related to communication, the railroad industry played a huge role in developing modern civilization by improving the speed at which information traveled across the nation."," "],"display_date":1832,"search_date":"1832-07-01","locations":[{"id":1273,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1751,"tag":"Post Office"},{"id":1752,"tag":"Railway"}],"course":{"name":"Historical Perspectives on Technology","school":"Widener University","course_id":111,"school_id":43}},{"id":5772,"title":"Senator Corwin Speaks Out Against the Wilmot Proviso","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1848-08-25","end_date":"1848-08-25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On August 8, 1846, David Wilmot proposed an amendment on the floor of the Senate to ban slavery in all territories acquired from Mexico following the Mexican-American War. His proposal had a long and controversial life. During an attempt to pass the bill in 1848, Senator Thomas Corwin, a Whig from Ohio, stood up before the Senate and gave his arguments against the piece of legislation. Senator Corwin opposed slavery. At one point, he stated that if there were a country so hot “the white man is supposed not to be able to work, I would not allow you to take slaves there.” Yet he still strongly opposed the Wilmot Proviso. He argued that the amendment was unnecessary, because slavery already existed in some form in the new territories. The senator referred to land expansions in his argument, saying, “if at any time…you have acquired territory where Slavery existed in such form and consistency…it has been permitted to remain where by law it did exist.” Despite being staunchly antislavery, he paradoxically fought against this bill. Senator Corwin had another motive behind his protest of the bill. He saw that the Proviso was just causing another Sectional Crisis and dividing Congress. Corwin opposed it because he, like many at the time, feared that it would lead to southern secession. His speech was an attempt to prevent this eventuality from happening.","The Wilmot Proviso quickly became controversial in Congress, and in some cases, it was for reasons other than slavery. Historian James McPherson writes that there were some southerners who opposed it because they saw “the northern effort to exclude it [slavery] as an insult to southern honor.” The Wilmot Proviso, as this amendment came to be called, passed in the House on two separate occasions, and both times the Senate voted it down. The country was already divided by a series of Sectional Crises, and the introduction of the Wilmot Proviso only exacerbated the problem. Historian Eric Foner called it “the beginning of a path which led almost inevitably to sectional controversy and civil war.” Corwin claimed that there was no way the proviso could possibly lead to that eventuality, but his actions say otherwise. In March of 1861, he proposed an amendment known as the “Corwin Amendment” that would have made it illegal for Congress to amend the Constitution to restrict slavery. The Corwin Amendment was the senator’s attempt to placate the South and prevent them from seceding. He saw how polarizing the Wilmot Proviso was. Corwin opposed it not because he supported slavery, but because he wanted to keep the United States a whole nation. He debated in vain, and the Proviso continued to divide the North and the South."],"display_date":"August 25, 1848","search_date":"1848-08-25","locations":[{"id":1274,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":1801,"tag":"Wilmot Proviso"},{"id":1802,"tag":"Mexican War"},{"id":1803,"tag":"Sectional Crisis"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5800,"title":"<strong><em>Daily National Intelligencer</em> Advertises for Fugitive Slaves</strong>","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1816-04-20","end_date":"1816-04-20","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On April 20, 1816, the <em>Daily National Intelligencer</em>, located in Washington D.C., published an article advertising fugitive slaves.  The article began by stating, “Fifty persons of color were brought into this city, in the ship <em>Lord Somers, </em>from London.”  The <em>Intelligencer</em> continued, “On examination, satisfactory evidence was produced, that forty-three were free, two the property of citizens of this city; and the description of the remaining five is now published­­- they are supposed to be fugitive slaves.”  The article provided detailed descriptions of the slaves and owners were expected to come forward with proof to claim their property.  For example, one description stated, “John Williams, says he was born in Savannah, state of Georgia.”  The description then continues, “ he was the property of Mr. Robert Boush in 1806; about 43 years of age; 5 feet 4 inches high.”  Slaves had high hopes of escaping from their owners’ barracks, but being able to successfully get away was usually impossible.","With the increasing numbers of slaves attempting to escape plantations on which they were held captive, southern states created fugitive slave laws.  According to historian William R. Leslie, the subject of fugitive slaves became a popular topic of discussion after the Pennsylvania Supreme Courts ruling in the <em>Commonwealth v. Holloway case </em>in 1816.  This case involved a fugitive slave giving birth to a child on Pennsylvania soil and the court ruling that the child was not subject to slavery.  This had many southerners irate and protests took place.   Later, the Pennsylvania Fugitive Slave Act of 1826 protected freed slaves and prevented the kidnapping of any black individual.","The federal government developed a fugitive slave act to help return escaped slaves to their owners.  Under this law, if a slave were to escape, the person whom was hired by the slave owner had the right to capture the fugitive and take him or her before any United States Judge or magistrate.  The Fugitive Slave Law of 1793 stated, “any person obstructing in any way such seizure or removal, or harboring or concealing any fugitive after notice, is liable to a penalty of $500.”  Northern states did not obey this law and developed their own laws to protect any person within their borders from being taken back to slavery.  The large number of loopholes in this law eventually resulted in a more stringent fugitive slave act.  According to historian James McPherson, the creation of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 gave the national government superior power over any other law during that time."],"display_date":"April 20, 1816","search_date":"1816-04-20","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1850,"tag":"Slave Laws"},{"id":1849,"tag":"Advertisement"},{"id":126,"tag":"fugitive slave"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5803,"title":"<strong>Congressman W.S.

Groesbeck of Ohio took the floor to argue in support of the recent capture of filibusterer, General William Walker. The speech served as a rebuttal to objections raised by Representative Keitt of South Carolina and Representative Stephens of Georgia.","Representatives Keitt and Stephens argued that the seizure of Walker and his company from Nicaragua was illegal. For these two Congressmen, the United States had violated jurisdiction zones established by the “law of 1818” during Walker’s seizure. In defense of the US forces that captured Walker, Representative Groesbeck focused his speech on the theme that “the sea is no sanctuary for crime.” He stated that since Walker and his company were American citizens, “the duty of this Government [was] to keep the peace with all other nations; and to break up combinations of its own citizens who have actually started upon expeditions to violate the peace of other nations.” This being said, Representative Groesbeck saw nothing wrong with the actions the US government took to apprehend Walker and his company: “He [the commander of the US Navy] had the right to cross the line of the marine league from our shore; he had the right to pursue this expedition, which was being <em>carried on</em> across the Gulf; and he had the right, with the consent of Nicaragua, to enter within her jurisdiction.” Simply put, General Walker and his company were rightfully and legally seized and detained by the US government.","William Walker was a man of many skills. Despite his medical education and experience in journalism, he is best remembered as a filibusterer. Walker’s first filibuster occurred in 1853 in Sonora, Mexico. The success of this filibuster prompted Walker to pursue Nicaragua a few years later.","The US Department of State acknowledges that filibustering-the militaristic actions of private citizens in a foreign land-was common in the years between the Mexican War and Civil War. Like Walker, most filibusterers were southern men hoping that the acquisition of new territory in Central America would ensure the expansion and survival of slavery. For this reason, as historian James McPherson wrote, “While much of the northern press condemned Walker as a pirate, southern newspapers praised him as engaged in a ‘noble cause.’” These conflicting perceptions of Walker’s actions created fierce tension in Washington.","When Walker and his company returned to Nicaragua in 1857, the US reacted. Historian Amy Greenberg wrote on this matter, “In May 1857 Walker surrendered to the commander of the United States navy after falling to the combined pressure of a Central American army, Great Britain, and threatened American shipping interest.” As evident in Rep. Groesbeck’s speech, there was a lot of controversy concerning Walker’s seizure. This contention between southerners and northerners in regards to the US actions was, in the end, pointless. In May 1858, a jury in New Orleans acquitted Walker of all charges for violating federal law."],"display_date":"January 11, 1858","search_date":"1858-01-11","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":9,"tag":"Law"},{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":20,"tag":"Diplomacy/International"},{"id":1854,"tag":"Filibuster"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":5829,"title":"<strong>Critiquing the Use of Tetraethyl Lead in Gasoline</strong>","course_id":118,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/24","end_date":"12/31/25","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":[" ","In Washington D.C. in 1925, the day of the official conference decision regarding the use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline, Alice Hamilton, a leader in the field of toxicology and occupational diseases, issued an article discussing her rejection of the previous 1924 Bureau of Mines Report. The 1924 Bureau of Mines Report stated that tetraethyl lead was safe for gasoline. Hamilton argued that the report, which tested tetraethyl gasoline on animals, was incorrectly analyzed and poorly conditioned to determine the correlating safety for humans. She further refuted the report by offering four unanswered questions regarding tetraethyl lead gasoline and its interactions with humans. She called into question the potential damage of manufacturing ethyl fluid to factory employees. Within the last seventeen months seventeen men had died and one became insane as a result of manufacturing this compound. Next, Hamilton addresses potential damage to gas station workers and service employees who combine the ethyl-fluid with the gasoline and pump it into automobiles. Lastly, she questions the danger regarding the emission of ethyl gasoline to the public airspace by way of car exhaust. While Hamilton acknowledged some previous scientific research into the matter, she still argued that the results were insufficient as they did not focus on the correct areas of research and the potentially for environmentally damaging side-effects to affect humans. Hamilton concluded her article by urging the conference to discontinue use of tetraethyl lead in gasoline until further research could determine the safety of its unknown effects.","During her medical studies at the University of Michigan, Hamilton utilized her academic discipline of medical science towards social reform by looking at environmentalism through a health perspective. After she was appointed to the Illinois Commission on Occupational Diseases, Hamilton began delving into investigations on lead industries. Since lead and the chemical compounds associated with it are extremely dangerous and in high demand during the rapidly expanding automobile industry of the early 1900’s, Hamilton’s work is invaluable to help to situate ourselves in understanding lead’s environmental impacts. Furthermore, Hamilton was a powerful environmental advocate in an era when the term “environmental” had yet to be established as an ideology.

The document Marshall wrote  became known as the \"U-Regulations\" and were passed by congress on 19th September 1939. These regulations were to preserve the natural environment under the protection of the Forest Service. Regulation U-1 became a protection for land 100k acres or more which banned commercial and limited recreational activity. Regulation U-2 revised old classifications of \"primitive areas\" to be renamed wilderness areas. Now the environment will become more inviting. He was able to preserve 12 wilderness areas and 4 wild areas. Two months after the U-Regulations were put into law, Marshall passed away leaving a groundwork for future environmentalists and Forest Service workers as his legacy.,","The U-regulations remained the governing principles of the Forest Service until President Lyndon B. Johnson made the regulations permanent with the landmark 1964 Wilderness Act. Shifting authority to designate land or remove Wilderness status from the bureaucratic Forest Service to Congress, only legislators can now make changes to the U-Regulations, and the current Wilderness areas are now permanently preserved. Early ideas of conservation and environmentalism put Marshall in a complex category. On the one hand, his critique of commercial activity limited intervention in the environment.

She created a precedent not only by representing her state in the Senate, but by being the first woman to deliver a speech on the Congress floor. “Miss Dixie”, as she was affectionately called, spoke against an anti-lynching bill. Southern women often talked about lynching, because they considered it a necessary prosecution to avoid rape; so it was not surprising that Senator Graves talked passionately about the subject. Lynching was a well-discussed subject during the New Deal Era of the 1930s, because the Great Depression and its repercussions had caused a new wave of lynching throughout the South. Congress had introduced various anti-lynching bills before and during the Progressive Era, but none could pass through the filibuster initiated by Southern Congressmen. By the 1930s, most mob violence and lynchings were directed against African Americans in the South; however, Senator Graves’s speech did not mention this. Instead, she argued that the frequency of lynching was declining and Southern states had the right to deal with it in their own way. She insisted that the lynching problem did not need governmental intervention and federal legislation, and states were “stamping out this disease”.","The speech became the subject of differing viewpoints and countless newspaper articles throughout the country. One such article from <em>The Birmingham News</em> praises Senator Graves and points out that “even Vice President Garner listened when [she] had her say about lynching”. The article even mentions that after the female senator was done with her speech, Republicans and Democrats from both sides of the isle stood up to shake her hand. Whether these events were true or not, many Southern newspapers like the <em>Tuscaloosa News</em> and the M<em>ontgomery Advisor</em> delivered similar articles acknowledging and praising Senator Graves. Northern newspapers, however, were not as kind. The newly appointed senator’s speech contained a number of erroneous facts, and to Northerners, she seemed to be defending the practice of lynching. Some Northern articles drew attention to her gender as a way of discrediting Miss Dixie Graves. One paper mocked her husband, Governor Graves, by saying that Mrs. Graves “can’t be a very good cook. Otherwise her husband, Bibb, would never have appointed her to the Senate”.","Dixie Graves followed in the footsteps of other women in Alabama and the South who were gaining more public roles since 1900. Historian Mary Martha Thomas writes, “although they were excluded from positions of political power, women compensated by activity in their various organizations”. Following the Progressive Era, women began moving from domestic life into public life; they established temperance societies, women’s suffrage clubs, and other organizations that were meant to bring attention to social issues. Through these organizations, women put pressure on the government to eliminate child labor, attack illiteracy, improve the school system, provide welfare for the sick and elderly, and allow women to vote. Although Miss Dixie’s speech to Congress represented women’s newly acquired confidence in public life, it was neither forward-looking in its subject matter, nor did it demonstrate any progress in the South's approval of racial equality."],"display_date":"August 20, 1937","search_date":"1937-08-20","locations":[{"id":22331,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2264,"tag":"senator graves"},{"id":2263,"tag":"governor Graves"},{"id":2262,"tag":"female senator"},{"id":2261,"tag":"women in politics"},{"id":1972,"tag":"1930s"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6112,"title":"An Underestimated Victory for Native Americans","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"7/8/70","end_date":"7/8/70","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":[" ","On July 8, 1970, President Nixon addresses the United States Congress regarding Native American rights in response to the ongoing efforts of the American Indian Movement. At the time of his address to Congress, Native Americans across the United States were taking a stand against the hundreds of years of mistreatment they have received at the hands of white settlers.  These American Indians, who were fed up with having their cries of freedom silenced, took over the abandoned Island of Alcatraz of the coast of California. The Native American occupancy of Alcatraz Island started in the fall of 1969 and was still demanding attention from the United States government at the time of Nixon’s letter. In a bold statement, Native Americans (who came from dozens of tribes from the United States and around the globe) from American Indian Movement decided to take over Alcatraz Island and reclaim it as Indian territory. These American Indians said they had the right to claim this land because the land was abandoned and unclaimed the United States.","Few Americans were paying attention to the Native American movement, which lead to further Native American frustration with America. Many leaders and supporters of the American Indian Movement felt as though their efforts were falling out of the spotlight. The occupancy of Alcatraz marked the first bold move of the part of the American Indian Movement that would finally capture the attention of U.S. citizens. The Coast Guard surrounded the Island of Alcatraz and would not let anyone bring much needed food and supplies to the Native Americans that now occupied the island. The Native Americans did not waver and held strong to beliefs held by the AIM. This takeover helped the AIM to gain momentum, but Paul Chaat Smith and Robert Allen Warrior, authors of the book “Like a Hurricane” argue that the American Indian Movement was successful due in large part the theatrical show that they believed members of the movement performed. They believed that leaders in the Alcatraz takeover like Richard Oakes, a college student of Native American descent from California, were taking on the Native American cause more for personal attention than to preserve their dying Native American culture.  Smith and Warrior also argued that the many leaders of the American Indian Movement were “too urban” and disconnected from true Native American culture since the movement started in the urban city of Minneapolis, Minnesota instead of a more rural setting where Native Americans still practiced their traditions and beliefs.. Whatever the motives of the various members of the movement, the takeover at Alcatraz lead to an awakening that swept the nation and brought Native American issues and injustices to light. The media became very interested and started running stories across the nation about the happenings on Alcatraz Island. The Native American occupancy of Alcatraz was important because it put an end to the silencing of Native American voices at the hands of other Americans.","President Nixon finally took notice of the AIM outcries for change by becoming one of the first modern American presidents to actually acknowledge that Native Americans had been unjustly treated by whites. Nixon boldly stated to Congress on July 8, 1970, “The first Americans--the Indians-are the most deprived and most isolated minority group in our nation. On virtually every scale of measurement--employment, income, education, health--the condition of the Indian people ranks at the bottom. This condition is the heritage of centuries of injustice. From the time of their first contact with European settlers, the American Indians have been oppressed and brutalized, deprived of their ancestral lands and denied the opportunity to control their own destiny. Even the Federal programs which are intended to meet their needs have frequently proven to be ineffective and demeaning.”","The president’s recognition of the Native American peoples was a huge sign that their efforts were finally paying off after centuries of trying to defend their people, their land, and their beliefs. Their efforts had gained the attention of the American president and Native Americans were hopeful that things would soon change for their people. In his Congressional address, Nixon proclaimed that Native Americans were have more freedoms and would be given better governmental assistance. Although Nixon made these presentations to Congress, Native Americans continue to fight for all that was taken from them so many years ago. America owes the American Indian so much and will be forever indebted to these native peoples."],"display_date":"July 8, 1970","search_date":"1970-07-08","locations":[{"id":35365,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"District of Columbia, District of Columb"}],"tags":[{"id":537,"tag":"Native Americans"},{"id":2281,"tag":"President Nixon"},{"id":2282,"tag":"American Indian Movement"}],"course":{"name":"Historian's Craft","school":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","course_id":126,"school_id":10}},{"id":6117,"title":"“Prohibition – A March to Stop Intoxication”","course_id":126,"status":"P","start_date":"12/10/13","end_date":"12/11/13","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In Washington, D.C. on the day of December 10, 1913 one of the largest prohibition demonstration took place within the city. There were 1,000 women from the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and 1,000 men from the Anti-Saloon League that marched silently to the capital.  The article states that the ranks were swelled by hundreds of people who joined the march singing “Onward, Christian Soldiers,” and “America” as they were marching. The marchers were met by Senator Morris Sheppard of Texas and Alabama Representative Richmond P. Hobson at the steps of the capital. The group of marchers then proceeded to present multiple petitions that would allow a constitutional amendment to be made so the making and selling of intoxicants in the United States would be prohibited.","After the presentations of the petitions speeches were made by the leaders of the two factions. Both factions seemed to receive warm responses from the two politicians meaning they had obtained their support. Later in the same day Senator Sheppard introduced the proposed constitutional amendment in the Senate. The article says, “the galleries were only half full, but his address in support of the amendment was punctuated with outbursts of applause which Vice President Marshall made no effort to stop.”  The Senator went on to conclude his proposal with these words, “Prohibition will embrace the whole United States within a comparatively short time. The movement is so strong throughout the nation that nothing in the world can prevent its ultimate complete success.” The article ends with saying that Senator Thompson and Owen joined the indorsement of the amendment proposal.","This newspaper article from the <em>New York Times</em> shows precisely what historians have suggested when they speak on how women supported the idea prohibition and this is a firsthand account of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union in action. The article also shows how organizations sought after the support of politicians in order to get the prohibition act into effect. This article fits perfectly with the beliefs of historian Peter Sasso and supports a number of his theses, but the main one being Sasso’s belief that the League was looking for political support. On page forty-seven of his journal Sasso talks about how one of the League leaders, Wayne Wheeler, believed that prohibition could only be accomplished through political advocacy. Gaining political support is one of the ways the League wanted to get prohibition into effect and it is clearly visible in the newspaper article.  Sasso also says how Wheeler sought to control the balance of power in key Congressional districts. This newspaper article shows perfectly how the League took steps to ensure political support to their idea.

The first question brought to the House by Mr. Quincy of Massachusetts, was to have the forthcoming meetings on stating the reasons and causes of having a war against Britain be held with “open doors.” The second motion brought to the House was from Mr. Randolph of Virginia, and asked ws whether or not the reading of messages from the President be held with “open doors.” The third and last question before the House was whether or not to reject the bill that would declare war with Britain. Each of these three questions were determined in the negative, and it became evident that the majority of Representatives felt it was necessary for such matters to remain secret for the time being, to remove the possibility of outside influence. Laban Wheaton from Massachusetts, one of the last Federalists to hold a position in Washington, sided the minority on these issues. Wheaton was skeptical about embarking on a war with Britain without carefully laying out the consequences. But was secrecy the real issue at hand?","The impending war with Britain brought various questions to the table. Arguably the most important was whether or not the United States should remain neutral in foreign affairs. The increasing naval surveillance by the British, as well as the non–compliance of the French and British regarding economic relations, represented reasons why the United States should intervene. John C. Calhoun drafted a bill that laid out how the United States should proceed with the war. Many Congressmen felt it was essential for the United States to intervene in order to establish its permanent place in the world as a powerful, revolutionary and prominent nation. However, some felt that if the United States were to engage in battle, it would go against what their predecessors had tried to establish – to remain neutral in foreign affairs. Laban Wheaton and many other Federalists felt the nation was still extremely unfit for such interaction and should proceed with extreme caution.","Throughout all of this debate, the concerns of political parties play an important role. Both sides--the Federalists and Republicans--were concerned with losing control of certain states depending on how the country acted on the war. For example, the Republicans were very concerned with losing the state of Massachusetts, so it was vital that they speak out against going to war. It became clear that the real problem the House was facing was not whether or not to hold the proceedings in secret, but how each party was going to keep their support in their respective states. It seemed that the House was more concerned with keeping the constituents happy, rather than keeping them informed, and more importantly, keeping them safe."," "," "],"display_date":"June 3, 1812","search_date":"1812-06-03","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":2395,"tag":"U.S. Government"},{"id":154,"tag":"War of 1812"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}},{"id":6204,"title":"Postal Road: Connecting a Young Nation","course_id":138,"status":"P","start_date":"1812-03-04","end_date":"1812-03-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In 1812 America was on the brink of war. The House of Representatives would congregate and hear various petitions and claims daily, but none more curious than those of March 4, 1812. Several petitions were submitted and claims were made in the hopes of installing new postal routes in different parts of the country. Requests for grants of land for certain individuals were also topics of discussion. Proposed postal routes would run through the Medford, Andover, Essex, and Londonderry turnpike roads. There were also other petitions being made to establish a new postal road in Randolph County Virginia and the authority to alter preexisting postal routes. Mr. Dawson proposed a route that would extend from Beverly to Staunton that would help benefit the community. Mr. Ornsby presented a claim by Daniel Boone that ten thousand acres lying in the Louisiana Territory be granted to him. All of these petitions were heard and approved by the House of Representatives on March 4, 1812. Some decisions were more unanimous than others. Judge Laban Morey Wheaton, who served in Congress from 1809-1817 didn’t vote in favor of the postal road claims. His lack of support for new postal roads in Massachusetts seems to be precarious, but upon further analysis the roads wouldn’t connect to the Norton area of Massachusetts where he resided, which may provide reasoning for his voting pattern. It’s also interesting to see that the House was able to function and conduct their normal business of governing, with particular attention to the extension of postal routes and establishing the communication infrastructure of the new nation on the eve of war. One would expect the discussions in The House of Representatives to revolve around the impending war with England that would later be declared in June of 1812.","The Gales and Seaton, “House Journal” dated on March 4, 1812 provides context as to what type of petitions were being submitted to the House of Representatives during that time period of the early nineteenth century. This particular day saw petitions involving the permission to establish land grants and postal routes.  Richard Bules book, “America on the Brink” offers insight as to why the establishing of postal routes was so important during this time period.  In the introduction of the book he touches on various elements of American life during the early 1800’s. In particular he talks about the influence of the urban newspaper. The newspaper was important for various reasons. One of those reasons being that it provides a link between rural and urban America in regards to news. That link later on proves to be crucial in helping stabilize the country during turbulent times. Another reason is that postal roads also help further intertwine parts of the rapidly growing country that were previously not connected. The connection of the various parts of the new country is vital in helping the growth and development process of a new country. As Blue reiterates throughout the book, the early part of nineteenth century America lacked stability and the establishment of postal roads help unite urban and rural areas, which otherwise would have been disconnected. Blues book help puts into context the flurry of petitions that were being submitted for the instillation of postal roads, which is highlighted in the Gales and Seaton, “House Journal.”"],"display_date":"March 4, 1812","search_date":"1812-03-04","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2420,"tag":"Postal Roads"},{"id":154,"tag":"War of 1812"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}},{"id":6205,"title":"Congress Votes to Reduce Military and Naval Establishments","course_id":138,"status":"P","start_date":"1810-04-17","end_date":"1810-04-17","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Things were tense when Congress convened on April 17, 1810. Foreign relations with Britain were strained, and the intransigent Federalist Party was making passing Republican legislation very difficult. On that day the Federalists succeeded in yet again undermining Republican authority in Congress by voting on whether or not to reduce Military and Naval establishments in a time when overseas affairs with the British were unsettled.","The first party system was comprised of the Federalist and the Republicans. The Federalists were those who wanted to trade with Britain at the expense of the French and wanted to commercialize the economy. The Republicans were interested in trading with France instead of Britain and were more compelled to act in a way that benefited the economic well being of their regions. These two parties' continual opposition of each other was eventually one of the reasons the Republicans declared war against Britain in 1812.  In the previous years the Federalist gentry had continually tried to subvert the federal government and had repeatedly attempted to sabotage Republican legislation in Congress. One example was the forced repeal of the embargo of 1807-1809, through which the United States had attempted to force European nations to recognize American’s neutrality by denying access to American commerce. Following the appeal of the embargo, the United States House of Representatives had passed a Non-Intercourse Act against Britain that took effect on May 20, 1809. This meant that the United States would not trade with Britain because the relationship between the two nations was rapidly deteriorating.","War seemed imminent as friction between Britain and the United States progressed, and the Federalists did nothing to relieve some of the pressure the federal government was feeling. One important measure against the Republicans was the passing of a bill on April 17, 1810. On that day the House was to vote on an unanswered question from April 16<sup>th</sup> regarding a resolution to reduce Military and Naval establishments. Mr. Quincy motioned that an amendment be made that the reduction happen only by repealing laws to disband Brigadier Generals, staff, and officers; the motion failed. Mr. Rhea then motioned that committees appointed by the President look at the resolutions. This motion also failed.","The House then voted on whether or not to reduce the size of the Military. The resolution passed by a vote of eighty-one to thirty-one. The question then turned to the reduction of the Navy. Mr. Hale motioned to insert after the word reduced “by selling such gunboats or crafts attached to it as may, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Navy, be unnecessary or incompetent to the service.”  This motion passed. The question of the reduction of the Navy also passed by a vote of sixty-five to forty-six. Following the votes on the question as two separate entities, the House then voted on the question regarding whether both the Military and Navy should be reduced. The resolution passed sixty to thirty-one.","Federalists like Laban Wheaton voted in the affirmative on this resolution for reducing the Army and the Navy. The resolution's success meant that Congress would vote on a bill to this effect. And these votes offer an example of the ways that Federalists in Congress subverted Republicans' attempts to show a strong military and naval presence in the face of a grow British threat. Historian Richard Buel has argued that Federalists sabotaged Republican legislation like the Embargo of 1807-1809 and the Non-Intercourse Act and that the sabotage of these acts heightened tensions with Britain and eventually pushed the Republicans to declare war in 1812."],"display_date":"April 17, 1810","search_date":"1810-04-17","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2395,"tag":"U.S. Government"},{"id":573,"tag":"Government Laws"},{"id":154,"tag":"War of 1812"},{"id":370,"tag":"Federalist"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}},{"id":6206,"title":"18 Days in June","course_id":138,"status":"P","start_date":"1812-06-01","end_date":"1812-06-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["President Madison was concerned in June 1812, and he asked for the help of Congress.

By a vote of seventy-nine to forty nine, the representatives voted to “declare war between Great Britain and her dependencies and the United States and her territories.” Representative Laban Wheaton of Massachusetts voted against declaring war.

On June 17<sup>th</sup>, The Senate narrowly passed the bill and on June 18<sup>th</sup>, Madison declared war on the British.","Historian Richard Buel has evaluated debate and preparations in Congress before the War of 1812. Buel noted that the Federalists, led by Virginian John Randolph, were partial to the British. They believed that the United States should be patient and wait for British concessions. “Go to war without money, without men, without a navy, would be treason,” said Randolph. But Republicans did not believe that the British concessions would be meaningful or lasting, and Republican president James Madison's letter to the House of Representatives led to the June 4<sup>th</sup> to declare war. A week later, the Senate voted to declare war, and President Madison then declared war on Britain. Ready or not, the United States would be taking on the most powerful sea power in the world. Not until the final declaration of war on June 18th did the American people know about these secret debates that took place in early June. These decisions would lead to Madison's evacuating the White House two years later."," "],"display_date":"June 1, 1812 - June 18, 1812","search_date":"1812-06-09","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":154,"tag":"War of 1812"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}},{"id":6207,"title":"Prelude to War: American Government After the Embargo","course_id":138,"status":"P","start_date":"1809-03-24","end_date":"1809-03-24","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Gurdon S.

Two petitions were redirected to the Committee of Commerce and Manufacturers, and Wheaton listened as members of the House propose amendments to their actions on previous days. Virginia Federalist John Randolf then moved “to immediately disband” military units that had been authorized on April 12 in a bill entitled “An Act to Raise, for a Limited Time, an Additional Military Force”. Randolph also moved that \"the funds be redirected towards the pre-existing military in order to [arm] and [equip] the whole body of the militia of the United States.” Randolf also sought to appoint a committee to look into whether or not money taken from the Treasury had been used in the way the House had directed.

The British had impressed over six thousand United States citizens, and in 1807, <em>HMS Leopard</em> had opened fire on <em>USS Chesapeake</em>, killing three men. Great Britain had not responded to either diplomatic negotiations or threats made by the United States. Declaring war was the next step for many United States politicians, though not all congressmen agreed on declaring war against Great Britain. Federalists and some Republicans had strong concerns about the effects of war on the new nation.","Virginian John Randolph had previously voiced Republican apprehensions about the implications of the impending war for the United States. Randolph worried that American citizens would not want to pay increased taxes and that New England merchants would not support a war that would make their ports vulnerable to the British. Randolph tried to convince other Southern Republicans of the possible dangers a war would cause.","Federalist Laban Wheaton had opposed war with Great Britain since his time in at the Massachusetts Statehouse. In 1808 Wheaton presented the Wheaton Resolves in response and opposition to the national Embargo Act. James Sullivan, a Democratic-Republican and Governor of Massachusetts, had seen the Federalist Campaign in Massachusetts as a betrayal of President Jefferson, and he had feared that opposing the national government would lead to anarchy. Sullivan tried to present the Embargo Act in a positive light, as a federal action the demonstrated of unity and independence for the nation. The Federalist Party had dominated the Statehouse, and Wheaton had gained recognition for authoring the resolves. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1808, Wheaton maintained his Federalist stance through his four terms. He joined with other Federalists and some Republicans in resisting the declaration of war in 1812.","When the Senate presented the act to the House, Federalists and other members who were opposed to war tried to delay the vote. Virginia Federalist Daniel Sheffey proposed to postpone the vote indefinitely. Along with seventy other House members, Massachusetts Federalist Laban Wheaton voted in favor of the motion, which was opposed by forty-six nays. The motion was raised again, and Wheaton voted in the affirmative. However, the nays outweighed the yeas with an eighty-five to forty-four vote. When John Randolph, a Republican from Virginia who opposed the declaration of war, moved to postpone the vote until the following Monday the nays still defeated the yeas. Randolph then proposed to postpone the vote until July, but again the motion failed. All efforts to delay a vote and halt the process of declaring war on Britain proved futile."],"display_date":"June 18, 1812","search_date":"1812-06-18","locations":[{"id":1271,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":370,"tag":"Federalist"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":2423,"tag":"Laban Wheaton"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A New Nation, 1776-1836","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":138,"school_id":2}},{"id":6212,"title":"American Militia Renewal in 1810","course_id":138,"status":"P","start_date":"1809-12-05","end_date":"1810-01-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The House of Representatives was busy on January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1810.

The microphone was first invented and introduced to the public in 1877 by Emile Berliner. Berliner immigrated to the United States when he was just nineteen years old but later became known as a great entrepreneur and inventor of products that would make their way into every home and industry in the U.S.","In September of 1926, a trade magazine called <em>Radio Broadcast</em> published an article which focused on the microphone and its origins. The broadcasting journal wanted to inform its readers about who invented the microphone and where exactly the technology came from, since at that time few in the industry knew much about the device that was being used across the world to broadcast sound. It was astonishing to readers that Emile Berliner had created the modern broadcasting microphone after just six weeks of experiments in his tiny one-bedroom apartment. The article digs up the history of the inventor as well as the invention, and describes the fascinating story of Berliner’s development of the microphone.","Emile Berliner had a passion for science and discovering secrets behind new technologies. He was astonishingly smart given his brief education.  He attended a Jewish school in Germany, but left school at the age of fourteen to help support his family. He later immigrated to the U.S. in 1870 and went to work in a small dry goods store in Washington, D.C. He first exhibited an interest in improving existing technology while working in the store.  He had heard of rumors about Alexander Bell’s telephone in the 1870s but the telephone had not been made public yet nor had Berliner ever seen one.  Berliner decided to experiment with building a device to transfer sound waves (the vibrations of air) along electrical wires. He started with a simple tin-can telephone and a soap box. He knocked the bottom out of the soap box and nailed sheet iron on instead, then placed a bar across the middle made of steel. With this, he created an iron diaphragm transmitter, similar to the telephone that Alexander Bell had invented. With this invention, he had to figure out a way to amplify the sound so that it would function as a true communications instrument and not just as a sound transformer. His initial design for what he called the microphone failed. He could not get the sound from fading as the waves traveled farther from the device. The solution to the problem was suggested by one of Berliner’s close friends during a conversation between the two men. Berliner’s friend, who worked at a telegraph station, explained to him that the harder he pressed down on the telegraph key, the stronger the current passing through the key became. This was the information that helped Berliner to understand why the waves were fading out so quickly. He needed to come up with a way to produce a stronger current. Using a toy drum to which he attached a steel button linked to a metal wire, Berliner built the first microphone. When contact was made between the diaphragm and the button, sound was transmitted and amplified in such a way that the waves did not fade like his earlier invention. The device functioned when the steel wire was hooked up to a battery and an induction coil. This was the process by which he developed the microphone.","Emile Berliner needed to patent the device in order to secure credit for his microphone invention. When he applied for the microphone patent on June 4, 1877, a fourteen-year conflict began over his patent. After the microphone was invented, it was discovered that in order to make a functional telephone, you needed a combination of Bell’s magneto receiver and Berliner’s microphone transmitter. The patent office did not know who to award the patent to because both inventions were so similar that they needed to investigate further. This caused great debate about who invented the microphone first. The Supreme Court finally recognized Emile Berliner for the invention of the microphone and granted him his patent on November 17, 1891.","With this success, Berliner landed a job as chief engineer at the Bell Telephone company. The company paid him $50,000 for his rights to the patent so that they could market it as their own. Berliner continued inventing and although he does not seem to have received much recognition for his initial invention due to Bell’s popularity, he played a vital role in the invention of both the microphone and the telephone.","Emile Berliner was an important inventor who had a tremendous impact on the broadcasting industry. At the time of the article’s publication in 1926, Berliner was still busy inventing and playing a role in the evolving science of acoustics. He went on to invent acoustic cells and acoustic tiles, which helped to perfect the acoustics in large buildings. His great invention of the microphone came to him by way of a few experiments and correcting some minor mistakes. Yet, his first major invention has had a major impact on society for over 120 years."],"display_date":"September 1, 1926","search_date":"1926-09-01","locations":[{"id":21755,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2511,"tag":"Inventor"},{"id":2510,"tag":"Microphone"},{"id":2522,"tag":"Emile Berliner"}],"course":{"name":"From Civil War to World Stage","school":"Widener University","course_id":133,"school_id":43}},{"id":6287,"title":"Nicaragua Applauds Commodore Pauling for Capturing William Walker","course_id":137,"status":"P","start_date":"1857-12-01","end_date":"1858-03-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On March 31,1858 the Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua wrote to United States Naval officer Hiram Paulding concerning his role in the capture and removal of the American filibusterer William Walker from Nicaraguan soil. In the letter, the government of Nicaragua applauded Paulding for his actions and informed him that “the [Nicaraguan] minister plenipotentiary in Washington was expressly directed to make known to the government of the United States that Nicaragua approved with full satisfaction the capture on its own territory of those revolutionist [Walker and his men] by the naval forces under your [Pauling’s] orders.”","In the months after Paulding’s December 1857 seizure of Walker, the capture’s actions had been called into question. Upon being returned to the United States Walker, who had previously studied law, took his case to the press. As summarized by historian William O. Scroggs, Walker  “coolly discussed Paulding’s invasion of the territory of a friendly power and his insult to its flag.” He then began to make claims that “It was the duty of the American Government…to return his men to the place from which they had been forcibly removed, and to salute the flag of Nicaragua for the insult it had received.”","While obviously overplaying his concern for Nicaragua’s national honor, Walker’s argument and his cause found favor with many in the southern masses including several southern congressmen. In fact, according to historian James McPherson, Georgia representative “Alexander Stephens urged the court-martial of the commodore who had detained Walker [Paulding].” Stephens was not alone in his views. No less than “two dozen Southern senators and congressmen echoed this sentiment in an extraordinary congressional debate.” The future of Paulding’s military career seemed uncertain.","Nicaragua was not oblivious to these ongoing debates. In the March letter to Paulding, the Nicaraguans expressed the “deep pain” felt by their government upon hearing “that the partisans of filibusterism have endeavored to blacken your [Paulding’s] conduct.” It is perhaps in response to these pains that the letter was written. By ensuring that “the grateful voice of the [Nicaraguan] government, of the people of Nicaragua, and all Central Americans rendering thanks to Commodore Paulding” gained a hearing by the American Congress, Nicaragua hoped to help save the career of the Naval officer who a few months earlier had helped to save them.","William Walker’s filibustering escapades in Central America were not over. In his final attempt at Nicaragua the British Navy captured Walker and turned him over to Central American authorities who were far less tolerant of the filibuster’s conduct. In the words of McPherson, “on September 12, 1860, the grey-eyed man [Walker] met his destiny before a Honduran firing squad.”"],"display_date":"December 1857 - March 1858","search_date":"1858-01-29","locations":[{"id":1275,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":11,"place":"Washington City, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":1854,"tag":"Filibuster"},{"id":1418,"tag":"Nicaragua"},{"id":442,"tag":"Foreign Politics"},{"id":2554,"tag":"Alexander Stephens"},{"id":2553,"tag":"Hiram Paulding"},{"id":2552,"tag":"William Walker"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":137,"school_id":3}},{"id":6271,"title":"Greenbelt: Enthusiasm and Exclusion","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/35","end_date":"12/31/37","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["Of all the federal government’s attempts to deal with the Great Depression, few were as ambitious as the creation of the Resettlement Administration. The Resettlement Administration, established in 1935, was originally designed to move farmers to more productive agricultural areas. Once farmers were moved off of poor landscapes, the agency sent in conservation experts to reclaim and improve the land. The Resettlement Administraion also oversaw the creation of model communities, designed to serve as examples of how people could live more harmoniously with the environment. The towns highlighted the necessity of green space and public transportation and emphasized the value of cooperative living. The Resettlement Administration worked with over 200 existing rural and suburban communities and actually designed three entirely new towns before the agency was dissolved.","Greenbelt, Maryland, was one of the three towns planned and established by the Resettlement Administration.

On Sunday, September 9, 1928, <em>The Washington Herald </em>reported on Emile Berliner’s success as he contributed another innovation in the field of sound transmission. As described in the newspaper article<em>, </em>“based upon a lifetime of experience in the study of sound, he has invented the acoustic cement cell which… has the effect of clarifying and amplifying the tones of a speaker’s voice or the notes of a musical instrument.” In other words, Berliner was triumphant yet again, in advancing sound technology by developing the acoustic cement cell. The acoustic cement cell was a simple device which attached to the interior walls of a room. The cells were usually shaped like a square or rectangle, and they were made of cement, although the inside was hollow. When an ample amount of cells were hung in a single room, they would diminish the reverberations and echoes generated by speakers or musical instruments, especially those generated in a large hall. Although Berliner had experimented with sound production and transmission technologies for much of his life, his dedication to studying sound showed concrete results with development of the new building material. According to <em>The Washington Herald, </em>“Berliner’s newest invention was crowned with success in a trial in the auditorium of the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia.” Along with that, <em>The Washington Herald </em>announced “the Berliner acoustic cement wall cells have been tested with eminent success in the spacious board room of the magnificent District Building in Washington D.C.” This means that Berliner tested his product in well-established and highly respected institutions. Upon doing so, Berliner once again gained national recognition for revolutionizing sound in an inconceivable fashion.","Besides creating the acoustic cement cell, Berliner was responsible for producing other distinct designs in an age of industrialism. Berliner was influential in telephone technology. More specifically, Berliner “discovered that the device could act as a superior telephone receiver” (Encyclopedia Britannica). Despite Berliner’s concentration on sound evolution, The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers notes, Berliner was responsible for building an “aircraft engine and helicopter.” It is clear, even with all his focus on sound throughout his life, Berliner was a true visionary who expanded other facets of technology. Berliner’s success is beyond remarkable, especially considering his educational background. The Library of Congress chronicles that “Berliner was a largely self-educated man.”  In spite of, his lack of formal education, Berliner still displayed a unique mindset as he supplied the world around him with intuitive inventions.","To this day, Berliner continues to receive recognition for his innovations. Berliner, although deceased, won a “Trustees Award in 1987 and a Technical Award in 2014” (News.Delaware.Gov). Although it has been over 100 years since his groundbreaking discoveries, Berliner is still acknowledged for his inventions. Additionally, many of Berliner’s designs are still currently used. The recording industry, along with the field of communications, is forever indebted to Berliner’s intellectual concepts. Still, his expertise, experimentation, discoveries, and devices have affected much more than those two areas of entertainment, without a doubt.

While women's wartime industrial work is well-known, less well known is the fact that women also engaged in homefront agricultural work by joining the Women’s Land Army.","The goal of the Women’s Land Army was to fill the roles men had left behind on farms while they were away fighting. During the course of the war, the Women’s Land Army had recruited over 1.5 million women to join the homefront efforts. Jean Wanamaker of Bel Air, Maryland, was one of the recruits. She was participated in the first nationally offered college course on farming for women, offered at the University of Maryland. The course was created to make sure that Women’s Land Army workers were appropriately trained before engaging in farm work. Jean joined mostly because she wanted the opportunity for training and income. Jean was one of several thousand women in the Maryland agricultural industry. They produced 40 percent more food than average, despite the fact that there had been 30 percent decrease in farm labor.","Jean’s story is just one of millions that reflected the common attitude of women on the Homefront during WWII. Many felt their civilian role was just as important as men’s military role. They, too, were working for victory, by keeping the country's economy running. Though many of the women returned to their original domestic roles when WWII ended, they made strides for future generations of women."," "],"display_date":"1943 - 1945","search_date":"1944-07-01","locations":[{"id":25324,"lat":38.8324772244,"lng":-76.8447330303,"zoom":9,"place":"Prince Georges, Maryland"},{"id":26216,"lat":39.5358347431,"lng":-76.0898051386,"zoom":9,"place":"Harford, Maryland"}],"tags":[{"id":2564,"tag":"Women's Land Army"},{"id":242,"tag":"WWII"},{"id":13,"tag":"Agriculture"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"},{"id":7,"tag":"Women"}],"course":{"name":"Novelty and Nostalgia: The Rise of Modern America, 1877 to 1945","school":"University of Maryland, Baltimore County","course_id":132,"school_id":71}},{"id":6304,"title":"Greenbelt Maryland and the Traditional Family","course_id":132,"status":"P","start_date":"1/1/37","end_date":"12/31/45","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["The Great Depression had devastating affect on the American economy.

a warm June day in the year 1966, 28 frustrated women went to Washington D.C. to attend the third National Conference of Commissions.[1]  The topic for this conference was the status of women in the United States.  While some believed that women became equal in America the moment that they gained the vote, others, these 28 women specifically, believed that the U.S. still had a long way to go to gain equality between the sexes.  Yet upon attending the conference they felt that not enough of the issues were being dealt with or even discussed.  Issues like that of equal opportunities for employment for both sexes.[2]  These 28 intelligent and educated women experienced first-hand the discrimination and limitations that came with being a woman in the job market during that time.[3]  Even though, governmental departments such as the Women’s Bureau may have been putting out reports of female contentment in the private sphere, or the home, these women said different.[4]  Soon after the conference these 28 women founded the National Organization for Women, an American Feminist Advocacy group.","These 28 women after leaving the conference threw their anger at the lack of progress for women into creating an activist feminist organization whose goal was to attempt to tip the scales in the favor of women everywhere in America.[5]  They wanted to challenge a system that would have much preferred women remain in their supposedly traditional roles in the home.[6]  Also to give a voice to the issues that women cared about and effected them directly, on a political and national scale.  With the help of Betty Friedman, the author of <em>The Feminine Mystique</em>, these women formed a feminist civil rights group.  Friedman also came up with the idea to name the group “NOW” or the National Organization for Women.[7]  Books like Friedman’s <em>Feminine Mystique </em>helped to create a consciousness in the United States which led to more discontentment with the status of women in the country.[8]  This consciousness along with many other factors contributed to the women’s movement in that time and eventually the creation of the National Organization for Women.","Later as NOW grew to include chapters all across the United States they felt the need to share their origin story.  So pamphlets were distributed, recounting the narrative of the founding of the organization to the newly formed chapters all over the country.  This most likely give the new chapters a sense of connection to the group on its national level.  Rather than just each individual chapter creating its own ideology and goals, NOW wanted all the chapters to understand the importance of the ideas that the organization was founded upon and the goal of helping women to gain their political voice."," ","[1]NOW Origins Pamphlet, in MSS 310 National Organization for Women National records,","Administrative 1966-1993, Special Collections, Augustana College, Rock Island IL.","[2]

Wilson sat at his desk trying to organize his thoughts. World War I continued on while he tried to fix the problems at home as well as overseas. On June 7, 1918, President Wilson typed up a letter and sent it to Carrie Chapman Catt who was a leading figure in the women’s suffrage movement. Wilson pictured the United States as the leader of the democratic world during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. However, it was hardly democratic itself. Women were not allowed to partake in politics, specifically in voting for their representatives. Many women had been trying to change this by adding a women’s suffrage amendment to the constitution since at least 1848 with little success.","President Wilson did very little with women’s suffrage at first. Many women even picketed the White House in 1917 in order for Wilson to take them seriously. The protest put many women into jail because violence broke out. His daughter, Jessie Woodrow Wilson Sayre, was also a prominent leader in the women’s suffrage movement. Around the time of the protests, Wilson had a sudden change of heart.  These various factors may have contributed to Wilson’s change in attitude towards the women’s movement.","Finally after much hard work, the leaders of women’s suffrage had gained a powerful ally in 1918. That ally would be none other than the President himself, Woodrow Wilson. In the letter, President Woodrow Wilson stated that he agreed with Catt on her views for, \"...democratic reconstruction of the world for which we are striving, and which we are determined to bring about at any cost, will not have been completely or adequately attained until women are admitted to the suffrage…” Carrie Chapman Catt had finally convinced a world leader about the importance of women’s suffrage.  It was now only a matter of time before her hope for women would become a reality with the eventual passage of the 19<sup>th</sup> Amendment."," "],"display_date":"June 7, 1918","search_date":"1918-06-07","locations":[{"id":17283,"lat":38.9151212228,"lng":-76.9435162098,"zoom":10,"place":"Dist Columbia, District of Columbia"}],"tags":[{"id":2645,"tag":"Woodrow Wilson"},{"id":2646,"tag":"Carrie Chapman Catt"},{"id":2647,"tag":"Women's Suffrage"}],"course":{"name":"History of Women in the U.S.","school":"Augustana College","course_id":144,"school_id":54}},{"id":6360,"title":"<strong>David F.

President Woodrow Wilson famously insisted that, \"America was too proud to fight\" in the European conflict. During this time, President Wilson pursued a non-intervention policy and tried to help mediate peace for all sides. He realized that the German government, in particular, was not interested in ending the war. On May 7, 1915, a German U-boat sank the British ocean liner <em>RMS Lusitania </em>killing 128 Americans. President Wilson was forced to make a stand and told the Germans that unrestricted warfare on non-military targets would not be tolerated. The German government originally agreed with the demand but by January 1917 they had sunk an additional seven U.S merchant ships. Realizing that he was now out of options, President Wilson called for war. Congress complied and declared war on April 6, 1917.","Soon after America declared war, Secretary of Agriculture David F. Houston wrote a commentary encapsulating his thoughts about U.S preparedness for the conflict entitled <em>U.S War Readiness, 1917. </em>Houston's insights about America's preparation for war and its speedy development of civil and military production capabilities shows exactly what kind of man he was. An academic with a degree in political science from Harvard University, Houston had taught at the University of Texas where he eventually became dean of the facility. Afterwards, he had accepted a job as president of rival university Texas A & M. He then proceeded to become chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis before accepting a position in President Wilson's cabinet. Toward the end of the war he became Secretary of the Treasury. He eventually left politics and entered the business world as president of Bell Telephone financial subsidiary, Bell Telephone Securities. Afterwards, he served as director of AT&T, the Guaranty Trust Company, and the United States Steel Corporation.","When David F. Houston wrote <em>U.S War Readiness, 1917 </em>he wasn't trying to hide his emotional state regarding the conflict. He was a very patriotic man who believed - along with many Americans - that the time had come for the United States to enter the war. His writings highlighted the magnitude of such an undertaking. Even Houston could not comprehend the vast funds authorized by Congress to support the war machine. For example, he writes that Congress had authorized over $21 billion dollars toward war efforts. The money was allocated for military operations that included building machinery such as ships and airplanes, maintaining supplies for the troops, transportation needs, and adequate medicine and medical care for the wounded. Houston states that the budget for ship construction of $1.9 billion dollars was nearly double the former federal budget as a whole. On the topic, Houston said, \"The figures even for particular items are beyond comprehension.\" Houston goes on to write in great detail about the cost of all facets of military operations.","What may be more incredible than the financial and industrial output necessary to support the war effort were the programs that were developed to safeguard these operations. Houston mentions that only a few months earlier, the Council of Defense was formed. Some of the responsibilities of the committee included mobilizing forces, utilizing waterways and highways, increasing domestic production for military commitments, and being able to utilize the nation's resources immediately if warranted. Houston also draws special attention to seven agencies still in their infancy that he thinks would play \"peculiar importance\" in the war mobilization. These newly-formed agencies included a shipping board, and aviation, medical, transportation, munitions, and labor committees. Houston says that these governmental bodies were able to become truly effective when the United States entered war. Other agencies that were created to regulate wartime activities include the Food Administration, the Fuel Administration, the War Council, the War Trade Board, and the War Industries Board. It is clear that Houston considers the War Industries Board to be of the greatest importance. He explains that all purchases for the Allies have to be approved by the three-person committee. The War Industries Board analyzes all aspects of industrial operations and makes commodity purchases large enough to effect market values.","In his essay, David F. Houston shares his thoughts on how America mobilized its economic and industrial might after it entered World War One. His writing shows just how overwhelmed he was with America's massive production abilities and the programs that kept war preparation operations running efficiently. He understood that technology alone would not win the war. He stated, \"No machinery is of great value unless it is properly manned.\" He believed that Americans would rise to the challenge.

However, he also believed that it would be disastrous to simply repeal it without any new tariff to take its place.  He explained that the newest version of the tariff had not been in place for more than nine months and therefore they could not possibly understand its true ramifications, as they did not yet know the experimental effects of the tariff yet and that was imperative information needed to improve policy in the future.  Clay, known as “the Great Compromiser,” made his motives clear saying, “I am anxious to find out some principle of mutual accommodation, to satisfy, as far as practicable, both parties.”  ","            The first modification he proposed was a change to the tax percentage on the tariff.  Clay argued that it would be sufficient to change it from twenty percent to fifteen or seventeen percent to help lighten the burden felt by the South while still protecting the domestic textile industry from the competitive foreign market. Another modification he proposed reduced the cost of “woollens” by five percent for poor southerners as well as those that are intended for the consumption of slaves.  He hoped this would make the southern states feel less attacked by the tariff and see it as a protection on the country’s industry as a whole.  Clay acknowledged the uncertainty of this modification stating “no calculation could be more uncertain than that.”  After he had finished this portion of his speech, he explained that should this bill go into operation, he had no doubt that it would be adhered to by all parties, thus diffusing the nullification crisis.   ","            With these modifications, Clay’s bill was passed and the Compromise Tariff of 1833 went into effect.  This version made the South happy enough to diffuse rising sectional tensions for the moment.  The new version of the tariff still favored the power of the federal government and undermined the nullification doctrine.  Henry Clay eased sectional tensions by thinking about the future in a way that no other congressman was able to do and therefore, unknowingly, delaying the seccession crisis by another thirty years.  "],"display_date":"February 12, 1833","search_date":"1833-02-12","locations":[{"id":53196,"lat":38.8860434,"lng":-76.999525,"zoom":2,"place":"Capitol Hill"}],"tags":[{"id":554,"tag":"Henry Clay"},{"id":3669,"tag":"Nullification Crisis"},{"id":3670,"tag":"Tariff"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":188,"school_id":3}},{"id":6867,"title":"Colonization Society Meeting to Ask for Federal Money","course_id":188,"status":"P","start_date":"1826-01-09","end_date":"1826-01-09","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On January 9, 1826, in Washington, D.C., the American Colonization Society (ACS) convened to review the annual “Report of the Managers.”  William H. Fitzhugh, Esq. of Virginia, a vice president of the society, offered resolutions to expand funding options. With a task as large as removing and relocating freed blacks from the United States back to Africa, “private charity is inadequate to its full execution; that the resources of the nation and the state are required for it…” The society needed the backing of the federal government to realize its chief goal.","The society dated to 1816, and the ACS could claim many prominent members such as Henry Clay, Andrew Jackson, and Abraham Lincoln. The ACS had one main goal; to relocate freed blacks back to Africa. As the population of enslaved Africans began to rise, the population of disenfranchised freed blacks rose as well. This growing assemblage of former slaves posed a significant stress on the predominantly white and racist society. Their main concern centered on the integration of the “inferior creatures” into society, as Samuel Hopkins, a member of the society, argued. Blacks living freely in the states, “could cause only injury to the slaves and disadvantage to the public” said Hopkins. Religious motives affirmed this massive project. Robert Finley,  a prominent figure in the society added, “The ACS was born out of religious benevolence and charity.” Claiming to be working in the name of God, freed Africans would liberate, “50 millions of people from the lowest state of ignorance and superstition, and restor[e] them to the knowledge and worship of the true God.” Using Christianity as a foundation, Elias Caldwell, another member, asserted that colonization was “a great national object and ought to be supported by the national purse.” Colonization seemed to be the only option at the time and in order for a project of this magnitude to be realized, the “national purse” needed to be opened. ","The ACS may have disapproved of slavery, but it remained blinkered by racist ideas. They justified the relocation of freed blacks as a benevolent action that solved the problem. This relocation supposedly benefited the, “American civil institutions, morals, and habits,” spread the word of God and redeemed the rest of Africa, Finley argued. Seemingly the only available option, the ACS gained supporters and momentum in antebellum South, with strong support from southern plantation owners who worried about the impact freed blacks would have on their slaves. As far as implementation, the cost of colonizing required incredible amounts of lives and money. Due to the magnitude of the project, private charity alone failed to cover the cost and thus the need for the appointment of a, “committee to draft memorials, to be immediately presented to the two houses of congress.”  Henry Clay’s campaign failed to produce grant money from the US government but the ACS received some state aid over the course of their existence.
