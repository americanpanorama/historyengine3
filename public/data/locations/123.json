They approached a Mr. D.F. Huddleston, a good citizen, who was sitting close to a tan yard.  The assassins demanded that he give up his arms, which he did, and then Hurst shot Huddleston in the head, forcing both eyes out.  Huddleston had a wife and four children that were left to face this horrible tragedy.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interesting part of this article, however, is the reference that it makes to the Union Army.  The article expresses utter disgust and embarrassment that these are these people represent the South and thus are people that Southerners do not want the Union Army to kill.  The article permits the Union men to kill these assassins Â“like dogs' if they ever encounter them.  At the end of the article, a list of names of all but four of the assassins is provided, so that Union men and soldiers may shoot them down whenever they find them.'"],"display_date":"February 20, 1864","search_date":"1864-02-20","locations":[{"id":12420,"lat":36.2828220019,"lng":-83.833004676,"zoom":10,"place":"UNION, Tennessee"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}}]}
