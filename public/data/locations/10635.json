Moore started his career as an educator in the Brevard County School System in 1925.  By 1934, he had organized and become president of the first branch of the NAACP in Brevard County; by 1946, he was the executive director for the Florida NAACP.  In 1949, Moore learned of a rape charge in a small Florida town called Groveland.  In what quickly escalated to a dramatic case, a white girl, Norma Padgett, accused four black men of raping her.  Her husband Willie said that he and Norma had been on their way home from a dance when his car stalled.  Four black men stopped to offer help, but instead beat him and escaped with Norma.  When Norma returned early the next morning, she spoke briefly to Willie and then claimed that the same four men had raped her.  Moore was among many in the NAACP who believed that Norma was lying to cover for Willie’s repeated abusive behavior.  A few days later, after an outbreak of violence against blacks in Groveland, Moore telegrammed the governor on behalf of the Florida NAACP to demand action to prosecute the perpetrators of the riots.  Nothing was done.","By the time the case went to trial, one of the four men had escaped and been killed.  The remaining three went on trial and were quickly convicted.  About a year later, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the convictions of two of the men – Shepard and Irvin.  In November, 1951, Sheriff McCall, was transporting the men for their pretrial hearing when he pulled over for a flat tire.  McCall claimed that the men attacked him when he opened their door and he was forced to shoot them, but Irvin survived to dispute McCall’s version of events.  Upon learning of this, Moore wrote an angry letter to the governor demanding to know how something like this could have been allowed to happen.","Though Moore never got an answer to his questions, the public was made well aware of his opinion on the mishandling of the Groveland case.  On December 25, 1951, less than a month after Moore’s letter, a bomb went off in his home, killing both himself and his wife.  Despite appeals from the NAACP and eventual FBI investigation, the murder was never solved.  However, the intense emotions surrounding the Groveland case had already incited racial riots several times over. Moore’s criticisms of the case, though they rang true with most blacks, most likely only enflamed the already strong hatred of him amongst racist whites.  It is easy to conclude, then, that Moore’s active involvement in the Groveland case was the final straw that made it seem necessary for civil rights opponents to eliminate him entirely.  "," "],"display_date":"July 1, 1949 - January 31, 1952","search_date":"1950-10-16","locations":[{"id":52955,"lat":28.6652727,"lng":-80.8447766,"zoom":8,"place":"Mims, FL"},{"id":52954,"lat":28.5580546,"lng":-81.8511889,"zoom":8,"place":"Groveland, FL"}],"tags":[{"id":3105,"tag":"Harry T.

Moore and on December 25<sup>th</sup>, 1951 when the Klu Klux Klan felt they had the power to decide someone’s destiny and planted a bomb in their home, killing them both instantly. Many may not recognize the name of Harry T. Moore, for he has been called an unsung hero, but there was grand reason why the K.K.K. did what they did and really didn’t deny participation in such a tragedy. Being the fearless fighter that he was, he fought selflessly until his last breath for equal rights for his black community and stated, “I am going to keep on doing it, even if it costs me my life.”[1]","            Harry T. Moore was man of many hats. Not only did he dedicate his life to teaching, but he was also an extremely passionate civil rights movement activist. Before the times of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X, Moore was setting foundations by starting his “Voteless Citizen is a Voiceless Citizen” campaign. Moore’s mission was to be able to give the African Americans the right to register as Democrats and to be able to vote in the primaries. Although this was not an easy task, Moore made a promise he would fight for racial equality for he felt that the injustices that his community suffered was due to the lack of rights to participation in an election, and he was certain he would be part of that change.","            Going back to the late 1800s when there were not many regulations in place, the white Democrats had the power to choose who they wanted on their voter’s registration list. During this time frame less than 10% were blacks when the 40% was whites.[2] Over time this situation has definitely improved, and statistical evidence gathered by the Registration and Voting Rights of the Florida Secretary of State showing that non-white registrant have more than doubled since the decade of 1946 – 1956.[3] Moore had to do with a large contribution of this. With much of Moore’s efforts, registration went from 20,000 in 1944 to an amazing figure of 116,145 in 1950, increasing the amount of registrants by more than 50%. [4]","            There were many movements going on during this time frame. It wasn’t only Moore that had this mindset. Many events and protests were created not only to prove a point but also to raise awareness to those that weren’t aware of their rights. These events helped them also gain courage to make the proper moves to be part of the electoral process and make a difference. One such event was one conducted on April 8<sup>th </sup>1947, at the Congregational Church in Winter Park, Florida. This event was purposely planned to begin a protest against the 1947 legislature, created to abolish Negros from voting. Senator John E. Matthews of Jacksonville wanted to pass a bill that will bring a negative impact to the African American community that we have seen before in the history of Hitler and the Jews.[5] And these were situations that these communities would unite to then become a voting voice. ","            There have been many civil right activists in our history that have gone through great struggles and had made a difference for many generations to come. They have endured torturous treatment both emotional and at times physical, simply for standing up for what they truly believe in. One of these individuals was Harry T. Moore. Moore, a person that did all he did and remains in the unknown. An almost father of civil rights movements, and yet his history and sacrifice has been lost in time. All a while, the supremacist racial community, Klu Klux Klan remains as strong as ever still until this day. Makes you think if all that has been given and lost through time in order to give us our freedom and rights has been all taken for granted."," ","[1] Ben Green, Before His Time: The Untold Story of Harry T.
