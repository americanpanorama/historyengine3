The teachers needed to talk about the best way to educate the hundreds of students entering the new public school system. Reverend A. B. Kinsolving opened the session by leading prayers. Mr. Hall began the discussion by encouraging the teachers to express their candid views on each topic covered over the course of the day. The first topic was whether teachers should allow whispering and talking during class. One young woman delivered an emphatic speech about the dangers of tolerating this behavior. Since everyone unanimously agreed on this issue, the group proceeded to the next topic: corporal punishment. There was a lively and animated debate. Since no consensus was reached, the teachers decided to postpone this discussion. They next talked about the best ways to teach reading, writing, arithmetic, and other subjects. The body reached an agreement much more quickly on these issues, finishing just in time for lunch.","Few people were familiar with public schools in the 1880s, especially in rural regions like Virginia's Eastern Shore. If they could afford it, parents sent their children to expensive private schools at remote distances. However, nearby Accomack County had opened eight local public schools by 1886, and Richmond County wanted to close the gap. Taxpayers provided 1.126 per child for schools in the Northern Neck, inequitably distributed between white and black schools. Many people wanted to increase this funding for religious reasons. While the teachers disagreed about corporal punishment, everyone at the Institute understood the important role Christian principles would have in the budding school system. Accordingly, the Institute opened its session with a prayer led by the local Reverend. As early as 1875, concerned citizens held concerts of prayer to recognize the importance of studying the Scriptures in all of [the] schools. At a teacher's meeting in the city of Richmond, teachers discussed the issue of Instruction in Moral and Mental Science so that children [without] proper home influence.. would have [it] taught in the schools.

Having previously come from a rural town, John Wise was mocked by his schoolmates for being a provincial bumpkin.  However, most of the abuse from his fellow students was due to his father's political persuasion as a Democrat.  In one particular passage of his writing, he recounted how his days as a schoolboy in Richmond were comprised of deflecting taunts, and fighting off bullying from the sons of Whig and Know-Nothing citizens who were instilled with a hatred of all things Democrat.  At this time, the Whigs had essentially joined forces with the new American, or Know-Nothing Party, against the Democrats.  Many of Henry Wise's votes had come from the rural Virginia farmers and yeoman, while Richmond itself was a stronghold of Know-Nothingism.  "," The American Party, also known as the Know-Nothings, began in 1855.  It was founded along the lines of a secret society with elaborate initiation rituals, and a series of secret passwords and coded communications between its members.  Its platform was essentially radical nationalism that included anti-immigration and anti-Catholicism stances.  As the Whig party began to slowly loose strength in the United States, members often threw their allegiance to the Know-Nothing Party in an attempt to continue fighting the Democrats.  The Know-Nothings took power in some Northern states, and were so strong in Richmond that Democrats were referred to as The Spartan Band there."],"display_date":"November 1, 1855 - January 30, 1856","search_date":"1855-12-15","locations":[{"id":14218,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":10,"tag":"Urban-Life/Boosterism"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2579,"title":"A Private Army in Virginia\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1859-01-01","end_date":"1859-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In the writings of his autobiography, TJ Macon recorded with great pride,that in 1859, he joined the First Company Richmond Howitzers,a militia artillery unit that drilled in the city and was composed of volunteers from the surrounding area. Macon was also quick to state that he later served in combat with this unit during the war between the states.Serving in such a unit was special to Macon because it was a clear act of serving his community. Not only did he drill to protect his home, but the men on either side of him were his friends and neighbors, prepared to make the same sacrifice alongside him.  His service in this unit made him an object of admiration and pride in the community, the concept of a noble southern gentleman defending his city.  However, Macon's youthful enthusiasm was most certainly curtailed when he experienced the harsh reality of the Civil War battlefield, where the pageantry and glory of parades through downtown Richmond would be replaced by the acrid smell of cordite and the cries of the dying. ","In the 1850s, with the memory of British tyranny not far from the minds of many Americans, there was still a great deal of wariness in regards to the idea of a standing federal army and professional military leadership.  Beginning in 1792,Congress began requiring able bodied men to serve in local militia units.  In 1808, the law provided that authority over these units fell to the state governor rather than the federal government, a forerunner of the modern National Guard.  With distrust of federal forces being particularly prevalent in the South, militias such as the Public Guard in Richmond were formed to provide local communities with some military muscle.  These militias provided well armed and well-disciplined units that could provide security in times of unrest, as well as acting as a type of police force.  While few, if any southerners would explicitly say so, these units also gave southerners peace of mind in the sense that any slave revolt would be met by a rapid and lethal response from local units who would not be subject to bureaucratic or political red tape as federal troops would be.","    This idea of military self sufficiency also led to a new martial state of mind in the southern gentry, whereby they stoked the idea of their ancestors being dashing Cavaliers, fighting across the plains of England during its Civil War in defense of their ideals.

It detailed the departure by rail of elements of Richmond's volunteer militia regiment, men who were being sent to suppress the insurrection that was taking place. The readers were also stunned to read that the governor of Virginia had ordered the men to Harpers Ferry himself; they were not called up by the federal government, which had already dispatched its own troops, US Marines under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Lee.  Furthermore, Governor Henry Wise accompanied the vanguard units on a commandeered mail train to the scene of the action, with the remaining companies of the militia to be sent the next morning when more trains would be available. The citizens of Richmond could only guess how tumultuous the situation was if their own governor was personally leading the military effort. The bulk of the passage detailed the sad sight of the departing troops.  It described legions of young men and boys going off to fight in the war, not knowing if they would return in good health, or at all.","This editorial is interesting because on the one hand, it demonstrates the capabilities of the state run militia.  Governor Wise was able to call up and deploy the men in order to deal with a situation in his state without any input from the federal government. However, the true importance of this editorial lies in the southern perception of the events surrounding the Harpers Ferry raid.  The wording and tone of this passage made it very clear that people saw this event as a grave threat to state stability and peace.  One also gets the sense that there was a widespread belief that there was a major battle occurring in Harpers Ferry. There is no doubt that much of this misconception was due to the slow travel of news; the common citizens in Richmond would have no way of knowing that Brown only commanded 18 men, half of whom were dead by this time. However, even if they had known this, the principal behind this raid was what disturbed so many southerners. They saw it as a physical threat on their security by the abolitionist movement as a whole."],"display_date":"October 18, 1859","search_date":"1859-10-18","locations":[{"id":14218,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2601,"title":"A Father&#39;s Last Wish \n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1843-09-07","end_date":"1843-09-07","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["A formal and standard law of wills was vital to the American property system and was fundamental for the transfer of assets.

In the cavalier lifestyle, honor was central to a man's standing and level of respect within the community.It was entirely acceptable, and in fact expected, that a man would be willing to put his life on the line in order to defend his own honor. While dueling was never particularly popular in the United States, there was a massive public outcry against it in the wake of the 1804 death of Alexander Hamilton in a duel with Aaron Burr.Therefore, while Mr. Reynolds would certainly like to restore his reputation through a duel to the death, it is highly unlikely that these two men would come to deadly blows; rather, upon meeting to duel, they would reach a verbal agreement, as was the common practice at the time.Nevertheless, this illustrates the ferocity with which southern men were willing to defend their honor, opinions, and reputation."],"display_date":"October 29, 1845","search_date":"1845-10-29","locations":[{"id":14217,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":1,"tag":"Crime/Violence"}],"course":{"name":"Rise And Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":1,"school_id":1}},{"id":2606,"title":"The Legal Rights of Women in Richmond\n","course_id":1,"status":"P","start_date":"1858-09-11","end_date":"1858-09-11","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By all accounts, Frances Taylor was a kind woman and a caring mother.

The best way that she saw fit to do this was to sell some of the lands she possessed for profit, and to pass the others down through her line. While she legally owned the property, she enlisted the aid of her husband, D.B., in helping her to draw up the contract and conduct the sale. Unbeknownst to Frances however, D.B. was in grave financial straits and plotted to sell the more valuable portions of land that she wanted for her children, to his creditors, in order to avoid bankruptcy.  Upon inquiry from his wife, he simply told her that everything had been done as she wanted it.  After the death of Frances, her children came aware of this plot, and took D.B. to court. ","While women did not possess many of the rights that men did, particularly the right to vote, they were allowed to own, buy, and sell property.

In fact, even when these women married, they often kept their holdings separated from their husband's and managed them independently. In this case, Frances Taylor trusted her husband to act as her agent and instead he betrayed her. However, many women successfully managed properties with no help at all from men.

In fact, their sales business had seen mostly boon time since they first established in Richmond in 1849.   However, for their merchandise, times were not so good.  They found their families torn apart and their bodies broken; Templeman and Goodwin were slave traders, and their merchandise was human beings.  During the aforementioned period, 33 slaves were sold for a total profit of 12,390.  This was a very large amount of money at this time.  The slaves were sold individually at prices ranging from 700 to 1000 on average.  It is interesting to note that when slaves were sold, only the name of the buyer was listed, that of the slave was omitted.  It was as if the traders wanted to forget that a particular slave ever existed.  Slaves' names were listed when they were first acquired; however, only a temporary first name was entered and an identification number assigned along with it, in what appears to be a tactic for dehumanization.  ","    As a centrally located major southern city, Richmond was a bustling slave trade market.  Traders would often come from the Tidewater area by way of the James River with slaves from all around the South.  The James also served as a highway in the opposite direction as well, with Richmond born slaves being moved to ports such as Norfolk to be sent to the Deep South.  Slave traders themselves were a varied group.  Some were rather unscrupulous men who sought to achieve great wealth quickly and had reputations for overabsuing their charges.  However, other slave traders were working in what they considered a family business.  They often took great pride in their work and on their reputations of delivering high quality slaves at reasonable prices.  In a fashionable metropolis such as Richmond, there can be no doubt that more then a few of the elite citizenry were heavily involved in the slave trade.

However, in 1850's Virginia, there was really only one market that was truly booming, and that was tobacco. His analysis of the Virginia tobacco trade was the most important aspect of his job, as the economic prosperity of Virginia walked hand in hand with the fortunes of the tobacco industry. In January of 1853, he issued a report on the state of the tobacco market in Richmond. He described the physical properties of the yearly tobacco yield, as well as how farmers should pack and present them for sale and production. One measure recommended was to be sure to remove all impure tobacco so as not to taint the yield. Brown went on to claim that from 1840 to 1850, tobacco production dropped by ten percent in the United States; however, production increased by ten percent as well. He cited these figures as evidence that tobacco would be able to command a good price in 1853. Brown also stated that Virginia's tobacco crop would never be able to compete in terms of quantity with that produced in the western United States; therefore, farmers in Virginia should strive to tout the superior quality of their tobacco in order to make sales. He went on to advise that in order to achieve this quality, farmers should take proper care of their soil as well as the crops themselves."," There is little doubt that tobacco was at the heart of Virginia's prewar economy, and Richmond itself was the major trafficking point within the state. Farmers from the fertile hills of central Virginia and the Piedmont traveled to Richmond in hopes of securing contracts with large tobacco processors with factories in Richmond. In the city at this time, there were at least 17 major factories that sold and shipped high quality processed tobacco all around the state and country. Richmond's central location proved ideal, with major shipments going by rail and wagon to Washington and Baltimore, while barges carried other shipments down the James River to ports in the Tidewater. From there, Virginia tobacco found its way all around the world.

A riot followed, with the mob hurling paving stones at the officers all the way to the station-house.  Captain Junkins, two sergeants, and one private were all seriously injured.  The incident caused enough of a disturbance to compel General Schofield to arrive at the scene along with a company of the 11 Virginia Regiment.

Zephaniah Turner raised this question repeatedly before the House of Delegates in Richmond. In the eyes of Turner, West Virginians were just as responsible for payment as Virginians, seeing as how the debt had existed before dismemberment of the state. Turner blasted Virginia's political representatives for rattling on about preserving honor when their priority should have been to prevent burdening the state's citizens with enormous taxes. When the people discover the unjust tax plans, Turner exclaimed, they would run out the current leaders and elevate to their places others who have less sublimated ideas of honor and fame and the past, and more practical ones as to the present and future."," In the aftermath of the Civil War, Virginia faced a significant economic hurdle-- a public debt of approximately 45 million. Although the debt, initially used to fund transportation initiatives like railroads and canals, started out as 33 million prior to war, the amount had swelled to its present state. Debates ensued over how to pay this sum. Since the westernmost counties of Virginia had only established the new state of West Virginia in 1863, some, like Turner, argued that the debt belonged to West Virginia as well and thus Virginians were not legally bound to pay anything. However, the main controversy of 1871 became whether Virginia should fund its entire debt plus interest or pay at a readjusted (reduced) level. This battle catalyzed the formation of two factions, the Funders and the Readjusters."," In 1871 the state government passed the Funding Act. This legislation pledged Virginia to pay the debt in full, marking the state as the only southern postwar government to fund its debt at such a high rate. As rationale, Funders pointed to the importance of saving the honor of Virginia, although additional motivation came from the fact that many were looking to profit from their state bonds. The Funders' decision eventually proved to be a strain for Virginia as it exhausted the state of its revenues and forced it to borrow just to continue operating its government. Leaders also severed funding for social services such as asylums, encouraged skyrocketing property taxes, and enforced new taxation on items such as dogs and liquor consumption. In addition, although constitutional requirements demanded the state to assume most of the cost of the new public school system, the Funders instead chose to shut down half of its schools, citing public education as a luxury.

The F&P Railroad Company, on the other hand, charged that when Richmond chartered the company in 1834, the city specifically granted the company's directors the power to place whatever vehicles they deemed necessary on the railroads. The court eventually ruled in favor of Richmond, deciding that the city's inherent right to guard the safety and welfare of its citizens did not violate any contract between Richmond and the F&P Railroad Company."," In the Reconstruction-era South, railroads played a prominent role, expanding in number (mileage doubled in the years from 1865 to 1880) while functioning as a symbol for urban development and economic growth. Between 1868 and 1873, white southerners touted railroad construction as the key to revitalizing their war-torn region, and indeed, Judge Christian mentioned in his opinion that when the railroad company was founded, Broad Street was a mere turnpike, neither graded nor paved, with scattered houses on the side. By the time of the case, however, Broad Street had become a site of many retail businesses and served as a bustling tourist site. "," At the same time, railroad companies suffered their share of critics. Many felt that the railroads exploited their lack of supervision to act like institutions beyond the reach of legislatures or courts. For example, railroads often charged excessively high fees, but denounced suggestions of rate regulations as violations of private property rights. In the Richmond vs. the F&P Railroad Company case, the railroad tried to convince the judge that its charter cemented a right by contract forever, and under all circumstances, to run its cars by steam, thereby exempting the company from any form of city regulatory laws.

The Baptist minister was a fierce advocate of higher education and lamented the fact that many young men attended schooling in their younger years, but, when about to enter the potential peak of their intellectual growth, chose to be practical and headed into business instead. Thus, Broadus set out in his essay to detail how college could benefit all men, including those destined for business as a merchant, manufacturer, agriculturalist, and so on. Latin and Astronomy, for example, were often dismissed as useless subjects, but Broadus pointed out that these branches could only strengthen the mind's thinking skills, which could then be applied to any field or situation. Wouldn't it be admirable if a merchant could make wise decisions based on complicated questions? An awareness of culture also contributed to the happiness of families, Broadus noticed, since men could teach their knowledge to their children. All in all, college, though expensive, would lead to enormous benefits in the future. And if a father's son refused to attend school? Argue with him, urged Broadus, exhort him, plead with him, and if he is still unwilling, make him go. "," The push for learning in this essay exhibits a wider sentiment that began in 1875 and continued through the twentieth century. A greater awareness of schooling had occurred during the early Reconstruction years due to state constitutions acknowledging citizens' right to education, but the general poverty of the South, combined with poor administration, led to a decline in schools and a high rate of adult illiteracy. In response, groups such as philanthropists, educators, and politicians aimed to remedy the situation by encouraging and providing education through various types of schools, including evening schools in textile communities and lay-by schools, schools that operated when cultivation of crops halted.

Just before, the Union had been condemning the South for seeking the intervention of the white French and English. "," In response to Lincoln's actions, Davis issued a statement of his own, declaring slave status for all free blacks in the South. Captured black Union soldiers would also be deemed chattel, as would all African Americans in any states taken by the Confederacy. Slavery is a corner-stone of a Western Republic, Davis emphasized, and the proper condition of the negro is slavery, or a complete subjection to the white man. "," The Confederate President composed his address during a bleak time for the South. A few months earlier, Southern troops had suffered defeats in both Kentucky and Maryland, obliterating any hopes of recognition and aid from England or any other European nations. Davis knew that Great Britain would not risk involvement in the conflict unless signs clearly pointed toward a Confederate victory. In addition, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation provided the North with the moral upper hand in the eyes of anti-slavery England and France. The South recognized its need to defend itself as the elimination of slavery became a major goal of the North, which had initially put forth preservation of the Union as its primary aim above all else. "," Davis' reference to blacks in the Union military reflected another significant difference between the North and the South. The North employed African Americans even before Lincoln's declaration; Union commanders sometimes recruited black troops, and in 1862 the War Department sanctioned the recruitment of African Americans. By the end of the war, almost one out of every ten Union soldiers was African American.

Carr told of Maria's feeble condition, noting, \"I had been nursing cousin Maria Carr who is recovering slowly, but so slowly that we rather hope than perceive the change from a tedious and dangerous fever and reduced to such hopelessness.\"  Most southern families, including the Carrs, did not use nurses.

Even in the latter part of the century, values firmly rooted in the pre-Civil War plantation culture remained prevalent. Mrs. Weisiger described her mother's virtues with special reverence as a woman whose life encountered many changes throughout the war and reconstruction years and yet still maintained her dignity as a Southern lady.

Howe to his brother John, of Enfield, Massachusetts on July 31, 1824. In meeting his brother's request, L.W. certainly provided an extensive account of the principal facets of life in the state of Virginia. Not only did he recount that the preferred beverage of the state was Whiskey, but he was mystified by the details of cooking because the process was all done in a \"separate house called a kitchen.\" What a strange concept to those hailing from the wintry climate of New England, where a trip outdoors to a separate building was absurd The most palpable aspect of Howe's letter, however, is the prominent role of agriculture and climate in central Virginian life. He noted that the \"wheat has come in very well and the prospect for corn is as good as it every was.\" Yet, when he discussed tobacco Howe displayed concern, in that \"the present prospect is promising, but it is a precarious crop.\" After he bemoaned the \"oppressive heat\" in the state, he promised his brother a copy of the Franklin Almanac when the new edition was published. In describing, \"how the Virginians live,\" the New Englander emphasized not their dress or manner, but instead the weather, soil, and crop yields that dictated planter life in the Commonwealth. ","    By the 1820s tobacco had brought wealth to Virginia for two hundred years. Throughout this time period it made its way from the Tidewater region to the Piedmont and became the central economic factor that brought wealth to the state. Howe's discussions of the climate and the Franklin Almanac were common amongst Virginians, who relied so heavily upon agriculture. The Panic of 1819, however, hit the southern states hard. Along with the plummeting of cotton rates came the decline of other agriculture products, including tobacco. Howe understood that Virginians were no longer able to depend on tobacco as a single cash crop. Aside from the concerns of the fluctuating market, tobacco itself depleted the soil and would not grow in the same area for more than three to four years. This made it significantly less profitable when the crop prices were low. According to Joseph A. CotÉ, in the <em>Encyclopedia of Southern Culture</em>, a lack of crop diversity was a danger to the \"overall development of the South.\" Virginia farmers came to this same conclusion and shifted to other agricultural endeavors such as wheat and corn to supplant their livelihoods. As hardship became more commonplace, farmers found it necessary to provide food for their families and slaves. Wheat and corn comprised a significant portion of the crops grown throughout the state. After the economic difficulties surrounding the Embargo Act of 1807, the War of 1812, and most prominently the Panic of 1819, planters could no longer safely rely on the tobacco market to provide for all of their needs.

This deceptive process of marking ballots incorrectly and giving them to illiterate blacks who would have voted in a different manner became common in the early 1880s.

In particular, there were still a disproportionate amount of railroads in the West and North compared to the South. The attempts to remedy the disparity had been largely unsuccessful up until this point. State legislatures gave railroad subsidies to companies hoping to spur railroad development; while the subsidies did add railroad lines throughout the South, the companies also abused the subsidies, using them for other purposes. Also, the lines were owned almost exclusively by companies in the North, so their effects on the Southern economy were limited. The difference in industry between the North and South was one of the things that lead to Southern secession from the Union, and even after the states were reunited the inequality in industry still remained a problem.

As many Confederate soldiers deserted and returned to their families, General Robert E. Lee appealed to their \"honor and duty\" by presenting only two options: \"war [or] abject submission.\" The only logical choice seemed to be a continuation of the fight for self-government at any cost. Lee offered pardon to any man \"improperly absent\" as long as he returned \"within the shortest possible time within 20 days.\" He declared that \"no general amnesty [would] again be granted\" in this final effort to reabsorb deserters into the Army of the Confederacy. Unfortunately for Lee, offering a sweeping pardon did not significantly recoup his dwindling supply of men still willing to fight.","Historians have pointed to desertion as one of the primary reasons for the South's defeat in the Civil War. The notion of the Civil War being a \"rich man's war, and a poor man's fight\" was a huge factor in desertion rates. One school of thought believes that as the war progressed, the yeoman farmers who were doing the majority of the fighting came to resent the planter aristocracy that was often exempted from military service due to various Confederate policies. The war became increasingly difficult, and many soldiers deserted due to economics, family, and personal sentiments. The less a man identified with the cause he was fighting for, the more likely he was to desert. Yeoman farmers did not own slaves, and the principles of slavery were not worth fighting and dying for as the war proceeded. In the final months of the war, desertion rates escalated as it became clear that the South would not emerge the victors.","James McPherson examines the Confederate soldier's experience through various diaries and letters and disagrees with this position. McPherson claims that Confederate men did not gain the conventional disillusionment and cynicism that would logically lead to desertion. The sources that he examines show soldiers continuing to assert the importance of the ideals they were fighting for throughout the conflict. Reasons for fighting would include defending their government, their manhood, their families, and their comrades. Although the reasons for desertion are clearly a subject of great debate among historians, it is clear that desertion made it increasingly difficult to pursue the collective goals of the Confederacy on the battlefield and inevitably contributed to Lee's surrender several months later."],"display_date":"February 15, 1865","search_date":"1865-02-15","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":11,"tag":"Economy"},{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":18,"tag":"Politics"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Rise and Fall of the Slave South","school":"University of Virginia","course_id":7,"school_id":1}},{"id":4147,"title":"The Last Rebel Paper\n","course_id":7,"status":"P","start_date":"1865-04-03","end_date":"1865-04-03","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["By 1865, General Robert E.

On November 23, 1860, the Richmond Daily Dispatch reported an account from the New York Journal of Commerce about the manufacturing and selling of \"Arms to the South.\" Before directly quoting the New York Journal of Commerce, the Richmond editor mentioned that the makers and sellers of arms were perhaps the only ones \"gathering any advantage from the present crisis.\"  According to the New York account, a firm in New York received anywhere from twenty to fifty orders for arms from South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama daily. The writer for the New York Journal of Commerce also mentioned that while those who did not know better might call the South's credit and financial dependability into question, the South actually concludes all business transactions with cash within thirty days. Adding significance to this article, the writer noted that all the orders came from Southern states, but \"but mainly from those in which secession is regarded as the only remedy for Southern grievances.\"","    The author of this article refers to the \"Colt's revolvers and rifles [sold] to Georgia,\" the arms for \"1,800 men…sent to Savannah,\" and the order of one thousand \"death-dealing weapons\" for Alabama. The New York Journal of Commerce ended this article with another seemingly biased statement that, \"the wholesale houses and agencies in the city [New York City] have been hard pressed to supply the orders for every imaginable species of weapons.\" These figures seem slanted towards Unionist and Northern sentiments, but perhaps these astronomical figures and seemingly exaggerated sentiments by Northerners were not as far-fetched as they first appear. ","    At the onset of the Civil War, the South struggled to provide adequate arms for Confederate troops. Records exist, however, of these several thousand modern small arms that were shipped to the Southern states and that were provided by Northern industries pre-Civil War. When these supplies were cut off at the start of the Civil War by orders of the U.S. government, smaller Confederate states began to produce and manufacture small arms, but they never were able to catch up with the production by the Northern states. It was at this point that the Confederacy turned to Caleb House in Europe in 1861 and 1862 for their weaponry and supplies. Despite the constant gaining and losing of arms in various battles during the Civil War, at the end of the war, the Confederacy, provided by Chief of Ordinance Josiah Gorgas, reported that they possessed 1,306 field artillery pieces, 921,441 rounds of artillery ammunition, 323,231 infantry arms, and 72,413,854 small arms cartridges. So, while the North was not the sole provider of the arms for Confederate armies, their early supplying of Confederate weaponry provided the basis for the Southern states to never lack in arms and ammunition, even though the conditions of these Confederacy arms was negotiable.

Northern abolitionists had hoped to amicably convert slaveholders through their postal campaign, yet had only further amplified the severity of the slavery issue to re-instill fear among the free black population in the South. After receiving antislavery mailings, fuming anti-abolitionists invaded the Charleston post office and snatched every letter and book in sight. They returned the following day and proceeded to torch any remaining mail in the flames of a large bonfire. Such anti-abolitionist mob behavior, with riots ensuing across both the North and South, had come to define the resistant and defiant reaction against Northern abolitionist activism.","It was in this contentious atmosphere that an anonymous Southerner wrote an opinion letter to the <em>Richmond Enquirer</em> in which he condemned acts of violent intimidation that suppressed both freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. His criticism, however, was not aimed at mobs in Charleston but rather at the “seditious and traitorous agitating measures” of those abolitionists who had exhibited a “fanatical and intolerant spirit” in Lowell, Massachusetts. According to the letter, a meeting held by a congregation of anti-abolitionists was abruptly disturbed with the sounds of violent screams and loud hisses, as fervent abolitionists attacked the building where the meeting was being orchestrated. The detailed account of abolitionist aggression provided in the letter mirrored the actions of many anti-abolitionist mobs, as the author attempted to redirect criticisms away from slaveholding anti-abolitionists. He called upon his fellow Southerners to take action against rising Northern activists, urging that immediate action was crucial to preventing any further abolitionist gains.","Specifically he called for a boycott of Northern goods. The suggested boycott of Northern manufactured goods by Southerners countered a growing trend among anti-slavery proponents known as the Free Produce Movement. The movement was generated by abolitionists who recognized the sinfulness of slavery and who refused to contribute to an economy based on slave labor. Quakers and free black abolitionists initiated the movement in the early 1820s, but the collective effort to disrupt the production, purchase, and procurement of slave-free goods lasted up until 1867. Just as this Southerner's criticisms of Lowell abolitionists mirrored the abolitionists' condemnations of anti-abolitionist acts of intimidation, in calling for a boycott of Northern manufactured goods he once again borrowed and adapted an abolitionist tactic. The author's careful literary manipulation is a notable rarity, as its existence demonstrates the rising tensions surrounding the issue of slavery, and the extent to which the matter had begun to affect the nation in its entirety. As the political implications of such strains surfaced nationally, the continued struggle for power between the North and South signified the magnitude of the slavery issue on a political, societal, and economic level. The cooperative balance that existed between the industrial North and labor intensive South was thus at risk with such boycotting tactics.","The implications of emancipation threatened the very foundation of the South’s economy and challenged the hierarchy of power that such Southerners were so accustomed to. The letter was one of numerous opinion letters published throughout various publications across the South during the aftermath of the abolitionist postal campaign, as Southern opposition began to manifest itself into formalized meetings, riots, and anti-abolitionist literature. Clearly, the beginnings of what would eventually become a decisive Southern antislavery movement had commenced."," "],"display_date":"September 8, 1835 - undefined 0, 0","search_date":"1867-10-19","locations":[{"id":14216,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":278,"tag":"boycott"},{"id":277,"tag":"anti abolitionism"}],"course":{"name":"The Abolitionists and American Society","school":"University of Richmond","course_id":23,"school_id":11}},{"id":4846,"title":"Patriarchal Slave System: How it worked","course_id":33,"status":"P","start_date":"1829-01-01","end_date":"1829-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"Y","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["<br /> ”Patriarchy is a system where males are the head of the family and have all the rights of decision-making,”a system that has persisted for many years in American History. Patriarchy was not only used in government bodies, but it was also used in determining a slave child’s fate. In A Treatise on the Patriarchal or Co-Operative System of Society a humble servant by the name of Z. Kingsley allows to find out how a couple’s offspring’s destiny was chose for them by their parent’s social status. <br /> Agriculture was a great foundation to the slave trade business, a business that soon became very popular among countries such as Spain, France, and the United States. Slaves were brought in from African countries and put to work in farms under the ruling of, more often than not, a white male. Sons and daughters of these slaves future all depended on the social status of their parents. Soon enough this procedure became a law, a “law that entitles the children of free quarteroons, to all white privileges, if the father is white.” Children, whose fathers were slaves, became slaves, and children whose father was white, was to have all of the same rights as a white would hold. <br /> Families were separated and many never reencountered after being transported to different parts to continue their lives as slaves. Children often loathed their parents for being slaves, and many ran away after search for freedom. White Americans benefited greatly from this new law. The reproduction of slaves greatly favored plantation owners since it added more slaves to work their land. Young children were not allowed to work in the fields, so masters often had children working in the house, doing chores such as cleaning. Many plantation owners allowed the children to stay in their house and play with the other children. After a certain age, they were placed along with the other slaves on the fields. <br /> Slave’s offspring was not only way slave population augmented. “The slave trade was the mechanism by which one of history’s greatest mass population transfers was affected,” and this was proven truth by the amounts of slaves that were being transferred over from Africa to America; men, women, and children. Ships were being sent over from all over African and European continent filled with slaves. While lives were being torn apart, and families were detached from their roots, American economy was increasing with every slave that stepped foot on slave soil. <br /> Slavery was a never-ending cycle, and slaves began to accept the fact that the slaves themselves and their children would be in bondage for the rest of their lives. Escaping the rigorous life of a slave was almost an impossible dream to achieve. The patriarchal system ruined the lives of young girls and boys who often dreamed of being free and returning to their homeland. The fight for their freedom was reflected on misconduct of many slaves, but such rebellions only cause them more pain. African American’s lives were changed, the only aspect being passed on from one generation to the next, was that of being a slave."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "],"display_date":1829,"search_date":"1829-07-02","locations":[{"id":14215,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":135,"tag":"Zephaniah Kingsley"},{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":456,"tag":"Patriarchy"}],"course":{"name":"HIS 240 African-American History I","school":"Rollins College","course_id":33,"school_id":5}},{"id":5001,"title":"Luxury Brooms","course_id":43,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-14","end_date":"1864-06-14","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 6, 1864, the Congress of the Confederate States prohibited its constituents from importing “articles not necessaries or of common use.” Such may be justified of a legislative body during wartime, but what is a foreign concept to the modern reader is the list of contraband: “vegetables, fruits, meats, poultry, and game, sealed or enclosed in cans or otherwise, and brooms and brushes of all kinds.”","The advent of the War Between the States brought not only bloodshed on the battlefield, but rationing, shortages, and hardships at home.

Sheridan, of the Union, speaks specifically to the feelings and thoughts of both the Union and the Confederacy.  In this letter Mosby directly calls out General Sheridan and says, “Six of my men who had been captured by your forces, were hung and shot in the streets of Fort Royal, by order and in the immediate presence of Brigadier-General Custer.  Since then another shared a similar fate.”  Mosby then goes on to say about seven of General Sheridan’s men captured by Mosby that, “seven of your men were, by my order, executed on the Valley Pike – your highway of travel.”","Although written by a Confederate Lieutenant Colonel and soldier, this letter reveals the way the Union was thinking towards the Confederate army.  The killing of six of Mosby’s men signifies the punishment that Union armies were planning to use against some of the Confederate Soldiers.  These killings may have been due to the fact that Mosby was not respected by Union leaders because of his “hit and run” strategy of fighting.  Mosby was known for eluding and quick strikes against Union regiments.  Mosby would not stand up and fight.  The Union leaders wanted to threaten Mosby and scare him away from these “hit and run” attacks.  Not only did the Union Army not like Mosby, the Union Army would not save any of Mosby’s men as signified by a sign hung around one of the six killed soldiers that declared “that this would be the fate of Mosby and all his men.”  This would warn Mosby and the rest of his army that the Union would not stand for anything the Confederate Army would throw at them.","This letter also reveals the thoughts and treatment that the Confederate Army used during the war.  The Confederate Army would not let the Union Army bully their way to a win.  This was evident in the fact that Mosby ordered the same fate to the Union prisoners that the Union army had ordered to captured Confederate prisoners.  This worked with great success as Mosby later says, “No further ‘acts of barbarity’ were committed on my men.”  Mosby and the Confederacy were not going to lie down easily even though the Union Army vastly outnumbered them.  Thus, the Union idea that they could “bully” the South was quickly shot down."],"display_date":"November 11, 1864","search_date":"1864-11-11","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":676,"tag":"John S.

In 1856, an Englishman, Frederick Law Olmstead, wrote <em>A journey in the seaboard slave states. </em>It is about his long journey in the seaboard slave states of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana.  In the chapter on Virginia, Olmstead expresses an unforgettable experience: he saw the whole process of slaves being sent to the market for sale just like merchandise.  He went to the slave-market and asked for the price and information, witnessed the procedure of slave auction and bidding, and saw slaves forced to depart from their families.  He even saw a black slave only cost $2.50.","During this period, the slave companies were all legal, and this kind of commerce flourished: “I turned into a short, broad street, in which were a number of establishments, the signs on which indicated that they were occupied by ‘Slave Dealers,’ and that ‘Slaves, for Sale or to Hire,’ were to be found within them. They were much like Intelligence Offices, being large rooms partly occupied by ranges of forms, on which sat a few comfortably and neatly clad negroes, who appeared perfectly cheerful; each grinning obsequiously, but with a manifest interest or anxiety, when I fixed my eye on them for a moment,” Olmstead says. He describes that many colored people, adults and children, were being sold like merchandise as home-servants or field-workers.  They were forced to leave their families, but no one seemed to feel a thing; in the auction, Olmstead describes, “there was an entire absence of emotion in the party of men, women, and children, thus seated preparatory to being sold.” Afterwards, Olmstead tried to do some research on general views of slavery in its social and political relations, and he discovered that people were fairly satisfied as long as the slaves were better off – as he interviewed a farmer, he says, “But what can we do that is better? Our free negroes--and, I believe it is the same at the North as it is here--are a miserable set of vagabonds, drunken, vicious, worse off, it is my honest opinion, than those who are retained in slavery. I am satisfied, too, that our slaves are better off, as they are, than the majority of your free laboring classes at the North.”","On the other hand, Olmstead was shocked that even poor white people were more “privileged” than the black people and black slaves: they received higher wages than black people, and they refused to do the jobs that black people usually did.  “Their wages were from fifty cents to a dollar [a day], varying with the demand and individual capacities . . .  No white man would ever do certain kinds of work, and if you should ask a white man you had hired, to do such things, he would get mad and tell you he wasn't a nigger.” With that said, black people and slaves were totally oppressed by whites (even poor whites), which added more stresses and dejection to their lives.","Olmstead’s story surely illustrates the picture of the slave trade through outsider’s eyes, and he showed how common and acceptable the slave trade was in the 1850s. In 1863, Francis Fedric, who actually was a slave in Virginia and Kentucky, wrote a book named <em>Slave Life in Virginia and Kentucky,</em> which was about his life as a slave over fifty years, including slaves being bought and sold, the events of slave-market, and his slave life with his fellows.  In the text, he states, “My master has bought about 100 slaves . . . for my master, at the next slave-market, intended to purchase more slaves.” Fedric’s book depicts the reality of the slave trade and the frustration and distress that slaves had to confront."],"display_date":1856,"search_date":"1856-07-01","locations":[{"id":14218,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":4,"tag":"Slavery"},{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"},{"id":891,"tag":"Slave States"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. History: 1812 - 1914","school":"Foothill College","course_id":66,"school_id":40}},{"id":5345,"title":"Timothy Webster Becomes First Spy Executed in the Civil War","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-05-04","end_date":"1862-05-04","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On the day of April 29, 1862, Timothy Webster became the first person executed during the Civil War for acts of espionage. Convicted four days prior to his execution, a court-martial in Richmond, Virginia ruled that Webster, an “alien enemy,” should “suffer death by hanging.” The <em>New York Times</em> republished an original article from the <em>Richmond Dispatch</em> relaying the information of Webster’s capture and trial. Both articles included a “brief synopsis of the proceedings,” which cited Webster’s alleged offenses and the court’s ruling.","The first charge stated that Timothy Webster had been caught on April 1, 1862, “in the service of the United States” lurking “about the armies and fortifications the Confederate States in and near Richmond.” Although the court brought another charge against Webster, they reached a “not guilty” verdict. This second accusation against Webster placed him in Memphis, Tennessee in July of 1861 also around Confederate fortifications. While the burden of proof for the second charge was not strong enough for a conviction, the guilty ruling on the first charge alone sealed Webster’s fate.","In the conclusion of the brief, a fair amount of detail regarding Webster’s final moments provided the reader with a clear picture of the events on April 29. The article went so far as to narrate the malfunction of the first rope used to hang Webster, stating “The half-hung and partially stunned man was speedily raised and assisted up, and a new rope being ready, he was soon swinging, in accordance with his sentence.”","The charges the Confederate court-marshal brought against Timothy Webster at the time of his execution turned out to be only a fraction of the Union spy’s activities. Born in the United Kingdom, in 1821, Webster immigrated to the United States and worked as police officer in New York City. At the war’s onset, he became involved in detective work for the Union, which led to his career as a spy. Part of the new Secret Service ring, Webster was the most valued agent to the organization’s creator, Allan Pinkerton. Prior to his capture, Pinkerton had sent Webster on numerous successful espionage missions to Baltimore. There, he infiltrated the Sons of Liberty group in February of 1861. This, supposedly, led Webster, and subsequently Pinkerton, to a plot in the organization to assassinate Abraham Lincoln.","Webster had also been employed as a double agent. Confederate Secretary of War, Judah Benjamin, used Webster to transport important document to Confederate agents that were across Union lines. With the documents in his possession, Webster made stops before delivering the dispatches allowing Union officials to read the contents of the messages.","When Webster was struck by a case of rheumatism on his mission to Richmond in 1862, Pinkerton sent Union spies Lewis Pryce and John Scully to locate Webster, who had been too ill to relay information back to Pinkerton. The two spies were captured while searching for Webster, and suspicion engulfed the valuable agent.

Stuart’s most celebrated act was his encirclement of the Union General George McClellan’s Army of the Potomac in June of 1862. Newly appointed commander of the Army of Northern Virginia Robert E. Lee and Jeb Stuart devised the plan to circle around McClellan and gather intelligence. The aggressive strategy stemmed from the knowledge that McClellan was hesitant to attack the Confederate troops, which he believed to be incredibly large in size and powerful in strength.","In a message to Stuart on June 11, 1862, Lee expressed caution, stating that he should be careful not “to hazard unnecessarily your command or to attempt what your judgment may not approve but be content to accomplish all the good you can without feeling it necessary to obtain all that might be desired.” The letter from Lee to Stuart stressed the importance of the reconnaissance mission and the need for discretion. Stuart saddled his troops, consisting of 1, 200 men from the first, fourth, and ninth Virginia Cavalry, and the Jeff Davis Legion, on June 12, 1862, to determine if the Army of the Potomac occupied the land between the Chickahominy and Totopotomy Rivers. The value of the land between both rivers was essential for the Confederacy and the Union. During the reconnaissance mission ordered by Lee, Stuart realized that his position had been discovered, forcing him to find an alternate route back to Richmond. The alternate route led Stuart’s infamous ride around McClellan’s troops. Historian James McPherson stated Stuart gained fame from this event as well as “great personal satisfaction from the enterprise, for one of the opposing cavalry commanders was his father-in-law, Philip St. George Cooke.”","Stuart’s mission resulted in his troops spending four days behind enemy lines in which they covered over 100 miles. The troops captured 165 prisoners as well as 260 mules<em>.</em> Stuart fulfilled the desires of Lee, who stated in his letter the importance of “gaining intelligence of his operations, communications, &c., of driving in his foraging parties, and securing such grain, cattle, &c., for ourselves as you can make arrangements to have driven in.” The encirclement of McClellan resulted in the recognition of the need for a reformed Union cavalry. After the successful raid commenced, Stuart felt that he had the capability to outride and outfight any Union cavalryman, boosting Southern morale even more. The intelligence that Stuart gathered allowed Lee to attack at Mechanicsville, which was the first of the Seven Days’ battles, and contributed in the failure of McClellan’s Peninsula campaign."],"display_date":"June 12, 1862 - June 15, 1862","search_date":"1862-06-13","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":17,"tag":"Government"},{"id":12,"tag":"Migration/Transportation"},{"id":5,"tag":"War"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":74,"school_id":3}},{"id":5352,"title":"Display of the Confederate Flag in Richmond Sparks Anger in Congress","course_id":74,"status":"P","start_date":"1867-02-17","end_date":"1867-02-18","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["On February 17, 1867 the <em>New York Times</em> reported on an act of reoccurring rebelliousness that happened within the city of Richmond, Virginia.  The incident that sparked all of the emotion was the display of the Confederate Flag during an event within the city.  Members of Congress and other Union loyalists decided that this act of rebelliousness proved that some of the southern states such as Virginia were, “utterly unfit for reconstruction” and that “the rebellious spirit still lived and raged in the South.”","Many called for legislation that would put the southern states under complete military rule.  The article went on to explain that the incident in question was actually just two young boys, one white and one black, pretending to be soldiers with an old faded flag that did not resemble that of the Confederate battle flag.

According to Bulloch in his book <em>The Secret Service of the Confederate States in Europe Volume 1</em>, “My early operations were greatly helped by the generous confidence of Messrs. Fraser, Trenholm and Co.  Within a month after my arrival, I had not only been able to buy a fair quantity of naval supplies on their credit, but had laid the keel of the first foreign built Confederate cruiser.”","The ship was to be built by two separate companies.  The first was William C. Miller and Sons who were responsible for the building of the ship and its frame, and the second was a company called Fawcett, Preston and Co. who was responsible for the manufacturing of the engine.  In his book, Bulloch says about William C. Miller and Sons, “The firm was selected…because the senior of the firm had been in the Royal Navy as a shipwright, and had served in her Majesty’s dockyards as a naval constructor.”  Moreover, Fawcett, Preston and Co. was also conveniently located in Liverpool which made the secrecy of the operation that much easier.","Construction of the ship commenced and it was made known that the ship’s name was <em>Oreto</em>, and that it was being built for an Italian merchant fleet.  This was necessary because the U.S. Consul in Liverpool at the time, Thomas Dudley, was watchful for Confederate war ships and tried to put an end to it by means of British neutrality laws.  Unfortunately, Dudley was unsuccessful because of Bulloch’s immense knowledge for these laws.  Bulloch made sure that the ship was never armed while being built so therefore, under law its manufacture was never in violation of the neutrality acts.","The <em>CSS Florida </em>sailed out of port in Liverpool destined to become a distinguished vessel for the navy of the confederacy, and Bulloch a silent hero."],"display_date":"June 4, 1861 - August 17, 1862","search_date":"1862-01-09","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":113,"tag":"Navy"},{"id":1579,"tag":"Undercover"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":93,"school_id":3}},{"id":5662,"title":"Solomon Bayley: The Hope of Escaping Slavery","course_id":103,"status":"P","start_date":"1813-01-01","end_date":"1825-12-31","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["Solomon Bayley touched the tender side of slavery in his narrative. Torn away from his enslaved family in Delaware and carried off in a wagon, Bayley jumped to freedom. It was only the chance to buy back his wife and son that motivated Bayley. On his adventure he was forced to journey by foot through Virginia, and ran into scheming slaves and slave owners. Bayley finally made it to the slave markets where his wife and son were being sold. The most revealing ordeal Bayley encountered is one in which he bought his wife. The ties of affection to his wife glistened brightly. Not only did the daughter of his wife’s master plea for Bayley to succeed but other white southerners felt the need chip in as well. With a daughter’s sympathy and borrowed money, Bayley was able to strike a deal, in which he bought his wife and only had to be enslaved to a benevolent white slave owner for a year.","Bayley's narrative is evidently relatable to Walter Johnson’s book, <em>Soul by Soul</em>. Johnson presents us with the rigors of slave trade.  At the trading market it was common for slaves to use emotion in order to be traded where they wished to be or not. Case in point, Bayley has to rely on the use of emotion to appeal to the daughter and white men.  By Bayley showing distress and despair, the white men and daughter decide to lend a hand. However, the slave owners want Bayley's family to be enslaved to them for the coming year. Bayley agreed to this deal. Bayley was exercising the little agency a free slave has when he or she has leverage (i.e an able-bodied family and money). The dream of reuniting his family on a plantation and eventually situating his family in a completely free lifestyle is Bayley's end goal. We are also able to see the struggle and anxiety slaves had to go through just to see their family again. Bayley was able to conquer his anxiety through prayer and see his goal to the end. This connects to Walter Johnson's <em>Sould By Soul</em> on page 180 when Johnson provides the example of the slave Henry. Henry bargained with the slave owners to be sold with his wife or else he would runaway. Johnson describes the Henry and Bayley's behavior perfectly on page 180 when he shares \"Slaves who were brave enough to meet insincere questions with a sincere response built upon the accreted experience of the slave market with unwilling slaves...\" Bayley was candid towards the benevolent owners in sharing his financial problems. It took alot of guts to stand up for himself and ask for his wife. After reading Johnson it is clear that slaves do have agency which enabled them appeal to owners."],"display_date":"1813 - 1825","search_date":"1819-07-02","locations":[{"id":14214,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":96,"tag":"Slave Trade"},{"id":501,"tag":"Escaping slavery"}],"course":{"name":"The United States: A Nation Divided, 1836-1876","school":"Wheaton College","course_id":103,"school_id":2}},{"id":5812,"title":"A Black Union Soldier Demands Equal Pay","course_id":113,"status":"P","start_date":"1864-06-01","end_date":"1864-06-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"Y","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"Y","estimated_end_day":"Y","content":["In a recommendation for trial written by a First Lieutenant of the 2<sup>nd</sup> U.S Colored Cavalry in early June of 1864 there is mention of Private Sylvester Ray, also of the 2<sup>nd</sup> U.S Colored Cavalry, who demanded equal pay for the African-American soldiers. In this recommendation, he states that, “he charges conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline.” At this time, black soldiers made seven dollars a month plus a three dollar clothing allowance while white soldiers of the same rank made thirteen dollars a month.","In many units, black soldiers were not permitted the same benefits as their white counterparts. It did not take long for the black soldiers to become aware of these discrepancies and start to demand equal pay. Private Sylvester Ray wanted pay that was the same as white soldiers because seven dollars a month was not enough to send home or pay for things that the black soldiers needed. Additionally, this discrepancy in pay was an injustice to African-American soldiers who were fighting for the same cause as their white counterparts.","According to historian Christian Samito, “the pay disparity undermined army discipline but also energized black soldiers’ demands for equal treatment.” When black soldiers realized that they were not being paid equally they threatened to desert the army or to rise against their white superior officers. Other places, the black soldiers rejected their pay, demanding equal pay. The tipping point for many of the soldiers was letters that had been sent from home. In many of these letters, their parents, wives, or children did not have enough money to survive on and were suffering. After receiving his letter, one unnamed soldier said, “we have been tried in the fire both of affliction and of the rebels, and nothing remains but pure metal.” This sentiment was reflected across most black units until equal pay was promised in late June, just a short while after Private Ray’s recommendation for trial. After enough troops protested the unfair conditions, the military started to listen. Samito believes that change occurred as “white officers came to realize, black soldiers mutinied not out of nervous energy…but as political action undertaken by men who felt newly entitled by their wearing of the uniform.","Private Sylvester Ray’s subsequent muster roll was also listed with his recommendation for trial. In the muster roll, it is clear that his pay for the month was raised to be equal with what was normal for white soldiers. It appears that his insistence on fairness and justice paid."," "," "," "],"display_date":"June 1864","search_date":"1864-06-15","locations":[{"id":14219,"lat":37.954527025,"lng":-76.8481834827,"zoom":10,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":321,"tag":"Union Army"},{"id":42,"tag":"Civil Rights"}],"course":{"name":"Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":113,"school_id":3}},{"id":6612,"title":"\n\nLincoln Removes General McClellan From Command","course_id":164,"status":"P","start_date":"1862-01-01","end_date":"1862-11-30","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["In November, 1862, a change occurred in Union power as President Abraham Lincoln removed General George McClellan from command of the Army of the Potomac. <em>The New York Times</em> stated, during “the fifteen months…he has had virtual control of the war have been utterly barren of results...Few commanders in history have had such splendid opportunities, and fewer still have so ostentatiously thrown them away.” McClellan commanded the Army of the Potomac satisfactorily from 1861 until November of 1862; as the war progressed, he quickly became paranoid about the size and talent of the Confederate Army. He was never outnumbered by the Confederates, and his paranoia put him at a mental disadvantage. "," ","During the start of the Seven Days Battle of July 1862, McClellan ably commanded his army. McCllelan launched an attack on Robert E. Lee and his troops. The Federals did not make irreversible gains, but McClellan believed his troops were in control; yet he ordered them to fall back. The retreat gave Confederates the advantage of more time. Consequently, Lee and his troops defended their position and caused McClellan to retreat due to his fear of losing. After this failure, Lincoln decided to give McClellan another chance which came at the Battle of Antietam nearly two months later."," ","The night before the Battle of Antietam, McClellan believed the Confederate Army had 120,000 plus men. Stephan Sears states, “McClellan imagined three Rebel soldiers for every one he faced on the Antietam battlefield. Every decision he made that September…was dominated by his fear of counterattack by phantom Confederate battalions.” McClellan had a plan to send troops as a diversion; he believed this would prevent Lee from overtaking Joe Hooker’s division. However, he gave his orders too late, and this caused McClellan to lose control of the battle, and let his irrational fears of the Confederate Army take over."," ","Lincoln wrote to McClellan to discuss his failures and give him a chance to respond; however, McClellan failed to impress Lincoln. After his failures in battle, Lincoln wanted to appoint someone more capable to the position of Commander of the Army of the Potomac. Lincoln talked to General Ambrose Burnside about becoming the new commander. Burnside had previously been asked to accept control after his success in North Carolina, but at that time Burnside denied the offer. This time the request was coming directly from the President, making it difficult to refuse. Burnside did not believe that he deserved this position, and he accepted it with reluctance."," ","McClellan allowed his fear of failure to control his ability to succeed as commander of the Army of the Potomac. If he would have been able to think more systemically and put aside the pressure to be perfect, he may not have lost his position. He frequently overestimated the size and power of the opponent; ultimately, this led to failure. The refusal to pursue the enemy at the close of the Antietam battle and for weeks afterwards, was the last straw for Lincoln, and he removed McClellan from power. Ultimately, McClellan was replaced by General Burnside as the new commander of the Army of the Potomac."," "],"display_date":"January 1, 1862 - November 30, 1862","search_date":"1862-06-16","locations":[{"id":14214,"lat":37.5407246,"lng":-77.4360481,"zoom":7,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":3170,"tag":"Seven Days"},{"id":3169,"tag":"Burnside"},{"id":3168,"tag":"McClellan"},{"id":1792,"tag":"Antietam"},{"id":311,"tag":"Union"},{"id":755,"tag":"Confederacy"},{"id":701,"tag":"Lincoln"}],"course":{"name":"The Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Juniata College","course_id":164,"school_id":3}},{"id":6651,"title":"Virginia Seccesion","course_id":170,"status":"P","start_date":"1861-04-17","end_date":"1865-04-01","estimated_start_year":"N","estimated_start_month":"N","estimated_start_day":"N","estimated_end_year":"N","estimated_end_month":"N","estimated_end_day":"N","content":["The act of secession was a very important topic when it came to the time before and during the Civil War. Through time you can still see the divide amongst our society from the effects of the war and secession of the southern states. One state that played an influential role in the Confederate states was Virginia. Virginia is a very history rich state, the first colony was in the state of Virginia and many political leaders of America were Virginians. I believe it is very important to discuss why Virginia left the union because many battles and the surrender of the war happened in Virginia. I believe the three main factor behind the secession of Virginia is their ties with slavery and the roots of their southern culture.","            Slavery played a very important role in the time of the civil war. Virginia was the most populous state of the south and had very deep ties in the slave trade. Geography played a huge role for slavery in Virginia, the barrier which affected it was the Blue Ridge Mountains. East of the mountains slavery dominated, plantation agriculture ruled and was the main source of income for that area. The slave trade was also found its grounds in Virginia making huge headquarters in Petersburg and Richmond, Virginia. William A. Link speaks in his book <em>Roots of Secession</em> and states “The entire Fabric of Virginia’s legal, constitutional, and political system was woven into the slave holding society, and the social interests and political imperatives converged around slavery.” This quote shoes the importance of slavery in the Virginian society and how they base their society around it.","            Even though Virginia was not the first to secede it had strong ties to its southern culture helped tip the balance when it came to the secession of Virginia. One aspect the kept the South so close is their pride in their society. The paternalistic ideals the south held kept unity across all of the southern states. The people of the south viewed the north as the people who wanted to start a revolution, and they were only doing what they believe was their right. In the <em>Declaration of Cause Secession of Virginia </em>it states “Having declared that the powers under the said Constitution were derived from the people of the United States, and might be resumed whensover the same should be perverted to their injury and oppression” In this quote, you can see that the people of Virginia felt that the southern way of live was being oppressed and it was there right to leave to preserve their rights.","            To conclude, the secession of Virginia was mostly motivated by their strong ties to slavery and the southern culture built around it. Though Virginia was not the first to secede, the state is home to many battles of the civil war and the surrender of the war. These events not only effected the people that lived during that time, they also will affect people for years to come. Even today the issues of the Civil War can still be seen throughout the country. The secession of the South played a pivotal role in the history of our country, and it will forever be studied and looked at by historians for years to come."," "," "],"display_date":"April 17, 1861 - April 1, 1865","search_date":"1863-04-09","locations":[{"id":14214,"lat":37.5407246,"lng":-77.4360481,"zoom":8,"place":"RICHMOND, Virginia"}],"tags":[{"id":32,"tag":"Civil War"},{"id":1879,"tag":"Secession"}],"course":{"name":"U.S. Civil War and Reconstruction","school":"Richard Bland College","course_id":170,"school_id":96}}]}
